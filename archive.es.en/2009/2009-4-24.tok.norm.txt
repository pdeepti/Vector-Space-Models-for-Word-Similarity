a former chairman of the social democrats suggested on public radio that german workers , just like their french counterparts , should kidnap their boss if they 're worried about their future . the leader of germany ’ s left party has urged german workers to copy the example of disgruntled french counterparts and kidnap their bosses .
several managers in france who announced restructuring measures to deal with the economic crisis have been detained in factories in recent weeks by employees who fear losing their jobs .
managers from companies in france , including molex , sony , 3m and hewlett-packard , have all reported " bossnapping " incidents .
" when the government continues to do nothing , there is increasing danger that the far-right will gain in strength , " warned oskar lafontaine on public radio wdr .
the left party has also been calling for national strikes to be legalized again .
despite these warnings , experts see there is little risk of serious social unrest and mass protests breaking out in europe 's biggest economy .
the left party was established two years ago and is made up largely of former east german communists and disaffected social democrats , including its former chairman oskar lafontaine .
he quit former chancellor gerhard schroeder 's cabinet because he found its policies too centrist .
unexpected support from presidential candidate lafontaine 's " bossnapping " suggestions have received unexpected support from the social democrat presidential candidate gesine schwan who " warned of growing anger throughout the country . "
she was immediately sharply criticized from within her own party for scaremongering and spreading excessive pessimism .
" the economy is doing badly , but we are a long way from social unrest , " warned spd colleague , dieter wiefelspuetz .
" it does n't do anyone any good to be talking about unrest erupting here or in france or anywhere else , " said peter struck , the head of the bundestag faction of the social democrats .
" that is undermining efforts by the federal government which is doing everything possible to help make it easier for people to get through the crisis . "
german chancellor angela merkel said at a meeting of senior christian democrat party officials that she does not share the concerns that social unrest will break out .

but the countries failed to make headway on climate change negotiations . saving the world 's biodiversity and agreeing on a way forward on climate change negotiations had topped the agenda at the three-day international environment meeting in syracuse , italy .
but ministers attending were only able to tick one of those boxes .
an elusive global warming pact still looks unlikely anytime before a un climate change conference in copenhagen in december , when it is hoped a global strategy for the post-kyoto protocol era can be laid down .
g8 industrial countries and major developing economies meeting on the island of sicily signed a charter pledging to tackle deforestation , curb illegal trade in wildlife and boost research into the rate of species loss .
extinction rates are currently running at around 1,000 times their natural pace , with three species vanishing every hour , according to un statistics .
time running out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim steiner was unconvinced leaving the syracuse meeting " we set objectives on biodiversity for 2010 ... but unfortunately we have all recognized they have not been met , " said italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo , who hosted the summit .
" we are all convinced of the urgency ... of intervening to safeguard our biodiversity , " she said .
the head of the un environment program , achim steiner , said several significant hurdles still needed ironing out .
these included setting targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and financing the greening of developing countries .
key nations , he said , are coming to the realization that time is running out ahead of the un talks in copenhagen .
" i leave syracuse very much concerned that there is no clear pathway to resolving the gaps that remain , " he said . details please kim carstensen , director of the world wide fund for nature ’ s global climate initiative , said after the meeting that the charter on curbing biodiversity loss sends out a clear message on the importance of biodiversity , but was lacking in details .
" it 's a political signal of a will that is higher than i think we 've seen before at this level , and that i think is positive , " he said .
" but in terms of actual implementation , it 's not at all at the level of an action plan , or funded , which would also be nice .
and which would be needed as a next step going forward .
he remarked that ministers ’ agreement that action to move toward a low carbon economy was needed now rather than later could be an important signal for the coming talks in copenhagen .
differences of opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developed and emerging economies will both need to come to the table the g8 grouping of rich nations , along with emerging economies such as china , brazil and india , agreed at the meeting that climate change and species extinction were linked , and emphasized the economic value of preserving biodiversity .
but the game of chicken between industrialized and developing nations over who should foot the bill for plans to mitigate or even reverse climate change looks unlikely to end .
carstensen said big differences remained on financing technological improvements and meeting targeted emissions cuts .
" we need countries like japan , canada , russia and the us to come out and say what exactly is it that we want to contribute , " he said .
" we need to see a stronger and more articulated political will on the side of developed countries to move this really forward . "
reimund schwarze , head of climate change policy at the helmholtz center for environmental research in leipzig , germany , said emerging economies like china will have to make sacrifices too .
" china not only has to move ahead , it has to accept the fact that in the very long run they will be in the role of giving financial aid to other countries , " he said .
the leaders of 16 major economies are due to meet in washington on monday for further talks aimed at generating political leadership for the end-of-year un climate change meeting in denmark .
environmentalists will hope , by then , that both developed and developing countries will be ready to back up their intentions with concrete actions .

but the countries failed to make headway on climate change negotiations . saving the world 's biodiversity and agreeing on a way forward on climate change negotiations had topped the agenda at the three-day international environment meeting in syracuse , italy .
but ministers attending were only able to tick one of those boxes .
an elusive global warming pact still looks unlikely anytime before a un climate change conference in copenhagen in december , when it is hoped a global strategy for the post-kyoto protocol era can be laid down .
g8 industrial countries and major developing economies meeting on the island of sicily signed a charter pledging to tackle deforestation , curb illegal trade in wildlife and boost research into the rate of species loss .
extinction rates are currently running at around 1,000 times their natural pace , with three species vanishing every hour , according to un statistics .
time running out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim steiner was unconvinced leaving the syracuse meeting " we set objectives on biodiversity for 2010 ... but unfortunately we have all recognized they have not been met , " said italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo , who hosted the summit .
" we are all convinced of the urgency ... of intervening to safeguard our biodiversity , " she said .
the head of the un environment program , achim steiner , said several significant hurdles still needed ironing out .
these included setting targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and financing the greening of developing countries .
key nations , he said , are coming to the realization that time is running out ahead of the un talks in copenhagen .
" i leave syracuse very much concerned that there is no clear pathway to resolving the gaps that remain , " he said . details please kim carstensen , director of the world wide fund for nature ’ s global climate initiative , said after the meeting that the charter on curbing biodiversity loss sends out a clear message on the importance of biodiversity , but was lacking in details .
" it 's a political signal of a will that is higher than i think we 've seen before at this level , and that i think is positive , " he said .
" but in terms of actual implementation , it 's not at all at the level of an action plan , or funded , which would also be nice .
and which would be needed as a next step going forward .
he remarked that ministers ’ agreement that action to move toward a low carbon economy was needed now rather than later could be an important signal for the coming talks in copenhagen .
differences of opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developed and emerging economies will both need to come to the table the g8 grouping of rich nations , along with emerging economies such as china , brazil and india , agreed at the meeting that climate change and species extinction were linked , and emphasized the economic value of preserving biodiversity .
but the game of chicken between industrialized and developing nations over who should foot the bill for plans to mitigate or even reverse climate change looks unlikely to end .
carstensen said big differences remained on financing technological improvements and meeting targeted emissions cuts .
" we need countries like japan , canada , russia and the us to come out and say what exactly is it that we want to contribute , " he said .
" we need to see a stronger and more articulated political will on the side of developed countries to move this really forward . "
reimund schwarze , head of climate change policy at the helmholtz center for environmental research in leipzig , germany , said emerging economies like china will have to make sacrifices too .
" china not only has to move ahead , it has to accept the fact that in the very long run they will be in the role of giving financial aid to other countries , " he said .
the leaders of 16 major economies are due to meet in washington on monday for further talks aimed at generating political leadership for the end-of-year un climate change meeting in denmark .
environmentalists will hope , by then , that both developed and developing countries will be ready to back up their intentions with concrete actions .

" but in terms of actual implementation , it 's not at all at the level of an action plan , or funded , which would also be nice .
and which would be needed as a next step going forward .
he remarked that ministers ’ agreement that action to move toward a low carbon economy was needed now rather than later could be an important signal for the coming talks in copenhagen .
differences of opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developed and emerging economies will both need to come to the table the g8 grouping of rich nations , along with emerging economies such as china , brazil and india , agreed at the meeting that climate change and species extinction were linked , and emphasized the economic value of preserving biodiversity .
but the game of chicken between industrialized and developing nations over who should foot the bill for plans to mitigate or even reverse climate change looks unlikely to end .
carstensen said big differences remained on financing technological improvements and meeting targeted emissions cuts .
" we need countries like japan , canada , russia and the us to come out and say what exactly is it that we want to contribute , " he said .
" we need to see a stronger and more articulated political will on the side of developed countries to move this really forward . "
reimund schwarze , head of climate change policy at the helmholtz center for environmental research in leipzig , germany , said emerging economies like china will have to make sacrifices too .
" china not only has to move ahead , it has to accept the fact that in the very long run they will be in the role of giving financial aid to other countries , " he said .
the leaders of 16 major economies are due to meet in washington on monday for further talks aimed at generating political leadership for the end-of-year un climate change meeting in denmark .
environmentalists will hope , by then , that both developed and developing countries will be ready to back up their intentions with concrete actions .

several managers in france who announced restructuring measures to deal with the economic crisis have been detained in factories in recent weeks by employees who fear losing their jobs .

the original strategic arms reduction treaty , or start , is set to expire in december . at a joint news conference at the us embassy in rome , negotiators described the one-day preliminary talks as a " productive beginning . "
us assistant secretary of state for verification and compliance rose gottemoeller said that friday 's meeting " got off to a fast start . " the talks focused largely on procedural issues and paved the way for the start of formal negotiations next month .
talks will be held in washington and moscow in may and june ahead of us president barack obama 's first visit to russia in july .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 24.04.2009 german government to take control of hypo real estate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hre shareholders were advised to accept the takeover bid the german government has told hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- , the biggest german casualty of the world financial crash , that it will obtain a 90-percent controlling stake in the bank by way of an equity issue . hre disclosed the move in a board statement from its head office in munich on friday .
berlin would ask the shareholders at a meeting on june 2 to vote for an increase in equity from just under 700 million euros -lrb- $ 925 million -rrb- at present to 6.3 billion euros , with the german state pumping in all the new funds .
the equity issue would sharply dilute the stakes of the existing shareholders , leaving them with less than a 10th of voting stock .
the new equity would be held by soffin , the government agency charged with helping german banks via guarantees and equity infusions .
soffin disclosed earlier in frankfurt that a government takeover offer for hre of 1.39 euros per share had made little progress .
merck finck analyst konrad becker told news agency afp the weak response by investors so far was not surpising , because " people often wait until the very last day before deciding to sell in hopes the purchaser will raise the offer . "
only 1.28 percent of shares had been acquired as of thursday afternoon , soffin said .
that brought berlin 's present stake to 9.94 percent .
the move could come at his expense of us investor jc flowers , who heads a consortium owning almost 24 percent of shares in hre .
so far , he has been dismissive towards the bid .
" accept bid " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are real fears hre could go the way of lehman brothers but the hre supervisory and executive boards advised shareholders friday to accept the takeover bid for their shares .
that offer expires on may 4 .
hre stock rose 1.4 percent in stock-market trading friday to 1.41 euros .
last month , germany legislated compulsory purchase powers in case the shareholders did not accept the bid .
chancellor angela merkel 's government is concerned that a collapse of hre could lead to the sort of financial market chaos that followed the failure of us investment bank lehman brothers in september last year .
hre 's problems arose at its depfa bank unit , which operated from largely deregulated dublin .
depfa is a principal lender to german local government , raising bond issues for roads and new buildings .
the government has so far given the bank support worth 102 billion euros .
germany 's banking industry is currently weighed down with significant problems .
it has more than 800 billion euros worth of so-called toxic assets on lenders ' books . dfm / jam , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin would ask the shareholders at a meeting on june 2 to vote for an increase in equity from just under 700 million euros -lrb- $ 925 million -rrb- at present to 6.3 billion euros , with the german state pumping in all the new funds .
the equity issue would sharply dilute the stakes of the existing shareholders , leaving them with less than a 10th of voting stock .
the new equity would be held by soffin , the government agency charged with helping german banks via guarantees and equity infusions .
soffin disclosed earlier in frankfurt that a government takeover offer for hre of 1.39 euros per share had made little progress .
merck finck analyst konrad becker told news agency afp the weak response by investors so far was not surpising , because " people often wait until the very last day before deciding to sell in hopes the purchaser will raise the offer . "
only 1.28 percent of shares had been acquired as of thursday afternoon , soffin said .
that brought berlin 's present stake to 9.94 percent .
the move could come at his expense of us investor jc flowers , who heads a consortium owning almost 24 percent of shares in hre .
so far , he has been dismissive towards the bid .
" accept bid " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are real fears hre could go the way of lehman brothers but the hre supervisory and executive boards advised shareholders friday to accept the takeover bid for their shares .
that offer expires on may 4 .
hre stock rose 1.4 percent in stock-market trading friday to 1.41 euros .
last month , germany legislated compulsory purchase powers in case the shareholders did not accept the bid .
chancellor angela merkel 's government is concerned that a collapse of hre could lead to the sort of financial market chaos that followed the failure of us investment bank lehman brothers in september last year .
hre 's problems arose at its depfa bank unit , which operated from largely deregulated dublin .
depfa is a principal lender to german local government , raising bond issues for roads and new buildings .
the government has so far given the bank support worth 102 billion euros .
germany 's banking industry is currently weighed down with significant problems .

the proposed law change would bar members of management and supervisory boards from cashing in their stock options during their period of employment .
it would also set senior executives ' personal liability for breaches of duty at up to one year 's salary in every instance .
currently most german executives obtain personal-liability insurance at their employer 's expense , meaning that even if they are sued , the full sum of damages must be paid by the insurer .
the new liability rule would mean that if a court imposed a 5-million-euro damages award on an executive who is paid 2 million euros per annum , the insurer would pay 3 million while the executive would pay the other 2 million .
the points agreed to on thursday are to be passed on to the justice ministry to be formulated into formal draft laws that must still be approved by both houses of parliament .
as in other nations , germans have expressed outrage at executives escaping penalty for past misdeeds and obtaining huge remuneration , even when their companies are in deep financial trouble and sacking staff .

the proposed law change would bar members of management and supervisory boards from cashing in their stock options during their period of employment .
it would also set senior executives ' personal liability for breaches of duty at up to one year 's salary in every instance .
currently most german executives obtain personal-liability insurance at their employer 's expense , meaning that even if they are sued , the full sum of damages must be paid by the insurer .
the new liability rule would mean that if a court imposed a 5-million-euro damages award on an executive who is paid 2 million euros per annum , the insurer would pay 3 million while the executive would pay the other 2 million .
the points agreed to on thursday are to be passed on to the justice ministry to be formulated into formal draft laws that must still be approved by both houses of parliament .
as in other nations , germans have expressed outrage at executives escaping penalty for past misdeeds and obtaining huge remuneration , even when their companies are in deep financial trouble and sacking staff .

north korea has announced that two us journalists arrested last month on its border with china are to be put on trial to face criminal charges . " our related agency has decided to turn the us reporters over for trial based on findings of their crimes , " the north 's kcna news agency reported , without giving further details .
laura ling and euna lee were arrested on march 17 near the tumen river , which runs along the border between north korea and china , while reporting on north korean refugees for san francisco-based current-tv .
north korea has accused them of illegally entering its territory with " hostile " intent .
the associated press reports the journalists could face at least five years in prison if they are convicted of espionage under north korean law .
the planned trial comes as the reclusive state faces un security council condemnation for its april 5 launch of a long-range rocket , which regional powers say was a ballistic missile test .

more than 6,000 firms from around the world were on hand , looking for new deals and a much needed boost to their balance sheets .
the traditional staple of the hanover trade fair - the machine tool trade - was still the best represented sector on hand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trade fair boss wolfram vom fritsch has had a difficult year however , the fair also focused on emerging industrial issues like energy efficiency , renewable energy sources and automated technology , with a message that these potentially cost-cutting endeavours could prove the best way to fight recession .
" if the situation is difficult you have to look to the costs , you have to look to your customers , and you have to look to the future , " wolfram vom fritsch , the chief executive of the hannover trade fair , told deutsche welle .
" because , once the crisis is over , the companies that will be successful are those that are right into the issues of the future , and we are sure that energy is one of those issues .
it 's an issue that can bring you a short-term return on investments and it 's an issue with a long-term impact . "
saving energy , and money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the energy harvester lets factories say bye bye to batteries production efficiency is a growing concern in the industrial sector .
as firms look to cut costs without slashing jobs , cutting down on overheads like electricity usage is becoming ever more important .
the british firm perpetuum showcased one example of innovative energy-saving technology .
it 's called an ' energy harvester ' , and it generates electricity from the vibrations of its surroundings to power battery-powered devices .
" i think the first benefit is you no longer have to change batteries , " said chief engineer john parker .
" if you have 5,000 censors on your industrial plant , and your average battery life is two or three years , you will be changing 10 batteries per day .
with our device you no longer have to do that , secondly it uses waste energy , so it recovers the energy from the motor , and thirdly , you no longer have to dispose of batteries which have nasty chemicals inside them . "
even the major players like siemens , volkswagen and phoenix concentrated on their energy saving credentials at the fair .
volkswagen brought only its fuel-efficient ' blue motion ' range of cars to hanover .
" fuel efficiency definitely is one of our top priorities , if not the top priority , " said juergen leohold , the head of corporate research for the volkswagen group .
" we contribute to the prevention of climate change , and we help our customers save on fuel , which gives them a financial advantage , too . "

while businesses are struggling at the moment , they are still looking for ways to emerge from this recession one step ahead of their competition .
automated technology and robotics featured heavily at the fair .
robotic science was even showcased through the german round of the autonomous robot soccer world cup , where teams of robots battle it out on the football pitch .
the standard of play may not make this sport worthy of the nickname ' the beautiful game ' , at least not yet , but it 's still an astounding sight .
however , the robots of real interest to the more serious trade fair goers performed more modest tasks .
some can transport stocks around warehouses without a driver , others are designed to lead customers to certain products in stores , eliminating the need for a shop assistant to do so , while a few are designed to perform simple production line tasks in factories .
the political trade fair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with south korean prime minister han seung-soo on opening day german chancellor angela merkel , the prime minister of partner nation south korea han seung-soo , and german president horst koehler are just a few of the high profile politicans who attended this year 's fair .
the financial crisis has turned the world of business into one of the most important political playgrounds , especially here in germany with a general election looming in september .
while exhibitors in hanover touted their wares , the german parliament convened in berlin to debate how to best tackle the deepening recession .
politicians discussed whether a third stimulus package was necessary to keep the german economy going , but exhibitors in hanover and the event organizers felt that they did n't need a government handout , rather they needed easier access to credit from cautious banks .
" we in germany tend to differentiate between the real economy and the financial economy , " said wolfram vom fritsch of the hanover trade fair .
" and most of our exhibitors see the problems in the financial economy , and see the problems in financing their orders , they say they 're struggling to finance good orders .
so we all look forward to more regulation in the financial sector , and we all look forward to more readily available liquid assets . "
wolfram vom fritsch admitted that the economic climate for the 2009 hanover trade fair has been anything but rosy , but he thinks the event has helped the industrial sector to fight back in the face of recession .
" i think cebit and the hannover trade fair have shown that they are more than just fairs , they are a marketplace - as we call it - where you can interchange between politics , science and industry . "
this interchange was arguably more important in 2009 than ever before in the fair 's 62-year history .

more than 6,000 firms from around the world were on hand , looking for new deals and a much needed boost to their balance sheets .
the traditional staple of the hanover trade fair - the machine tool trade - was still the best represented sector on hand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trade fair boss wolfram vom fritsch has had a difficult year however , the fair also focused on emerging industrial issues like energy efficiency , renewable energy sources and automated technology , with a message that these potentially cost-cutting endeavours could prove the best way to fight recession .
" if the situation is difficult you have to look to the costs , you have to look to your customers , and you have to look to the future , " wolfram vom fritsch , the chief executive of the hannover trade fair , told deutsche welle .
" because , once the crisis is over , the companies that will be successful are those that are right into the issues of the future , and we are sure that energy is one of those issues .
it 's an issue that can bring you a short-term return on investments and it 's an issue with a long-term impact . "
saving energy , and money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the energy harvester lets factories say bye bye to batteries production efficiency is a growing concern in the industrial sector .
as firms look to cut costs without slashing jobs , cutting down on overheads like electricity usage is becoming ever more important .
the british firm perpetuum showcased one example of innovative energy-saving technology .
it 's called an ' energy harvester ' , and it generates electricity from the vibrations of its surroundings to power battery-powered devices .
" i think the first benefit is you no longer have to change batteries , " said chief engineer john parker .
" if you have 5,000 censors on your industrial plant , and your average battery life is two or three years , you will be changing 10 batteries per day .
with our device you no longer have to do that , secondly it uses waste energy , so it recovers the energy from the motor , and thirdly , you no longer have to dispose of batteries which have nasty chemicals inside them . "
even the major players like siemens , volkswagen and phoenix concentrated on their energy saving credentials at the fair .
volkswagen brought only its fuel-efficient ' blue motion ' range of cars to hanover .
" fuel efficiency definitely is one of our top priorities , if not the top priority , " said juergen leohold , the head of corporate research for the volkswagen group .
" we contribute to the prevention of climate change , and we help our customers save on fuel , which gives them a financial advantage , too . "
planning for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the robotic soccer world championships do n't have a recession to tackle rather like the major communication and information technology trade fair cebit , also based in hanover , the 2009 trade fair put a great emphasis on the importance of futuristic technology .
while businesses are struggling at the moment , they are still looking for ways to emerge from this recession one step ahead of their competition .
automated technology and robotics featured heavily at the fair .
robotic science was even showcased through the german round of the autonomous robot soccer world cup , where teams of robots battle it out on the football pitch .
the standard of play may not make this sport worthy of the nickname ' the beautiful game ' , at least not yet , but it 's still an astounding sight .
however , the robots of real interest to the more serious trade fair goers performed more modest tasks .
some can transport stocks around warehouses without a driver , others are designed to lead customers to certain products in stores , eliminating the need for a shop assistant to do so , while a few are designed to perform simple production line tasks in factories .
the political trade fair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with south korean prime minister han seung-soo on opening day german chancellor angela merkel , the prime minister of partner nation south korea han seung-soo , and german president horst koehler are just a few of the high profile politicans who attended this year 's fair .
the financial crisis has turned the world of business into one of the most important political playgrounds , especially here in germany with a general election looming in september .
while exhibitors in hanover touted their wares , the german parliament convened in berlin to debate how to best tackle the deepening recession .
politicians discussed whether a third stimulus package was necessary to keep the german economy going , but exhibitors in hanover and the event organizers felt that they did n't need a government handout , rather they needed easier access to credit from cautious banks .
" we in germany tend to differentiate between the real economy and the financial economy , " said wolfram vom fritsch of the hanover trade fair .
" and most of our exhibitors see the problems in the financial economy , and see the problems in financing their orders , they say they 're struggling to finance good orders .
so we all look forward to more regulation in the financial sector , and we all look forward to more readily available liquid assets . "
wolfram vom fritsch admitted that the economic climate for the 2009 hanover trade fair has been anything but rosy , but he thinks the event has helped the industrial sector to fight back in the face of recession .
" i think cebit and the hannover trade fair have shown that they are more than just fairs , they are a marketplace - as we call it - where you can interchange between politics , science and industry . "
this interchange was arguably more important in 2009 than ever before in the fair 's 62-year history .

it bans secret paternity tests and severely restricts the use of genetic testing by employers and insurance companies . health minister ulla schmidt welcomed the new law as a crucial step in protecting the rights of patients .
she said that after 10 years of discussions a legal framework had been put in place that would prevent the abuse of sensitive personal data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister schmidt says the law is crucial to protect patients genetic testing can be used to determine a person 's disposition to develop certain illnesses such as cancer - information which in the hands of an employer or a health insurance company could easily lead to discrimination .
the new legislation defines under which circumstances an analysis of genetic material is legal .
now , testing can only be conducted with the patient 's consent and after consultation with a doctor .
medical tourism to find out who 's the father ?
under the new law , paternity tests , for example , will be only legal if both the woman and man agree .
conducting a secret test can result in a fine of up to 5,000 euros .
paternity tests during pregnancy will be only legal in cases of sexual abuse or rape .
the german medical association however has warned that this might lead to medical tourism , with people trying to get genetic testing done abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who 's the father ?
clandestine testing will be illegal employers will also be affected by the new law .
they will not be able to demand a genetic test from their employees to check for illnesses or health problems .
the only exceptions to the rule are if some specific jobs entail potential health risks - as can be the case in the chemical industry .
insurance companies may not demand that their clients undergo genetic testing - with exceptions only in cases in which the pay-out sum is very high .
critics say there are too many exceptions the need for a clear law on the issue had been expressed by all parties across the political spectrum - but the details of the new legislation have been controversial .
the opposition green party , the free democratic party and the left party have all criticised the law for not going far enough and being open to too many loopholes . ai / pfd , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin would ask the shareholders at a meeting on june 2 to vote for an increase in equity from just under 700 million euros -lrb- $ 925 million -rrb- at present to 6.3 billion euros , with the german state pumping in all the new funds .
the equity issue would sharply dilute the stakes of the existing shareholders , leaving them with less than a 10th of voting stock .
the new equity would be held by soffin , the government agency charged with helping german banks via guarantees and equity infusions .
soffin disclosed earlier in frankfurt that a government takeover offer for hre of 1.39 euros per share had made little progress .
merck finck analyst konrad becker told news agency afp the weak response by investors so far was not surpising , because " people often wait until the very last day before deciding to sell in hopes the purchaser will raise the offer . "
only 1.28 percent of shares had been acquired as of thursday afternoon , soffin said .
that brought berlin 's present stake to 9.94 percent .
the move could come at his expense of us investor jc flowers , who heads a consortium owning almost 24 percent of shares in hre .
so far , he has been dismissive towards the bid .
" accept bid " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are real fears hre could go the way of lehman brothers but the hre supervisory and executive boards advised shareholders friday to accept the takeover bid for their shares .
that offer expires on may 4 .
hre stock rose 1.4 percent in stock-market trading friday to 1.41 euros .
last month , germany legislated compulsory purchase powers in case the shareholders did not accept the bid .
chancellor angela merkel 's government is concerned that a collapse of hre could lead to the sort of financial market chaos that followed the failure of us investment bank lehman brothers in september last year .
hre 's problems arose at its depfa bank unit , which operated from largely deregulated dublin .
depfa is a principal lender to german local government , raising bond issues for roads and new buildings .

" the time is right for a new beginning on nuclear disarmament , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said , referring to an agreement earlier this month between us president barack obama and his russian counterpart , dimitry medvedev , aimed at negotiating a new deal on strategic nuclear arms reduction .
in the debate , the german foreign minister outlined steps which he said were crucial for reaching the goal of a nuclear-free world .
he said us-russian talks on a follow-up to the strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start 1 -rrb- , due to expire in december , must be successfully completed .
in addition , iran and north korea - two countries thought to be on the threshold of becoming nuclear powers - must be convinced to enter talks on their nuclear programs as proposed by the us president .

the weapons are a remnant of the cold war , although details about their number and location are not known .

gregor gysi , the parliamentary leader of the left party , also urged chancellor angela merkel to abandon her policy of participation in nato ’ s nuclear strategy .
under nato policy , non-nuclear alliance members must provide troops and technical assistance in the event of a nuclear strike .
greece and canada have already opted out of this strategy .

stressing that iran was on the verge of becoming a nuclear power , and that india and pakistan are eager to upgrade their nuclear weapons technology , he said that the tactical nuclear arms based in germany were an important part of nato ’ s policy of nuclear deterrence .

that 's the verdict of former f1 ace heinz-harald frentzen . it 's been a year of surprises and shake-ups in the world of formula one racing .
a team that looked on the verge of extinction a couple of months ago has a commanding lead in the formula one championship after three grands prix .
brawn gp have gone from rank outsiders to hot favorites in what seems like the blink of an eye .
red bull and toyota - both of whom have been also-rans throughout their histories in the sport - are the closest competition for the former honda works team .
the only traditionally big name anywhere near the top is mclaren mercedes .
world champion lewis hamilton 's team are currently fourth in the constructor 's championship , but their future is in serious doubt due to off-track controversy .
meanwhile , ferrari , f1 's top team in eight of the last ten seasons , are dead last in the championship with no points from three races .
formula one has been turned on its head this season , and germany 's former f1 superstar heinz-harald frentzen told deutsche welle that he thinks it 's a breath of fresh air .
" it 's mixed up formula one completely , " frentzen says .
" i mean , before the season started , could you imagine the top teams spending a lot of money and effort and finding themselves in the midfield ?
no one expected that ! "
initial testing results for the fourth race of the season in bahrain this weekend do n't suggest that normality is going to be restored just yet , if at all .
surprising , but not inexplicable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brawn gp and other ' underdogs ' are dominating f1 however , while frentzen said this new order in formula one is unexpected , he also pointed to rules , a hard fought 2008 season , and the introduction of new technoloiges as explanations for this surprising turn of events .
" there has been a big modification from one year to the other , in terms of regulations , chassis layout and with the introduction of kers -lrb- kinetic energy recovery system -rrb- .
everything 's been mixed up , " he says .
he said the last time there was a similar comprehensive change was between 1997 and 1998 .
" just like it was back then , the teams who made the best decisions and found the best strategy for the new regulations over the winter have earned the glory , " he said .
little wonder frentzen is so conscious of how rule changes can affect f1 .
he was one of the losers after the rule changes a decade ago .
then driving for williams , frentzen watched his team morph from the quickest in the sport into a relatively mediocre outfit in a matter of months .
it was during this same shakeup that mclaren and ferrari re-established themselves as major players in the sport , a position neither team ever really relinquished , until this year , perhaps .
getting better and better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel has won both his races in wet conditions one major winner in the new-look f1 is sebastian vettel .
the 21-year-old german won round three of the season in china from pole position , taking the second race win of his fledgling career .
in friday testing in bahrain , his red bull car looked quick again and the young german is optimistic about the season .
" i do n't want to talk about the title , but we have the potential to drive for victory in the next races , " vettel told reporters trackside in bahrain .
frentzen - who was 29 years old when he won his first grand prix with williams - is impressed that vettel has grabbed two wins so early in his career .
" i am a big fan of vettel because he developed himself steadily , starting in the sport at a very young age , " he says .
" but now , he 's already a very experienced driver .
he still makes some mistakes , but what really impresses me is that he is able to improve the development of his car , to help the mechanics make his car faster .
he 's getting better and better and better . "
the newey factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrian newey 's latest f1 masterpiece may be the 2009 red bull however , frentzen says that there 's more to red bull 's success than the talented young german behind the wheel .
adrian newey , red bull 's chief technical officer and designer , is a legend in formula one circles .
he has designed a slew of blisteringly quick f1 cars for williams and then mclaren mercedes over the years .
" i have also driven an adrian newey car in 1997 , " frentzen points out .
" for me , when i was closely involved in f1 , he was the best aerodynamic engineer in the sport , and the cars he built were always fantastic . "
" and remember that if vettel had n't won that race -lsb- in china -rsb- , then his teammate mark webber would have won instead .
also , rookie sebastien buemi was up there fighting with double world champion fernando alonso , also in an adrian newey car .
so i have to give the credit to the team as well , they 've built a fantstic car this season . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frentzen knows first hand that an adrian newey car is usually a fast car f1 's drastic rule changes meant that designers could n't simply improve on the foundation of their 2008 models in 2009 .
innovation was the order of the day , as design teams all along the pitlane went back to the drawing board .
taking this into account , the success of red bull with adrian newey 's involvement , and of championship leaders brawn gp with a car developed by ross brawn , the mastermind of michael schumacher 's dominant years with benetton and ferrari , seems a little less shocking .
however , these relatively small teams may yet struggle to maintain their early season advantage .
there are bigger , richer outfits working round the clock to close the gap on formula one 's unlikely front-runners .

that 's the verdict of former f1 ace heinz-harald frentzen . it 's been a year of surprises and shake-ups in the world of formula one racing .
a team that looked on the verge of extinction a couple of months ago has a commanding lead in the formula one championship after three grands prix .
brawn gp have gone from rank outsiders to hot favorites in what seems like the blink of an eye .
red bull and toyota - both of whom have been also-rans throughout their histories in the sport - are the closest competition for the former honda works team .
the only traditionally big name anywhere near the top is mclaren mercedes .
world champion lewis hamilton 's team are currently fourth in the constructor 's championship , but their future is in serious doubt due to off-track controversy .
meanwhile , ferrari , f1 's top team in eight of the last ten seasons , are dead last in the championship with no points from three races .
formula one has been turned on its head this season , and germany 's former f1 superstar heinz-harald frentzen told deutsche welle that he thinks it 's a breath of fresh air .
" it 's mixed up formula one completely , " frentzen says .
" i mean , before the season started , could you imagine the top teams spending a lot of money and effort and finding themselves in the midfield ?
no one expected that ! "
initial testing results for the fourth race of the season in bahrain this weekend do n't suggest that normality is going to be restored just yet , if at all .
surprising , but not inexplicable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brawn gp and other ' underdogs ' are dominating f1 however , while frentzen said this new order in formula one is unexpected , he also pointed to rules , a hard fought 2008 season , and the introduction of new technoloiges as explanations for this surprising turn of events .
" there has been a big modification from one year to the other , in terms of regulations , chassis layout and with the introduction of kers -lrb- kinetic energy recovery system -rrb- .
everything 's been mixed up , " he says .
he said the last time there was a similar comprehensive change was between 1997 and 1998 .
" just like it was back then , the teams who made the best decisions and found the best strategy for the new regulations over the winter have earned the glory , " he said .
little wonder frentzen is so conscious of how rule changes can affect f1 .
he was one of the losers after the rule changes a decade ago .
then driving for williams , frentzen watched his team morph from the quickest in the sport into a relatively mediocre outfit in a matter of months .
it was during this same shakeup that mclaren and ferrari re-established themselves as major players in the sport , a position neither team ever really relinquished , until this year , perhaps .
getting better and better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel has won both his races in wet conditions one major winner in the new-look f1 is sebastian vettel .
the 21-year-old german won round three of the season in china from pole position , taking the second race win of his fledgling career .
in friday testing in bahrain , his red bull car looked quick again and the young german is optimistic about the season .
" i do n't want to talk about the title , but we have the potential to drive for victory in the next races , " vettel told reporters trackside in bahrain .
frentzen - who was 29 years old when he won his first grand prix with williams - is impressed that vettel has grabbed two wins so early in his career .
" i am a big fan of vettel because he developed himself steadily , starting in the sport at a very young age , " he says .
" but now , he 's already a very experienced driver .
he still makes some mistakes , but what really impresses me is that he is able to improve the development of his car , to help the mechanics make his car faster .
he 's getting better and better and better . "
the newey factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrian newey 's latest f1 masterpiece may be the 2009 red bull however , frentzen says that there 's more to red bull 's success than the talented young german behind the wheel .
adrian newey , red bull 's chief technical officer and designer , is a legend in formula one circles .
he has designed a slew of blisteringly quick f1 cars for williams and then mclaren mercedes over the years .
" i have also driven an adrian newey car in 1997 , " frentzen points out .
" for me , when i was closely involved in f1 , he was the best aerodynamic engineer in the sport , and the cars he built were always fantastic . "
" and remember that if vettel had n't won that race -lsb- in china -rsb- , then his teammate mark webber would have won instead .
also , rookie sebastien buemi was up there fighting with double world champion fernando alonso , also in an adrian newey car .
so i have to give the credit to the team as well , they 've built a fantstic car this season . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frentzen knows first hand that an adrian newey car is usually a fast car f1 's drastic rule changes meant that designers could n't simply improve on the foundation of their 2008 models in 2009 .
innovation was the order of the day , as design teams all along the pitlane went back to the drawing board .
taking this into account , the success of red bull with adrian newey 's involvement , and of championship leaders brawn gp with a car developed by ross brawn , the mastermind of michael schumacher 's dominant years with benetton and ferrari , seems a little less shocking .
however , these relatively small teams may yet struggle to maintain their early season advantage .
there are bigger , richer outfits working round the clock to close the gap on formula one 's unlikely front-runners .

then driving for williams , frentzen watched his team morph from the quickest in the sport into a relatively mediocre outfit in a matter of months .
it was during this same shakeup that mclaren and ferrari re-established themselves as major players in the sport , a position neither team ever really relinquished , until this year , perhaps .
getting better and better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel has won both his races in wet conditions one major winner in the new-look f1 is sebastian vettel .
the 21-year-old german won round three of the season in china from pole position , taking the second race win of his fledgling career .
in friday testing in bahrain , his red bull car looked quick again and the young german is optimistic about the season .
" i do n't want to talk about the title , but we have the potential to drive for victory in the next races , " vettel told reporters trackside in bahrain .
frentzen - who was 29 years old when he won his first grand prix with williams - is impressed that vettel has grabbed two wins so early in his career .
" i am a big fan of vettel because he developed himself steadily , starting in the sport at a very young age , " he says .
" but now , he 's already a very experienced driver .
he still makes some mistakes , but what really impresses me is that he is able to improve the development of his car , to help the mechanics make his car faster .
he 's getting better and better and better . "
the newey factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrian newey 's latest f1 masterpiece may be the 2009 red bull however , frentzen says that there 's more to red bull 's success than the talented young german behind the wheel .
adrian newey , red bull 's chief technical officer and designer , is a legend in formula one circles .
he has designed a slew of blisteringly quick f1 cars for williams and then mclaren mercedes over the years .
" i have also driven an adrian newey car in 1997 , " frentzen points out .
" for me , when i was closely involved in f1 , he was the best aerodynamic engineer in the sport , and the cars he built were always fantastic . "
" and remember that if vettel had n't won that race -lsb- in china -rsb- , then his teammate mark webber would have won instead .
also , rookie sebastien buemi was up there fighting with double world champion fernando alonso , also in an adrian newey car .
so i have to give the credit to the team as well , they 've built a fantstic car this season . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frentzen knows first hand that an adrian newey car is usually a fast car f1 's drastic rule changes meant that designers could n't simply improve on the foundation of their 2008 models in 2009 .
innovation was the order of the day , as design teams all along the pitlane went back to the drawing board .
taking this into account , the success of red bull with adrian newey 's involvement , and of championship leaders brawn gp with a car developed by ross brawn , the mastermind of michael schumacher 's dominant years with benetton and ferrari , seems a little less shocking .
however , these relatively small teams may yet struggle to maintain their early season advantage .
there are bigger , richer outfits working round the clock to close the gap on formula one 's unlikely front-runners .

it bans secret paternity tests and severely restricts the use of genetic testing by employers and insurance companies . health minister ulla schmidt welcomed the new law as a crucial step in protecting the rights of patients .
she said that after 10 years of discussions a legal framework had been put in place that would prevent the abuse of sensitive personal data .

the new legislation defines under which circumstances an analysis of genetic material is legal .
now , testing can only be conducted with the patient 's consent and after consultation with a doctor .

under the new law , paternity tests , for example , will be only legal if both the woman and man agree .
conducting a secret test can result in a fine of up to 5,000 euros .

berlin would ask the shareholders at a meeting on june 2 to vote for an increase in equity from just under 700 million euros -lrb- $ 925 million -rrb- at present to 6.3 billion euros , with the german state pumping in all the new funds .
the equity issue would sharply dilute the stakes of the existing shareholders , leaving them with less than a 10th of voting stock .
the new equity would be held by soffin , the government agency charged with helping german banks via guarantees and equity infusions .
soffin disclosed earlier in frankfurt that a government takeover offer for hre of 1.39 euros per share had made little progress .
merck finck analyst konrad becker told news agency afp the weak response by investors so far was not surpising , because " people often wait until the very last day before deciding to sell in hopes the purchaser will raise the offer . "
only 1.28 percent of shares had been acquired as of thursday afternoon , soffin said .
that brought berlin 's present stake to 9.94 percent .
the move could come at his expense of us investor jc flowers , who heads a consortium owning almost 24 percent of shares in hre .
so far , he has been dismissive towards the bid .
" accept bid " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are real fears hre could go the way of lehman brothers but the hre supervisory and executive boards advised shareholders friday to accept the takeover bid for their shares .
that offer expires on may 4 .
hre stock rose 1.4 percent in stock-market trading friday to 1.41 euros .
last month , germany legislated compulsory purchase powers in case the shareholders did not accept the bid .
chancellor angela merkel 's government is concerned that a collapse of hre could lead to the sort of financial market chaos that followed the failure of us investment bank lehman brothers in september last year .
hre 's problems arose at its depfa bank unit , which operated from largely deregulated dublin .
depfa is a principal lender to german local government , raising bond issues for roads and new buildings .
the government has so far given the bank support worth 102 billion euros .

berlin would ask the shareholders at a meeting on june 2 to vote for an increase in equity from just under 700 million euros -lrb- $ 925 million -rrb- at present to 6.3 billion euros , with the german state pumping in all the new funds .
the equity issue would sharply dilute the stakes of the existing shareholders , leaving them with less than a 10th of voting stock .
the new equity would be held by soffin , the government agency charged with helping german banks via guarantees and equity infusions .
soffin disclosed earlier in frankfurt that a government takeover offer for hre of 1.39 euros per share had made little progress .
merck finck analyst konrad becker told news agency afp the weak response by investors so far was not surpising , because " people often wait until the very last day before deciding to sell in hopes the purchaser will raise the offer . "
only 1.28 percent of shares had been acquired as of thursday afternoon , soffin said .
that brought berlin 's present stake to 9.94 percent .
the move could come at his expense of us investor jc flowers , who heads a consortium owning almost 24 percent of shares in hre .
so far , he has been dismissive towards the bid .
" accept bid " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are real fears hre could go the way of lehman brothers but the hre supervisory and executive boards advised shareholders friday to accept the takeover bid for their shares .
that offer expires on may 4 .
hre stock rose 1.4 percent in stock-market trading friday to 1.41 euros .
last month , germany legislated compulsory purchase powers in case the shareholders did not accept the bid .
chancellor angela merkel 's government is concerned that a collapse of hre could lead to the sort of financial market chaos that followed the failure of us investment bank lehman brothers in september last year .
hre 's problems arose at its depfa bank unit , which operated from largely deregulated dublin .
depfa is a principal lender to german local government , raising bond issues for roads and new buildings .
the government has so far given the bank support worth 102 billion euros .

but the countries failed to make headway on climate change negotiations . saving the world 's biodiversity and agreeing on a way forward on climate change negotiations had topped the agenda at the three-day international environment meeting in syracuse , italy .
but ministers attending were only able to tick one of those boxes .
an elusive global warming pact still looks unlikely anytime before a un climate change conference in copenhagen in december , when it is hoped a global strategy for the post-kyoto protocol era can be laid down .
g8 industrial countries and major developing economies meeting on the island of sicily signed a charter pledging to tackle deforestation , curb illegal trade in wildlife and boost research into the rate of species loss .
extinction rates are currently running at around 1,000 times their natural pace , with three species vanishing every hour , according to un statistics .
time running out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim steiner was unconvinced leaving the syracuse meeting " we set objectives on biodiversity for 2010 ... but unfortunately we have all recognized they have not been met , " said italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo , who hosted the summit .
" we are all convinced of the urgency ... of intervening to safeguard our biodiversity , " she said .
the head of the un environment program , achim steiner , said several significant hurdles still needed ironing out .
these included setting targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and financing the greening of developing countries .
key nations , he said , are coming to the realization that time is running out ahead of the un talks in copenhagen .
" i leave syracuse very much concerned that there is no clear pathway to resolving the gaps that remain , " he said . details please kim carstensen , director of the world wide fund for nature ’ s global climate initiative , said after the meeting that the charter on curbing biodiversity loss sends out a clear message on the importance of biodiversity , but was lacking in details .
" it 's a political signal of a will that is higher than i think we 've seen before at this level , and that i think is positive , " he said .
" but in terms of actual implementation , it 's not at all at the level of an action plan , or funded , which would also be nice .
and which would be needed as a next step going forward .
he remarked that ministers ’ agreement that action to move toward a low carbon economy was needed now rather than later could be an important signal for the coming talks in copenhagen .
differences of opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developed and emerging economies will both need to come to the table the g8 grouping of rich nations , along with emerging economies such as china , brazil and india , agreed at the meeting that climate change and species extinction were linked , and emphasized the economic value of preserving biodiversity .
but the game of chicken between industrialized and developing nations over who should foot the bill for plans to mitigate or even reverse climate change looks unlikely to end .
carstensen said big differences remained on financing technological improvements and meeting targeted emissions cuts .
" we need countries like japan , canada , russia and the us to come out and say what exactly is it that we want to contribute , " he said .
" we need to see a stronger and more articulated political will on the side of developed countries to move this really forward . "
reimund schwarze , head of climate change policy at the helmholtz center for environmental research in leipzig , germany , said emerging economies like china will have to make sacrifices too .
" china not only has to move ahead , it has to accept the fact that in the very long run they will be in the role of giving financial aid to other countries , " he said .
the leaders of 16 major economies are due to meet in washington on monday for further talks aimed at generating political leadership for the end-of-year un climate change meeting in denmark .
environmentalists will hope , by then , that both developed and developing countries will be ready to back up their intentions with concrete actions .

" because , once the crisis is over , the companies that will be successful are those that are right into the issues of the future , and we are sure that energy is one of those issues .

while businesses are struggling at the moment , they are still looking for ways to emerge from this recession one step ahead of their competition .
automated technology and robotics featured heavily at the fair .
robotic science was even showcased through the german round of the autonomous robot soccer world cup , where teams of robots battle it out on the football pitch .
the standard of play may not make this sport worthy of the nickname ' the beautiful game ' , at least not yet , but it 's still an astounding sight .
however , the robots of real interest to the more serious trade fair goers performed more modest tasks .

the financial crisis has turned the world of business into one of the most important political playgrounds , especially here in germany with a general election looming in september .
while exhibitors in hanover touted their wares , the german parliament convened in berlin to debate how to best tackle the deepening recession .
politicians discussed whether a third stimulus package was necessary to keep the german economy going , but exhibitors in hanover and the event organizers felt that they did n't need a government handout , rather they needed easier access to credit from cautious banks .
" we in germany tend to differentiate between the real economy and the financial economy , " said wolfram vom fritsch of the hanover trade fair .
" and most of our exhibitors see the problems in the financial economy , and see the problems in financing their orders , they say they 're struggling to finance good orders .
so we all look forward to more regulation in the financial sector , and we all look forward to more readily available liquid assets . "
wolfram vom fritsch admitted that the economic climate for the 2009 hanover trade fair has been anything but rosy , but he thinks the event has helped the industrial sector to fight back in the face of recession .
" i think cebit and the hannover trade fair have shown that they are more than just fairs , they are a marketplace - as we call it - where you can interchange between politics , science and industry . "
this interchange was arguably more important in 2009 than ever before in the fair 's 62-year history .

the proposed law change would bar members of management and supervisory boards from cashing in their stock options during their period of employment .
it would also set senior executives ' personal liability for breaches of duty at up to one year 's salary in every instance .
currently most german executives obtain personal-liability insurance at their employer 's expense , meaning that even if they are sued , the full sum of damages must be paid by the insurer .
the new liability rule would mean that if a court imposed a 5-million-euro damages award on an executive who is paid 2 million euros per annum , the insurer would pay 3 million while the executive would pay the other 2 million .
the points agreed to on thursday are to be passed on to the justice ministry to be formulated into formal draft laws that must still be approved by both houses of parliament .
as in other nations , germans have expressed outrage at executives escaping penalty for past misdeeds and obtaining huge remuneration , even when their companies are in deep financial trouble and sacking staff .

north korea has announced that two us journalists arrested last month on its border with china are to be put on trial to face criminal charges . " our related agency has decided to turn the us reporters over for trial based on findings of their crimes , " the north 's kcna news agency reported , without giving further details .
laura ling and euna lee were arrested on march 17 near the tumen river , which runs along the border between north korea and china , while reporting on north korean refugees for san francisco-based current-tv .
north korea has accused them of illegally entering its territory with " hostile " intent .

" the purpose of this humanitarian team will be to first of all monitor the situation and support the humanitarian assistance and try to do whatever we can to protect the civilian population , " ban told a press conference in brussels .
sri lanka , however , rejected his appeal , saying that it was not sensible to send a mission to the war zone .
" we still estimate that about 50,000 remain there , " said un assistant secretary general for humanitarian affairs catherine bragg .
she told a press conference that some 95,000 people had already managed to reach the safety of refugee camps set up outside the conflict zone , although she stressed " all these are estimates , we do n't have exact figures . "
the sri lankan army has said some 15,000 to 20,000 civilians are still trapped in the narrow strip of land where the tigers had been encircled by government forces .

the proposed law change would bar members of management and supervisory boards from cashing in their stock options during their period of employment .
it would also set senior executives ' personal liability for breaches of duty at up to one year 's salary in every instance .
currently most german executives obtain personal-liability insurance at their employer 's expense , meaning that even if they are sued , the full sum of damages must be paid by the insurer .
the new liability rule would mean that if a court imposed a 5-million-euro damages award on an executive who is paid 2 million euros per annum , the insurer would pay 3 million while the executive would pay the other 2 million .
the points agreed to on thursday are to be passed on to the justice ministry to be formulated into formal draft laws that must still be approved by both houses of parliament .
as in other nations , germans have expressed outrage at executives escaping penalty for past misdeeds and obtaining huge remuneration , even when their companies are in deep financial trouble and sacking staff .
germany has been pushing for an overhaul of the global financial framework and has blamed the world recession on the " casino capitalism " prevalent in the united states and britain . sje / nrt , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

currently most german executives obtain personal-liability insurance at their employer 's expense , meaning that even if they are sued , the full sum of damages must be paid by the insurer .

" the time is right for a new beginning on nuclear disarmament , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said , referring to an agreement earlier this month between us president barack obama and his russian counterpart , dimitry medvedev , aimed at negotiating a new deal on strategic nuclear arms reduction .
in the debate , the german foreign minister outlined steps which he said were crucial for reaching the goal of a nuclear-free world .
he said us-russian talks on a follow-up to the strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start 1 -rrb- , due to expire in december , must be successfully completed .
in addition , iran and north korea - two countries thought to be on the threshold of becoming nuclear powers - must be convinced to enter talks on their nuclear programs as proposed by the us president .
other efforts must be made on reducing the number of short- and medium-range nuclear weapons and to unfreeze negotiations on conventional arms reduction .
scrap nukes in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner hoyer -lrb- fdp -rrb- wants to rid germany of nuclear weapons in separate motions , germany ’ s opposition parties - the environmentalist greens , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the left party - called on the government to press for the removal of american tactical nuclear weapons based on german soil .
the weapons are a remnant of the cold war , although details about their number and location are not known .
" it ’ s a myth that the scrapping of these weapons would go along with a loss of security for germany and reduced influence in decision-making at nato , " the fdp ’ s foreign policy expert werner hoyer said in reference to the government ’ s stance that the weapons are important .
gregor gysi , the parliamentary leader of the left party , also urged chancellor angela merkel to abandon her policy of participation in nato ’ s nuclear strategy .
under nato policy , non-nuclear alliance members must provide troops and technical assistance in the event of a nuclear strike .
greece and canada have already opted out of this strategy .
gysi said germany should become the third nato country to do so .
" the idea that a departure from this policy would diminish german influence in nato is cold war thinking , " he added .
cool response by the government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel rejects calls for us nuclear weapons to be withdrawn from german soil eckart von klaeden , foreign policy expert of chancellor merkel 's conservative cdu , expressed skepticism about the demands .
" unfortunately we ’ ve seen a rapid increase in the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the world , " he said .
stressing that iran was on the verge of becoming a nuclear power , and that india and pakistan are eager to upgrade their nuclear weapons technology , he said that the tactical nuclear arms based in germany were an important part of nato ’ s policy of nuclear deterrence .
" president obama himself has stressed , " he concluded , " that his drive towards disarmament must go hand in hand with maintaining security for his country and that of its nato partners . "
the social democratic-conservative coalition government used its large majority to turn down the motions put foward by the opposition .
a nuclear-free germany can only be part of nato ’ s disarmament inititative , they said , and not the start of it . uh / pfd / jam , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a former chairman of the social democrats suggested on public radio that german workers , just like their french counterparts , should kidnap their boss if they 're worried about their future . the leader of germany ’ s left party has urged german workers to copy the example of disgruntled french counterparts and kidnap their bosses .
several managers in france who announced restructuring measures to deal with the economic crisis have been detained in factories in recent weeks by employees who fear losing their jobs .
managers from companies in france , including molex , sony , 3m and hewlett-packard , have all reported " bossnapping " incidents .
" when the government continues to do nothing , there is increasing danger that the far-right will gain in strength , " warned oskar lafontaine on public radio wdr .
the left party has also been calling for national strikes to be legalized again .
despite these warnings , experts see there is little risk of serious social unrest and mass protests breaking out in europe 's biggest economy .
the left party was established two years ago and is made up largely of former east german communists and disaffected social democrats , including its former chairman oskar lafontaine .
he quit former chancellor gerhard schroeder 's cabinet because he found its policies too centrist .
unexpected support from presidential candidate lafontaine 's " bossnapping " suggestions have received unexpected support from the social democrat presidential candidate gesine schwan who " warned of growing anger throughout the country . "
she was immediately sharply criticized from within her own party for scaremongering and spreading excessive pessimism .
" the economy is doing badly , but we are a long way from social unrest , " warned spd colleague , dieter wiefelspuetz .
" it does n't do anyone any good to be talking about unrest erupting here or in france or anywhere else , " said peter struck , the head of the bundestag faction of the social democrats .
" that is undermining efforts by the federal government which is doing everything possible to help make it easier for people to get through the crisis . "
german chancellor angela merkel said at a meeting of senior christian democrat party officials that she does not share the concerns that social unrest will break out .
" it is totally irresponsible to encourage panic and fear and to predict things that do not correspond with reality , " she said . wl / mrh , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de formula one -pipe- 24.04.2009 former f1 star enjoying 2009 's " big shake up " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinz-harald frentzen is pleased to see an upside-down f1 grid this year sebastian vettel is getting better and better , and he 's in a car designed by perhaps the best aerodynamic engineer in formula one .
that 's the verdict of former f1 ace heinz-harald frentzen . it 's been a year of surprises and shake-ups in the world of formula one racing .
a team that looked on the verge of extinction a couple of months ago has a commanding lead in the formula one championship after three grands prix .
brawn gp have gone from rank outsiders to hot favorites in what seems like the blink of an eye .
red bull and toyota - both of whom have been also-rans throughout their histories in the sport - are the closest competition for the former honda works team .
the only traditionally big name anywhere near the top is mclaren mercedes .
world champion lewis hamilton 's team are currently fourth in the constructor 's championship , but their future is in serious doubt due to off-track controversy .
meanwhile , ferrari , f1 's top team in eight of the last ten seasons , are dead last in the championship with no points from three races .
formula one has been turned on its head this season , and germany 's former f1 superstar heinz-harald frentzen told deutsche welle that he thinks it 's a breath of fresh air .
" it 's mixed up formula one completely , " frentzen says .
" i mean , before the season started , could you imagine the top teams spending a lot of money and effort and finding themselves in the midfield ?
no one expected that ! "
initial testing results for the fourth race of the season in bahrain this weekend do n't suggest that normality is going to be restored just yet , if at all .
surprising , but not inexplicable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brawn gp and other ' underdogs ' are dominating f1 however , while frentzen said this new order in formula one is unexpected , he also pointed to rules , a hard fought 2008 season , and the introduction of new technoloiges as explanations for this surprising turn of events .
" there has been a big modification from one year to the other , in terms of regulations , chassis layout and with the introduction of kers -lrb- kinetic energy recovery system -rrb- .
everything 's been mixed up , " he says .
he said the last time there was a similar comprehensive change was between 1997 and 1998 .
" just like it was back then , the teams who made the best decisions and found the best strategy for the new regulations over the winter have earned the glory , " he said .
little wonder frentzen is so conscious of how rule changes can affect f1 .
he was one of the losers after the rule changes a decade ago .
then driving for williams , frentzen watched his team morph from the quickest in the sport into a relatively mediocre outfit in a matter of months .
it was during this same shakeup that mclaren and ferrari re-established themselves as major players in the sport , a position neither team ever really relinquished , until this year , perhaps .
getting better and better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel has won both his races in wet conditions one major winner in the new-look f1 is sebastian vettel .
the 21-year-old german won round three of the season in china from pole position , taking the second race win of his fledgling career .
in friday testing in bahrain , his red bull car looked quick again and the young german is optimistic about the season .
" i do n't want to talk about the title , but we have the potential to drive for victory in the next races , " vettel told reporters trackside in bahrain .
frentzen - who was 29 years old when he won his first grand prix with williams - is impressed that vettel has grabbed two wins so early in his career .
" i am a big fan of vettel because he developed himself steadily , starting in the sport at a very young age , " he says .
" but now , he 's already a very experienced driver .
he still makes some mistakes , but what really impresses me is that he is able to improve the development of his car , to help the mechanics make his car faster .
he 's getting better and better and better . "
the newey factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrian newey 's latest f1 masterpiece may be the 2009 red bull however , frentzen says that there 's more to red bull 's success than the talented young german behind the wheel .
adrian newey , red bull 's chief technical officer and designer , is a legend in formula one circles .
he has designed a slew of blisteringly quick f1 cars for williams and then mclaren mercedes over the years .
" i have also driven an adrian newey car in 1997 , " frentzen points out .
" for me , when i was closely involved in f1 , he was the best aerodynamic engineer in the sport , and the cars he built were always fantastic . "
" and remember that if vettel had n't won that race -lsb- in china -rsb- , then his teammate mark webber would have won instead .
also , rookie sebastien buemi was up there fighting with double world champion fernando alonso , also in an adrian newey car .
so i have to give the credit to the team as well , they 've built a fantstic car this season . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frentzen knows first hand that an adrian newey car is usually a fast car f1 's drastic rule changes meant that designers could n't simply improve on the foundation of their 2008 models in 2009 .
innovation was the order of the day , as design teams all along the pitlane went back to the drawing board .
taking this into account , the success of red bull with adrian newey 's involvement , and of championship leaders brawn gp with a car developed by ross brawn , the mastermind of michael schumacher 's dominant years with benetton and ferrari , seems a little less shocking .
however , these relatively small teams may yet struggle to maintain their early season advantage .
there are bigger , richer outfits working round the clock to close the gap on formula one 's unlikely front-runners .

that 's the verdict of former f1 ace heinz-harald frentzen . it 's been a year of surprises and shake-ups in the world of formula one racing .
a team that looked on the verge of extinction a couple of months ago has a commanding lead in the formula one championship after three grands prix .
brawn gp have gone from rank outsiders to hot favorites in what seems like the blink of an eye .
red bull and toyota - both of whom have been also-rans throughout their histories in the sport - are the closest competition for the former honda works team .
the only traditionally big name anywhere near the top is mclaren mercedes .
world champion lewis hamilton 's team are currently fourth in the constructor 's championship , but their future is in serious doubt due to off-track controversy .
meanwhile , ferrari , f1 's top team in eight of the last ten seasons , are dead last in the championship with no points from three races .
formula one has been turned on its head this season , and germany 's former f1 superstar heinz-harald frentzen told deutsche welle that he thinks it 's a breath of fresh air .
" it 's mixed up formula one completely , " frentzen says .
" i mean , before the season started , could you imagine the top teams spending a lot of money and effort and finding themselves in the midfield ?
no one expected that ! "
initial testing results for the fourth race of the season in bahrain this weekend do n't suggest that normality is going to be restored just yet , if at all .
surprising , but not inexplicable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brawn gp and other ' underdogs ' are dominating f1 however , while frentzen said this new order in formula one is unexpected , he also pointed to rules , a hard fought 2008 season , and the introduction of new technoloiges as explanations for this surprising turn of events .
" there has been a big modification from one year to the other , in terms of regulations , chassis layout and with the introduction of kers -lrb- kinetic energy recovery system -rrb- .
everything 's been mixed up , " he says .
he said the last time there was a similar comprehensive change was between 1997 and 1998 .
" just like it was back then , the teams who made the best decisions and found the best strategy for the new regulations over the winter have earned the glory , " he said .
little wonder frentzen is so conscious of how rule changes can affect f1 .
he was one of the losers after the rule changes a decade ago .
then driving for williams , frentzen watched his team morph from the quickest in the sport into a relatively mediocre outfit in a matter of months .
it was during this same shakeup that mclaren and ferrari re-established themselves as major players in the sport , a position neither team ever really relinquished , until this year , perhaps .
getting better and better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel has won both his races in wet conditions one major winner in the new-look f1 is sebastian vettel .
the 21-year-old german won round three of the season in china from pole position , taking the second race win of his fledgling career .
in friday testing in bahrain , his red bull car looked quick again and the young german is optimistic about the season .
" i do n't want to talk about the title , but we have the potential to drive for victory in the next races , " vettel told reporters trackside in bahrain .
frentzen - who was 29 years old when he won his first grand prix with williams - is impressed that vettel has grabbed two wins so early in his career .
" i am a big fan of vettel because he developed himself steadily , starting in the sport at a very young age , " he says .
" but now , he 's already a very experienced driver .
he still makes some mistakes , but what really impresses me is that he is able to improve the development of his car , to help the mechanics make his car faster .
he 's getting better and better and better . "
the newey factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrian newey 's latest f1 masterpiece may be the 2009 red bull however , frentzen says that there 's more to red bull 's success than the talented young german behind the wheel .
adrian newey , red bull 's chief technical officer and designer , is a legend in formula one circles .
he has designed a slew of blisteringly quick f1 cars for williams and then mclaren mercedes over the years .
" i have also driven an adrian newey car in 1997 , " frentzen points out .
" for me , when i was closely involved in f1 , he was the best aerodynamic engineer in the sport , and the cars he built were always fantastic . "
" and remember that if vettel had n't won that race -lsb- in china -rsb- , then his teammate mark webber would have won instead .
also , rookie sebastien buemi was up there fighting with double world champion fernando alonso , also in an adrian newey car .
so i have to give the credit to the team as well , they 've built a fantstic car this season . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frentzen knows first hand that an adrian newey car is usually a fast car f1 's drastic rule changes meant that designers could n't simply improve on the foundation of their 2008 models in 2009 .
innovation was the order of the day , as design teams all along the pitlane went back to the drawing board .
taking this into account , the success of red bull with adrian newey 's involvement , and of championship leaders brawn gp with a car developed by ross brawn , the mastermind of michael schumacher 's dominant years with benetton and ferrari , seems a little less shocking .
however , these relatively small teams may yet struggle to maintain their early season advantage .
there are bigger , richer outfits working round the clock to close the gap on formula one 's unlikely front-runners .

" the time is right for a new beginning on nuclear disarmament , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said , referring to an agreement earlier this month between us president barack obama and his russian counterpart , dimitry medvedev , aimed at negotiating a new deal on strategic nuclear arms reduction .
in the debate , the german foreign minister outlined steps which he said were crucial for reaching the goal of a nuclear-free world .
he said us-russian talks on a follow-up to the strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start 1 -rrb- , due to expire in december , must be successfully completed .
in addition , iran and north korea - two countries thought to be on the threshold of becoming nuclear powers - must be convinced to enter talks on their nuclear programs as proposed by the us president .
other efforts must be made on reducing the number of short- and medium-range nuclear weapons and to unfreeze negotiations on conventional arms reduction .
scrap nukes in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner hoyer -lrb- fdp -rrb- wants to rid germany of nuclear weapons in separate motions , germany ’ s opposition parties - the environmentalist greens , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the left party - called on the government to press for the removal of american tactical nuclear weapons based on german soil .
the weapons are a remnant of the cold war , although details about their number and location are not known .
" it ’ s a myth that the scrapping of these weapons would go along with a loss of security for germany and reduced influence in decision-making at nato , " the fdp ’ s foreign policy expert werner hoyer said in reference to the government ’ s stance that the weapons are important .
gregor gysi , the parliamentary leader of the left party , also urged chancellor angela merkel to abandon her policy of participation in nato ’ s nuclear strategy .
under nato policy , non-nuclear alliance members must provide troops and technical assistance in the event of a nuclear strike .
greece and canada have already opted out of this strategy .
gysi said germany should become the third nato country to do so .
" the idea that a departure from this policy would diminish german influence in nato is cold war thinking , " he added .
cool response by the government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel rejects calls for us nuclear weapons to be withdrawn from german soil eckart von klaeden , foreign policy expert of chancellor merkel 's conservative cdu , expressed skepticism about the demands .
" unfortunately we ’ ve seen a rapid increase in the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the world , " he said .
stressing that iran was on the verge of becoming a nuclear power , and that india and pakistan are eager to upgrade their nuclear weapons technology , he said that the tactical nuclear arms based in germany were an important part of nato ’ s policy of nuclear deterrence .
" president obama himself has stressed , " he concluded , " that his drive towards disarmament must go hand in hand with maintaining security for his country and that of its nato partners . "
the social democratic-conservative coalition government used its large majority to turn down the motions put foward by the opposition .
a nuclear-free germany can only be part of nato ’ s disarmament inititative , they said , and not the start of it . uh / pfd / jam , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

several managers in france who announced restructuring measures to deal with the economic crisis have been detained in factories in recent weeks by employees who fear losing their jobs .

a former chairman of the social democrats suggested on public radio that german workers , just like their french counterparts , should kidnap their boss if they 're worried about their future . the leader of germany ’ s left party has urged german workers to copy the example of disgruntled french counterparts and kidnap their bosses .
several managers in france who announced restructuring measures to deal with the economic crisis have been detained in factories in recent weeks by employees who fear losing their jobs .
managers from companies in france , including molex , sony , 3m and hewlett-packard , have all reported " bossnapping " incidents .
" when the government continues to do nothing , there is increasing danger that the far-right will gain in strength , " warned oskar lafontaine on public radio wdr .
the left party has also been calling for national strikes to be legalized again .
despite these warnings , experts see there is little risk of serious social unrest and mass protests breaking out in europe 's biggest economy .
the left party was established two years ago and is made up largely of former east german communists and disaffected social democrats , including its former chairman oskar lafontaine .
he quit former chancellor gerhard schroeder 's cabinet because he found its policies too centrist .
unexpected support from presidential candidate lafontaine 's " bossnapping " suggestions have received unexpected support from the social democrat presidential candidate gesine schwan who " warned of growing anger throughout the country . "
she was immediately sharply criticized from within her own party for scaremongering and spreading excessive pessimism .
" the economy is doing badly , but we are a long way from social unrest , " warned spd colleague , dieter wiefelspuetz .
" it does n't do anyone any good to be talking about unrest erupting here or in france or anywhere else , " said peter struck , the head of the bundestag faction of the social democrats .
" that is undermining efforts by the federal government which is doing everything possible to help make it easier for people to get through the crisis . "
german chancellor angela merkel said at a meeting of senior christian democrat party officials that she does not share the concerns that social unrest will break out .
" it is totally irresponsible to encourage panic and fear and to predict things that do not correspond with reality , " she said . wl / mrh , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin would ask the shareholders at a meeting on june 2 to vote for an increase in equity from just under 700 million euros -lrb- $ 925 million -rrb- at present to 6.3 billion euros , with the german state pumping in all the new funds .
the equity issue would sharply dilute the stakes of the existing shareholders , leaving them with less than a 10th of voting stock .
the new equity would be held by soffin , the government agency charged with helping german banks via guarantees and equity infusions .
soffin disclosed earlier in frankfurt that a government takeover offer for hre of 1.39 euros per share had made little progress .
merck finck analyst konrad becker told news agency afp the weak response by investors so far was not surpising , because " people often wait until the very last day before deciding to sell in hopes the purchaser will raise the offer . "
only 1.28 percent of shares had been acquired as of thursday afternoon , soffin said .
that brought berlin 's present stake to 9.94 percent .
the move could come at his expense of us investor jc flowers , who heads a consortium owning almost 24 percent of shares in hre .
so far , he has been dismissive towards the bid .
" accept bid " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are real fears hre could go the way of lehman brothers but the hre supervisory and executive boards advised shareholders friday to accept the takeover bid for their shares .
that offer expires on may 4 .
hre stock rose 1.4 percent in stock-market trading friday to 1.41 euros .
last month , germany legislated compulsory purchase powers in case the shareholders did not accept the bid .
chancellor angela merkel 's government is concerned that a collapse of hre could lead to the sort of financial market chaos that followed the failure of us investment bank lehman brothers in september last year .
hre 's problems arose at its depfa bank unit , which operated from largely deregulated dublin .
depfa is a principal lender to german local government , raising bond issues for roads and new buildings .
the government has so far given the bank support worth 102 billion euros .

berlin would ask the shareholders at a meeting on june 2 to vote for an increase in equity from just under 700 million euros -lrb- $ 925 million -rrb- at present to 6.3 billion euros , with the german state pumping in all the new funds .
the equity issue would sharply dilute the stakes of the existing shareholders , leaving them with less than a 10th of voting stock .
the new equity would be held by soffin , the government agency charged with helping german banks via guarantees and equity infusions .
soffin disclosed earlier in frankfurt that a government takeover offer for hre of 1.39 euros per share had made little progress .
merck finck analyst konrad becker told news agency afp the weak response by investors so far was not surpising , because " people often wait until the very last day before deciding to sell in hopes the purchaser will raise the offer . "
only 1.28 percent of shares had been acquired as of thursday afternoon , soffin said .
that brought berlin 's present stake to 9.94 percent .
the move could come at his expense of us investor jc flowers , who heads a consortium owning almost 24 percent of shares in hre .
so far , he has been dismissive towards the bid .
" accept bid " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are real fears hre could go the way of lehman brothers but the hre supervisory and executive boards advised shareholders friday to accept the takeover bid for their shares .
that offer expires on may 4 .
hre stock rose 1.4 percent in stock-market trading friday to 1.41 euros .
last month , germany legislated compulsory purchase powers in case the shareholders did not accept the bid .
chancellor angela merkel 's government is concerned that a collapse of hre could lead to the sort of financial market chaos that followed the failure of us investment bank lehman brothers in september last year .
hre 's problems arose at its depfa bank unit , which operated from largely deregulated dublin .
depfa is a principal lender to german local government , raising bond issues for roads and new buildings .
the government has so far given the bank support worth 102 billion euros .

that 's the verdict of former f1 ace heinz-harald frentzen . it 's been a year of surprises and shake-ups in the world of formula one racing .
a team that looked on the verge of extinction a couple of months ago has a commanding lead in the formula one championship after three grands prix .
brawn gp have gone from rank outsiders to hot favorites in what seems like the blink of an eye .
red bull and toyota - both of whom have been also-rans throughout their histories in the sport - are the closest competition for the former honda works team .
the only traditionally big name anywhere near the top is mclaren mercedes .
world champion lewis hamilton 's team are currently fourth in the constructor 's championship , but their future is in serious doubt due to off-track controversy .
meanwhile , ferrari , f1 's top team in eight of the last ten seasons , are dead last in the championship with no points from three races .
formula one has been turned on its head this season , and germany 's former f1 superstar heinz-harald frentzen told deutsche welle that he thinks it 's a breath of fresh air .
" it 's mixed up formula one completely , " frentzen says .
" i mean , before the season started , could you imagine the top teams spending a lot of money and effort and finding themselves in the midfield ?
no one expected that ! "
initial testing results for the fourth race of the season in bahrain this weekend do n't suggest that normality is going to be restored just yet , if at all .
surprising , but not inexplicable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brawn gp and other ' underdogs ' are dominating f1 however , while frentzen said this new order in formula one is unexpected , he also pointed to rules , a hard fought 2008 season , and the introduction of new technoloiges as explanations for this surprising turn of events .
" there has been a big modification from one year to the other , in terms of regulations , chassis layout and with the introduction of kers -lrb- kinetic energy recovery system -rrb- .
everything 's been mixed up , " he says .
he said the last time there was a similar comprehensive change was between 1997 and 1998 .
" just like it was back then , the teams who made the best decisions and found the best strategy for the new regulations over the winter have earned the glory , " he said .
little wonder frentzen is so conscious of how rule changes can affect f1 .
he was one of the losers after the rule changes a decade ago .
then driving for williams , frentzen watched his team morph from the quickest in the sport into a relatively mediocre outfit in a matter of months .
it was during this same shakeup that mclaren and ferrari re-established themselves as major players in the sport , a position neither team ever really relinquished , until this year , perhaps .
getting better and better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel has won both his races in wet conditions one major winner in the new-look f1 is sebastian vettel .
the 21-year-old german won round three of the season in china from pole position , taking the second race win of his fledgling career .
in friday testing in bahrain , his red bull car looked quick again and the young german is optimistic about the season .
" i do n't want to talk about the title , but we have the potential to drive for victory in the next races , " vettel told reporters trackside in bahrain .
frentzen - who was 29 years old when he won his first grand prix with williams - is impressed that vettel has grabbed two wins so early in his career .
" i am a big fan of vettel because he developed himself steadily , starting in the sport at a very young age , " he says .
" but now , he 's already a very experienced driver .
he still makes some mistakes , but what really impresses me is that he is able to improve the development of his car , to help the mechanics make his car faster .
he 's getting better and better and better . "
the newey factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrian newey 's latest f1 masterpiece may be the 2009 red bull however , frentzen says that there 's more to red bull 's success than the talented young german behind the wheel .
adrian newey , red bull 's chief technical officer and designer , is a legend in formula one circles .
he has designed a slew of blisteringly quick f1 cars for williams and then mclaren mercedes over the years .
" i have also driven an adrian newey car in 1997 , " frentzen points out .
" for me , when i was closely involved in f1 , he was the best aerodynamic engineer in the sport , and the cars he built were always fantastic . "
" and remember that if vettel had n't won that race -lsb- in china -rsb- , then his teammate mark webber would have won instead .
also , rookie sebastien buemi was up there fighting with double world champion fernando alonso , also in an adrian newey car .
so i have to give the credit to the team as well , they 've built a fantstic car this season . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frentzen knows first hand that an adrian newey car is usually a fast car f1 's drastic rule changes meant that designers could n't simply improve on the foundation of their 2008 models in 2009 .
innovation was the order of the day , as design teams all along the pitlane went back to the drawing board .
taking this into account , the success of red bull with adrian newey 's involvement , and of championship leaders brawn gp with a car developed by ross brawn , the mastermind of michael schumacher 's dominant years with benetton and ferrari , seems a little less shocking .
however , these relatively small teams may yet struggle to maintain their early season advantage .
there are bigger , richer outfits working round the clock to close the gap on formula one 's unlikely front-runners .

the original strategic arms reduction treaty , or start , is set to expire in december . at a joint news conference at the us embassy in rome , negotiators described the one-day preliminary talks as a " productive beginning . "
us assistant secretary of state for verification and compliance rose gottemoeller said that friday 's meeting " got off to a fast start . " the talks focused largely on procedural issues and paved the way for the start of formal negotiations next month .
talks will be held in washington and moscow in may and june ahead of us president barack obama 's first visit to russia in july .
anatoly antonov , the chief of security and disarmament issues at the russian foreign ministry , said the two sides hoped they would meet the december deadline for a new treaty .
" we are sure that this new treaty will help to improve relations between the us and the russian federation , " added antonov .
a new start under obama ?
the first start arms control treaty , signed in 1991 , committed both russia and the us to cutting their nuclear arsenals , including reducing missile numbers to a maximum of 1,600 and warheads to no more than 6,000 . this led to steep reduction in nuclear weapons stocks on both sides .
the two countries agreed on a successor treaty , start ii , in 1993 , but russia ’ s parliament never ratified it .
and when us president barack obama 's predecessor george w. bush pulled the us out of the anti-ballistic missile treaty in 2002 , russia said it would give up plans of ever bringing start ii into force .
the initiative to resume talks toward a new start treaty was launched at the recent g-20 summit in london by russian president dmitri medvedev and barack obama , after which obama vowed to press for a world free of nuclear weapons . wl / jam , dpa / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

us assistant secretary of state for verification and compliance rose gottemoeller said that friday 's meeting " got off to a fast start . " the talks focused largely on procedural issues and paved the way for the start of formal negotiations next month .
talks will be held in washington and moscow in may and june ahead of us president barack obama 's first visit to russia in july .

" we are sure that this new treaty will help to improve relations between the us and the russian federation , " added antonov .
a new start under obama ?
the first start arms control treaty , signed in 1991 , committed both russia and the us to cutting their nuclear arsenals , including reducing missile numbers to a maximum of 1,600 and warheads to no more than 6,000 . this led to steep reduction in nuclear weapons stocks on both sides .
the two countries agreed on a successor treaty , start ii , in 1993 , but russia ’ s parliament never ratified it .
and when us president barack obama 's predecessor george w. bush pulled the us out of the anti-ballistic missile treaty in 2002 , russia said it would give up plans of ever bringing start ii into force .

it bans secret paternity tests and severely restricts the use of genetic testing by employers and insurance companies . health minister ulla schmidt welcomed the new law as a crucial step in protecting the rights of patients .
she said that after 10 years of discussions a legal framework had been put in place that would prevent the abuse of sensitive personal data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister schmidt says the law is crucial to protect patients genetic testing can be used to determine a person 's disposition to develop certain illnesses such as cancer - information which in the hands of an employer or a health insurance company could easily lead to discrimination .
the new legislation defines under which circumstances an analysis of genetic material is legal .
now , testing can only be conducted with the patient 's consent and after consultation with a doctor .
medical tourism to find out who 's the father ?
under the new law , paternity tests , for example , will be only legal if both the woman and man agree .
conducting a secret test can result in a fine of up to 5,000 euros .
paternity tests during pregnancy will be only legal in cases of sexual abuse or rape .
the german medical association however has warned that this might lead to medical tourism , with people trying to get genetic testing done abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who 's the father ?
clandestine testing will be illegal employers will also be affected by the new law .
they will not be able to demand a genetic test from their employees to check for illnesses or health problems .
the only exceptions to the rule are if some specific jobs entail potential health risks - as can be the case in the chemical industry .
insurance companies may not demand that their clients undergo genetic testing - with exceptions only in cases in which the pay-out sum is very high .
critics say there are too many exceptions the need for a clear law on the issue had been expressed by all parties across the political spectrum - but the details of the new legislation have been controversial .
the opposition green party , the free democratic party and the left party have all criticised the law for not going far enough and being open to too many loopholes . ai / pfd , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the time is right for a new beginning on nuclear disarmament , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said , referring to an agreement earlier this month between us president barack obama and his russian counterpart , dimitry medvedev , aimed at negotiating a new deal on strategic nuclear arms reduction .
in the debate , the german foreign minister outlined steps which he said were crucial for reaching the goal of a nuclear-free world .
he said us-russian talks on a follow-up to the strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start 1 -rrb- , due to expire in december , must be successfully completed .
in addition , iran and north korea - two countries thought to be on the threshold of becoming nuclear powers - must be convinced to enter talks on their nuclear programs as proposed by the us president .
other efforts must be made on reducing the number of short- and medium-range nuclear weapons and to unfreeze negotiations on conventional arms reduction .
scrap nukes in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner hoyer -lrb- fdp -rrb- wants to rid germany of nuclear weapons in separate motions , germany ’ s opposition parties - the environmentalist greens , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the left party - called on the government to press for the removal of american tactical nuclear weapons based on german soil .
the weapons are a remnant of the cold war , although details about their number and location are not known .
" it ’ s a myth that the scrapping of these weapons would go along with a loss of security for germany and reduced influence in decision-making at nato , " the fdp ’ s foreign policy expert werner hoyer said in reference to the government ’ s stance that the weapons are important .
gregor gysi , the parliamentary leader of the left party , also urged chancellor angela merkel to abandon her policy of participation in nato ’ s nuclear strategy .
under nato policy , non-nuclear alliance members must provide troops and technical assistance in the event of a nuclear strike .
greece and canada have already opted out of this strategy .
gysi said germany should become the third nato country to do so .
" the idea that a departure from this policy would diminish german influence in nato is cold war thinking , " he added .
cool response by the government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel rejects calls for us nuclear weapons to be withdrawn from german soil eckart von klaeden , foreign policy expert of chancellor merkel 's conservative cdu , expressed skepticism about the demands .
" unfortunately we ’ ve seen a rapid increase in the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the world , " he said .
stressing that iran was on the verge of becoming a nuclear power , and that india and pakistan are eager to upgrade their nuclear weapons technology , he said that the tactical nuclear arms based in germany were an important part of nato ’ s policy of nuclear deterrence .
" president obama himself has stressed , " he concluded , " that his drive towards disarmament must go hand in hand with maintaining security for his country and that of its nato partners . "
the social democratic-conservative coalition government used its large majority to turn down the motions put foward by the opposition .
a nuclear-free germany can only be part of nato ’ s disarmament inititative , they said , and not the start of it . uh / pfd / jam , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an elusive global warming pact still looks unlikely anytime before a un climate change conference in copenhagen in december , when it is hoped a global strategy for the post-kyoto protocol era can be laid down .
g8 industrial countries and major developing economies meeting on the island of sicily signed a charter pledging to tackle deforestation , curb illegal trade in wildlife and boost research into the rate of species loss .
extinction rates are currently running at around 1,000 times their natural pace , with three species vanishing every hour , according to un statistics .
time running out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim steiner was unconvinced leaving the syracuse meeting " we set objectives on biodiversity for 2010 ... but unfortunately we have all recognized they have not been met , " said italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo , who hosted the summit .
" we are all convinced of the urgency ... of intervening to safeguard our biodiversity , " she said .
the head of the un environment program , achim steiner , said several significant hurdles still needed ironing out .

carstensen said big differences remained on financing technological improvements and meeting targeted emissions cuts .
" we need countries like japan , canada , russia and the us to come out and say what exactly is it that we want to contribute , " he said .
" we need to see a stronger and more articulated political will on the side of developed countries to move this really forward . "
reimund schwarze , head of climate change policy at the helmholtz center for environmental research in leipzig , germany , said emerging economies like china will have to make sacrifices too .
" china not only has to move ahead , it has to accept the fact that in the very long run they will be in the role of giving financial aid to other countries , " he said .
the leaders of 16 major economies are due to meet in washington on monday for further talks aimed at generating political leadership for the end-of-year un climate change meeting in denmark .
environmentalists will hope , by then , that both developed and developing countries will be ready to back up their intentions with concrete actions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.04.2009 hanover fair wraps up , recession continues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business leaders in hanover were looking for new ideas to fight the recession one week of futuristic new products , courting new clients and political wrangling at the hanover trade fair may have created a feel-good factor , but the world 's economy is still reeling . the hanover trade fair managed to keep exhibitor turnout high this week , despite an economic downturn that top economic institutes expect to be the worst since the federal republic of germany was founded in 1949 .
more than 6,000 firms from around the world were on hand , looking for new deals and a much needed boost to their balance sheets .
the traditional staple of the hanover trade fair - the machine tool trade - was still the best represented sector on hand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trade fair boss wolfram vom fritsch has had a difficult year however , the fair also focused on emerging industrial issues like energy efficiency , renewable energy sources and automated technology , with a message that these potentially cost-cutting endeavours could prove the best way to fight recession .
" if the situation is difficult you have to look to the costs , you have to look to your customers , and you have to look to the future , " wolfram vom fritsch , the chief executive of the hannover trade fair , told deutsche welle .
" because , once the crisis is over , the companies that will be successful are those that are right into the issues of the future , and we are sure that energy is one of those issues .
it 's an issue that can bring you a short-term return on investments and it 's an issue with a long-term impact . "
saving energy , and money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the energy harvester lets factories say bye bye to batteries production efficiency is a growing concern in the industrial sector .
as firms look to cut costs without slashing jobs , cutting down on overheads like electricity usage is becoming ever more important .
the british firm perpetuum showcased one example of innovative energy-saving technology .
it 's called an ' energy harvester ' , and it generates electricity from the vibrations of its surroundings to power battery-powered devices .
" i think the first benefit is you no longer have to change batteries , " said chief engineer john parker .
" if you have 5,000 censors on your industrial plant , and your average battery life is two or three years , you will be changing 10 batteries per day .
with our device you no longer have to do that , secondly it uses waste energy , so it recovers the energy from the motor , and thirdly , you no longer have to dispose of batteries which have nasty chemicals inside them . "
even the major players like siemens , volkswagen and phoenix concentrated on their energy saving credentials at the fair .
volkswagen brought only its fuel-efficient ' blue motion ' range of cars to hanover .
" fuel efficiency definitely is one of our top priorities , if not the top priority , " said juergen leohold , the head of corporate research for the volkswagen group .
" we contribute to the prevention of climate change , and we help our customers save on fuel , which gives them a financial advantage , too . "
planning for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the robotic soccer world championships do n't have a recession to tackle rather like the major communication and information technology trade fair cebit , also based in hanover , the 2009 trade fair put a great emphasis on the importance of futuristic technology .
while businesses are struggling at the moment , they are still looking for ways to emerge from this recession one step ahead of their competition .
automated technology and robotics featured heavily at the fair .
robotic science was even showcased through the german round of the autonomous robot soccer world cup , where teams of robots battle it out on the football pitch .
the standard of play may not make this sport worthy of the nickname ' the beautiful game ' , at least not yet , but it 's still an astounding sight .
however , the robots of real interest to the more serious trade fair goers performed more modest tasks .
some can transport stocks around warehouses without a driver , others are designed to lead customers to certain products in stores , eliminating the need for a shop assistant to do so , while a few are designed to perform simple production line tasks in factories .
the political trade fair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with south korean prime minister han seung-soo on opening day german chancellor angela merkel , the prime minister of partner nation south korea han seung-soo , and german president horst koehler are just a few of the high profile politicans who attended this year 's fair .
the financial crisis has turned the world of business into one of the most important political playgrounds , especially here in germany with a general election looming in september .
while exhibitors in hanover touted their wares , the german parliament convened in berlin to debate how to best tackle the deepening recession .
politicians discussed whether a third stimulus package was necessary to keep the german economy going , but exhibitors in hanover and the event organizers felt that they did n't need a government handout , rather they needed easier access to credit from cautious banks .
" we in germany tend to differentiate between the real economy and the financial economy , " said wolfram vom fritsch of the hanover trade fair .
" and most of our exhibitors see the problems in the financial economy , and see the problems in financing their orders , they say they 're struggling to finance good orders .
so we all look forward to more regulation in the financial sector , and we all look forward to more readily available liquid assets . "
wolfram vom fritsch admitted that the economic climate for the 2009 hanover trade fair has been anything but rosy , but he thinks the event has helped the industrial sector to fight back in the face of recession .
" i think cebit and the hannover trade fair have shown that they are more than just fairs , they are a marketplace - as we call it - where you can interchange between politics , science and industry . "
this interchange was arguably more important in 2009 than ever before in the fair 's 62-year history .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.04.2009 hanover fair wraps up , recession continues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business leaders in hanover were looking for new ideas to fight the recession one week of futuristic new products , courting new clients and political wrangling at the hanover trade fair may have created a feel-good factor , but the world 's economy is still reeling . the hanover trade fair managed to keep exhibitor turnout high this week , despite an economic downturn that top economic institutes expect to be the worst since the federal republic of germany was founded in 1949 .
more than 6,000 firms from around the world were on hand , looking for new deals and a much needed boost to their balance sheets .
the traditional staple of the hanover trade fair - the machine tool trade - was still the best represented sector on hand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trade fair boss wolfram vom fritsch has had a difficult year however , the fair also focused on emerging industrial issues like energy efficiency , renewable energy sources and automated technology , with a message that these potentially cost-cutting endeavours could prove the best way to fight recession .
" if the situation is difficult you have to look to the costs , you have to look to your customers , and you have to look to the future , " wolfram vom fritsch , the chief executive of the hannover trade fair , told deutsche welle .
" because , once the crisis is over , the companies that will be successful are those that are right into the issues of the future , and we are sure that energy is one of those issues .
it 's an issue that can bring you a short-term return on investments and it 's an issue with a long-term impact . "
saving energy , and money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the energy harvester lets factories say bye bye to batteries production efficiency is a growing concern in the industrial sector .
as firms look to cut costs without slashing jobs , cutting down on overheads like electricity usage is becoming ever more important .
the british firm perpetuum showcased one example of innovative energy-saving technology .
it 's called an ' energy harvester ' , and it generates electricity from the vibrations of its surroundings to power battery-powered devices .
" i think the first benefit is you no longer have to change batteries , " said chief engineer john parker .
" if you have 5,000 censors on your industrial plant , and your average battery life is two or three years , you will be changing 10 batteries per day .
with our device you no longer have to do that , secondly it uses waste energy , so it recovers the energy from the motor , and thirdly , you no longer have to dispose of batteries which have nasty chemicals inside them . "
even the major players like siemens , volkswagen and phoenix concentrated on their energy saving credentials at the fair .
volkswagen brought only its fuel-efficient ' blue motion ' range of cars to hanover .
" fuel efficiency definitely is one of our top priorities , if not the top priority , " said juergen leohold , the head of corporate research for the volkswagen group .
" we contribute to the prevention of climate change , and we help our customers save on fuel , which gives them a financial advantage , too . "
planning for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the robotic soccer world championships do n't have a recession to tackle rather like the major communication and information technology trade fair cebit , also based in hanover , the 2009 trade fair put a great emphasis on the importance of futuristic technology .
while businesses are struggling at the moment , they are still looking for ways to emerge from this recession one step ahead of their competition .
automated technology and robotics featured heavily at the fair .
robotic science was even showcased through the german round of the autonomous robot soccer world cup , where teams of robots battle it out on the football pitch .
the standard of play may not make this sport worthy of the nickname ' the beautiful game ' , at least not yet , but it 's still an astounding sight .
however , the robots of real interest to the more serious trade fair goers performed more modest tasks .
some can transport stocks around warehouses without a driver , others are designed to lead customers to certain products in stores , eliminating the need for a shop assistant to do so , while a few are designed to perform simple production line tasks in factories .
the political trade fair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with south korean prime minister han seung-soo on opening day german chancellor angela merkel , the prime minister of partner nation south korea han seung-soo , and german president horst koehler are just a few of the high profile politicans who attended this year 's fair .
the financial crisis has turned the world of business into one of the most important political playgrounds , especially here in germany with a general election looming in september .
while exhibitors in hanover touted their wares , the german parliament convened in berlin to debate how to best tackle the deepening recession .
politicians discussed whether a third stimulus package was necessary to keep the german economy going , but exhibitors in hanover and the event organizers felt that they did n't need a government handout , rather they needed easier access to credit from cautious banks .
" we in germany tend to differentiate between the real economy and the financial economy , " said wolfram vom fritsch of the hanover trade fair .
" and most of our exhibitors see the problems in the financial economy , and see the problems in financing their orders , they say they 're struggling to finance good orders .
so we all look forward to more regulation in the financial sector , and we all look forward to more readily available liquid assets . "
wolfram vom fritsch admitted that the economic climate for the 2009 hanover trade fair has been anything but rosy , but he thinks the event has helped the industrial sector to fight back in the face of recession .
" i think cebit and the hannover trade fair have shown that they are more than just fairs , they are a marketplace - as we call it - where you can interchange between politics , science and industry . "
this interchange was arguably more important in 2009 than ever before in the fair 's 62-year history .

it bans secret paternity tests and severely restricts the use of genetic testing by employers and insurance companies . health minister ulla schmidt welcomed the new law as a crucial step in protecting the rights of patients .
she said that after 10 years of discussions a legal framework had been put in place that would prevent the abuse of sensitive personal data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister schmidt says the law is crucial to protect patients genetic testing can be used to determine a person 's disposition to develop certain illnesses such as cancer - information which in the hands of an employer or a health insurance company could easily lead to discrimination .
the new legislation defines under which circumstances an analysis of genetic material is legal .
now , testing can only be conducted with the patient 's consent and after consultation with a doctor .
medical tourism to find out who 's the father ?
under the new law , paternity tests , for example , will be only legal if both the woman and man agree .
conducting a secret test can result in a fine of up to 5,000 euros .
paternity tests during pregnancy will be only legal in cases of sexual abuse or rape .
the german medical association however has warned that this might lead to medical tourism , with people trying to get genetic testing done abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who 's the father ?
clandestine testing will be illegal employers will also be affected by the new law .
they will not be able to demand a genetic test from their employees to check for illnesses or health problems .
the only exceptions to the rule are if some specific jobs entail potential health risks - as can be the case in the chemical industry .
insurance companies may not demand that their clients undergo genetic testing - with exceptions only in cases in which the pay-out sum is very high .
critics say there are too many exceptions the need for a clear law on the issue had been expressed by all parties across the political spectrum - but the details of the new legislation have been controversial .
the opposition green party , the free democratic party and the left party have all criticised the law for not going far enough and being open to too many loopholes . ai / pfd , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de formula one -pipe- 24.04.2009 former f1 star enjoying 2009 's " big shake up " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinz-harald frentzen is pleased to see an upside-down f1 grid this year sebastian vettel is getting better and better , and he 's in a car designed by perhaps the best aerodynamic engineer in formula one .
that 's the verdict of former f1 ace heinz-harald frentzen . it 's been a year of surprises and shake-ups in the world of formula one racing .
a team that looked on the verge of extinction a couple of months ago has a commanding lead in the formula one championship after three grands prix .
brawn gp have gone from rank outsiders to hot favorites in what seems like the blink of an eye .
red bull and toyota - both of whom have been also-rans throughout their histories in the sport - are the closest competition for the former honda works team .
the only traditionally big name anywhere near the top is mclaren mercedes .
world champion lewis hamilton 's team are currently fourth in the constructor 's championship , but their future is in serious doubt due to off-track controversy .
meanwhile , ferrari , f1 's top team in eight of the last ten seasons , are dead last in the championship with no points from three races .
formula one has been turned on its head this season , and germany 's former f1 superstar heinz-harald frentzen told deutsche welle that he thinks it 's a breath of fresh air .
" it 's mixed up formula one completely , " frentzen says .
" i mean , before the season started , could you imagine the top teams spending a lot of money and effort and finding themselves in the midfield ?
no one expected that ! "
initial testing results for the fourth race of the season in bahrain this weekend do n't suggest that normality is going to be restored just yet , if at all .
surprising , but not inexplicable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brawn gp and other ' underdogs ' are dominating f1 however , while frentzen said this new order in formula one is unexpected , he also pointed to rules , a hard fought 2008 season , and the introduction of new technoloiges as explanations for this surprising turn of events .
" there has been a big modification from one year to the other , in terms of regulations , chassis layout and with the introduction of kers -lrb- kinetic energy recovery system -rrb- .
everything 's been mixed up , " he says .
he said the last time there was a similar comprehensive change was between 1997 and 1998 .
" just like it was back then , the teams who made the best decisions and found the best strategy for the new regulations over the winter have earned the glory , " he said .
little wonder frentzen is so conscious of how rule changes can affect f1 .
he was one of the losers after the rule changes a decade ago .
then driving for williams , frentzen watched his team morph from the quickest in the sport into a relatively mediocre outfit in a matter of months .
it was during this same shakeup that mclaren and ferrari re-established themselves as major players in the sport , a position neither team ever really relinquished , until this year , perhaps .
getting better and better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel has won both his races in wet conditions one major winner in the new-look f1 is sebastian vettel .
the 21-year-old german won round three of the season in china from pole position , taking the second race win of his fledgling career .
in friday testing in bahrain , his red bull car looked quick again and the young german is optimistic about the season .
" i do n't want to talk about the title , but we have the potential to drive for victory in the next races , " vettel told reporters trackside in bahrain .
frentzen - who was 29 years old when he won his first grand prix with williams - is impressed that vettel has grabbed two wins so early in his career .
" i am a big fan of vettel because he developed himself steadily , starting in the sport at a very young age , " he says .
" but now , he 's already a very experienced driver .
he still makes some mistakes , but what really impresses me is that he is able to improve the development of his car , to help the mechanics make his car faster .
he 's getting better and better and better . "
the newey factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrian newey 's latest f1 masterpiece may be the 2009 red bull however , frentzen says that there 's more to red bull 's success than the talented young german behind the wheel .
adrian newey , red bull 's chief technical officer and designer , is a legend in formula one circles .
he has designed a slew of blisteringly quick f1 cars for williams and then mclaren mercedes over the years .
" i have also driven an adrian newey car in 1997 , " frentzen points out .
" for me , when i was closely involved in f1 , he was the best aerodynamic engineer in the sport , and the cars he built were always fantastic . "
" and remember that if vettel had n't won that race -lsb- in china -rsb- , then his teammate mark webber would have won instead .
also , rookie sebastien buemi was up there fighting with double world champion fernando alonso , also in an adrian newey car .
so i have to give the credit to the team as well , they 've built a fantstic car this season . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frentzen knows first hand that an adrian newey car is usually a fast car f1 's drastic rule changes meant that designers could n't simply improve on the foundation of their 2008 models in 2009 .
innovation was the order of the day , as design teams all along the pitlane went back to the drawing board .
taking this into account , the success of red bull with adrian newey 's involvement , and of championship leaders brawn gp with a car developed by ross brawn , the mastermind of michael schumacher 's dominant years with benetton and ferrari , seems a little less shocking .
however , these relatively small teams may yet struggle to maintain their early season advantage .
there are bigger , richer outfits working round the clock to close the gap on formula one 's unlikely front-runners .

" the time is right for a new beginning on nuclear disarmament , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said , referring to an agreement earlier this month between us president barack obama and his russian counterpart , dimitry medvedev , aimed at negotiating a new deal on strategic nuclear arms reduction .
in the debate , the german foreign minister outlined steps which he said were crucial for reaching the goal of a nuclear-free world .
he said us-russian talks on a follow-up to the strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start 1 -rrb- , due to expire in december , must be successfully completed .
in addition , iran and north korea - two countries thought to be on the threshold of becoming nuclear powers - must be convinced to enter talks on their nuclear programs as proposed by the us president .

stressing that iran was on the verge of becoming a nuclear power , and that india and pakistan are eager to upgrade their nuclear weapons technology , he said that the tactical nuclear arms based in germany were an important part of nato ’ s policy of nuclear deterrence .

it bans secret paternity tests and severely restricts the use of genetic testing by employers and insurance companies . health minister ulla schmidt welcomed the new law as a crucial step in protecting the rights of patients .
she said that after 10 years of discussions a legal framework had been put in place that would prevent the abuse of sensitive personal data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister schmidt says the law is crucial to protect patients genetic testing can be used to determine a person 's disposition to develop certain illnesses such as cancer - information which in the hands of an employer or a health insurance company could easily lead to discrimination .
the new legislation defines under which circumstances an analysis of genetic material is legal .
now , testing can only be conducted with the patient 's consent and after consultation with a doctor .
medical tourism to find out who 's the father ?
under the new law , paternity tests , for example , will be only legal if both the woman and man agree .
conducting a secret test can result in a fine of up to 5,000 euros .
paternity tests during pregnancy will be only legal in cases of sexual abuse or rape .
the german medical association however has warned that this might lead to medical tourism , with people trying to get genetic testing done abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who 's the father ?
clandestine testing will be illegal employers will also be affected by the new law .
they will not be able to demand a genetic test from their employees to check for illnesses or health problems .
the only exceptions to the rule are if some specific jobs entail potential health risks - as can be the case in the chemical industry .
insurance companies may not demand that their clients undergo genetic testing - with exceptions only in cases in which the pay-out sum is very high .
critics say there are too many exceptions the need for a clear law on the issue had been expressed by all parties across the political spectrum - but the details of the new legislation have been controversial .
the opposition green party , the free democratic party and the left party have all criticised the law for not going far enough and being open to too many loopholes . ai / pfd , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.04.2009 hanover fair wraps up , recession continues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business leaders in hanover were looking for new ideas to fight the recession one week of futuristic new products , courting new clients and political wrangling at the hanover trade fair may have created a feel-good factor , but the world 's economy is still reeling . the hanover trade fair managed to keep exhibitor turnout high this week , despite an economic downturn that top economic institutes expect to be the worst since the federal republic of germany was founded in 1949 .
more than 6,000 firms from around the world were on hand , looking for new deals and a much needed boost to their balance sheets .
the traditional staple of the hanover trade fair - the machine tool trade - was still the best represented sector on hand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trade fair boss wolfram vom fritsch has had a difficult year however , the fair also focused on emerging industrial issues like energy efficiency , renewable energy sources and automated technology , with a message that these potentially cost-cutting endeavours could prove the best way to fight recession .
" if the situation is difficult you have to look to the costs , you have to look to your customers , and you have to look to the future , " wolfram vom fritsch , the chief executive of the hannover trade fair , told deutsche welle .
" because , once the crisis is over , the companies that will be successful are those that are right into the issues of the future , and we are sure that energy is one of those issues .
it 's an issue that can bring you a short-term return on investments and it 's an issue with a long-term impact . "
saving energy , and money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the energy harvester lets factories say bye bye to batteries production efficiency is a growing concern in the industrial sector .
as firms look to cut costs without slashing jobs , cutting down on overheads like electricity usage is becoming ever more important .
the british firm perpetuum showcased one example of innovative energy-saving technology .
it 's called an ' energy harvester ' , and it generates electricity from the vibrations of its surroundings to power battery-powered devices .
" i think the first benefit is you no longer have to change batteries , " said chief engineer john parker .
" if you have 5,000 censors on your industrial plant , and your average battery life is two or three years , you will be changing 10 batteries per day .
with our device you no longer have to do that , secondly it uses waste energy , so it recovers the energy from the motor , and thirdly , you no longer have to dispose of batteries which have nasty chemicals inside them . "
even the major players like siemens , volkswagen and phoenix concentrated on their energy saving credentials at the fair .
volkswagen brought only its fuel-efficient ' blue motion ' range of cars to hanover .
" fuel efficiency definitely is one of our top priorities , if not the top priority , " said juergen leohold , the head of corporate research for the volkswagen group .
" we contribute to the prevention of climate change , and we help our customers save on fuel , which gives them a financial advantage , too . "
planning for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the robotic soccer world championships do n't have a recession to tackle rather like the major communication and information technology trade fair cebit , also based in hanover , the 2009 trade fair put a great emphasis on the importance of futuristic technology .
while businesses are struggling at the moment , they are still looking for ways to emerge from this recession one step ahead of their competition .
automated technology and robotics featured heavily at the fair .
robotic science was even showcased through the german round of the autonomous robot soccer world cup , where teams of robots battle it out on the football pitch .
the standard of play may not make this sport worthy of the nickname ' the beautiful game ' , at least not yet , but it 's still an astounding sight .
however , the robots of real interest to the more serious trade fair goers performed more modest tasks .
some can transport stocks around warehouses without a driver , others are designed to lead customers to certain products in stores , eliminating the need for a shop assistant to do so , while a few are designed to perform simple production line tasks in factories .
the political trade fair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with south korean prime minister han seung-soo on opening day german chancellor angela merkel , the prime minister of partner nation south korea han seung-soo , and german president horst koehler are just a few of the high profile politicans who attended this year 's fair .
the financial crisis has turned the world of business into one of the most important political playgrounds , especially here in germany with a general election looming in september .
while exhibitors in hanover touted their wares , the german parliament convened in berlin to debate how to best tackle the deepening recession .
politicians discussed whether a third stimulus package was necessary to keep the german economy going , but exhibitors in hanover and the event organizers felt that they did n't need a government handout , rather they needed easier access to credit from cautious banks .
" we in germany tend to differentiate between the real economy and the financial economy , " said wolfram vom fritsch of the hanover trade fair .
" and most of our exhibitors see the problems in the financial economy , and see the problems in financing their orders , they say they 're struggling to finance good orders .
so we all look forward to more regulation in the financial sector , and we all look forward to more readily available liquid assets . "
wolfram vom fritsch admitted that the economic climate for the 2009 hanover trade fair has been anything but rosy , but he thinks the event has helped the industrial sector to fight back in the face of recession .
" i think cebit and the hannover trade fair have shown that they are more than just fairs , they are a marketplace - as we call it - where you can interchange between politics , science and industry . "
this interchange was arguably more important in 2009 than ever before in the fair 's 62-year history .

dw-world.de industry looks for a silver lining at hanover 's trade fair judging by interest in the hanover fair , you would n't guess that the world is in the middle of its worst economic crisis in nearly 80 years .

the financial crisis has turned the world of business into one of the most important political playgrounds , especially here in germany with a general election looming in september .
while exhibitors in hanover touted their wares , the german parliament convened in berlin to debate how to best tackle the deepening recession .
politicians discussed whether a third stimulus package was necessary to keep the german economy going , but exhibitors in hanover and the event organizers felt that they did n't need a government handout , rather they needed easier access to credit from cautious banks .

" and most of our exhibitors see the problems in the financial economy , and see the problems in financing their orders , they say they 're struggling to finance good orders .
so we all look forward to more regulation in the financial sector , and we all look forward to more readily available liquid assets . "
wolfram vom fritsch admitted that the economic climate for the 2009 hanover trade fair has been anything but rosy , but he thinks the event has helped the industrial sector to fight back in the face of recession .
" i think cebit and the hannover trade fair have shown that they are more than just fairs , they are a marketplace - as we call it - where you can interchange between politics , science and industry . "
this interchange was arguably more important in 2009 than ever before in the fair 's 62-year history .

it bans secret paternity tests and severely restricts the use of genetic testing by employers and insurance companies . health minister ulla schmidt welcomed the new law as a crucial step in protecting the rights of patients .
she said that after 10 years of discussions a legal framework had been put in place that would prevent the abuse of sensitive personal data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister schmidt says the law is crucial to protect patients genetic testing can be used to determine a person 's disposition to develop certain illnesses such as cancer - information which in the hands of an employer or a health insurance company could easily lead to discrimination .
the new legislation defines under which circumstances an analysis of genetic material is legal .
now , testing can only be conducted with the patient 's consent and after consultation with a doctor .
medical tourism to find out who 's the father ?
under the new law , paternity tests , for example , will be only legal if both the woman and man agree .
conducting a secret test can result in a fine of up to 5,000 euros .
paternity tests during pregnancy will be only legal in cases of sexual abuse or rape .
the german medical association however has warned that this might lead to medical tourism , with people trying to get genetic testing done abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who 's the father ?
clandestine testing will be illegal employers will also be affected by the new law .
they will not be able to demand a genetic test from their employees to check for illnesses or health problems .
the only exceptions to the rule are if some specific jobs entail potential health risks - as can be the case in the chemical industry .
insurance companies may not demand that their clients undergo genetic testing - with exceptions only in cases in which the pay-out sum is very high .
critics say there are too many exceptions the need for a clear law on the issue had been expressed by all parties across the political spectrum - but the details of the new legislation have been controversial .
the opposition green party , the free democratic party and the left party have all criticised the law for not going far enough and being open to too many loopholes . ai / pfd , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin would ask the shareholders at a meeting on june 2 to vote for an increase in equity from just under 700 million euros -lrb- $ 925 million -rrb- at present to 6.3 billion euros , with the german state pumping in all the new funds .
the equity issue would sharply dilute the stakes of the existing shareholders , leaving them with less than a 10th of voting stock .
the new equity would be held by soffin , the government agency charged with helping german banks via guarantees and equity infusions .
soffin disclosed earlier in frankfurt that a government takeover offer for hre of 1.39 euros per share had made little progress .
merck finck analyst konrad becker told news agency afp the weak response by investors so far was not surpising , because " people often wait until the very last day before deciding to sell in hopes the purchaser will raise the offer . "
only 1.28 percent of shares had been acquired as of thursday afternoon , soffin said .
that brought berlin 's present stake to 9.94 percent .
the move could come at his expense of us investor jc flowers , who heads a consortium owning almost 24 percent of shares in hre .
so far , he has been dismissive towards the bid .
" accept bid " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are real fears hre could go the way of lehman brothers but the hre supervisory and executive boards advised shareholders friday to accept the takeover bid for their shares .
that offer expires on may 4 .
hre stock rose 1.4 percent in stock-market trading friday to 1.41 euros .
last month , germany legislated compulsory purchase powers in case the shareholders did not accept the bid .
chancellor angela merkel 's government is concerned that a collapse of hre could lead to the sort of financial market chaos that followed the failure of us investment bank lehman brothers in september last year .
hre 's problems arose at its depfa bank unit , which operated from largely deregulated dublin .
depfa is a principal lender to german local government , raising bond issues for roads and new buildings .
the government has so far given the bank support worth 102 billion euros .
germany 's banking industry is currently weighed down with significant problems .
it has more than 800 billion euros worth of so-called toxic assets on lenders ' books . dfm / jam , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin would ask the shareholders at a meeting on june 2 to vote for an increase in equity from just under 700 million euros -lrb- $ 925 million -rrb- at present to 6.3 billion euros , with the german state pumping in all the new funds .
the equity issue would sharply dilute the stakes of the existing shareholders , leaving them with less than a 10th of voting stock .
the new equity would be held by soffin , the government agency charged with helping german banks via guarantees and equity infusions .
soffin disclosed earlier in frankfurt that a government takeover offer for hre of 1.39 euros per share had made little progress .
merck finck analyst konrad becker told news agency afp the weak response by investors so far was not surpising , because " people often wait until the very last day before deciding to sell in hopes the purchaser will raise the offer . "
only 1.28 percent of shares had been acquired as of thursday afternoon , soffin said .
that brought berlin 's present stake to 9.94 percent .

hre stock rose 1.4 percent in stock-market trading friday to 1.41 euros .
last month , germany legislated compulsory purchase powers in case the shareholders did not accept the bid .
chancellor angela merkel 's government is concerned that a collapse of hre could lead to the sort of financial market chaos that followed the failure of us investment bank lehman brothers in september last year .
hre 's problems arose at its depfa bank unit , which operated from largely deregulated dublin .
depfa is a principal lender to german local government , raising bond issues for roads and new buildings .

a former chairman of the social democrats suggested on public radio that german workers , just like their french counterparts , should kidnap their boss if they 're worried about their future . the leader of germany ’ s left party has urged german workers to copy the example of disgruntled french counterparts and kidnap their bosses .
several managers in france who announced restructuring measures to deal with the economic crisis have been detained in factories in recent weeks by employees who fear losing their jobs .
managers from companies in france , including molex , sony , 3m and hewlett-packard , have all reported " bossnapping " incidents .
" when the government continues to do nothing , there is increasing danger that the far-right will gain in strength , " warned oskar lafontaine on public radio wdr .
the left party has also been calling for national strikes to be legalized again .
despite these warnings , experts see there is little risk of serious social unrest and mass protests breaking out in europe 's biggest economy .
the left party was established two years ago and is made up largely of former east german communists and disaffected social democrats , including its former chairman oskar lafontaine .
he quit former chancellor gerhard schroeder 's cabinet because he found its policies too centrist .
unexpected support from presidential candidate lafontaine 's " bossnapping " suggestions have received unexpected support from the social democrat presidential candidate gesine schwan who " warned of growing anger throughout the country . "
she was immediately sharply criticized from within her own party for scaremongering and spreading excessive pessimism .
" the economy is doing badly , but we are a long way from social unrest , " warned spd colleague , dieter wiefelspuetz .
" it does n't do anyone any good to be talking about unrest erupting here or in france or anywhere else , " said peter struck , the head of the bundestag faction of the social democrats .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 24.04.2009 magath declines the role of bundesliga favorite großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg coach felix magath has led his team to title contention coach felix magath has led wolfsburg to 10 straight victories and the top of the bundesliga table .
but the strict disciplinarian maintains his team is still likely to be knocked off its perch . week after week , coach felix magath guides vfl wolfsburg to victory and week after week he faces the same question : is wolfsburg a serious title contender ? the answer is always similar .
magath says that his team has a precarious hold on the top of the bundesliga standings and , like the five other teams who have swapped the lead 11 times this season , will also eventually be unseated . despite wolfsburg 's success under magath and the clear mathematical possibility of their claiming the bundesliga title , magath has refused to name his team as a favorite to lift the league trophy .
in an effort to dampen expectations , magath has even said he 'd wager that bayern munich would win the title . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's grafite fires home " the best goal of his career " " if the -lsb- german soccer association -rsb- would allow it , i 'd even put money on fc bayern , " magath said after wolfsburg 's 2-1 win against bayer leverkusen last weekend . not even a 5-1 thrashing of bayern - the bavarian team 's worst loss in seven years - was enough to shake magath 's belief in bayern . " that was a very unique result that might not happen again for 50 years , " he said after the game . a history with bayern bayern are indeed still in the running , currently tied for second place in the standings with hamburg .
hertha berlin and vfb stuttgart also have an outside shot at the title .
but magath tipping bayern to win smacks of irony - it 's the same team he led to back-to-back german cup and league titles in 2005 and 2006 only to be fired in 2007 when bayern 's champions league chances began to pale . magath 's firing did n't rescue a champion 's league spot for bayern in 2007 but it freed him up to sign on with wolfsburg as coach , manager and ceo .
following the team 's recent winning streak , fans in wolfsburg are hoping the side remains undefeated until magath 's contract expires in 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath cut an elegant profile as a player before taking to coaching , magath was best known for his career as a player at hamburg .
the midfielder scored 46 goals in 306 games for hamburg , who were german champions three times during magath 's time .
magath also took part in germany 's consecutive second place finishes in the 1982 and 1986 world cups . a highlight in magath 's career on the pitch came for hamburg in the 1983 european cup final .
just eight minutes into the match , magath launched an arching blast from 18 meters that seemed certain to fly over the goal until it dropped just enough to duck the crossbar and sail into the net .
it was the game 's only goal and led hamburg to an upset win over juventus . records in sight now , wolfsburg is looking to upset a bundesliga record or two .
its 10 straight bundesliga wins tied a record set by borussia moenchengladbach in 1987 , and magath stands a good chance of breaking the record this weekend against second-to-last energie cottbus . if wolfsburg break gladbach 's record , magath 's sights will be set on a milestone he 's already familiar with .
bayern currently hold the record for 15 consecutive wins over two seasons - a record set partly while magath was at the helm . six games to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the game lasts 90 minutes and bayern win in the end ... for now but regardless of any records , players should n't expect much of a break from the coach .
magath 's reputation is as an outspoken disciplinarian .
once a marathon-runner himself , he values the physical fitness of his players .

berlin would ask the shareholders at a meeting on june 2 to vote for an increase in equity from just under 700 million euros -lrb- $ 925 million -rrb- at present to 6.3 billion euros , with the german state pumping in all the new funds .

soffin disclosed earlier in frankfurt that a government takeover offer for hre of 1.39 euros per share had made little progress .
merck finck analyst konrad becker told news agency afp the weak response by investors so far was not surpising , because " people often wait until the very last day before deciding to sell in hopes the purchaser will raise the offer . "
only 1.28 percent of shares had been acquired as of thursday afternoon , soffin said .

a former chairman of the social democrats suggested on public radio that german workers , just like their french counterparts , should kidnap their boss if they 're worried about their future . the leader of germany ’ s left party has urged german workers to copy the example of disgruntled french counterparts and kidnap their bosses .
several managers in france who announced restructuring measures to deal with the economic crisis have been detained in factories in recent weeks by employees who fear losing their jobs .
managers from companies in france , including molex , sony , 3m and hewlett-packard , have all reported " bossnapping " incidents .
" when the government continues to do nothing , there is increasing danger that the far-right will gain in strength , " warned oskar lafontaine on public radio wdr .
the left party has also been calling for national strikes to be legalized again .
despite these warnings , experts see there is little risk of serious social unrest and mass protests breaking out in europe 's biggest economy .
the left party was established two years ago and is made up largely of former east german communists and disaffected social democrats , including its former chairman oskar lafontaine .
he quit former chancellor gerhard schroeder 's cabinet because he found its policies too centrist .
unexpected support from presidential candidate lafontaine 's " bossnapping " suggestions have received unexpected support from the social democrat presidential candidate gesine schwan who " warned of growing anger throughout the country . "
she was immediately sharply criticized from within her own party for scaremongering and spreading excessive pessimism .
" the economy is doing badly , but we are a long way from social unrest , " warned spd colleague , dieter wiefelspuetz .
" it does n't do anyone any good to be talking about unrest erupting here or in france or anywhere else , " said peter struck , the head of the bundestag faction of the social democrats .
" that is undermining efforts by the federal government which is doing everything possible to help make it easier for people to get through the crisis . "
german chancellor angela merkel said at a meeting of senior christian democrat party officials that she does not share the concerns that social unrest will break out .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de formula one -pipe- 24.04.2009 former f1 star enjoying 2009 's " big shake up " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinz-harald frentzen is pleased to see an upside-down f1 grid this year sebastian vettel is getting better and better , and he 's in a car designed by perhaps the best aerodynamic engineer in formula one .
that 's the verdict of former f1 ace heinz-harald frentzen . it 's been a year of surprises and shake-ups in the world of formula one racing .
a team that looked on the verge of extinction a couple of months ago has a commanding lead in the formula one championship after three grands prix .
brawn gp have gone from rank outsiders to hot favorites in what seems like the blink of an eye .
red bull and toyota - both of whom have been also-rans throughout their histories in the sport - are the closest competition for the former honda works team .
the only traditionally big name anywhere near the top is mclaren mercedes .
world champion lewis hamilton 's team are currently fourth in the constructor 's championship , but their future is in serious doubt due to off-track controversy .
meanwhile , ferrari , f1 's top team in eight of the last ten seasons , are dead last in the championship with no points from three races .
formula one has been turned on its head this season , and germany 's former f1 superstar heinz-harald frentzen told deutsche welle that he thinks it 's a breath of fresh air .
" it 's mixed up formula one completely , " frentzen says .
" i mean , before the season started , could you imagine the top teams spending a lot of money and effort and finding themselves in the midfield ?
no one expected that ! "
initial testing results for the fourth race of the season in bahrain this weekend do n't suggest that normality is going to be restored just yet , if at all .
surprising , but not inexplicable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brawn gp and other ' underdogs ' are dominating f1 however , while frentzen said this new order in formula one is unexpected , he also pointed to rules , a hard fought 2008 season , and the introduction of new technoloiges as explanations for this surprising turn of events .
" there has been a big modification from one year to the other , in terms of regulations , chassis layout and with the introduction of kers -lrb- kinetic energy recovery system -rrb- .
everything 's been mixed up , " he says .
he said the last time there was a similar comprehensive change was between 1997 and 1998 .
" just like it was back then , the teams who made the best decisions and found the best strategy for the new regulations over the winter have earned the glory , " he said .
little wonder frentzen is so conscious of how rule changes can affect f1 .
he was one of the losers after the rule changes a decade ago .
then driving for williams , frentzen watched his team morph from the quickest in the sport into a relatively mediocre outfit in a matter of months .
it was during this same shakeup that mclaren and ferrari re-established themselves as major players in the sport , a position neither team ever really relinquished , until this year , perhaps .
getting better and better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel has won both his races in wet conditions one major winner in the new-look f1 is sebastian vettel .
the 21-year-old german won round three of the season in china from pole position , taking the second race win of his fledgling career .
in friday testing in bahrain , his red bull car looked quick again and the young german is optimistic about the season .
" i do n't want to talk about the title , but we have the potential to drive for victory in the next races , " vettel told reporters trackside in bahrain .
frentzen - who was 29 years old when he won his first grand prix with williams - is impressed that vettel has grabbed two wins so early in his career .
" i am a big fan of vettel because he developed himself steadily , starting in the sport at a very young age , " he says .
" but now , he 's already a very experienced driver .
he still makes some mistakes , but what really impresses me is that he is able to improve the development of his car , to help the mechanics make his car faster .
he 's getting better and better and better . "
the newey factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrian newey 's latest f1 masterpiece may be the 2009 red bull however , frentzen says that there 's more to red bull 's success than the talented young german behind the wheel .
adrian newey , red bull 's chief technical officer and designer , is a legend in formula one circles .
he has designed a slew of blisteringly quick f1 cars for williams and then mclaren mercedes over the years .
" i have also driven an adrian newey car in 1997 , " frentzen points out .
" for me , when i was closely involved in f1 , he was the best aerodynamic engineer in the sport , and the cars he built were always fantastic . "
" and remember that if vettel had n't won that race -lsb- in china -rsb- , then his teammate mark webber would have won instead .
also , rookie sebastien buemi was up there fighting with double world champion fernando alonso , also in an adrian newey car .
so i have to give the credit to the team as well , they 've built a fantstic car this season . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frentzen knows first hand that an adrian newey car is usually a fast car f1 's drastic rule changes meant that designers could n't simply improve on the foundation of their 2008 models in 2009 .
innovation was the order of the day , as design teams all along the pitlane went back to the drawing board .
taking this into account , the success of red bull with adrian newey 's involvement , and of championship leaders brawn gp with a car developed by ross brawn , the mastermind of michael schumacher 's dominant years with benetton and ferrari , seems a little less shocking .
however , these relatively small teams may yet struggle to maintain their early season advantage .
there are bigger , richer outfits working round the clock to close the gap on formula one 's unlikely front-runners .

but the strict disciplinarian maintains his team is still likely to be knocked off its perch . week after week , coach felix magath guides vfl wolfsburg to victory and week after week he faces the same question : is wolfsburg a serious title contender ? the answer is always similar .
magath says that his team has a precarious hold on the top of the bundesliga standings and , like the five other teams who have swapped the lead 11 times this season , will also eventually be unseated . despite wolfsburg 's success under magath and the clear mathematical possibility of their claiming the bundesliga title , magath has refused to name his team as a favorite to lift the league trophy .
in an effort to dampen expectations , magath has even said he 'd wager that bayern munich would win the title . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's grafite fires home " the best goal of his career " " if the -lsb- german soccer association -rsb- would allow it , i 'd even put money on fc bayern , " magath said after wolfsburg 's 2-1 win against bayer leverkusen last weekend . not even a 5-1 thrashing of bayern - the bavarian team 's worst loss in seven years - was enough to shake magath 's belief in bayern . " that was a very unique result that might not happen again for 50 years , " he said after the game . a history with bayern bayern are indeed still in the running , currently tied for second place in the standings with hamburg .
hertha berlin and vfb stuttgart also have an outside shot at the title .
but magath tipping bayern to win smacks of irony - it 's the same team he led to back-to-back german cup and league titles in 2005 and 2006 only to be fired in 2007 when bayern 's champions league chances began to pale . magath 's firing did n't rescue a champion 's league spot for bayern in 2007 but it freed him up to sign on with wolfsburg as coach , manager and ceo .
following the team 's recent winning streak , fans in wolfsburg are hoping the side remains undefeated until magath 's contract expires in 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath cut an elegant profile as a player before taking to coaching , magath was best known for his career as a player at hamburg .
the midfielder scored 46 goals in 306 games for hamburg , who were german champions three times during magath 's time .
magath also took part in germany 's consecutive second place finishes in the 1982 and 1986 world cups . a highlight in magath 's career on the pitch came for hamburg in the 1983 european cup final .
just eight minutes into the match , magath launched an arching blast from 18 meters that seemed certain to fly over the goal until it dropped just enough to duck the crossbar and sail into the net .
it was the game 's only goal and led hamburg to an upset win over juventus . records in sight now , wolfsburg is looking to upset a bundesliga record or two .
its 10 straight bundesliga wins tied a record set by borussia moenchengladbach in 1987 , and magath stands a good chance of breaking the record this weekend against second-to-last energie cottbus . if wolfsburg break gladbach 's record , magath 's sights will be set on a milestone he 's already familiar with .
bayern currently hold the record for 15 consecutive wins over two seasons - a record set partly while magath was at the helm . six games to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the game lasts 90 minutes and bayern win in the end ... for now but regardless of any records , players should n't expect much of a break from the coach .
magath 's reputation is as an outspoken disciplinarian .
once a marathon-runner himself , he values the physical fitness of his players .
star player grafite told the german newspaper die welt that he has magath to thank for being in the best shape of his life . with the end of the season approaching , now is the time that magath needs his players in top condition .
the biggest challenge comes in two weeks ' time , when wolfsburg face surging stuttgart on the road . coming into the season , wolfsburg 's goal was to finish fifth to secure a berth in european competition for next year .
barring a catastrophe , that goal can be checked off the list , but magath insists on keeping his team 's feet on the ground . " the last team to be on top was four points ahead just a few weeks ago and now they are five behind the leaders , " magath said of dethroned hertha berlin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 24.04.2009 magath declines the role of bundesliga favorite großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg coach felix magath has led his team to title contention coach felix magath has led wolfsburg to 10 straight victories and the top of the bundesliga table .
but the strict disciplinarian maintains his team is still likely to be knocked off its perch . week after week , coach felix magath guides vfl wolfsburg to victory and week after week he faces the same question : is wolfsburg a serious title contender ? the answer is always similar .
magath says that his team has a precarious hold on the top of the bundesliga standings and , like the five other teams who have swapped the lead 11 times this season , will also eventually be unseated . despite wolfsburg 's success under magath and the clear mathematical possibility of their claiming the bundesliga title , magath has refused to name his team as a favorite to lift the league trophy .
in an effort to dampen expectations , magath has even said he 'd wager that bayern munich would win the title . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's grafite fires home " the best goal of his career " " if the -lsb- german soccer association -rsb- would allow it , i 'd even put money on fc bayern , " magath said after wolfsburg 's 2-1 win against bayer leverkusen last weekend . not even a 5-1 thrashing of bayern - the bavarian team 's worst loss in seven years - was enough to shake magath 's belief in bayern . " that was a very unique result that might not happen again for 50 years , " he said after the game . a history with bayern bayern are indeed still in the running , currently tied for second place in the standings with hamburg .
hertha berlin and vfb stuttgart also have an outside shot at the title .
but magath tipping bayern to win smacks of irony - it 's the same team he led to back-to-back german cup and league titles in 2005 and 2006 only to be fired in 2007 when bayern 's champions league chances began to pale . magath 's firing did n't rescue a champion 's league spot for bayern in 2007 but it freed him up to sign on with wolfsburg as coach , manager and ceo .
following the team 's recent winning streak , fans in wolfsburg are hoping the side remains undefeated until magath 's contract expires in 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath cut an elegant profile as a player before taking to coaching , magath was best known for his career as a player at hamburg .
the midfielder scored 46 goals in 306 games for hamburg , who were german champions three times during magath 's time .
magath also took part in germany 's consecutive second place finishes in the 1982 and 1986 world cups . a highlight in magath 's career on the pitch came for hamburg in the 1983 european cup final .
just eight minutes into the match , magath launched an arching blast from 18 meters that seemed certain to fly over the goal until it dropped just enough to duck the crossbar and sail into the net .
it was the game 's only goal and led hamburg to an upset win over juventus . records in sight now , wolfsburg is looking to upset a bundesliga record or two .
its 10 straight bundesliga wins tied a record set by borussia moenchengladbach in 1987 , and magath stands a good chance of breaking the record this weekend against second-to-last energie cottbus . if wolfsburg break gladbach 's record , magath 's sights will be set on a milestone he 's already familiar with .
bayern currently hold the record for 15 consecutive wins over two seasons - a record set partly while magath was at the helm . six games to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the game lasts 90 minutes and bayern win in the end ... for now but regardless of any records , players should n't expect much of a break from the coach .
magath 's reputation is as an outspoken disciplinarian .
once a marathon-runner himself , he values the physical fitness of his players .
star player grafite told the german newspaper die welt that he has magath to thank for being in the best shape of his life . with the end of the season approaching , now is the time that magath needs his players in top condition .
the biggest challenge comes in two weeks ' time , when wolfsburg face surging stuttgart on the road . coming into the season , wolfsburg 's goal was to finish fifth to secure a berth in european competition for next year .
barring a catastrophe , that goal can be checked off the list , but magath insists on keeping his team 's feet on the ground . " the last team to be on top was four points ahead just a few weeks ago and now they are five behind the leaders , " magath said of dethroned hertha berlin .

that 's the verdict of former f1 ace heinz-harald frentzen . it 's been a year of surprises and shake-ups in the world of formula one racing .
a team that looked on the verge of extinction a couple of months ago has a commanding lead in the formula one championship after three grands prix .
brawn gp have gone from rank outsiders to hot favorites in what seems like the blink of an eye .
red bull and toyota - both of whom have been also-rans throughout their histories in the sport - are the closest competition for the former honda works team .
the only traditionally big name anywhere near the top is mclaren mercedes .
world champion lewis hamilton 's team are currently fourth in the constructor 's championship , but their future is in serious doubt due to off-track controversy .
meanwhile , ferrari , f1 's top team in eight of the last ten seasons , are dead last in the championship with no points from three races .
formula one has been turned on its head this season , and germany 's former f1 superstar heinz-harald frentzen told deutsche welle that he thinks it 's a breath of fresh air .
" it 's mixed up formula one completely , " frentzen says .
" i mean , before the season started , could you imagine the top teams spending a lot of money and effort and finding themselves in the midfield ?
no one expected that ! "
initial testing results for the fourth race of the season in bahrain this weekend do n't suggest that normality is going to be restored just yet , if at all .
surprising , but not inexplicable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brawn gp and other ' underdogs ' are dominating f1 however , while frentzen said this new order in formula one is unexpected , he also pointed to rules , a hard fought 2008 season , and the introduction of new technoloiges as explanations for this surprising turn of events .
" there has been a big modification from one year to the other , in terms of regulations , chassis layout and with the introduction of kers -lrb- kinetic energy recovery system -rrb- .
everything 's been mixed up , " he says .
he said the last time there was a similar comprehensive change was between 1997 and 1998 .
" just like it was back then , the teams who made the best decisions and found the best strategy for the new regulations over the winter have earned the glory , " he said .
little wonder frentzen is so conscious of how rule changes can affect f1 .
he was one of the losers after the rule changes a decade ago .
then driving for williams , frentzen watched his team morph from the quickest in the sport into a relatively mediocre outfit in a matter of months .
it was during this same shakeup that mclaren and ferrari re-established themselves as major players in the sport , a position neither team ever really relinquished , until this year , perhaps .
getting better and better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel has won both his races in wet conditions one major winner in the new-look f1 is sebastian vettel .
the 21-year-old german won round three of the season in china from pole position , taking the second race win of his fledgling career .
in friday testing in bahrain , his red bull car looked quick again and the young german is optimistic about the season .
" i do n't want to talk about the title , but we have the potential to drive for victory in the next races , " vettel told reporters trackside in bahrain .
frentzen - who was 29 years old when he won his first grand prix with williams - is impressed that vettel has grabbed two wins so early in his career .
" i am a big fan of vettel because he developed himself steadily , starting in the sport at a very young age , " he says .
" but now , he 's already a very experienced driver .
he still makes some mistakes , but what really impresses me is that he is able to improve the development of his car , to help the mechanics make his car faster .
he 's getting better and better and better . "
the newey factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrian newey 's latest f1 masterpiece may be the 2009 red bull however , frentzen says that there 's more to red bull 's success than the talented young german behind the wheel .
adrian newey , red bull 's chief technical officer and designer , is a legend in formula one circles .
he has designed a slew of blisteringly quick f1 cars for williams and then mclaren mercedes over the years .
" i have also driven an adrian newey car in 1997 , " frentzen points out .
" for me , when i was closely involved in f1 , he was the best aerodynamic engineer in the sport , and the cars he built were always fantastic . "
" and remember that if vettel had n't won that race -lsb- in china -rsb- , then his teammate mark webber would have won instead .
also , rookie sebastien buemi was up there fighting with double world champion fernando alonso , also in an adrian newey car .
so i have to give the credit to the team as well , they 've built a fantstic car this season . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frentzen knows first hand that an adrian newey car is usually a fast car f1 's drastic rule changes meant that designers could n't simply improve on the foundation of their 2008 models in 2009 .
innovation was the order of the day , as design teams all along the pitlane went back to the drawing board .
taking this into account , the success of red bull with adrian newey 's involvement , and of championship leaders brawn gp with a car developed by ross brawn , the mastermind of michael schumacher 's dominant years with benetton and ferrari , seems a little less shocking .
however , these relatively small teams may yet struggle to maintain their early season advantage .
there are bigger , richer outfits working round the clock to close the gap on formula one 's unlikely front-runners .

" there has been a big modification from one year to the other , in terms of regulations , chassis layout and with the introduction of kers -lrb- kinetic energy recovery system -rrb- .
everything 's been mixed up , " he says .
he said the last time there was a similar comprehensive change was between 1997 and 1998 .
" just like it was back then , the teams who made the best decisions and found the best strategy for the new regulations over the winter have earned the glory , " he said .
little wonder frentzen is so conscious of how rule changes can affect f1 .
he was one of the losers after the rule changes a decade ago .
then driving for williams , frentzen watched his team morph from the quickest in the sport into a relatively mediocre outfit in a matter of months .
it was during this same shakeup that mclaren and ferrari re-established themselves as major players in the sport , a position neither team ever really relinquished , until this year , perhaps .
getting better and better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel has won both his races in wet conditions one major winner in the new-look f1 is sebastian vettel .
the 21-year-old german won round three of the season in china from pole position , taking the second race win of his fledgling career .
in friday testing in bahrain , his red bull car looked quick again and the young german is optimistic about the season .
" i do n't want to talk about the title , but we have the potential to drive for victory in the next races , " vettel told reporters trackside in bahrain .
frentzen - who was 29 years old when he won his first grand prix with williams - is impressed that vettel has grabbed two wins so early in his career .
" i am a big fan of vettel because he developed himself steadily , starting in the sport at a very young age , " he says .
" but now , he 's already a very experienced driver .
he still makes some mistakes , but what really impresses me is that he is able to improve the development of his car , to help the mechanics make his car faster .
he 's getting better and better and better . "
the newey factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrian newey 's latest f1 masterpiece may be the 2009 red bull however , frentzen says that there 's more to red bull 's success than the talented young german behind the wheel .
adrian newey , red bull 's chief technical officer and designer , is a legend in formula one circles .
he has designed a slew of blisteringly quick f1 cars for williams and then mclaren mercedes over the years .
" i have also driven an adrian newey car in 1997 , " frentzen points out .
" for me , when i was closely involved in f1 , he was the best aerodynamic engineer in the sport , and the cars he built were always fantastic . "
" and remember that if vettel had n't won that race -lsb- in china -rsb- , then his teammate mark webber would have won instead .
also , rookie sebastien buemi was up there fighting with double world champion fernando alonso , also in an adrian newey car .
so i have to give the credit to the team as well , they 've built a fantstic car this season . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frentzen knows first hand that an adrian newey car is usually a fast car f1 's drastic rule changes meant that designers could n't simply improve on the foundation of their 2008 models in 2009 .
innovation was the order of the day , as design teams all along the pitlane went back to the drawing board .
taking this into account , the success of red bull with adrian newey 's involvement , and of championship leaders brawn gp with a car developed by ross brawn , the mastermind of michael schumacher 's dominant years with benetton and ferrari , seems a little less shocking .
however , these relatively small teams may yet struggle to maintain their early season advantage .
there are bigger , richer outfits working round the clock to close the gap on formula one 's unlikely front-runners .

that 's the verdict of former f1 ace heinz-harald frentzen . it 's been a year of surprises and shake-ups in the world of formula one racing .
a team that looked on the verge of extinction a couple of months ago has a commanding lead in the formula one championship after three grands prix .
brawn gp have gone from rank outsiders to hot favorites in what seems like the blink of an eye .
red bull and toyota - both of whom have been also-rans throughout their histories in the sport - are the closest competition for the former honda works team .
the only traditionally big name anywhere near the top is mclaren mercedes .
world champion lewis hamilton 's team are currently fourth in the constructor 's championship , but their future is in serious doubt due to off-track controversy .
meanwhile , ferrari , f1 's top team in eight of the last ten seasons , are dead last in the championship with no points from three races .
formula one has been turned on its head this season , and germany 's former f1 superstar heinz-harald frentzen told deutsche welle that he thinks it 's a breath of fresh air .
" it 's mixed up formula one completely , " frentzen says .
" i mean , before the season started , could you imagine the top teams spending a lot of money and effort and finding themselves in the midfield ?
no one expected that ! "
initial testing results for the fourth race of the season in bahrain this weekend do n't suggest that normality is going to be restored just yet , if at all .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 24.04.2009 magath declines the role of bundesliga favorite großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg coach felix magath has led his team to title contention coach felix magath has led wolfsburg to 10 straight victories and the top of the bundesliga table .
but the strict disciplinarian maintains his team is still likely to be knocked off its perch . week after week , coach felix magath guides vfl wolfsburg to victory and week after week he faces the same question : is wolfsburg a serious title contender ? the answer is always similar .
magath says that his team has a precarious hold on the top of the bundesliga standings and , like the five other teams who have swapped the lead 11 times this season , will also eventually be unseated . despite wolfsburg 's success under magath and the clear mathematical possibility of their claiming the bundesliga title , magath has refused to name his team as a favorite to lift the league trophy .
in an effort to dampen expectations , magath has even said he 'd wager that bayern munich would win the title . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's grafite fires home " the best goal of his career " " if the -lsb- german soccer association -rsb- would allow it , i 'd even put money on fc bayern , " magath said after wolfsburg 's 2-1 win against bayer leverkusen last weekend . not even a 5-1 thrashing of bayern - the bavarian team 's worst loss in seven years - was enough to shake magath 's belief in bayern . " that was a very unique result that might not happen again for 50 years , " he said after the game . a history with bayern bayern are indeed still in the running , currently tied for second place in the standings with hamburg .
hertha berlin and vfb stuttgart also have an outside shot at the title .
but magath tipping bayern to win smacks of irony - it 's the same team he led to back-to-back german cup and league titles in 2005 and 2006 only to be fired in 2007 when bayern 's champions league chances began to pale . magath 's firing did n't rescue a champion 's league spot for bayern in 2007 but it freed him up to sign on with wolfsburg as coach , manager and ceo .
following the team 's recent winning streak , fans in wolfsburg are hoping the side remains undefeated until magath 's contract expires in 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath cut an elegant profile as a player before taking to coaching , magath was best known for his career as a player at hamburg .
the midfielder scored 46 goals in 306 games for hamburg , who were german champions three times during magath 's time .
magath also took part in germany 's consecutive second place finishes in the 1982 and 1986 world cups . a highlight in magath 's career on the pitch came for hamburg in the 1983 european cup final .
just eight minutes into the match , magath launched an arching blast from 18 meters that seemed certain to fly over the goal until it dropped just enough to duck the crossbar and sail into the net .
it was the game 's only goal and led hamburg to an upset win over juventus . records in sight now , wolfsburg is looking to upset a bundesliga record or two .
its 10 straight bundesliga wins tied a record set by borussia moenchengladbach in 1987 , and magath stands a good chance of breaking the record this weekend against second-to-last energie cottbus . if wolfsburg break gladbach 's record , magath 's sights will be set on a milestone he 's already familiar with .
bayern currently hold the record for 15 consecutive wins over two seasons - a record set partly while magath was at the helm . six games to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the game lasts 90 minutes and bayern win in the end ... for now but regardless of any records , players should n't expect much of a break from the coach .
magath 's reputation is as an outspoken disciplinarian .
once a marathon-runner himself , he values the physical fitness of his players .
star player grafite told the german newspaper die welt that he has magath to thank for being in the best shape of his life . with the end of the season approaching , now is the time that magath needs his players in top condition .
the biggest challenge comes in two weeks ' time , when wolfsburg face surging stuttgart on the road . coming into the season , wolfsburg 's goal was to finish fifth to secure a berth in european competition for next year .
barring a catastrophe , that goal can be checked off the list , but magath insists on keeping his team 's feet on the ground . " the last team to be on top was four points ahead just a few weeks ago and now they are five behind the leaders , " magath said of dethroned hertha berlin .

a former chairman of the social democrats suggested on public radio that german workers , just like their french counterparts , should kidnap their boss if they 're worried about their future . the leader of germany ’ s left party has urged german workers to copy the example of disgruntled french counterparts and kidnap their bosses .
several managers in france who announced restructuring measures to deal with the economic crisis have been detained in factories in recent weeks by employees who fear losing their jobs .
managers from companies in france , including molex , sony , 3m and hewlett-packard , have all reported " bossnapping " incidents .
" when the government continues to do nothing , there is increasing danger that the far-right will gain in strength , " warned oskar lafontaine on public radio wdr .
the left party has also been calling for national strikes to be legalized again .
despite these warnings , experts see there is little risk of serious social unrest and mass protests breaking out in europe 's biggest economy .
the left party was established two years ago and is made up largely of former east german communists and disaffected social democrats , including its former chairman oskar lafontaine .
he quit former chancellor gerhard schroeder 's cabinet because he found its policies too centrist .
unexpected support from presidential candidate lafontaine 's " bossnapping " suggestions have received unexpected support from the social democrat presidential candidate gesine schwan who " warned of growing anger throughout the country . "
she was immediately sharply criticized from within her own party for scaremongering and spreading excessive pessimism .

" the economy is doing badly , but we are a long way from social unrest , " warned spd colleague , dieter wiefelspuetz .
" it does n't do anyone any good to be talking about unrest erupting here or in france or anywhere else , " said peter struck , the head of the bundestag faction of the social democrats .
" that is undermining efforts by the federal government which is doing everything possible to help make it easier for people to get through the crisis . "
german chancellor angela merkel said at a meeting of senior christian democrat party officials that she does not share the concerns that social unrest will break out .
" it is totally irresponsible to encourage panic and fear and to predict things that do not correspond with reality , " she said . wl / mrh , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the countries failed to make headway on climate change negotiations . saving the world 's biodiversity and agreeing on a way forward on climate change negotiations had topped the agenda at the three-day international environment meeting in syracuse , italy .
but ministers attending were only able to tick one of those boxes .
an elusive global warming pact still looks unlikely anytime before a un climate change conference in copenhagen in december , when it is hoped a global strategy for the post-kyoto protocol era can be laid down .
g8 industrial countries and major developing economies meeting on the island of sicily signed a charter pledging to tackle deforestation , curb illegal trade in wildlife and boost research into the rate of species loss .
extinction rates are currently running at around 1,000 times their natural pace , with three species vanishing every hour , according to un statistics .
time running out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim steiner was unconvinced leaving the syracuse meeting " we set objectives on biodiversity for 2010 ... but unfortunately we have all recognized they have not been met , " said italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo , who hosted the summit .
" we are all convinced of the urgency ... of intervening to safeguard our biodiversity , " she said .
the head of the un environment program , achim steiner , said several significant hurdles still needed ironing out .
these included setting targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and financing the greening of developing countries .
key nations , he said , are coming to the realization that time is running out ahead of the un talks in copenhagen .
" i leave syracuse very much concerned that there is no clear pathway to resolving the gaps that remain , " he said . details please kim carstensen , director of the world wide fund for nature ’ s global climate initiative , said after the meeting that the charter on curbing biodiversity loss sends out a clear message on the importance of biodiversity , but was lacking in details .
" it 's a political signal of a will that is higher than i think we 've seen before at this level , and that i think is positive , " he said .
" but in terms of actual implementation , it 's not at all at the level of an action plan , or funded , which would also be nice .
and which would be needed as a next step going forward .
he remarked that ministers ’ agreement that action to move toward a low carbon economy was needed now rather than later could be an important signal for the coming talks in copenhagen .
differences of opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developed and emerging economies will both need to come to the table the g8 grouping of rich nations , along with emerging economies such as china , brazil and india , agreed at the meeting that climate change and species extinction were linked , and emphasized the economic value of preserving biodiversity .
but the game of chicken between industrialized and developing nations over who should foot the bill for plans to mitigate or even reverse climate change looks unlikely to end .
carstensen said big differences remained on financing technological improvements and meeting targeted emissions cuts .
" we need countries like japan , canada , russia and the us to come out and say what exactly is it that we want to contribute , " he said .
" we need to see a stronger and more articulated political will on the side of developed countries to move this really forward . "
reimund schwarze , head of climate change policy at the helmholtz center for environmental research in leipzig , germany , said emerging economies like china will have to make sacrifices too .
" china not only has to move ahead , it has to accept the fact that in the very long run they will be in the role of giving financial aid to other countries , " he said .
the leaders of 16 major economies are due to meet in washington on monday for further talks aimed at generating political leadership for the end-of-year un climate change meeting in denmark .
environmentalists will hope , by then , that both developed and developing countries will be ready to back up their intentions with concrete actions .

extinction rates are currently running at around 1,000 times their natural pace , with three species vanishing every hour , according to un statistics .
time running out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim steiner was unconvinced leaving the syracuse meeting " we set objectives on biodiversity for 2010 ... but unfortunately we have all recognized they have not been met , " said italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo , who hosted the summit .
" we are all convinced of the urgency ... of intervening to safeguard our biodiversity , " she said .
the head of the un environment program , achim steiner , said several significant hurdles still needed ironing out .
these included setting targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and financing the greening of developing countries .
key nations , he said , are coming to the realization that time is running out ahead of the un talks in copenhagen .
" i leave syracuse very much concerned that there is no clear pathway to resolving the gaps that remain , " he said . details please kim carstensen , director of the world wide fund for nature ’ s global climate initiative , said after the meeting that the charter on curbing biodiversity loss sends out a clear message on the importance of biodiversity , but was lacking in details .
" it 's a political signal of a will that is higher than i think we 've seen before at this level , and that i think is positive , " he said .
" but in terms of actual implementation , it 's not at all at the level of an action plan , or funded , which would also be nice .
and which would be needed as a next step going forward .
he remarked that ministers ’ agreement that action to move toward a low carbon economy was needed now rather than later could be an important signal for the coming talks in copenhagen .
differences of opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developed and emerging economies will both need to come to the table the g8 grouping of rich nations , along with emerging economies such as china , brazil and india , agreed at the meeting that climate change and species extinction were linked , and emphasized the economic value of preserving biodiversity .
but the game of chicken between industrialized and developing nations over who should foot the bill for plans to mitigate or even reverse climate change looks unlikely to end .
carstensen said big differences remained on financing technological improvements and meeting targeted emissions cuts .
" we need countries like japan , canada , russia and the us to come out and say what exactly is it that we want to contribute , " he said .
" we need to see a stronger and more articulated political will on the side of developed countries to move this really forward . "
reimund schwarze , head of climate change policy at the helmholtz center for environmental research in leipzig , germany , said emerging economies like china will have to make sacrifices too .
" china not only has to move ahead , it has to accept the fact that in the very long run they will be in the role of giving financial aid to other countries , " he said .
the leaders of 16 major economies are due to meet in washington on monday for further talks aimed at generating political leadership for the end-of-year un climate change meeting in denmark .
environmentalists will hope , by then , that both developed and developing countries will be ready to back up their intentions with concrete actions .

the original strategic arms reduction treaty , or start , is set to expire in december . at a joint news conference at the us embassy in rome , negotiators described the one-day preliminary talks as a " productive beginning . "
us assistant secretary of state for verification and compliance rose gottemoeller said that friday 's meeting " got off to a fast start . " the talks focused largely on procedural issues and paved the way for the start of formal negotiations next month .
talks will be held in washington and moscow in may and june ahead of us president barack obama 's first visit to russia in july .
anatoly antonov , the chief of security and disarmament issues at the russian foreign ministry , said the two sides hoped they would meet the december deadline for a new treaty .
" we are sure that this new treaty will help to improve relations between the us and the russian federation , " added antonov .
a new start under obama ?
the first start arms control treaty , signed in 1991 , committed both russia and the us to cutting their nuclear arsenals , including reducing missile numbers to a maximum of 1,600 and warheads to no more than 6,000 . this led to steep reduction in nuclear weapons stocks on both sides .
the two countries agreed on a successor treaty , start ii , in 1993 , but russia ’ s parliament never ratified it .
and when us president barack obama 's predecessor george w. bush pulled the us out of the anti-ballistic missile treaty in 2002 , russia said it would give up plans of ever bringing start ii into force .
the initiative to resume talks toward a new start treaty was launched at the recent g-20 summit in london by russian president dmitri medvedev and barack obama , after which obama vowed to press for a world free of nuclear weapons . wl / jam , dpa / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the proposed law change would bar members of management and supervisory boards from cashing in their stock options during their period of employment .
it would also set senior executives ' personal liability for breaches of duty at up to one year 's salary in every instance .
currently most german executives obtain personal-liability insurance at their employer 's expense , meaning that even if they are sued , the full sum of damages must be paid by the insurer .
the new liability rule would mean that if a court imposed a 5-million-euro damages award on an executive who is paid 2 million euros per annum , the insurer would pay 3 million while the executive would pay the other 2 million .
the points agreed to on thursday are to be passed on to the justice ministry to be formulated into formal draft laws that must still be approved by both houses of parliament .
as in other nations , germans have expressed outrage at executives escaping penalty for past misdeeds and obtaining huge remuneration , even when their companies are in deep financial trouble and sacking staff .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.04.2009 hanover fair wraps up , recession continues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business leaders in hanover were looking for new ideas to fight the recession one week of futuristic new products , courting new clients and political wrangling at the hanover trade fair may have created a feel-good factor , but the world 's economy is still reeling . the hanover trade fair managed to keep exhibitor turnout high this week , despite an economic downturn that top economic institutes expect to be the worst since the federal republic of germany was founded in 1949 .
more than 6,000 firms from around the world were on hand , looking for new deals and a much needed boost to their balance sheets .
the traditional staple of the hanover trade fair - the machine tool trade - was still the best represented sector on hand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trade fair boss wolfram vom fritsch has had a difficult year however , the fair also focused on emerging industrial issues like energy efficiency , renewable energy sources and automated technology , with a message that these potentially cost-cutting endeavours could prove the best way to fight recession .
" if the situation is difficult you have to look to the costs , you have to look to your customers , and you have to look to the future , " wolfram vom fritsch , the chief executive of the hannover trade fair , told deutsche welle .
" because , once the crisis is over , the companies that will be successful are those that are right into the issues of the future , and we are sure that energy is one of those issues .
it 's an issue that can bring you a short-term return on investments and it 's an issue with a long-term impact . "
saving energy , and money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the energy harvester lets factories say bye bye to batteries production efficiency is a growing concern in the industrial sector .
as firms look to cut costs without slashing jobs , cutting down on overheads like electricity usage is becoming ever more important .
the british firm perpetuum showcased one example of innovative energy-saving technology .
it 's called an ' energy harvester ' , and it generates electricity from the vibrations of its surroundings to power battery-powered devices .
" i think the first benefit is you no longer have to change batteries , " said chief engineer john parker .
" if you have 5,000 censors on your industrial plant , and your average battery life is two or three years , you will be changing 10 batteries per day .
with our device you no longer have to do that , secondly it uses waste energy , so it recovers the energy from the motor , and thirdly , you no longer have to dispose of batteries which have nasty chemicals inside them . "
even the major players like siemens , volkswagen and phoenix concentrated on their energy saving credentials at the fair .
volkswagen brought only its fuel-efficient ' blue motion ' range of cars to hanover .
" fuel efficiency definitely is one of our top priorities , if not the top priority , " said juergen leohold , the head of corporate research for the volkswagen group .
" we contribute to the prevention of climate change , and we help our customers save on fuel , which gives them a financial advantage , too . "
planning for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the robotic soccer world championships do n't have a recession to tackle rather like the major communication and information technology trade fair cebit , also based in hanover , the 2009 trade fair put a great emphasis on the importance of futuristic technology .
while businesses are struggling at the moment , they are still looking for ways to emerge from this recession one step ahead of their competition .
automated technology and robotics featured heavily at the fair .
robotic science was even showcased through the german round of the autonomous robot soccer world cup , where teams of robots battle it out on the football pitch .
the standard of play may not make this sport worthy of the nickname ' the beautiful game ' , at least not yet , but it 's still an astounding sight .
however , the robots of real interest to the more serious trade fair goers performed more modest tasks .
some can transport stocks around warehouses without a driver , others are designed to lead customers to certain products in stores , eliminating the need for a shop assistant to do so , while a few are designed to perform simple production line tasks in factories .
the political trade fair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with south korean prime minister han seung-soo on opening day german chancellor angela merkel , the prime minister of partner nation south korea han seung-soo , and german president horst koehler are just a few of the high profile politicans who attended this year 's fair .
the financial crisis has turned the world of business into one of the most important political playgrounds , especially here in germany with a general election looming in september .
while exhibitors in hanover touted their wares , the german parliament convened in berlin to debate how to best tackle the deepening recession .
politicians discussed whether a third stimulus package was necessary to keep the german economy going , but exhibitors in hanover and the event organizers felt that they did n't need a government handout , rather they needed easier access to credit from cautious banks .
" we in germany tend to differentiate between the real economy and the financial economy , " said wolfram vom fritsch of the hanover trade fair .
" and most of our exhibitors see the problems in the financial economy , and see the problems in financing their orders , they say they 're struggling to finance good orders .
so we all look forward to more regulation in the financial sector , and we all look forward to more readily available liquid assets . "
wolfram vom fritsch admitted that the economic climate for the 2009 hanover trade fair has been anything but rosy , but he thinks the event has helped the industrial sector to fight back in the face of recession .
" i think cebit and the hannover trade fair have shown that they are more than just fairs , they are a marketplace - as we call it - where you can interchange between politics , science and industry . "
this interchange was arguably more important in 2009 than ever before in the fair 's 62-year history .

it bans secret paternity tests and severely restricts the use of genetic testing by employers and insurance companies . health minister ulla schmidt welcomed the new law as a crucial step in protecting the rights of patients .
she said that after 10 years of discussions a legal framework had been put in place that would prevent the abuse of sensitive personal data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister schmidt says the law is crucial to protect patients genetic testing can be used to determine a person 's disposition to develop certain illnesses such as cancer - information which in the hands of an employer or a health insurance company could easily lead to discrimination .
the new legislation defines under which circumstances an analysis of genetic material is legal .
now , testing can only be conducted with the patient 's consent and after consultation with a doctor .
medical tourism to find out who 's the father ?
under the new law , paternity tests , for example , will be only legal if both the woman and man agree .
conducting a secret test can result in a fine of up to 5,000 euros .
paternity tests during pregnancy will be only legal in cases of sexual abuse or rape .
the german medical association however has warned that this might lead to medical tourism , with people trying to get genetic testing done abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who 's the father ?
clandestine testing will be illegal employers will also be affected by the new law .
they will not be able to demand a genetic test from their employees to check for illnesses or health problems .
the only exceptions to the rule are if some specific jobs entail potential health risks - as can be the case in the chemical industry .
insurance companies may not demand that their clients undergo genetic testing - with exceptions only in cases in which the pay-out sum is very high .
critics say there are too many exceptions the need for a clear law on the issue had been expressed by all parties across the political spectrum - but the details of the new legislation have been controversial .
the opposition green party , the free democratic party and the left party have all criticised the law for not going far enough and being open to too many loopholes . ai / pfd , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the time is right for a new beginning on nuclear disarmament , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said , referring to an agreement earlier this month between us president barack obama and his russian counterpart , dimitry medvedev , aimed at negotiating a new deal on strategic nuclear arms reduction .
in the debate , the german foreign minister outlined steps which he said were crucial for reaching the goal of a nuclear-free world .
he said us-russian talks on a follow-up to the strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start 1 -rrb- , due to expire in december , must be successfully completed .
in addition , iran and north korea - two countries thought to be on the threshold of becoming nuclear powers - must be convinced to enter talks on their nuclear programs as proposed by the us president .
other efforts must be made on reducing the number of short- and medium-range nuclear weapons and to unfreeze negotiations on conventional arms reduction .
scrap nukes in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner hoyer -lrb- fdp -rrb- wants to rid germany of nuclear weapons in separate motions , germany ’ s opposition parties - the environmentalist greens , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the left party - called on the government to press for the removal of american tactical nuclear weapons based on german soil .
the weapons are a remnant of the cold war , although details about their number and location are not known .
" it ’ s a myth that the scrapping of these weapons would go along with a loss of security for germany and reduced influence in decision-making at nato , " the fdp ’ s foreign policy expert werner hoyer said in reference to the government ’ s stance that the weapons are important .
gregor gysi , the parliamentary leader of the left party , also urged chancellor angela merkel to abandon her policy of participation in nato ’ s nuclear strategy .
under nato policy , non-nuclear alliance members must provide troops and technical assistance in the event of a nuclear strike .
greece and canada have already opted out of this strategy .
gysi said germany should become the third nato country to do so .
" the idea that a departure from this policy would diminish german influence in nato is cold war thinking , " he added .
cool response by the government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel rejects calls for us nuclear weapons to be withdrawn from german soil eckart von klaeden , foreign policy expert of chancellor merkel 's conservative cdu , expressed skepticism about the demands .
" unfortunately we ’ ve seen a rapid increase in the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the world , " he said .
stressing that iran was on the verge of becoming a nuclear power , and that india and pakistan are eager to upgrade their nuclear weapons technology , he said that the tactical nuclear arms based in germany were an important part of nato ’ s policy of nuclear deterrence .
" president obama himself has stressed , " he concluded , " that his drive towards disarmament must go hand in hand with maintaining security for his country and that of its nato partners . "
the social democratic-conservative coalition government used its large majority to turn down the motions put foward by the opposition .

berlin would ask the shareholders at a meeting on june 2 to vote for an increase in equity from just under 700 million euros -lrb- $ 925 million -rrb- at present to 6.3 billion euros , with the german state pumping in all the new funds .
the equity issue would sharply dilute the stakes of the existing shareholders , leaving them with less than a 10th of voting stock .
the new equity would be held by soffin , the government agency charged with helping german banks via guarantees and equity infusions .
soffin disclosed earlier in frankfurt that a government takeover offer for hre of 1.39 euros per share had made little progress .
merck finck analyst konrad becker told news agency afp the weak response by investors so far was not surpising , because " people often wait until the very last day before deciding to sell in hopes the purchaser will raise the offer . "
only 1.28 percent of shares had been acquired as of thursday afternoon , soffin said .
that brought berlin 's present stake to 9.94 percent .
the move could come at his expense of us investor jc flowers , who heads a consortium owning almost 24 percent of shares in hre .
so far , he has been dismissive towards the bid .
" accept bid " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are real fears hre could go the way of lehman brothers but the hre supervisory and executive boards advised shareholders friday to accept the takeover bid for their shares .
that offer expires on may 4 .
hre stock rose 1.4 percent in stock-market trading friday to 1.41 euros .
last month , germany legislated compulsory purchase powers in case the shareholders did not accept the bid .
chancellor angela merkel 's government is concerned that a collapse of hre could lead to the sort of financial market chaos that followed the failure of us investment bank lehman brothers in september last year .
hre 's problems arose at its depfa bank unit , which operated from largely deregulated dublin .
depfa is a principal lender to german local government , raising bond issues for roads and new buildings .
the government has so far given the bank support worth 102 billion euros .

a former chairman of the social democrats suggested on public radio that german workers , just like their french counterparts , should kidnap their boss if they 're worried about their future . the leader of germany ’ s left party has urged german workers to copy the example of disgruntled french counterparts and kidnap their bosses .
several managers in france who announced restructuring measures to deal with the economic crisis have been detained in factories in recent weeks by employees who fear losing their jobs .
managers from companies in france , including molex , sony , 3m and hewlett-packard , have all reported " bossnapping " incidents .
" when the government continues to do nothing , there is increasing danger that the far-right will gain in strength , " warned oskar lafontaine on public radio wdr .
the left party has also been calling for national strikes to be legalized again .
despite these warnings , experts see there is little risk of serious social unrest and mass protests breaking out in europe 's biggest economy .
the left party was established two years ago and is made up largely of former east german communists and disaffected social democrats , including its former chairman oskar lafontaine .
he quit former chancellor gerhard schroeder 's cabinet because he found its policies too centrist .
unexpected support from presidential candidate lafontaine 's " bossnapping " suggestions have received unexpected support from the social democrat presidential candidate gesine schwan who " warned of growing anger throughout the country . "
she was immediately sharply criticized from within her own party for scaremongering and spreading excessive pessimism .
" the economy is doing badly , but we are a long way from social unrest , " warned spd colleague , dieter wiefelspuetz .
" it does n't do anyone any good to be talking about unrest erupting here or in france or anywhere else , " said peter struck , the head of the bundestag faction of the social democrats .
" that is undermining efforts by the federal government which is doing everything possible to help make it easier for people to get through the crisis . "
german chancellor angela merkel said at a meeting of senior christian democrat party officials that she does not share the concerns that social unrest will break out .
" it is totally irresponsible to encourage panic and fear and to predict things that do not correspond with reality , " she said . wl / mrh , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the countries failed to make headway on climate change negotiations . saving the world 's biodiversity and agreeing on a way forward on climate change negotiations had topped the agenda at the three-day international environment meeting in syracuse , italy .
but ministers attending were only able to tick one of those boxes .
an elusive global warming pact still looks unlikely anytime before a un climate change conference in copenhagen in december , when it is hoped a global strategy for the post-kyoto protocol era can be laid down .
g8 industrial countries and major developing economies meeting on the island of sicily signed a charter pledging to tackle deforestation , curb illegal trade in wildlife and boost research into the rate of species loss .
extinction rates are currently running at around 1,000 times their natural pace , with three species vanishing every hour , according to un statistics .
time running out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim steiner was unconvinced leaving the syracuse meeting " we set objectives on biodiversity for 2010 ... but unfortunately we have all recognized they have not been met , " said italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo , who hosted the summit .
" we are all convinced of the urgency ... of intervening to safeguard our biodiversity , " she said .
the head of the un environment program , achim steiner , said several significant hurdles still needed ironing out .
these included setting targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and financing the greening of developing countries .
key nations , he said , are coming to the realization that time is running out ahead of the un talks in copenhagen .
" i leave syracuse very much concerned that there is no clear pathway to resolving the gaps that remain , " he said . details please kim carstensen , director of the world wide fund for nature ’ s global climate initiative , said after the meeting that the charter on curbing biodiversity loss sends out a clear message on the importance of biodiversity , but was lacking in details .
" it 's a political signal of a will that is higher than i think we 've seen before at this level , and that i think is positive , " he said .
" but in terms of actual implementation , it 's not at all at the level of an action plan , or funded , which would also be nice .
and which would be needed as a next step going forward .
he remarked that ministers ’ agreement that action to move toward a low carbon economy was needed now rather than later could be an important signal for the coming talks in copenhagen .
differences of opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developed and emerging economies will both need to come to the table the g8 grouping of rich nations , along with emerging economies such as china , brazil and india , agreed at the meeting that climate change and species extinction were linked , and emphasized the economic value of preserving biodiversity .
but the game of chicken between industrialized and developing nations over who should foot the bill for plans to mitigate or even reverse climate change looks unlikely to end .
carstensen said big differences remained on financing technological improvements and meeting targeted emissions cuts .
" we need countries like japan , canada , russia and the us to come out and say what exactly is it that we want to contribute , " he said .
" we need to see a stronger and more articulated political will on the side of developed countries to move this really forward . "
reimund schwarze , head of climate change policy at the helmholtz center for environmental research in leipzig , germany , said emerging economies like china will have to make sacrifices too .
" china not only has to move ahead , it has to accept the fact that in the very long run they will be in the role of giving financial aid to other countries , " he said .
the leaders of 16 major economies are due to meet in washington on monday for further talks aimed at generating political leadership for the end-of-year un climate change meeting in denmark .
environmentalists will hope , by then , that both developed and developing countries will be ready to back up their intentions with concrete actions .

the original strategic arms reduction treaty , or start , is set to expire in december . at a joint news conference at the us embassy in rome , negotiators described the one-day preliminary talks as a " productive beginning . "
us assistant secretary of state for verification and compliance rose gottemoeller said that friday 's meeting " got off to a fast start . " the talks focused largely on procedural issues and paved the way for the start of formal negotiations next month .
talks will be held in washington and moscow in may and june ahead of us president barack obama 's first visit to russia in july .
anatoly antonov , the chief of security and disarmament issues at the russian foreign ministry , said the two sides hoped they would meet the december deadline for a new treaty .
" we are sure that this new treaty will help to improve relations between the us and the russian federation , " added antonov .
a new start under obama ?
the first start arms control treaty , signed in 1991 , committed both russia and the us to cutting their nuclear arsenals , including reducing missile numbers to a maximum of 1,600 and warheads to no more than 6,000 . this led to steep reduction in nuclear weapons stocks on both sides .
the two countries agreed on a successor treaty , start ii , in 1993 , but russia ’ s parliament never ratified it .
and when us president barack obama 's predecessor george w. bush pulled the us out of the anti-ballistic missile treaty in 2002 , russia said it would give up plans of ever bringing start ii into force .
the initiative to resume talks toward a new start treaty was launched at the recent g-20 summit in london by russian president dmitri medvedev and barack obama , after which obama vowed to press for a world free of nuclear weapons . wl / jam , dpa / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de formula one -pipe- 24.04.2009 former f1 star enjoying 2009 's " big shake up " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinz-harald frentzen is pleased to see an upside-down f1 grid this year sebastian vettel is getting better and better , and he 's in a car designed by perhaps the best aerodynamic engineer in formula one .
that 's the verdict of former f1 ace heinz-harald frentzen . it 's been a year of surprises and shake-ups in the world of formula one racing .
a team that looked on the verge of extinction a couple of months ago has a commanding lead in the formula one championship after three grands prix .
brawn gp have gone from rank outsiders to hot favorites in what seems like the blink of an eye .
red bull and toyota - both of whom have been also-rans throughout their histories in the sport - are the closest competition for the former honda works team .
the only traditionally big name anywhere near the top is mclaren mercedes .
world champion lewis hamilton 's team are currently fourth in the constructor 's championship , but their future is in serious doubt due to off-track controversy .
meanwhile , ferrari , f1 's top team in eight of the last ten seasons , are dead last in the championship with no points from three races .
formula one has been turned on its head this season , and germany 's former f1 superstar heinz-harald frentzen told deutsche welle that he thinks it 's a breath of fresh air .
" it 's mixed up formula one completely , " frentzen says .
" i mean , before the season started , could you imagine the top teams spending a lot of money and effort and finding themselves in the midfield ?
no one expected that ! "
initial testing results for the fourth race of the season in bahrain this weekend do n't suggest that normality is going to be restored just yet , if at all .
surprising , but not inexplicable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brawn gp and other ' underdogs ' are dominating f1 however , while frentzen said this new order in formula one is unexpected , he also pointed to rules , a hard fought 2008 season , and the introduction of new technoloiges as explanations for this surprising turn of events .
" there has been a big modification from one year to the other , in terms of regulations , chassis layout and with the introduction of kers -lrb- kinetic energy recovery system -rrb- .
everything 's been mixed up , " he says .
he said the last time there was a similar comprehensive change was between 1997 and 1998 .
" just like it was back then , the teams who made the best decisions and found the best strategy for the new regulations over the winter have earned the glory , " he said .
little wonder frentzen is so conscious of how rule changes can affect f1 .
he was one of the losers after the rule changes a decade ago .
then driving for williams , frentzen watched his team morph from the quickest in the sport into a relatively mediocre outfit in a matter of months .
it was during this same shakeup that mclaren and ferrari re-established themselves as major players in the sport , a position neither team ever really relinquished , until this year , perhaps .
getting better and better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel has won both his races in wet conditions one major winner in the new-look f1 is sebastian vettel .
the 21-year-old german won round three of the season in china from pole position , taking the second race win of his fledgling career .
in friday testing in bahrain , his red bull car looked quick again and the young german is optimistic about the season .
" i do n't want to talk about the title , but we have the potential to drive for victory in the next races , " vettel told reporters trackside in bahrain .
frentzen - who was 29 years old when he won his first grand prix with williams - is impressed that vettel has grabbed two wins so early in his career .
" i am a big fan of vettel because he developed himself steadily , starting in the sport at a very young age , " he says .
" but now , he 's already a very experienced driver .
he still makes some mistakes , but what really impresses me is that he is able to improve the development of his car , to help the mechanics make his car faster .
he 's getting better and better and better . "
the newey factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrian newey 's latest f1 masterpiece may be the 2009 red bull however , frentzen says that there 's more to red bull 's success than the talented young german behind the wheel .
adrian newey , red bull 's chief technical officer and designer , is a legend in formula one circles .
he has designed a slew of blisteringly quick f1 cars for williams and then mclaren mercedes over the years .
" i have also driven an adrian newey car in 1997 , " frentzen points out .
" for me , when i was closely involved in f1 , he was the best aerodynamic engineer in the sport , and the cars he built were always fantastic . "
" and remember that if vettel had n't won that race -lsb- in china -rsb- , then his teammate mark webber would have won instead .
also , rookie sebastien buemi was up there fighting with double world champion fernando alonso , also in an adrian newey car .
so i have to give the credit to the team as well , they 've built a fantstic car this season . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frentzen knows first hand that an adrian newey car is usually a fast car f1 's drastic rule changes meant that designers could n't simply improve on the foundation of their 2008 models in 2009 .
innovation was the order of the day , as design teams all along the pitlane went back to the drawing board .
taking this into account , the success of red bull with adrian newey 's involvement , and of championship leaders brawn gp with a car developed by ross brawn , the mastermind of michael schumacher 's dominant years with benetton and ferrari , seems a little less shocking .
however , these relatively small teams may yet struggle to maintain their early season advantage .
there are bigger , richer outfits working round the clock to close the gap on formula one 's unlikely front-runners .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.04.2009 hanover fair wraps up , recession continues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business leaders in hanover were looking for new ideas to fight the recession one week of futuristic new products , courting new clients and political wrangling at the hanover trade fair may have created a feel-good factor , but the world 's economy is still reeling . the hanover trade fair managed to keep exhibitor turnout high this week , despite an economic downturn that top economic institutes expect to be the worst since the federal republic of germany was founded in 1949 .
more than 6,000 firms from around the world were on hand , looking for new deals and a much needed boost to their balance sheets .
the traditional staple of the hanover trade fair - the machine tool trade - was still the best represented sector on hand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trade fair boss wolfram vom fritsch has had a difficult year however , the fair also focused on emerging industrial issues like energy efficiency , renewable energy sources and automated technology , with a message that these potentially cost-cutting endeavours could prove the best way to fight recession .
" if the situation is difficult you have to look to the costs , you have to look to your customers , and you have to look to the future , " wolfram vom fritsch , the chief executive of the hannover trade fair , told deutsche welle .
" because , once the crisis is over , the companies that will be successful are those that are right into the issues of the future , and we are sure that energy is one of those issues .
it 's an issue that can bring you a short-term return on investments and it 's an issue with a long-term impact . "
saving energy , and money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the energy harvester lets factories say bye bye to batteries production efficiency is a growing concern in the industrial sector .
as firms look to cut costs without slashing jobs , cutting down on overheads like electricity usage is becoming ever more important .
the british firm perpetuum showcased one example of innovative energy-saving technology .
it 's called an ' energy harvester ' , and it generates electricity from the vibrations of its surroundings to power battery-powered devices .
" i think the first benefit is you no longer have to change batteries , " said chief engineer john parker .
" if you have 5,000 censors on your industrial plant , and your average battery life is two or three years , you will be changing 10 batteries per day .
with our device you no longer have to do that , secondly it uses waste energy , so it recovers the energy from the motor , and thirdly , you no longer have to dispose of batteries which have nasty chemicals inside them . "
even the major players like siemens , volkswagen and phoenix concentrated on their energy saving credentials at the fair .
volkswagen brought only its fuel-efficient ' blue motion ' range of cars to hanover .
" fuel efficiency definitely is one of our top priorities , if not the top priority , " said juergen leohold , the head of corporate research for the volkswagen group .
" we contribute to the prevention of climate change , and we help our customers save on fuel , which gives them a financial advantage , too . "
planning for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the robotic soccer world championships do n't have a recession to tackle rather like the major communication and information technology trade fair cebit , also based in hanover , the 2009 trade fair put a great emphasis on the importance of futuristic technology .
while businesses are struggling at the moment , they are still looking for ways to emerge from this recession one step ahead of their competition .
automated technology and robotics featured heavily at the fair .
robotic science was even showcased through the german round of the autonomous robot soccer world cup , where teams of robots battle it out on the football pitch .
the standard of play may not make this sport worthy of the nickname ' the beautiful game ' , at least not yet , but it 's still an astounding sight .
however , the robots of real interest to the more serious trade fair goers performed more modest tasks .
some can transport stocks around warehouses without a driver , others are designed to lead customers to certain products in stores , eliminating the need for a shop assistant to do so , while a few are designed to perform simple production line tasks in factories .
the political trade fair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with south korean prime minister han seung-soo on opening day german chancellor angela merkel , the prime minister of partner nation south korea han seung-soo , and german president horst koehler are just a few of the high profile politicans who attended this year 's fair .
the financial crisis has turned the world of business into one of the most important political playgrounds , especially here in germany with a general election looming in september .
while exhibitors in hanover touted their wares , the german parliament convened in berlin to debate how to best tackle the deepening recession .
politicians discussed whether a third stimulus package was necessary to keep the german economy going , but exhibitors in hanover and the event organizers felt that they did n't need a government handout , rather they needed easier access to credit from cautious banks .
" we in germany tend to differentiate between the real economy and the financial economy , " said wolfram vom fritsch of the hanover trade fair .
" and most of our exhibitors see the problems in the financial economy , and see the problems in financing their orders , they say they 're struggling to finance good orders .
so we all look forward to more regulation in the financial sector , and we all look forward to more readily available liquid assets . "
wolfram vom fritsch admitted that the economic climate for the 2009 hanover trade fair has been anything but rosy , but he thinks the event has helped the industrial sector to fight back in the face of recession .
" i think cebit and the hannover trade fair have shown that they are more than just fairs , they are a marketplace - as we call it - where you can interchange between politics , science and industry . "
this interchange was arguably more important in 2009 than ever before in the fair 's 62-year history .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 24.04.2009 g8-plus environment meeting ends with biodiversity pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a charter was signed pledging to tackle deforestation and illegal wildlife trade environment ministers from the g8 industrialized nations and developing economies sealed a deal friday to slow species loss around the world .
but the countries failed to make headway on climate change negotiations . saving the world 's biodiversity and agreeing on a way forward on climate change negotiations had topped the agenda at the three-day international environment meeting in syracuse , italy .
but ministers attending were only able to tick one of those boxes .
an elusive global warming pact still looks unlikely anytime before a un climate change conference in copenhagen in december , when it is hoped a global strategy for the post-kyoto protocol era can be laid down .
g8 industrial countries and major developing economies meeting on the island of sicily signed a charter pledging to tackle deforestation , curb illegal trade in wildlife and boost research into the rate of species loss .
extinction rates are currently running at around 1,000 times their natural pace , with three species vanishing every hour , according to un statistics .
time running out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim steiner was unconvinced leaving the syracuse meeting " we set objectives on biodiversity for 2010 ... but unfortunately we have all recognized they have not been met , " said italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo , who hosted the summit .
" we are all convinced of the urgency ... of intervening to safeguard our biodiversity , " she said .
the head of the un environment program , achim steiner , said several significant hurdles still needed ironing out .
these included setting targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and financing the greening of developing countries .
key nations , he said , are coming to the realization that time is running out ahead of the un talks in copenhagen .
" i leave syracuse very much concerned that there is no clear pathway to resolving the gaps that remain , " he said . details please kim carstensen , director of the world wide fund for nature ’ s global climate initiative , said after the meeting that the charter on curbing biodiversity loss sends out a clear message on the importance of biodiversity , but was lacking in details .
" it 's a political signal of a will that is higher than i think we 've seen before at this level , and that i think is positive , " he said .
" but in terms of actual implementation , it 's not at all at the level of an action plan , or funded , which would also be nice .
and which would be needed as a next step going forward .
he remarked that ministers ’ agreement that action to move toward a low carbon economy was needed now rather than later could be an important signal for the coming talks in copenhagen .
differences of opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developed and emerging economies will both need to come to the table the g8 grouping of rich nations , along with emerging economies such as china , brazil and india , agreed at the meeting that climate change and species extinction were linked , and emphasized the economic value of preserving biodiversity .
but the game of chicken between industrialized and developing nations over who should foot the bill for plans to mitigate or even reverse climate change looks unlikely to end .
carstensen said big differences remained on financing technological improvements and meeting targeted emissions cuts .
" we need countries like japan , canada , russia and the us to come out and say what exactly is it that we want to contribute , " he said .
" we need to see a stronger and more articulated political will on the side of developed countries to move this really forward . "
reimund schwarze , head of climate change policy at the helmholtz center for environmental research in leipzig , germany , said emerging economies like china will have to make sacrifices too .
" china not only has to move ahead , it has to accept the fact that in the very long run they will be in the role of giving financial aid to other countries , " he said .
the leaders of 16 major economies are due to meet in washington on monday for further talks aimed at generating political leadership for the end-of-year un climate change meeting in denmark .
environmentalists will hope , by then , that both developed and developing countries will be ready to back up their intentions with concrete actions .

the british firm perpetuum showcased one example of innovative energy-saving technology .
it 's called an ' energy harvester ' , and it generates electricity from the vibrations of its surroundings to power battery-powered devices .
" i think the first benefit is you no longer have to change batteries , " said chief engineer john parker .
" if you have 5,000 censors on your industrial plant , and your average battery life is two or three years , you will be changing 10 batteries per day .
with our device you no longer have to do that , secondly it uses waste energy , so it recovers the energy from the motor , and thirdly , you no longer have to dispose of batteries which have nasty chemicals inside them . "
even the major players like siemens , volkswagen and phoenix concentrated on their energy saving credentials at the fair .
volkswagen brought only its fuel-efficient ' blue motion ' range of cars to hanover .
" fuel efficiency definitely is one of our top priorities , if not the top priority , " said juergen leohold , the head of corporate research for the volkswagen group .
" we contribute to the prevention of climate change , and we help our customers save on fuel , which gives them a financial advantage , too . "
planning for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the robotic soccer world championships do n't have a recession to tackle rather like the major communication and information technology trade fair cebit , also based in hanover , the 2009 trade fair put a great emphasis on the importance of futuristic technology .
while businesses are struggling at the moment , they are still looking for ways to emerge from this recession one step ahead of their competition .
automated technology and robotics featured heavily at the fair .
robotic science was even showcased through the german round of the autonomous robot soccer world cup , where teams of robots battle it out on the football pitch .
the standard of play may not make this sport worthy of the nickname ' the beautiful game ' , at least not yet , but it 's still an astounding sight .
however , the robots of real interest to the more serious trade fair goers performed more modest tasks .
some can transport stocks around warehouses without a driver , others are designed to lead customers to certain products in stores , eliminating the need for a shop assistant to do so , while a few are designed to perform simple production line tasks in factories .
the political trade fair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with south korean prime minister han seung-soo on opening day german chancellor angela merkel , the prime minister of partner nation south korea han seung-soo , and german president horst koehler are just a few of the high profile politicans who attended this year 's fair .
the financial crisis has turned the world of business into one of the most important political playgrounds , especially here in germany with a general election looming in september .
while exhibitors in hanover touted their wares , the german parliament convened in berlin to debate how to best tackle the deepening recession .
politicians discussed whether a third stimulus package was necessary to keep the german economy going , but exhibitors in hanover and the event organizers felt that they did n't need a government handout , rather they needed easier access to credit from cautious banks .
" we in germany tend to differentiate between the real economy and the financial economy , " said wolfram vom fritsch of the hanover trade fair .
" and most of our exhibitors see the problems in the financial economy , and see the problems in financing their orders , they say they 're struggling to finance good orders .
so we all look forward to more regulation in the financial sector , and we all look forward to more readily available liquid assets . "
wolfram vom fritsch admitted that the economic climate for the 2009 hanover trade fair has been anything but rosy , but he thinks the event has helped the industrial sector to fight back in the face of recession .
" i think cebit and the hannover trade fair have shown that they are more than just fairs , they are a marketplace - as we call it - where you can interchange between politics , science and industry . "
this interchange was arguably more important in 2009 than ever before in the fair 's 62-year history .

more than 6,000 firms from around the world were on hand , looking for new deals and a much needed boost to their balance sheets .
the traditional staple of the hanover trade fair - the machine tool trade - was still the best represented sector on hand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trade fair boss wolfram vom fritsch has had a difficult year however , the fair also focused on emerging industrial issues like energy efficiency , renewable energy sources and automated technology , with a message that these potentially cost-cutting endeavours could prove the best way to fight recession .
" if the situation is difficult you have to look to the costs , you have to look to your customers , and you have to look to the future , " wolfram vom fritsch , the chief executive of the hannover trade fair , told deutsche welle .
" because , once the crisis is over , the companies that will be successful are those that are right into the issues of the future , and we are sure that energy is one of those issues .
it 's an issue that can bring you a short-term return on investments and it 's an issue with a long-term impact . "
saving energy , and money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the energy harvester lets factories say bye bye to batteries production efficiency is a growing concern in the industrial sector .
as firms look to cut costs without slashing jobs , cutting down on overheads like electricity usage is becoming ever more important .
the british firm perpetuum showcased one example of innovative energy-saving technology .
it 's called an ' energy harvester ' , and it generates electricity from the vibrations of its surroundings to power battery-powered devices .
" i think the first benefit is you no longer have to change batteries , " said chief engineer john parker .
" if you have 5,000 censors on your industrial plant , and your average battery life is two or three years , you will be changing 10 batteries per day .
with our device you no longer have to do that , secondly it uses waste energy , so it recovers the energy from the motor , and thirdly , you no longer have to dispose of batteries which have nasty chemicals inside them . "
even the major players like siemens , volkswagen and phoenix concentrated on their energy saving credentials at the fair .
volkswagen brought only its fuel-efficient ' blue motion ' range of cars to hanover .
" fuel efficiency definitely is one of our top priorities , if not the top priority , " said juergen leohold , the head of corporate research for the volkswagen group .
" we contribute to the prevention of climate change , and we help our customers save on fuel , which gives them a financial advantage , too . "
planning for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the robotic soccer world championships do n't have a recession to tackle rather like the major communication and information technology trade fair cebit , also based in hanover , the 2009 trade fair put a great emphasis on the importance of futuristic technology .
while businesses are struggling at the moment , they are still looking for ways to emerge from this recession one step ahead of their competition .
automated technology and robotics featured heavily at the fair .
robotic science was even showcased through the german round of the autonomous robot soccer world cup , where teams of robots battle it out on the football pitch .
the standard of play may not make this sport worthy of the nickname ' the beautiful game ' , at least not yet , but it 's still an astounding sight .
however , the robots of real interest to the more serious trade fair goers performed more modest tasks .
some can transport stocks around warehouses without a driver , others are designed to lead customers to certain products in stores , eliminating the need for a shop assistant to do so , while a few are designed to perform simple production line tasks in factories .
the political trade fair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with south korean prime minister han seung-soo on opening day german chancellor angela merkel , the prime minister of partner nation south korea han seung-soo , and german president horst koehler are just a few of the high profile politicans who attended this year 's fair .
the financial crisis has turned the world of business into one of the most important political playgrounds , especially here in germany with a general election looming in september .
while exhibitors in hanover touted their wares , the german parliament convened in berlin to debate how to best tackle the deepening recession .
politicians discussed whether a third stimulus package was necessary to keep the german economy going , but exhibitors in hanover and the event organizers felt that they did n't need a government handout , rather they needed easier access to credit from cautious banks .
" we in germany tend to differentiate between the real economy and the financial economy , " said wolfram vom fritsch of the hanover trade fair .
" and most of our exhibitors see the problems in the financial economy , and see the problems in financing their orders , they say they 're struggling to finance good orders .
so we all look forward to more regulation in the financial sector , and we all look forward to more readily available liquid assets . "
wolfram vom fritsch admitted that the economic climate for the 2009 hanover trade fair has been anything but rosy , but he thinks the event has helped the industrial sector to fight back in the face of recession .
" i think cebit and the hannover trade fair have shown that they are more than just fairs , they are a marketplace - as we call it - where you can interchange between politics , science and industry . "
this interchange was arguably more important in 2009 than ever before in the fair 's 62-year history .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de formula one -pipe- 24.04.2009 former f1 star enjoying 2009 's " big shake up " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinz-harald frentzen is pleased to see an upside-down f1 grid this year sebastian vettel is getting better and better , and he 's in a car designed by perhaps the best aerodynamic engineer in formula one .
that 's the verdict of former f1 ace heinz-harald frentzen . it 's been a year of surprises and shake-ups in the world of formula one racing .
a team that looked on the verge of extinction a couple of months ago has a commanding lead in the formula one championship after three grands prix .
brawn gp have gone from rank outsiders to hot favorites in what seems like the blink of an eye .
red bull and toyota - both of whom have been also-rans throughout their histories in the sport - are the closest competition for the former honda works team .
the only traditionally big name anywhere near the top is mclaren mercedes .
world champion lewis hamilton 's team are currently fourth in the constructor 's championship , but their future is in serious doubt due to off-track controversy .
meanwhile , ferrari , f1 's top team in eight of the last ten seasons , are dead last in the championship with no points from three races .
formula one has been turned on its head this season , and germany 's former f1 superstar heinz-harald frentzen told deutsche welle that he thinks it 's a breath of fresh air .
" it 's mixed up formula one completely , " frentzen says .
" i mean , before the season started , could you imagine the top teams spending a lot of money and effort and finding themselves in the midfield ?
no one expected that ! "
initial testing results for the fourth race of the season in bahrain this weekend do n't suggest that normality is going to be restored just yet , if at all .
surprising , but not inexplicable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brawn gp and other ' underdogs ' are dominating f1 however , while frentzen said this new order in formula one is unexpected , he also pointed to rules , a hard fought 2008 season , and the introduction of new technoloiges as explanations for this surprising turn of events .
" there has been a big modification from one year to the other , in terms of regulations , chassis layout and with the introduction of kers -lrb- kinetic energy recovery system -rrb- .
everything 's been mixed up , " he says .
he said the last time there was a similar comprehensive change was between 1997 and 1998 .
" just like it was back then , the teams who made the best decisions and found the best strategy for the new regulations over the winter have earned the glory , " he said .
little wonder frentzen is so conscious of how rule changes can affect f1 .
he was one of the losers after the rule changes a decade ago .
then driving for williams , frentzen watched his team morph from the quickest in the sport into a relatively mediocre outfit in a matter of months .
it was during this same shakeup that mclaren and ferrari re-established themselves as major players in the sport , a position neither team ever really relinquished , until this year , perhaps .
getting better and better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel has won both his races in wet conditions one major winner in the new-look f1 is sebastian vettel .
the 21-year-old german won round three of the season in china from pole position , taking the second race win of his fledgling career .
in friday testing in bahrain , his red bull car looked quick again and the young german is optimistic about the season .
" i do n't want to talk about the title , but we have the potential to drive for victory in the next races , " vettel told reporters trackside in bahrain .
frentzen - who was 29 years old when he won his first grand prix with williams - is impressed that vettel has grabbed two wins so early in his career .
" i am a big fan of vettel because he developed himself steadily , starting in the sport at a very young age , " he says .
" but now , he 's already a very experienced driver .
he still makes some mistakes , but what really impresses me is that he is able to improve the development of his car , to help the mechanics make his car faster .
he 's getting better and better and better . "
the newey factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrian newey 's latest f1 masterpiece may be the 2009 red bull however , frentzen says that there 's more to red bull 's success than the talented young german behind the wheel .
adrian newey , red bull 's chief technical officer and designer , is a legend in formula one circles .
he has designed a slew of blisteringly quick f1 cars for williams and then mclaren mercedes over the years .
" i have also driven an adrian newey car in 1997 , " frentzen points out .
" for me , when i was closely involved in f1 , he was the best aerodynamic engineer in the sport , and the cars he built were always fantastic . "
" and remember that if vettel had n't won that race -lsb- in china -rsb- , then his teammate mark webber would have won instead .
also , rookie sebastien buemi was up there fighting with double world champion fernando alonso , also in an adrian newey car .
so i have to give the credit to the team as well , they 've built a fantstic car this season . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frentzen knows first hand that an adrian newey car is usually a fast car f1 's drastic rule changes meant that designers could n't simply improve on the foundation of their 2008 models in 2009 .
innovation was the order of the day , as design teams all along the pitlane went back to the drawing board .
taking this into account , the success of red bull with adrian newey 's involvement , and of championship leaders brawn gp with a car developed by ross brawn , the mastermind of michael schumacher 's dominant years with benetton and ferrari , seems a little less shocking .
however , these relatively small teams may yet struggle to maintain their early season advantage .
there are bigger , richer outfits working round the clock to close the gap on formula one 's unlikely front-runners .

but the countries failed to make headway on climate change negotiations . saving the world 's biodiversity and agreeing on a way forward on climate change negotiations had topped the agenda at the three-day international environment meeting in syracuse , italy .
but ministers attending were only able to tick one of those boxes .
an elusive global warming pact still looks unlikely anytime before a un climate change conference in copenhagen in december , when it is hoped a global strategy for the post-kyoto protocol era can be laid down .
g8 industrial countries and major developing economies meeting on the island of sicily signed a charter pledging to tackle deforestation , curb illegal trade in wildlife and boost research into the rate of species loss .
extinction rates are currently running at around 1,000 times their natural pace , with three species vanishing every hour , according to un statistics .
time running out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim steiner was unconvinced leaving the syracuse meeting " we set objectives on biodiversity for 2010 ... but unfortunately we have all recognized they have not been met , " said italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo , who hosted the summit .
" we are all convinced of the urgency ... of intervening to safeguard our biodiversity , " she said .
the head of the un environment program , achim steiner , said several significant hurdles still needed ironing out .
these included setting targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and financing the greening of developing countries .
key nations , he said , are coming to the realization that time is running out ahead of the un talks in copenhagen .
" i leave syracuse very much concerned that there is no clear pathway to resolving the gaps that remain , " he said . details please kim carstensen , director of the world wide fund for nature ’ s global climate initiative , said after the meeting that the charter on curbing biodiversity loss sends out a clear message on the importance of biodiversity , but was lacking in details .

" but in terms of actual implementation , it 's not at all at the level of an action plan , or funded , which would also be nice .
and which would be needed as a next step going forward .
he remarked that ministers ’ agreement that action to move toward a low carbon economy was needed now rather than later could be an important signal for the coming talks in copenhagen .
differences of opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developed and emerging economies will both need to come to the table the g8 grouping of rich nations , along with emerging economies such as china , brazil and india , agreed at the meeting that climate change and species extinction were linked , and emphasized the economic value of preserving biodiversity .
but the game of chicken between industrialized and developing nations over who should foot the bill for plans to mitigate or even reverse climate change looks unlikely to end .
carstensen said big differences remained on financing technological improvements and meeting targeted emissions cuts .
" we need countries like japan , canada , russia and the us to come out and say what exactly is it that we want to contribute , " he said .
" we need to see a stronger and more articulated political will on the side of developed countries to move this really forward . "
reimund schwarze , head of climate change policy at the helmholtz center for environmental research in leipzig , germany , said emerging economies like china will have to make sacrifices too .
" china not only has to move ahead , it has to accept the fact that in the very long run they will be in the role of giving financial aid to other countries , " he said .
the leaders of 16 major economies are due to meet in washington on monday for further talks aimed at generating political leadership for the end-of-year un climate change meeting in denmark .
environmentalists will hope , by then , that both developed and developing countries will be ready to back up their intentions with concrete actions .

but the game of chicken between industrialized and developing nations over who should foot the bill for plans to mitigate or even reverse climate change looks unlikely to end .
carstensen said big differences remained on financing technological improvements and meeting targeted emissions cuts .
" we need countries like japan , canada , russia and the us to come out and say what exactly is it that we want to contribute , " he said .
" we need to see a stronger and more articulated political will on the side of developed countries to move this really forward . "
reimund schwarze , head of climate change policy at the helmholtz center for environmental research in leipzig , germany , said emerging economies like china will have to make sacrifices too .
" china not only has to move ahead , it has to accept the fact that in the very long run they will be in the role of giving financial aid to other countries , " he said .
the leaders of 16 major economies are due to meet in washington on monday for further talks aimed at generating political leadership for the end-of-year un climate change meeting in denmark .
environmentalists will hope , by then , that both developed and developing countries will be ready to back up their intentions with concrete actions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 24.04.2009 g8-plus environment meeting ends with biodiversity pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a charter was signed pledging to tackle deforestation and illegal wildlife trade environment ministers from the g8 industrialized nations and developing economies sealed a deal friday to slow species loss around the world .
but the countries failed to make headway on climate change negotiations . saving the world 's biodiversity and agreeing on a way forward on climate change negotiations had topped the agenda at the three-day international environment meeting in syracuse , italy .
but ministers attending were only able to tick one of those boxes .
an elusive global warming pact still looks unlikely anytime before a un climate change conference in copenhagen in december , when it is hoped a global strategy for the post-kyoto protocol era can be laid down .
g8 industrial countries and major developing economies meeting on the island of sicily signed a charter pledging to tackle deforestation , curb illegal trade in wildlife and boost research into the rate of species loss .
extinction rates are currently running at around 1,000 times their natural pace , with three species vanishing every hour , according to un statistics .
time running out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim steiner was unconvinced leaving the syracuse meeting " we set objectives on biodiversity for 2010 ... but unfortunately we have all recognized they have not been met , " said italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo , who hosted the summit .
" we are all convinced of the urgency ... of intervening to safeguard our biodiversity , " she said .
the head of the un environment program , achim steiner , said several significant hurdles still needed ironing out .
these included setting targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and financing the greening of developing countries .
key nations , he said , are coming to the realization that time is running out ahead of the un talks in copenhagen .
" i leave syracuse very much concerned that there is no clear pathway to resolving the gaps that remain , " he said . details please kim carstensen , director of the world wide fund for nature ’ s global climate initiative , said after the meeting that the charter on curbing biodiversity loss sends out a clear message on the importance of biodiversity , but was lacking in details .
" it 's a political signal of a will that is higher than i think we 've seen before at this level , and that i think is positive , " he said .
" but in terms of actual implementation , it 's not at all at the level of an action plan , or funded , which would also be nice .
and which would be needed as a next step going forward .
he remarked that ministers ’ agreement that action to move toward a low carbon economy was needed now rather than later could be an important signal for the coming talks in copenhagen .
differences of opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developed and emerging economies will both need to come to the table the g8 grouping of rich nations , along with emerging economies such as china , brazil and india , agreed at the meeting that climate change and species extinction were linked , and emphasized the economic value of preserving biodiversity .
but the game of chicken between industrialized and developing nations over who should foot the bill for plans to mitigate or even reverse climate change looks unlikely to end .
carstensen said big differences remained on financing technological improvements and meeting targeted emissions cuts .
" we need countries like japan , canada , russia and the us to come out and say what exactly is it that we want to contribute , " he said .
" we need to see a stronger and more articulated political will on the side of developed countries to move this really forward . "
reimund schwarze , head of climate change policy at the helmholtz center for environmental research in leipzig , germany , said emerging economies like china will have to make sacrifices too .
" china not only has to move ahead , it has to accept the fact that in the very long run they will be in the role of giving financial aid to other countries , " he said .
the leaders of 16 major economies are due to meet in washington on monday for further talks aimed at generating political leadership for the end-of-year un climate change meeting in denmark .
environmentalists will hope , by then , that both developed and developing countries will be ready to back up their intentions with concrete actions .

but ministers attending were only able to tick one of those boxes .
an elusive global warming pact still looks unlikely anytime before a un climate change conference in copenhagen in december , when it is hoped a global strategy for the post-kyoto protocol era can be laid down .
g8 industrial countries and major developing economies meeting on the island of sicily signed a charter pledging to tackle deforestation , curb illegal trade in wildlife and boost research into the rate of species loss .
extinction rates are currently running at around 1,000 times their natural pace , with three species vanishing every hour , according to un statistics .
time running out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim steiner was unconvinced leaving the syracuse meeting " we set objectives on biodiversity for 2010 ... but unfortunately we have all recognized they have not been met , " said italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo , who hosted the summit .
" we are all convinced of the urgency ... of intervening to safeguard our biodiversity , " she said .
the head of the un environment program , achim steiner , said several significant hurdles still needed ironing out .
these included setting targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and financing the greening of developing countries .
key nations , he said , are coming to the realization that time is running out ahead of the un talks in copenhagen .
" i leave syracuse very much concerned that there is no clear pathway to resolving the gaps that remain , " he said . details please kim carstensen , director of the world wide fund for nature ’ s global climate initiative , said after the meeting that the charter on curbing biodiversity loss sends out a clear message on the importance of biodiversity , but was lacking in details .
" it 's a political signal of a will that is higher than i think we 've seen before at this level , and that i think is positive , " he said .
" but in terms of actual implementation , it 's not at all at the level of an action plan , or funded , which would also be nice .
and which would be needed as a next step going forward .
he remarked that ministers ’ agreement that action to move toward a low carbon economy was needed now rather than later could be an important signal for the coming talks in copenhagen .
differences of opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developed and emerging economies will both need to come to the table the g8 grouping of rich nations , along with emerging economies such as china , brazil and india , agreed at the meeting that climate change and species extinction were linked , and emphasized the economic value of preserving biodiversity .
but the game of chicken between industrialized and developing nations over who should foot the bill for plans to mitigate or even reverse climate change looks unlikely to end .
carstensen said big differences remained on financing technological improvements and meeting targeted emissions cuts .
" we need countries like japan , canada , russia and the us to come out and say what exactly is it that we want to contribute , " he said .
" we need to see a stronger and more articulated political will on the side of developed countries to move this really forward . "
reimund schwarze , head of climate change policy at the helmholtz center for environmental research in leipzig , germany , said emerging economies like china will have to make sacrifices too .
" china not only has to move ahead , it has to accept the fact that in the very long run they will be in the role of giving financial aid to other countries , " he said .
the leaders of 16 major economies are due to meet in washington on monday for further talks aimed at generating political leadership for the end-of-year un climate change meeting in denmark .
environmentalists will hope , by then , that both developed and developing countries will be ready to back up their intentions with concrete actions .

that 's the verdict of former f1 ace heinz-harald frentzen . it 's been a year of surprises and shake-ups in the world of formula one racing .
a team that looked on the verge of extinction a couple of months ago has a commanding lead in the formula one championship after three grands prix .
brawn gp have gone from rank outsiders to hot favorites in what seems like the blink of an eye .
red bull and toyota - both of whom have been also-rans throughout their histories in the sport - are the closest competition for the former honda works team .
the only traditionally big name anywhere near the top is mclaren mercedes .
world champion lewis hamilton 's team are currently fourth in the constructor 's championship , but their future is in serious doubt due to off-track controversy .
meanwhile , ferrari , f1 's top team in eight of the last ten seasons , are dead last in the championship with no points from three races .
formula one has been turned on its head this season , and germany 's former f1 superstar heinz-harald frentzen told deutsche welle that he thinks it 's a breath of fresh air .
" it 's mixed up formula one completely , " frentzen says .
" i mean , before the season started , could you imagine the top teams spending a lot of money and effort and finding themselves in the midfield ?
no one expected that ! "
initial testing results for the fourth race of the season in bahrain this weekend do n't suggest that normality is going to be restored just yet , if at all .
surprising , but not inexplicable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brawn gp and other ' underdogs ' are dominating f1 however , while frentzen said this new order in formula one is unexpected , he also pointed to rules , a hard fought 2008 season , and the introduction of new technoloiges as explanations for this surprising turn of events .
" there has been a big modification from one year to the other , in terms of regulations , chassis layout and with the introduction of kers -lrb- kinetic energy recovery system -rrb- .
everything 's been mixed up , " he says .
he said the last time there was a similar comprehensive change was between 1997 and 1998 .
" just like it was back then , the teams who made the best decisions and found the best strategy for the new regulations over the winter have earned the glory , " he said .
little wonder frentzen is so conscious of how rule changes can affect f1 .
he was one of the losers after the rule changes a decade ago .
then driving for williams , frentzen watched his team morph from the quickest in the sport into a relatively mediocre outfit in a matter of months .
it was during this same shakeup that mclaren and ferrari re-established themselves as major players in the sport , a position neither team ever really relinquished , until this year , perhaps .
getting better and better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel has won both his races in wet conditions one major winner in the new-look f1 is sebastian vettel .
the 21-year-old german won round three of the season in china from pole position , taking the second race win of his fledgling career .
in friday testing in bahrain , his red bull car looked quick again and the young german is optimistic about the season .
" i do n't want to talk about the title , but we have the potential to drive for victory in the next races , " vettel told reporters trackside in bahrain .
frentzen - who was 29 years old when he won his first grand prix with williams - is impressed that vettel has grabbed two wins so early in his career .
" i am a big fan of vettel because he developed himself steadily , starting in the sport at a very young age , " he says .
" but now , he 's already a very experienced driver .
he still makes some mistakes , but what really impresses me is that he is able to improve the development of his car , to help the mechanics make his car faster .
he 's getting better and better and better . "
the newey factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrian newey 's latest f1 masterpiece may be the 2009 red bull however , frentzen says that there 's more to red bull 's success than the talented young german behind the wheel .
adrian newey , red bull 's chief technical officer and designer , is a legend in formula one circles .
he has designed a slew of blisteringly quick f1 cars for williams and then mclaren mercedes over the years .
" i have also driven an adrian newey car in 1997 , " frentzen points out .
" for me , when i was closely involved in f1 , he was the best aerodynamic engineer in the sport , and the cars he built were always fantastic . "
" and remember that if vettel had n't won that race -lsb- in china -rsb- , then his teammate mark webber would have won instead .
also , rookie sebastien buemi was up there fighting with double world champion fernando alonso , also in an adrian newey car .
so i have to give the credit to the team as well , they 've built a fantstic car this season . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frentzen knows first hand that an adrian newey car is usually a fast car f1 's drastic rule changes meant that designers could n't simply improve on the foundation of their 2008 models in 2009 .
innovation was the order of the day , as design teams all along the pitlane went back to the drawing board .
taking this into account , the success of red bull with adrian newey 's involvement , and of championship leaders brawn gp with a car developed by ross brawn , the mastermind of michael schumacher 's dominant years with benetton and ferrari , seems a little less shocking .
however , these relatively small teams may yet struggle to maintain their early season advantage .
there are bigger , richer outfits working round the clock to close the gap on formula one 's unlikely front-runners .

that 's the verdict of former f1 ace heinz-harald frentzen . it 's been a year of surprises and shake-ups in the world of formula one racing .
a team that looked on the verge of extinction a couple of months ago has a commanding lead in the formula one championship after three grands prix .
brawn gp have gone from rank outsiders to hot favorites in what seems like the blink of an eye .
red bull and toyota - both of whom have been also-rans throughout their histories in the sport - are the closest competition for the former honda works team .
the only traditionally big name anywhere near the top is mclaren mercedes .
world champion lewis hamilton 's team are currently fourth in the constructor 's championship , but their future is in serious doubt due to off-track controversy .
meanwhile , ferrari , f1 's top team in eight of the last ten seasons , are dead last in the championship with no points from three races .
formula one has been turned on its head this season , and germany 's former f1 superstar heinz-harald frentzen told deutsche welle that he thinks it 's a breath of fresh air .
" it 's mixed up formula one completely , " frentzen says .
" i mean , before the season started , could you imagine the top teams spending a lot of money and effort and finding themselves in the midfield ?
no one expected that ! "
initial testing results for the fourth race of the season in bahrain this weekend do n't suggest that normality is going to be restored just yet , if at all .
surprising , but not inexplicable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brawn gp and other ' underdogs ' are dominating f1 however , while frentzen said this new order in formula one is unexpected , he also pointed to rules , a hard fought 2008 season , and the introduction of new technoloiges as explanations for this surprising turn of events .
" there has been a big modification from one year to the other , in terms of regulations , chassis layout and with the introduction of kers -lrb- kinetic energy recovery system -rrb- .
everything 's been mixed up , " he says .
he said the last time there was a similar comprehensive change was between 1997 and 1998 .
" just like it was back then , the teams who made the best decisions and found the best strategy for the new regulations over the winter have earned the glory , " he said .
little wonder frentzen is so conscious of how rule changes can affect f1 .
he was one of the losers after the rule changes a decade ago .
then driving for williams , frentzen watched his team morph from the quickest in the sport into a relatively mediocre outfit in a matter of months .
it was during this same shakeup that mclaren and ferrari re-established themselves as major players in the sport , a position neither team ever really relinquished , until this year , perhaps .
getting better and better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel has won both his races in wet conditions one major winner in the new-look f1 is sebastian vettel .
the 21-year-old german won round three of the season in china from pole position , taking the second race win of his fledgling career .
in friday testing in bahrain , his red bull car looked quick again and the young german is optimistic about the season .
" i do n't want to talk about the title , but we have the potential to drive for victory in the next races , " vettel told reporters trackside in bahrain .
frentzen - who was 29 years old when he won his first grand prix with williams - is impressed that vettel has grabbed two wins so early in his career .
" i am a big fan of vettel because he developed himself steadily , starting in the sport at a very young age , " he says .
" but now , he 's already a very experienced driver .
he still makes some mistakes , but what really impresses me is that he is able to improve the development of his car , to help the mechanics make his car faster .
he 's getting better and better and better . "
the newey factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrian newey 's latest f1 masterpiece may be the 2009 red bull however , frentzen says that there 's more to red bull 's success than the talented young german behind the wheel .
adrian newey , red bull 's chief technical officer and designer , is a legend in formula one circles .
he has designed a slew of blisteringly quick f1 cars for williams and then mclaren mercedes over the years .
" i have also driven an adrian newey car in 1997 , " frentzen points out .
" for me , when i was closely involved in f1 , he was the best aerodynamic engineer in the sport , and the cars he built were always fantastic . "
" and remember that if vettel had n't won that race -lsb- in china -rsb- , then his teammate mark webber would have won instead .
also , rookie sebastien buemi was up there fighting with double world champion fernando alonso , also in an adrian newey car .
so i have to give the credit to the team as well , they 've built a fantstic car this season . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frentzen knows first hand that an adrian newey car is usually a fast car f1 's drastic rule changes meant that designers could n't simply improve on the foundation of their 2008 models in 2009 .
innovation was the order of the day , as design teams all along the pitlane went back to the drawing board .
taking this into account , the success of red bull with adrian newey 's involvement , and of championship leaders brawn gp with a car developed by ross brawn , the mastermind of michael schumacher 's dominant years with benetton and ferrari , seems a little less shocking .
however , these relatively small teams may yet struggle to maintain their early season advantage .
there are bigger , richer outfits working round the clock to close the gap on formula one 's unlikely front-runners .

formula one has been turned on its head this season , and germany 's former f1 superstar heinz-harald frentzen told deutsche welle that he thinks it 's a breath of fresh air .
" it 's mixed up formula one completely , " frentzen says .
" i mean , before the season started , could you imagine the top teams spending a lot of money and effort and finding themselves in the midfield ?
no one expected that ! "
initial testing results for the fourth race of the season in bahrain this weekend do n't suggest that normality is going to be restored just yet , if at all .
surprising , but not inexplicable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brawn gp and other ' underdogs ' are dominating f1 however , while frentzen said this new order in formula one is unexpected , he also pointed to rules , a hard fought 2008 season , and the introduction of new technoloiges as explanations for this surprising turn of events .
" there has been a big modification from one year to the other , in terms of regulations , chassis layout and with the introduction of kers -lrb- kinetic energy recovery system -rrb- .
everything 's been mixed up , " he says .
he said the last time there was a similar comprehensive change was between 1997 and 1998 .
" just like it was back then , the teams who made the best decisions and found the best strategy for the new regulations over the winter have earned the glory , " he said .
little wonder frentzen is so conscious of how rule changes can affect f1 .
he was one of the losers after the rule changes a decade ago .
then driving for williams , frentzen watched his team morph from the quickest in the sport into a relatively mediocre outfit in a matter of months .
it was during this same shakeup that mclaren and ferrari re-established themselves as major players in the sport , a position neither team ever really relinquished , until this year , perhaps .
getting better and better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel has won both his races in wet conditions one major winner in the new-look f1 is sebastian vettel .
the 21-year-old german won round three of the season in china from pole position , taking the second race win of his fledgling career .
in friday testing in bahrain , his red bull car looked quick again and the young german is optimistic about the season .
" i do n't want to talk about the title , but we have the potential to drive for victory in the next races , " vettel told reporters trackside in bahrain .
frentzen - who was 29 years old when he won his first grand prix with williams - is impressed that vettel has grabbed two wins so early in his career .
" i am a big fan of vettel because he developed himself steadily , starting in the sport at a very young age , " he says .
" but now , he 's already a very experienced driver .
he still makes some mistakes , but what really impresses me is that he is able to improve the development of his car , to help the mechanics make his car faster .
he 's getting better and better and better . "
the newey factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrian newey 's latest f1 masterpiece may be the 2009 red bull however , frentzen says that there 's more to red bull 's success than the talented young german behind the wheel .
adrian newey , red bull 's chief technical officer and designer , is a legend in formula one circles .
he has designed a slew of blisteringly quick f1 cars for williams and then mclaren mercedes over the years .
" i have also driven an adrian newey car in 1997 , " frentzen points out .
" for me , when i was closely involved in f1 , he was the best aerodynamic engineer in the sport , and the cars he built were always fantastic . "
" and remember that if vettel had n't won that race -lsb- in china -rsb- , then his teammate mark webber would have won instead .
also , rookie sebastien buemi was up there fighting with double world champion fernando alonso , also in an adrian newey car .
so i have to give the credit to the team as well , they 've built a fantstic car this season . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frentzen knows first hand that an adrian newey car is usually a fast car f1 's drastic rule changes meant that designers could n't simply improve on the foundation of their 2008 models in 2009 .
innovation was the order of the day , as design teams all along the pitlane went back to the drawing board .
taking this into account , the success of red bull with adrian newey 's involvement , and of championship leaders brawn gp with a car developed by ross brawn , the mastermind of michael schumacher 's dominant years with benetton and ferrari , seems a little less shocking .
however , these relatively small teams may yet struggle to maintain their early season advantage .
there are bigger , richer outfits working round the clock to close the gap on formula one 's unlikely front-runners .

a former chairman of the social democrats suggested on public radio that german workers , just like their french counterparts , should kidnap their boss if they 're worried about their future . the leader of germany ’ s left party has urged german workers to copy the example of disgruntled french counterparts and kidnap their bosses .
several managers in france who announced restructuring measures to deal with the economic crisis have been detained in factories in recent weeks by employees who fear losing their jobs .
managers from companies in france , including molex , sony , 3m and hewlett-packard , have all reported " bossnapping " incidents .
" when the government continues to do nothing , there is increasing danger that the far-right will gain in strength , " warned oskar lafontaine on public radio wdr .
the left party has also been calling for national strikes to be legalized again .
despite these warnings , experts see there is little risk of serious social unrest and mass protests breaking out in europe 's biggest economy .
the left party was established two years ago and is made up largely of former east german communists and disaffected social democrats , including its former chairman oskar lafontaine .
he quit former chancellor gerhard schroeder 's cabinet because he found its policies too centrist .
unexpected support from presidential candidate lafontaine 's " bossnapping " suggestions have received unexpected support from the social democrat presidential candidate gesine schwan who " warned of growing anger throughout the country . "
she was immediately sharply criticized from within her own party for scaremongering and spreading excessive pessimism .
" the economy is doing badly , but we are a long way from social unrest , " warned spd colleague , dieter wiefelspuetz .
" it does n't do anyone any good to be talking about unrest erupting here or in france or anywhere else , " said peter struck , the head of the bundestag faction of the social democrats .
" that is undermining efforts by the federal government which is doing everything possible to help make it easier for people to get through the crisis . "
german chancellor angela merkel said at a meeting of senior christian democrat party officials that she does not share the concerns that social unrest will break out .

a former chairman of the social democrats suggested on public radio that german workers , just like their french counterparts , should kidnap their boss if they 're worried about their future . the leader of germany ’ s left party has urged german workers to copy the example of disgruntled french counterparts and kidnap their bosses .
several managers in france who announced restructuring measures to deal with the economic crisis have been detained in factories in recent weeks by employees who fear losing their jobs .
managers from companies in france , including molex , sony , 3m and hewlett-packard , have all reported " bossnapping " incidents .
" when the government continues to do nothing , there is increasing danger that the far-right will gain in strength , " warned oskar lafontaine on public radio wdr .
the left party has also been calling for national strikes to be legalized again .
despite these warnings , experts see there is little risk of serious social unrest and mass protests breaking out in europe 's biggest economy .
the left party was established two years ago and is made up largely of former east german communists and disaffected social democrats , including its former chairman oskar lafontaine .
he quit former chancellor gerhard schroeder 's cabinet because he found its policies too centrist .
unexpected support from presidential candidate lafontaine 's " bossnapping " suggestions have received unexpected support from the social democrat presidential candidate gesine schwan who " warned of growing anger throughout the country . "
she was immediately sharply criticized from within her own party for scaremongering and spreading excessive pessimism .
" the economy is doing badly , but we are a long way from social unrest , " warned spd colleague , dieter wiefelspuetz .
" it does n't do anyone any good to be talking about unrest erupting here or in france or anywhere else , " said peter struck , the head of the bundestag faction of the social democrats .
" that is undermining efforts by the federal government which is doing everything possible to help make it easier for people to get through the crisis . "
german chancellor angela merkel said at a meeting of senior christian democrat party officials that she does not share the concerns that social unrest will break out .

berlin would ask the shareholders at a meeting on june 2 to vote for an increase in equity from just under 700 million euros -lrb- $ 925 million -rrb- at present to 6.3 billion euros , with the german state pumping in all the new funds .
the equity issue would sharply dilute the stakes of the existing shareholders , leaving them with less than a 10th of voting stock .
the new equity would be held by soffin , the government agency charged with helping german banks via guarantees and equity infusions .
soffin disclosed earlier in frankfurt that a government takeover offer for hre of 1.39 euros per share had made little progress .
merck finck analyst konrad becker told news agency afp the weak response by investors so far was not surpising , because " people often wait until the very last day before deciding to sell in hopes the purchaser will raise the offer . "
only 1.28 percent of shares had been acquired as of thursday afternoon , soffin said .
that brought berlin 's present stake to 9.94 percent .
the move could come at his expense of us investor jc flowers , who heads a consortium owning almost 24 percent of shares in hre .
so far , he has been dismissive towards the bid .
" accept bid " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are real fears hre could go the way of lehman brothers but the hre supervisory and executive boards advised shareholders friday to accept the takeover bid for their shares .

hre stock rose 1.4 percent in stock-market trading friday to 1.41 euros .
last month , germany legislated compulsory purchase powers in case the shareholders did not accept the bid .
chancellor angela merkel 's government is concerned that a collapse of hre could lead to the sort of financial market chaos that followed the failure of us investment bank lehman brothers in september last year .
hre 's problems arose at its depfa bank unit , which operated from largely deregulated dublin .

" the time is right for a new beginning on nuclear disarmament , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said , referring to an agreement earlier this month between us president barack obama and his russian counterpart , dimitry medvedev , aimed at negotiating a new deal on strategic nuclear arms reduction .
in the debate , the german foreign minister outlined steps which he said were crucial for reaching the goal of a nuclear-free world .
he said us-russian talks on a follow-up to the strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start 1 -rrb- , due to expire in december , must be successfully completed .
in addition , iran and north korea - two countries thought to be on the threshold of becoming nuclear powers - must be convinced to enter talks on their nuclear programs as proposed by the us president .
other efforts must be made on reducing the number of short- and medium-range nuclear weapons and to unfreeze negotiations on conventional arms reduction .
scrap nukes in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner hoyer -lrb- fdp -rrb- wants to rid germany of nuclear weapons in separate motions , germany ’ s opposition parties - the environmentalist greens , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the left party - called on the government to press for the removal of american tactical nuclear weapons based on german soil .
the weapons are a remnant of the cold war , although details about their number and location are not known .
" it ’ s a myth that the scrapping of these weapons would go along with a loss of security for germany and reduced influence in decision-making at nato , " the fdp ’ s foreign policy expert werner hoyer said in reference to the government ’ s stance that the weapons are important .
gregor gysi , the parliamentary leader of the left party , also urged chancellor angela merkel to abandon her policy of participation in nato ’ s nuclear strategy .
under nato policy , non-nuclear alliance members must provide troops and technical assistance in the event of a nuclear strike .
greece and canada have already opted out of this strategy .
gysi said germany should become the third nato country to do so .
" the idea that a departure from this policy would diminish german influence in nato is cold war thinking , " he added .
cool response by the government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel rejects calls for us nuclear weapons to be withdrawn from german soil eckart von klaeden , foreign policy expert of chancellor merkel 's conservative cdu , expressed skepticism about the demands .
" unfortunately we ’ ve seen a rapid increase in the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the world , " he said .
stressing that iran was on the verge of becoming a nuclear power , and that india and pakistan are eager to upgrade their nuclear weapons technology , he said that the tactical nuclear arms based in germany were an important part of nato ’ s policy of nuclear deterrence .
" president obama himself has stressed , " he concluded , " that his drive towards disarmament must go hand in hand with maintaining security for his country and that of its nato partners . "
the social democratic-conservative coalition government used its large majority to turn down the motions put foward by the opposition .
a nuclear-free germany can only be part of nato ’ s disarmament inititative , they said , and not the start of it . uh / pfd / jam , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the time is right for a new beginning on nuclear disarmament , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said , referring to an agreement earlier this month between us president barack obama and his russian counterpart , dimitry medvedev , aimed at negotiating a new deal on strategic nuclear arms reduction .
in the debate , the german foreign minister outlined steps which he said were crucial for reaching the goal of a nuclear-free world .
he said us-russian talks on a follow-up to the strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start 1 -rrb- , due to expire in december , must be successfully completed .
in addition , iran and north korea - two countries thought to be on the threshold of becoming nuclear powers - must be convinced to enter talks on their nuclear programs as proposed by the us president .
other efforts must be made on reducing the number of short- and medium-range nuclear weapons and to unfreeze negotiations on conventional arms reduction .
scrap nukes in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner hoyer -lrb- fdp -rrb- wants to rid germany of nuclear weapons in separate motions , germany ’ s opposition parties - the environmentalist greens , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the left party - called on the government to press for the removal of american tactical nuclear weapons based on german soil .
the weapons are a remnant of the cold war , although details about their number and location are not known .
" it ’ s a myth that the scrapping of these weapons would go along with a loss of security for germany and reduced influence in decision-making at nato , " the fdp ’ s foreign policy expert werner hoyer said in reference to the government ’ s stance that the weapons are important .
gregor gysi , the parliamentary leader of the left party , also urged chancellor angela merkel to abandon her policy of participation in nato ’ s nuclear strategy .
under nato policy , non-nuclear alliance members must provide troops and technical assistance in the event of a nuclear strike .
greece and canada have already opted out of this strategy .
gysi said germany should become the third nato country to do so .
" the idea that a departure from this policy would diminish german influence in nato is cold war thinking , " he added .
cool response by the government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel rejects calls for us nuclear weapons to be withdrawn from german soil eckart von klaeden , foreign policy expert of chancellor merkel 's conservative cdu , expressed skepticism about the demands .
" unfortunately we ’ ve seen a rapid increase in the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the world , " he said .
stressing that iran was on the verge of becoming a nuclear power , and that india and pakistan are eager to upgrade their nuclear weapons technology , he said that the tactical nuclear arms based in germany were an important part of nato ’ s policy of nuclear deterrence .
" president obama himself has stressed , " he concluded , " that his drive towards disarmament must go hand in hand with maintaining security for his country and that of its nato partners . "
the social democratic-conservative coalition government used its large majority to turn down the motions put foward by the opposition .

the proposed law change would bar members of management and supervisory boards from cashing in their stock options during their period of employment .
it would also set senior executives ' personal liability for breaches of duty at up to one year 's salary in every instance .
currently most german executives obtain personal-liability insurance at their employer 's expense , meaning that even if they are sued , the full sum of damages must be paid by the insurer .
the new liability rule would mean that if a court imposed a 5-million-euro damages award on an executive who is paid 2 million euros per annum , the insurer would pay 3 million while the executive would pay the other 2 million .
the points agreed to on thursday are to be passed on to the justice ministry to be formulated into formal draft laws that must still be approved by both houses of parliament .
as in other nations , germans have expressed outrage at executives escaping penalty for past misdeeds and obtaining huge remuneration , even when their companies are in deep financial trouble and sacking staff .

the proposed law change would bar members of management and supervisory boards from cashing in their stock options during their period of employment .
it would also set senior executives ' personal liability for breaches of duty at up to one year 's salary in every instance .
currently most german executives obtain personal-liability insurance at their employer 's expense , meaning that even if they are sued , the full sum of damages must be paid by the insurer .
the new liability rule would mean that if a court imposed a 5-million-euro damages award on an executive who is paid 2 million euros per annum , the insurer would pay 3 million while the executive would pay the other 2 million .
the points agreed to on thursday are to be passed on to the justice ministry to be formulated into formal draft laws that must still be approved by both houses of parliament .
as in other nations , germans have expressed outrage at executives escaping penalty for past misdeeds and obtaining huge remuneration , even when their companies are in deep financial trouble and sacking staff .

the original strategic arms reduction treaty , or start , is set to expire in december . at a joint news conference at the us embassy in rome , negotiators described the one-day preliminary talks as a " productive beginning . "
us assistant secretary of state for verification and compliance rose gottemoeller said that friday 's meeting " got off to a fast start . " the talks focused largely on procedural issues and paved the way for the start of formal negotiations next month .
talks will be held in washington and moscow in may and june ahead of us president barack obama 's first visit to russia in july .
anatoly antonov , the chief of security and disarmament issues at the russian foreign ministry , said the two sides hoped they would meet the december deadline for a new treaty .
" we are sure that this new treaty will help to improve relations between the us and the russian federation , " added antonov .
a new start under obama ?
the first start arms control treaty , signed in 1991 , committed both russia and the us to cutting their nuclear arsenals , including reducing missile numbers to a maximum of 1,600 and warheads to no more than 6,000 . this led to steep reduction in nuclear weapons stocks on both sides .
the two countries agreed on a successor treaty , start ii , in 1993 , but russia ’ s parliament never ratified it .
and when us president barack obama 's predecessor george w. bush pulled the us out of the anti-ballistic missile treaty in 2002 , russia said it would give up plans of ever bringing start ii into force .
the initiative to resume talks toward a new start treaty was launched at the recent g-20 summit in london by russian president dmitri medvedev and barack obama , after which obama vowed to press for a world free of nuclear weapons . wl / jam , dpa / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the original strategic arms reduction treaty , or start , is set to expire in december . at a joint news conference at the us embassy in rome , negotiators described the one-day preliminary talks as a " productive beginning . "
us assistant secretary of state for verification and compliance rose gottemoeller said that friday 's meeting " got off to a fast start . " the talks focused largely on procedural issues and paved the way for the start of formal negotiations next month .
talks will be held in washington and moscow in may and june ahead of us president barack obama 's first visit to russia in july .

a new start under obama ?
the first start arms control treaty , signed in 1991 , committed both russia and the us to cutting their nuclear arsenals , including reducing missile numbers to a maximum of 1,600 and warheads to no more than 6,000 . this led to steep reduction in nuclear weapons stocks on both sides .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 24.04.2009 g8-plus environment meeting ends with biodiversity pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a charter was signed pledging to tackle deforestation and illegal wildlife trade environment ministers from the g8 industrialized nations and developing economies sealed a deal friday to slow species loss around the world .
but the countries failed to make headway on climate change negotiations . saving the world 's biodiversity and agreeing on a way forward on climate change negotiations had topped the agenda at the three-day international environment meeting in syracuse , italy .
but ministers attending were only able to tick one of those boxes .
an elusive global warming pact still looks unlikely anytime before a un climate change conference in copenhagen in december , when it is hoped a global strategy for the post-kyoto protocol era can be laid down .
g8 industrial countries and major developing economies meeting on the island of sicily signed a charter pledging to tackle deforestation , curb illegal trade in wildlife and boost research into the rate of species loss .
extinction rates are currently running at around 1,000 times their natural pace , with three species vanishing every hour , according to un statistics .
time running out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim steiner was unconvinced leaving the syracuse meeting " we set objectives on biodiversity for 2010 ... but unfortunately we have all recognized they have not been met , " said italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo , who hosted the summit .
" we are all convinced of the urgency ... of intervening to safeguard our biodiversity , " she said .
the head of the un environment program , achim steiner , said several significant hurdles still needed ironing out .
these included setting targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and financing the greening of developing countries .
key nations , he said , are coming to the realization that time is running out ahead of the un talks in copenhagen .
" i leave syracuse very much concerned that there is no clear pathway to resolving the gaps that remain , " he said . details please kim carstensen , director of the world wide fund for nature ’ s global climate initiative , said after the meeting that the charter on curbing biodiversity loss sends out a clear message on the importance of biodiversity , but was lacking in details .
" it 's a political signal of a will that is higher than i think we 've seen before at this level , and that i think is positive , " he said .
" but in terms of actual implementation , it 's not at all at the level of an action plan , or funded , which would also be nice .
and which would be needed as a next step going forward .
he remarked that ministers ’ agreement that action to move toward a low carbon economy was needed now rather than later could be an important signal for the coming talks in copenhagen .
differences of opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developed and emerging economies will both need to come to the table the g8 grouping of rich nations , along with emerging economies such as china , brazil and india , agreed at the meeting that climate change and species extinction were linked , and emphasized the economic value of preserving biodiversity .
but the game of chicken between industrialized and developing nations over who should foot the bill for plans to mitigate or even reverse climate change looks unlikely to end .
carstensen said big differences remained on financing technological improvements and meeting targeted emissions cuts .
" we need countries like japan , canada , russia and the us to come out and say what exactly is it that we want to contribute , " he said .
" we need to see a stronger and more articulated political will on the side of developed countries to move this really forward . "
reimund schwarze , head of climate change policy at the helmholtz center for environmental research in leipzig , germany , said emerging economies like china will have to make sacrifices too .
" china not only has to move ahead , it has to accept the fact that in the very long run they will be in the role of giving financial aid to other countries , " he said .
the leaders of 16 major economies are due to meet in washington on monday for further talks aimed at generating political leadership for the end-of-year un climate change meeting in denmark .
environmentalists will hope , by then , that both developed and developing countries will be ready to back up their intentions with concrete actions .

it bans secret paternity tests and severely restricts the use of genetic testing by employers and insurance companies . health minister ulla schmidt welcomed the new law as a crucial step in protecting the rights of patients .
she said that after 10 years of discussions a legal framework had been put in place that would prevent the abuse of sensitive personal data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister schmidt says the law is crucial to protect patients genetic testing can be used to determine a person 's disposition to develop certain illnesses such as cancer - information which in the hands of an employer or a health insurance company could easily lead to discrimination .
the new legislation defines under which circumstances an analysis of genetic material is legal .
now , testing can only be conducted with the patient 's consent and after consultation with a doctor .
medical tourism to find out who 's the father ?
under the new law , paternity tests , for example , will be only legal if both the woman and man agree .
conducting a secret test can result in a fine of up to 5,000 euros .
paternity tests during pregnancy will be only legal in cases of sexual abuse or rape .
the german medical association however has warned that this might lead to medical tourism , with people trying to get genetic testing done abroad .

they will not be able to demand a genetic test from their employees to check for illnesses or health problems .
the only exceptions to the rule are if some specific jobs entail potential health risks - as can be the case in the chemical industry .
insurance companies may not demand that their clients undergo genetic testing - with exceptions only in cases in which the pay-out sum is very high .
critics say there are too many exceptions the need for a clear law on the issue had been expressed by all parties across the political spectrum - but the details of the new legislation have been controversial .

" because , once the crisis is over , the companies that will be successful are those that are right into the issues of the future , and we are sure that energy is one of those issues .

the financial crisis has turned the world of business into one of the most important political playgrounds , especially here in germany with a general election looming in september .
while exhibitors in hanover touted their wares , the german parliament convened in berlin to debate how to best tackle the deepening recession .
politicians discussed whether a third stimulus package was necessary to keep the german economy going , but exhibitors in hanover and the event organizers felt that they did n't need a government handout , rather they needed easier access to credit from cautious banks .
" we in germany tend to differentiate between the real economy and the financial economy , " said wolfram vom fritsch of the hanover trade fair .
" and most of our exhibitors see the problems in the financial economy , and see the problems in financing their orders , they say they 're struggling to finance good orders .
so we all look forward to more regulation in the financial sector , and we all look forward to more readily available liquid assets . "
wolfram vom fritsch admitted that the economic climate for the 2009 hanover trade fair has been anything but rosy , but he thinks the event has helped the industrial sector to fight back in the face of recession .
" i think cebit and the hannover trade fair have shown that they are more than just fairs , they are a marketplace - as we call it - where you can interchange between politics , science and industry . "
this interchange was arguably more important in 2009 than ever before in the fair 's 62-year history .

it 's an issue that can bring you a short-term return on investments and it 's an issue with a long-term impact . "
saving energy , and money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the energy harvester lets factories say bye bye to batteries production efficiency is a growing concern in the industrial sector .
as firms look to cut costs without slashing jobs , cutting down on overheads like electricity usage is becoming ever more important .
the british firm perpetuum showcased one example of innovative energy-saving technology .
it 's called an ' energy harvester ' , and it generates electricity from the vibrations of its surroundings to power battery-powered devices .
" i think the first benefit is you no longer have to change batteries , " said chief engineer john parker .
" if you have 5,000 censors on your industrial plant , and your average battery life is two or three years , you will be changing 10 batteries per day .
with our device you no longer have to do that , secondly it uses waste energy , so it recovers the energy from the motor , and thirdly , you no longer have to dispose of batteries which have nasty chemicals inside them . "
even the major players like siemens , volkswagen and phoenix concentrated on their energy saving credentials at the fair .
volkswagen brought only its fuel-efficient ' blue motion ' range of cars to hanover .
" fuel efficiency definitely is one of our top priorities , if not the top priority , " said juergen leohold , the head of corporate research for the volkswagen group .
" we contribute to the prevention of climate change , and we help our customers save on fuel , which gives them a financial advantage , too . "
planning for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the robotic soccer world championships do n't have a recession to tackle rather like the major communication and information technology trade fair cebit , also based in hanover , the 2009 trade fair put a great emphasis on the importance of futuristic technology .
while businesses are struggling at the moment , they are still looking for ways to emerge from this recession one step ahead of their competition .
automated technology and robotics featured heavily at the fair .
robotic science was even showcased through the german round of the autonomous robot soccer world cup , where teams of robots battle it out on the football pitch .
the standard of play may not make this sport worthy of the nickname ' the beautiful game ' , at least not yet , but it 's still an astounding sight .
however , the robots of real interest to the more serious trade fair goers performed more modest tasks .
some can transport stocks around warehouses without a driver , others are designed to lead customers to certain products in stores , eliminating the need for a shop assistant to do so , while a few are designed to perform simple production line tasks in factories .
the political trade fair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with south korean prime minister han seung-soo on opening day german chancellor angela merkel , the prime minister of partner nation south korea han seung-soo , and german president horst koehler are just a few of the high profile politicans who attended this year 's fair .
the financial crisis has turned the world of business into one of the most important political playgrounds , especially here in germany with a general election looming in september .
while exhibitors in hanover touted their wares , the german parliament convened in berlin to debate how to best tackle the deepening recession .
politicians discussed whether a third stimulus package was necessary to keep the german economy going , but exhibitors in hanover and the event organizers felt that they did n't need a government handout , rather they needed easier access to credit from cautious banks .
" we in germany tend to differentiate between the real economy and the financial economy , " said wolfram vom fritsch of the hanover trade fair .
" and most of our exhibitors see the problems in the financial economy , and see the problems in financing their orders , they say they 're struggling to finance good orders .
so we all look forward to more regulation in the financial sector , and we all look forward to more readily available liquid assets . "
wolfram vom fritsch admitted that the economic climate for the 2009 hanover trade fair has been anything but rosy , but he thinks the event has helped the industrial sector to fight back in the face of recession .
" i think cebit and the hannover trade fair have shown that they are more than just fairs , they are a marketplace - as we call it - where you can interchange between politics , science and industry . "
this interchange was arguably more important in 2009 than ever before in the fair 's 62-year history .

more than 6,000 firms from around the world were on hand , looking for new deals and a much needed boost to their balance sheets .

magath also took part in germany 's consecutive second place finishes in the 1982 and 1986 world cups . a highlight in magath 's career on the pitch came for hamburg in the 1983 european cup final .
just eight minutes into the match , magath launched an arching blast from 18 meters that seemed certain to fly over the goal until it dropped just enough to duck the crossbar and sail into the net .
it was the game 's only goal and led hamburg to an upset win over juventus . records in sight now , wolfsburg is looking to upset a bundesliga record or two .
its 10 straight bundesliga wins tied a record set by borussia moenchengladbach in 1987 , and magath stands a good chance of breaking the record this weekend against second-to-last energie cottbus . if wolfsburg break gladbach 's record , magath 's sights will be set on a milestone he 's already familiar with .

star player grafite told the german newspaper die welt that he has magath to thank for being in the best shape of his life . with the end of the season approaching , now is the time that magath needs his players in top condition .
the biggest challenge comes in two weeks ' time , when wolfsburg face surging stuttgart on the road . coming into the season , wolfsburg 's goal was to finish fifth to secure a berth in european competition for next year .
barring a catastrophe , that goal can be checked off the list , but magath insists on keeping his team 's feet on the ground . " the last team to be on top was four points ahead just a few weeks ago and now they are five behind the leaders , " magath said of dethroned hertha berlin .

but the strict disciplinarian maintains his team is still likely to be knocked off its perch . week after week , coach felix magath guides vfl wolfsburg to victory and week after week he faces the same question : is wolfsburg a serious title contender ? the answer is always similar .
magath says that his team has a precarious hold on the top of the bundesliga standings and , like the five other teams who have swapped the lead 11 times this season , will also eventually be unseated . despite wolfsburg 's success under magath and the clear mathematical possibility of their claiming the bundesliga title , magath has refused to name his team as a favorite to lift the league trophy .
in an effort to dampen expectations , magath has even said he 'd wager that bayern munich would win the title . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's grafite fires home " the best goal of his career " " if the -lsb- german soccer association -rsb- would allow it , i 'd even put money on fc bayern , " magath said after wolfsburg 's 2-1 win against bayer leverkusen last weekend . not even a 5-1 thrashing of bayern - the bavarian team 's worst loss in seven years - was enough to shake magath 's belief in bayern . " that was a very unique result that might not happen again for 50 years , " he said after the game . a history with bayern bayern are indeed still in the running , currently tied for second place in the standings with hamburg .
hertha berlin and vfb stuttgart also have an outside shot at the title .
but magath tipping bayern to win smacks of irony - it 's the same team he led to back-to-back german cup and league titles in 2005 and 2006 only to be fired in 2007 when bayern 's champions league chances began to pale . magath 's firing did n't rescue a champion 's league spot for bayern in 2007 but it freed him up to sign on with wolfsburg as coach , manager and ceo .
following the team 's recent winning streak , fans in wolfsburg are hoping the side remains undefeated until magath 's contract expires in 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath cut an elegant profile as a player before taking to coaching , magath was best known for his career as a player at hamburg .
the midfielder scored 46 goals in 306 games for hamburg , who were german champions three times during magath 's time .
magath also took part in germany 's consecutive second place finishes in the 1982 and 1986 world cups . a highlight in magath 's career on the pitch came for hamburg in the 1983 european cup final .
just eight minutes into the match , magath launched an arching blast from 18 meters that seemed certain to fly over the goal until it dropped just enough to duck the crossbar and sail into the net .
it was the game 's only goal and led hamburg to an upset win over juventus . records in sight now , wolfsburg is looking to upset a bundesliga record or two .
its 10 straight bundesliga wins tied a record set by borussia moenchengladbach in 1987 , and magath stands a good chance of breaking the record this weekend against second-to-last energie cottbus . if wolfsburg break gladbach 's record , magath 's sights will be set on a milestone he 's already familiar with .
bayern currently hold the record for 15 consecutive wins over two seasons - a record set partly while magath was at the helm . six games to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the game lasts 90 minutes and bayern win in the end ... for now but regardless of any records , players should n't expect much of a break from the coach .
magath 's reputation is as an outspoken disciplinarian .
once a marathon-runner himself , he values the physical fitness of his players .
star player grafite told the german newspaper die welt that he has magath to thank for being in the best shape of his life . with the end of the season approaching , now is the time that magath needs his players in top condition .
the biggest challenge comes in two weeks ' time , when wolfsburg face surging stuttgart on the road . coming into the season , wolfsburg 's goal was to finish fifth to secure a berth in european competition for next year .
barring a catastrophe , that goal can be checked off the list , but magath insists on keeping his team 's feet on the ground . " the last team to be on top was four points ahead just a few weeks ago and now they are five behind the leaders , " magath said of dethroned hertha berlin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 24.04.2009 g8-plus environment meeting ends with biodiversity pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a charter was signed pledging to tackle deforestation and illegal wildlife trade environment ministers from the g8 industrialized nations and developing economies sealed a deal friday to slow species loss around the world .
but the countries failed to make headway on climate change negotiations . saving the world 's biodiversity and agreeing on a way forward on climate change negotiations had topped the agenda at the three-day international environment meeting in syracuse , italy .
but ministers attending were only able to tick one of those boxes .
an elusive global warming pact still looks unlikely anytime before a un climate change conference in copenhagen in december , when it is hoped a global strategy for the post-kyoto protocol era can be laid down .
g8 industrial countries and major developing economies meeting on the island of sicily signed a charter pledging to tackle deforestation , curb illegal trade in wildlife and boost research into the rate of species loss .
extinction rates are currently running at around 1,000 times their natural pace , with three species vanishing every hour , according to un statistics .
time running out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim steiner was unconvinced leaving the syracuse meeting " we set objectives on biodiversity for 2010 ... but unfortunately we have all recognized they have not been met , " said italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo , who hosted the summit .
" we are all convinced of the urgency ... of intervening to safeguard our biodiversity , " she said .
the head of the un environment program , achim steiner , said several significant hurdles still needed ironing out .
these included setting targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and financing the greening of developing countries .
key nations , he said , are coming to the realization that time is running out ahead of the un talks in copenhagen .
" i leave syracuse very much concerned that there is no clear pathway to resolving the gaps that remain , " he said . details please kim carstensen , director of the world wide fund for nature ’ s global climate initiative , said after the meeting that the charter on curbing biodiversity loss sends out a clear message on the importance of biodiversity , but was lacking in details .
" it 's a political signal of a will that is higher than i think we 've seen before at this level , and that i think is positive , " he said .
" but in terms of actual implementation , it 's not at all at the level of an action plan , or funded , which would also be nice .
and which would be needed as a next step going forward .
he remarked that ministers ’ agreement that action to move toward a low carbon economy was needed now rather than later could be an important signal for the coming talks in copenhagen .
differences of opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developed and emerging economies will both need to come to the table the g8 grouping of rich nations , along with emerging economies such as china , brazil and india , agreed at the meeting that climate change and species extinction were linked , and emphasized the economic value of preserving biodiversity .
but the game of chicken between industrialized and developing nations over who should foot the bill for plans to mitigate or even reverse climate change looks unlikely to end .
carstensen said big differences remained on financing technological improvements and meeting targeted emissions cuts .
" we need countries like japan , canada , russia and the us to come out and say what exactly is it that we want to contribute , " he said .
" we need to see a stronger and more articulated political will on the side of developed countries to move this really forward . "
reimund schwarze , head of climate change policy at the helmholtz center for environmental research in leipzig , germany , said emerging economies like china will have to make sacrifices too .
" china not only has to move ahead , it has to accept the fact that in the very long run they will be in the role of giving financial aid to other countries , " he said .
the leaders of 16 major economies are due to meet in washington on monday for further talks aimed at generating political leadership for the end-of-year un climate change meeting in denmark .
environmentalists will hope , by then , that both developed and developing countries will be ready to back up their intentions with concrete actions .

us assistant secretary of state for verification and compliance rose gottemoeller said that friday 's meeting " got off to a fast start . " the talks focused largely on procedural issues and paved the way for the start of formal negotiations next month .

a new start under obama ?
the first start arms control treaty , signed in 1991 , committed both russia and the us to cutting their nuclear arsenals , including reducing missile numbers to a maximum of 1,600 and warheads to no more than 6,000 . this led to steep reduction in nuclear weapons stocks on both sides .
the two countries agreed on a successor treaty , start ii , in 1993 , but russia ’ s parliament never ratified it .
and when us president barack obama 's predecessor george w. bush pulled the us out of the anti-ballistic missile treaty in 2002 , russia said it would give up plans of ever bringing start ii into force .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 24.04.2009 g8-plus environment meeting ends with biodiversity pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a charter was signed pledging to tackle deforestation and illegal wildlife trade environment ministers from the g8 industrialized nations and developing economies sealed a deal friday to slow species loss around the world .
but the countries failed to make headway on climate change negotiations . saving the world 's biodiversity and agreeing on a way forward on climate change negotiations had topped the agenda at the three-day international environment meeting in syracuse , italy .
but ministers attending were only able to tick one of those boxes .
an elusive global warming pact still looks unlikely anytime before a un climate change conference in copenhagen in december , when it is hoped a global strategy for the post-kyoto protocol era can be laid down .
g8 industrial countries and major developing economies meeting on the island of sicily signed a charter pledging to tackle deforestation , curb illegal trade in wildlife and boost research into the rate of species loss .
extinction rates are currently running at around 1,000 times their natural pace , with three species vanishing every hour , according to un statistics .
time running out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim steiner was unconvinced leaving the syracuse meeting " we set objectives on biodiversity for 2010 ... but unfortunately we have all recognized they have not been met , " said italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo , who hosted the summit .
" we are all convinced of the urgency ... of intervening to safeguard our biodiversity , " she said .
the head of the un environment program , achim steiner , said several significant hurdles still needed ironing out .
these included setting targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and financing the greening of developing countries .
key nations , he said , are coming to the realization that time is running out ahead of the un talks in copenhagen .
" i leave syracuse very much concerned that there is no clear pathway to resolving the gaps that remain , " he said . details please kim carstensen , director of the world wide fund for nature ’ s global climate initiative , said after the meeting that the charter on curbing biodiversity loss sends out a clear message on the importance of biodiversity , but was lacking in details .
" it 's a political signal of a will that is higher than i think we 've seen before at this level , and that i think is positive , " he said .
" but in terms of actual implementation , it 's not at all at the level of an action plan , or funded , which would also be nice .
and which would be needed as a next step going forward .
he remarked that ministers ’ agreement that action to move toward a low carbon economy was needed now rather than later could be an important signal for the coming talks in copenhagen .
differences of opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developed and emerging economies will both need to come to the table the g8 grouping of rich nations , along with emerging economies such as china , brazil and india , agreed at the meeting that climate change and species extinction were linked , and emphasized the economic value of preserving biodiversity .
but the game of chicken between industrialized and developing nations over who should foot the bill for plans to mitigate or even reverse climate change looks unlikely to end .
carstensen said big differences remained on financing technological improvements and meeting targeted emissions cuts .
" we need countries like japan , canada , russia and the us to come out and say what exactly is it that we want to contribute , " he said .
" we need to see a stronger and more articulated political will on the side of developed countries to move this really forward . "
reimund schwarze , head of climate change policy at the helmholtz center for environmental research in leipzig , germany , said emerging economies like china will have to make sacrifices too .
" china not only has to move ahead , it has to accept the fact that in the very long run they will be in the role of giving financial aid to other countries , " he said .
the leaders of 16 major economies are due to meet in washington on monday for further talks aimed at generating political leadership for the end-of-year un climate change meeting in denmark .
environmentalists will hope , by then , that both developed and developing countries will be ready to back up their intentions with concrete actions .

the original strategic arms reduction treaty , or start , is set to expire in december . at a joint news conference at the us embassy in rome , negotiators described the one-day preliminary talks as a " productive beginning . "
us assistant secretary of state for verification and compliance rose gottemoeller said that friday 's meeting " got off to a fast start . " the talks focused largely on procedural issues and paved the way for the start of formal negotiations next month .
talks will be held in washington and moscow in may and june ahead of us president barack obama 's first visit to russia in july .
anatoly antonov , the chief of security and disarmament issues at the russian foreign ministry , said the two sides hoped they would meet the december deadline for a new treaty .
" we are sure that this new treaty will help to improve relations between the us and the russian federation , " added antonov .
a new start under obama ?
the first start arms control treaty , signed in 1991 , committed both russia and the us to cutting their nuclear arsenals , including reducing missile numbers to a maximum of 1,600 and warheads to no more than 6,000 . this led to steep reduction in nuclear weapons stocks on both sides .
the two countries agreed on a successor treaty , start ii , in 1993 , but russia ’ s parliament never ratified it .
and when us president barack obama 's predecessor george w. bush pulled the us out of the anti-ballistic missile treaty in 2002 , russia said it would give up plans of ever bringing start ii into force .
the initiative to resume talks toward a new start treaty was launched at the recent g-20 summit in london by russian president dmitri medvedev and barack obama , after which obama vowed to press for a world free of nuclear weapons . wl / jam , dpa / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin would ask the shareholders at a meeting on june 2 to vote for an increase in equity from just under 700 million euros -lrb- $ 925 million -rrb- at present to 6.3 billion euros , with the german state pumping in all the new funds .
the equity issue would sharply dilute the stakes of the existing shareholders , leaving them with less than a 10th of voting stock .
the new equity would be held by soffin , the government agency charged with helping german banks via guarantees and equity infusions .
soffin disclosed earlier in frankfurt that a government takeover offer for hre of 1.39 euros per share had made little progress .
merck finck analyst konrad becker told news agency afp the weak response by investors so far was not surpising , because " people often wait until the very last day before deciding to sell in hopes the purchaser will raise the offer . "
only 1.28 percent of shares had been acquired as of thursday afternoon , soffin said .
that brought berlin 's present stake to 9.94 percent .
the move could come at his expense of us investor jc flowers , who heads a consortium owning almost 24 percent of shares in hre .
so far , he has been dismissive towards the bid .
" accept bid " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are real fears hre could go the way of lehman brothers but the hre supervisory and executive boards advised shareholders friday to accept the takeover bid for their shares .
that offer expires on may 4 .
hre stock rose 1.4 percent in stock-market trading friday to 1.41 euros .
last month , germany legislated compulsory purchase powers in case the shareholders did not accept the bid .
chancellor angela merkel 's government is concerned that a collapse of hre could lead to the sort of financial market chaos that followed the failure of us investment bank lehman brothers in september last year .
hre 's problems arose at its depfa bank unit , which operated from largely deregulated dublin .
depfa is a principal lender to german local government , raising bond issues for roads and new buildings .
the government has so far given the bank support worth 102 billion euros .

managers from companies in france , including molex , sony , 3m and hewlett-packard , have all reported " bossnapping " incidents .
" when the government continues to do nothing , there is increasing danger that the far-right will gain in strength , " warned oskar lafontaine on public radio wdr .
the left party has also been calling for national strikes to be legalized again .
despite these warnings , experts see there is little risk of serious social unrest and mass protests breaking out in europe 's biggest economy .
the left party was established two years ago and is made up largely of former east german communists and disaffected social democrats , including its former chairman oskar lafontaine .
he quit former chancellor gerhard schroeder 's cabinet because he found its policies too centrist .
unexpected support from presidential candidate lafontaine 's " bossnapping " suggestions have received unexpected support from the social democrat presidential candidate gesine schwan who " warned of growing anger throughout the country . "
she was immediately sharply criticized from within her own party for scaremongering and spreading excessive pessimism .
" the economy is doing badly , but we are a long way from social unrest , " warned spd colleague , dieter wiefelspuetz .
" it does n't do anyone any good to be talking about unrest erupting here or in france or anywhere else , " said peter struck , the head of the bundestag faction of the social democrats .
" that is undermining efforts by the federal government which is doing everything possible to help make it easier for people to get through the crisis . "
german chancellor angela merkel said at a meeting of senior christian democrat party officials that she does not share the concerns that social unrest will break out .

berlin would ask the shareholders at a meeting on june 2 to vote for an increase in equity from just under 700 million euros -lrb- $ 925 million -rrb- at present to 6.3 billion euros , with the german state pumping in all the new funds .

the proposed law change would bar members of management and supervisory boards from cashing in their stock options during their period of employment .
it would also set senior executives ' personal liability for breaches of duty at up to one year 's salary in every instance .
currently most german executives obtain personal-liability insurance at their employer 's expense , meaning that even if they are sued , the full sum of damages must be paid by the insurer .
the new liability rule would mean that if a court imposed a 5-million-euro damages award on an executive who is paid 2 million euros per annum , the insurer would pay 3 million while the executive would pay the other 2 million .
the points agreed to on thursday are to be passed on to the justice ministry to be formulated into formal draft laws that must still be approved by both houses of parliament .
as in other nations , germans have expressed outrage at executives escaping penalty for past misdeeds and obtaining huge remuneration , even when their companies are in deep financial trouble and sacking staff .

he said us-russian talks on a follow-up to the strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start 1 -rrb- , due to expire in december , must be successfully completed .

in the debate , the german foreign minister outlined steps which he said were crucial for reaching the goal of a nuclear-free world .
he said us-russian talks on a follow-up to the strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start 1 -rrb- , due to expire in december , must be successfully completed .
in addition , iran and north korea - two countries thought to be on the threshold of becoming nuclear powers - must be convinced to enter talks on their nuclear programs as proposed by the us president .

the original strategic arms reduction treaty , or start , is set to expire in december . at a joint news conference at the us embassy in rome , negotiators described the one-day preliminary talks as a " productive beginning . "
us assistant secretary of state for verification and compliance rose gottemoeller said that friday 's meeting " got off to a fast start . " the talks focused largely on procedural issues and paved the way for the start of formal negotiations next month .
talks will be held in washington and moscow in may and june ahead of us president barack obama 's first visit to russia in july .
anatoly antonov , the chief of security and disarmament issues at the russian foreign ministry , said the two sides hoped they would meet the december deadline for a new treaty .
" we are sure that this new treaty will help to improve relations between the us and the russian federation , " added antonov .
a new start under obama ?
the first start arms control treaty , signed in 1991 , committed both russia and the us to cutting their nuclear arsenals , including reducing missile numbers to a maximum of 1,600 and warheads to no more than 6,000 . this led to steep reduction in nuclear weapons stocks on both sides .
the two countries agreed on a successor treaty , start ii , in 1993 , but russia ’ s parliament never ratified it .
and when us president barack obama 's predecessor george w. bush pulled the us out of the anti-ballistic missile treaty in 2002 , russia said it would give up plans of ever bringing start ii into force .
the initiative to resume talks toward a new start treaty was launched at the recent g-20 summit in london by russian president dmitri medvedev and barack obama , after which obama vowed to press for a world free of nuclear weapons . wl / jam , dpa / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the original strategic arms reduction treaty , or start , is set to expire in december . at a joint news conference at the us embassy in rome , negotiators described the one-day preliminary talks as a " productive beginning . "
us assistant secretary of state for verification and compliance rose gottemoeller said that friday 's meeting " got off to a fast start . " the talks focused largely on procedural issues and paved the way for the start of formal negotiations next month .
talks will be held in washington and moscow in may and june ahead of us president barack obama 's first visit to russia in july .
anatoly antonov , the chief of security and disarmament issues at the russian foreign ministry , said the two sides hoped they would meet the december deadline for a new treaty .
" we are sure that this new treaty will help to improve relations between the us and the russian federation , " added antonov .
a new start under obama ?
the first start arms control treaty , signed in 1991 , committed both russia and the us to cutting their nuclear arsenals , including reducing missile numbers to a maximum of 1,600 and warheads to no more than 6,000 . this led to steep reduction in nuclear weapons stocks on both sides .
the two countries agreed on a successor treaty , start ii , in 1993 , but russia ’ s parliament never ratified it .
and when us president barack obama 's predecessor george w. bush pulled the us out of the anti-ballistic missile treaty in 2002 , russia said it would give up plans of ever bringing start ii into force .
the initiative to resume talks toward a new start treaty was launched at the recent g-20 summit in london by russian president dmitri medvedev and barack obama , after which obama vowed to press for a world free of nuclear weapons . wl / jam , dpa / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de formula one -pipe- 24.04.2009 former f1 star enjoying 2009 's " big shake up " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinz-harald frentzen is pleased to see an upside-down f1 grid this year sebastian vettel is getting better and better , and he 's in a car designed by perhaps the best aerodynamic engineer in formula one .
that 's the verdict of former f1 ace heinz-harald frentzen . it 's been a year of surprises and shake-ups in the world of formula one racing .
a team that looked on the verge of extinction a couple of months ago has a commanding lead in the formula one championship after three grands prix .
brawn gp have gone from rank outsiders to hot favorites in what seems like the blink of an eye .
red bull and toyota - both of whom have been also-rans throughout their histories in the sport - are the closest competition for the former honda works team .
the only traditionally big name anywhere near the top is mclaren mercedes .
world champion lewis hamilton 's team are currently fourth in the constructor 's championship , but their future is in serious doubt due to off-track controversy .
meanwhile , ferrari , f1 's top team in eight of the last ten seasons , are dead last in the championship with no points from three races .
formula one has been turned on its head this season , and germany 's former f1 superstar heinz-harald frentzen told deutsche welle that he thinks it 's a breath of fresh air .
" it 's mixed up formula one completely , " frentzen says .
" i mean , before the season started , could you imagine the top teams spending a lot of money and effort and finding themselves in the midfield ?
no one expected that ! "
initial testing results for the fourth race of the season in bahrain this weekend do n't suggest that normality is going to be restored just yet , if at all .
surprising , but not inexplicable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brawn gp and other ' underdogs ' are dominating f1 however , while frentzen said this new order in formula one is unexpected , he also pointed to rules , a hard fought 2008 season , and the introduction of new technoloiges as explanations for this surprising turn of events .
" there has been a big modification from one year to the other , in terms of regulations , chassis layout and with the introduction of kers -lrb- kinetic energy recovery system -rrb- .
everything 's been mixed up , " he says .
he said the last time there was a similar comprehensive change was between 1997 and 1998 .
" just like it was back then , the teams who made the best decisions and found the best strategy for the new regulations over the winter have earned the glory , " he said .
little wonder frentzen is so conscious of how rule changes can affect f1 .
he was one of the losers after the rule changes a decade ago .
then driving for williams , frentzen watched his team morph from the quickest in the sport into a relatively mediocre outfit in a matter of months .
it was during this same shakeup that mclaren and ferrari re-established themselves as major players in the sport , a position neither team ever really relinquished , until this year , perhaps .
getting better and better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel has won both his races in wet conditions one major winner in the new-look f1 is sebastian vettel .
the 21-year-old german won round three of the season in china from pole position , taking the second race win of his fledgling career .
in friday testing in bahrain , his red bull car looked quick again and the young german is optimistic about the season .
" i do n't want to talk about the title , but we have the potential to drive for victory in the next races , " vettel told reporters trackside in bahrain .
frentzen - who was 29 years old when he won his first grand prix with williams - is impressed that vettel has grabbed two wins so early in his career .
" i am a big fan of vettel because he developed himself steadily , starting in the sport at a very young age , " he says .
" but now , he 's already a very experienced driver .
he still makes some mistakes , but what really impresses me is that he is able to improve the development of his car , to help the mechanics make his car faster .
he 's getting better and better and better . "
the newey factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrian newey 's latest f1 masterpiece may be the 2009 red bull however , frentzen says that there 's more to red bull 's success than the talented young german behind the wheel .
adrian newey , red bull 's chief technical officer and designer , is a legend in formula one circles .
he has designed a slew of blisteringly quick f1 cars for williams and then mclaren mercedes over the years .
" i have also driven an adrian newey car in 1997 , " frentzen points out .
" for me , when i was closely involved in f1 , he was the best aerodynamic engineer in the sport , and the cars he built were always fantastic . "
" and remember that if vettel had n't won that race -lsb- in china -rsb- , then his teammate mark webber would have won instead .
also , rookie sebastien buemi was up there fighting with double world champion fernando alonso , also in an adrian newey car .
so i have to give the credit to the team as well , they 've built a fantstic car this season . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frentzen knows first hand that an adrian newey car is usually a fast car f1 's drastic rule changes meant that designers could n't simply improve on the foundation of their 2008 models in 2009 .
innovation was the order of the day , as design teams all along the pitlane went back to the drawing board .
taking this into account , the success of red bull with adrian newey 's involvement , and of championship leaders brawn gp with a car developed by ross brawn , the mastermind of michael schumacher 's dominant years with benetton and ferrari , seems a little less shocking .
however , these relatively small teams may yet struggle to maintain their early season advantage .
there are bigger , richer outfits working round the clock to close the gap on formula one 's unlikely front-runners .

that 's the verdict of former f1 ace heinz-harald frentzen . it 's been a year of surprises and shake-ups in the world of formula one racing .
a team that looked on the verge of extinction a couple of months ago has a commanding lead in the formula one championship after three grands prix .
brawn gp have gone from rank outsiders to hot favorites in what seems like the blink of an eye .
red bull and toyota - both of whom have been also-rans throughout their histories in the sport - are the closest competition for the former honda works team .
the only traditionally big name anywhere near the top is mclaren mercedes .
world champion lewis hamilton 's team are currently fourth in the constructor 's championship , but their future is in serious doubt due to off-track controversy .
meanwhile , ferrari , f1 's top team in eight of the last ten seasons , are dead last in the championship with no points from three races .
formula one has been turned on its head this season , and germany 's former f1 superstar heinz-harald frentzen told deutsche welle that he thinks it 's a breath of fresh air .
" it 's mixed up formula one completely , " frentzen says .
" i mean , before the season started , could you imagine the top teams spending a lot of money and effort and finding themselves in the midfield ?
no one expected that ! "
initial testing results for the fourth race of the season in bahrain this weekend do n't suggest that normality is going to be restored just yet , if at all .
surprising , but not inexplicable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brawn gp and other ' underdogs ' are dominating f1 however , while frentzen said this new order in formula one is unexpected , he also pointed to rules , a hard fought 2008 season , and the introduction of new technoloiges as explanations for this surprising turn of events .
" there has been a big modification from one year to the other , in terms of regulations , chassis layout and with the introduction of kers -lrb- kinetic energy recovery system -rrb- .
everything 's been mixed up , " he says .
he said the last time there was a similar comprehensive change was between 1997 and 1998 .
" just like it was back then , the teams who made the best decisions and found the best strategy for the new regulations over the winter have earned the glory , " he said .
little wonder frentzen is so conscious of how rule changes can affect f1 .
he was one of the losers after the rule changes a decade ago .
then driving for williams , frentzen watched his team morph from the quickest in the sport into a relatively mediocre outfit in a matter of months .
it was during this same shakeup that mclaren and ferrari re-established themselves as major players in the sport , a position neither team ever really relinquished , until this year , perhaps .
getting better and better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel has won both his races in wet conditions one major winner in the new-look f1 is sebastian vettel .
the 21-year-old german won round three of the season in china from pole position , taking the second race win of his fledgling career .
in friday testing in bahrain , his red bull car looked quick again and the young german is optimistic about the season .
" i do n't want to talk about the title , but we have the potential to drive for victory in the next races , " vettel told reporters trackside in bahrain .
frentzen - who was 29 years old when he won his first grand prix with williams - is impressed that vettel has grabbed two wins so early in his career .
" i am a big fan of vettel because he developed himself steadily , starting in the sport at a very young age , " he says .
" but now , he 's already a very experienced driver .
he still makes some mistakes , but what really impresses me is that he is able to improve the development of his car , to help the mechanics make his car faster .
he 's getting better and better and better . "
the newey factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrian newey 's latest f1 masterpiece may be the 2009 red bull however , frentzen says that there 's more to red bull 's success than the talented young german behind the wheel .
adrian newey , red bull 's chief technical officer and designer , is a legend in formula one circles .
he has designed a slew of blisteringly quick f1 cars for williams and then mclaren mercedes over the years .
" i have also driven an adrian newey car in 1997 , " frentzen points out .
" for me , when i was closely involved in f1 , he was the best aerodynamic engineer in the sport , and the cars he built were always fantastic . "
" and remember that if vettel had n't won that race -lsb- in china -rsb- , then his teammate mark webber would have won instead .
also , rookie sebastien buemi was up there fighting with double world champion fernando alonso , also in an adrian newey car .
so i have to give the credit to the team as well , they 've built a fantstic car this season . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frentzen knows first hand that an adrian newey car is usually a fast car f1 's drastic rule changes meant that designers could n't simply improve on the foundation of their 2008 models in 2009 .
innovation was the order of the day , as design teams all along the pitlane went back to the drawing board .
taking this into account , the success of red bull with adrian newey 's involvement , and of championship leaders brawn gp with a car developed by ross brawn , the mastermind of michael schumacher 's dominant years with benetton and ferrari , seems a little less shocking .
however , these relatively small teams may yet struggle to maintain their early season advantage .
there are bigger , richer outfits working round the clock to close the gap on formula one 's unlikely front-runners .

the proposed law change would bar members of management and supervisory boards from cashing in their stock options during their period of employment .
it would also set senior executives ' personal liability for breaches of duty at up to one year 's salary in every instance .
currently most german executives obtain personal-liability insurance at their employer 's expense , meaning that even if they are sued , the full sum of damages must be paid by the insurer .
the new liability rule would mean that if a court imposed a 5-million-euro damages award on an executive who is paid 2 million euros per annum , the insurer would pay 3 million while the executive would pay the other 2 million .
the points agreed to on thursday are to be passed on to the justice ministry to be formulated into formal draft laws that must still be approved by both houses of parliament .
as in other nations , germans have expressed outrage at executives escaping penalty for past misdeeds and obtaining huge remuneration , even when their companies are in deep financial trouble and sacking staff .
germany has been pushing for an overhaul of the global financial framework and has blamed the world recession on the " casino capitalism " prevalent in the united states and britain . sje / nrt , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the countries failed to make headway on climate change negotiations . saving the world 's biodiversity and agreeing on a way forward on climate change negotiations had topped the agenda at the three-day international environment meeting in syracuse , italy .
but ministers attending were only able to tick one of those boxes .
an elusive global warming pact still looks unlikely anytime before a un climate change conference in copenhagen in december , when it is hoped a global strategy for the post-kyoto protocol era can be laid down .
g8 industrial countries and major developing economies meeting on the island of sicily signed a charter pledging to tackle deforestation , curb illegal trade in wildlife and boost research into the rate of species loss .
extinction rates are currently running at around 1,000 times their natural pace , with three species vanishing every hour , according to un statistics .
time running out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim steiner was unconvinced leaving the syracuse meeting " we set objectives on biodiversity for 2010 ... but unfortunately we have all recognized they have not been met , " said italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo , who hosted the summit .
" we are all convinced of the urgency ... of intervening to safeguard our biodiversity , " she said .
the head of the un environment program , achim steiner , said several significant hurdles still needed ironing out .
these included setting targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and financing the greening of developing countries .
key nations , he said , are coming to the realization that time is running out ahead of the un talks in copenhagen .
" i leave syracuse very much concerned that there is no clear pathway to resolving the gaps that remain , " he said . details please kim carstensen , director of the world wide fund for nature ’ s global climate initiative , said after the meeting that the charter on curbing biodiversity loss sends out a clear message on the importance of biodiversity , but was lacking in details .
" it 's a political signal of a will that is higher than i think we 've seen before at this level , and that i think is positive , " he said .
" but in terms of actual implementation , it 's not at all at the level of an action plan , or funded , which would also be nice .
and which would be needed as a next step going forward .
he remarked that ministers ’ agreement that action to move toward a low carbon economy was needed now rather than later could be an important signal for the coming talks in copenhagen .
differences of opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developed and emerging economies will both need to come to the table the g8 grouping of rich nations , along with emerging economies such as china , brazil and india , agreed at the meeting that climate change and species extinction were linked , and emphasized the economic value of preserving biodiversity .
but the game of chicken between industrialized and developing nations over who should foot the bill for plans to mitigate or even reverse climate change looks unlikely to end .
carstensen said big differences remained on financing technological improvements and meeting targeted emissions cuts .
" we need countries like japan , canada , russia and the us to come out and say what exactly is it that we want to contribute , " he said .
" we need to see a stronger and more articulated political will on the side of developed countries to move this really forward . "
reimund schwarze , head of climate change policy at the helmholtz center for environmental research in leipzig , germany , said emerging economies like china will have to make sacrifices too .
" china not only has to move ahead , it has to accept the fact that in the very long run they will be in the role of giving financial aid to other countries , " he said .
the leaders of 16 major economies are due to meet in washington on monday for further talks aimed at generating political leadership for the end-of-year un climate change meeting in denmark .
environmentalists will hope , by then , that both developed and developing countries will be ready to back up their intentions with concrete actions .

north korea has announced that two us journalists arrested last month on its border with china are to be put on trial to face criminal charges . " our related agency has decided to turn the us reporters over for trial based on findings of their crimes , " the north 's kcna news agency reported , without giving further details .
laura ling and euna lee were arrested on march 17 near the tumen river , which runs along the border between north korea and china , while reporting on north korean refugees for san francisco-based current-tv .
north korea has accused them of illegally entering its territory with " hostile " intent .
the associated press reports the journalists could face at least five years in prison if they are convicted of espionage under north korean law .
the planned trial comes as the reclusive state faces un security council condemnation for its april 5 launch of a long-range rocket , which regional powers say was a ballistic missile test .

berlin would ask the shareholders at a meeting on june 2 to vote for an increase in equity from just under 700 million euros -lrb- $ 925 million -rrb- at present to 6.3 billion euros , with the german state pumping in all the new funds .
the equity issue would sharply dilute the stakes of the existing shareholders , leaving them with less than a 10th of voting stock .
the new equity would be held by soffin , the government agency charged with helping german banks via guarantees and equity infusions .
soffin disclosed earlier in frankfurt that a government takeover offer for hre of 1.39 euros per share had made little progress .
merck finck analyst konrad becker told news agency afp the weak response by investors so far was not surpising , because " people often wait until the very last day before deciding to sell in hopes the purchaser will raise the offer . "
only 1.28 percent of shares had been acquired as of thursday afternoon , soffin said .
that brought berlin 's present stake to 9.94 percent .
the move could come at his expense of us investor jc flowers , who heads a consortium owning almost 24 percent of shares in hre .
so far , he has been dismissive towards the bid .
" accept bid " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are real fears hre could go the way of lehman brothers but the hre supervisory and executive boards advised shareholders friday to accept the takeover bid for their shares .
that offer expires on may 4 .
hre stock rose 1.4 percent in stock-market trading friday to 1.41 euros .
last month , germany legislated compulsory purchase powers in case the shareholders did not accept the bid .
chancellor angela merkel 's government is concerned that a collapse of hre could lead to the sort of financial market chaos that followed the failure of us investment bank lehman brothers in september last year .
hre 's problems arose at its depfa bank unit , which operated from largely deregulated dublin .
depfa is a principal lender to german local government , raising bond issues for roads and new buildings .
the government has so far given the bank support worth 102 billion euros .
germany 's banking industry is currently weighed down with significant problems .
it has more than 800 billion euros worth of so-called toxic assets on lenders ' books . dfm / jam , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a former chairman of the social democrats suggested on public radio that german workers , just like their french counterparts , should kidnap their boss if they 're worried about their future . the leader of germany ’ s left party has urged german workers to copy the example of disgruntled french counterparts and kidnap their bosses .
several managers in france who announced restructuring measures to deal with the economic crisis have been detained in factories in recent weeks by employees who fear losing their jobs .
managers from companies in france , including molex , sony , 3m and hewlett-packard , have all reported " bossnapping " incidents .
" when the government continues to do nothing , there is increasing danger that the far-right will gain in strength , " warned oskar lafontaine on public radio wdr .
the left party has also been calling for national strikes to be legalized again .
despite these warnings , experts see there is little risk of serious social unrest and mass protests breaking out in europe 's biggest economy .
the left party was established two years ago and is made up largely of former east german communists and disaffected social democrats , including its former chairman oskar lafontaine .
he quit former chancellor gerhard schroeder 's cabinet because he found its policies too centrist .
unexpected support from presidential candidate lafontaine 's " bossnapping " suggestions have received unexpected support from the social democrat presidential candidate gesine schwan who " warned of growing anger throughout the country . "
she was immediately sharply criticized from within her own party for scaremongering and spreading excessive pessimism .
" the economy is doing badly , but we are a long way from social unrest , " warned spd colleague , dieter wiefelspuetz .
" it does n't do anyone any good to be talking about unrest erupting here or in france or anywhere else , " said peter struck , the head of the bundestag faction of the social democrats .

german chancellor angela merkel said at a meeting of senior christian democrat party officials that she does not share the concerns that social unrest will break out .

that 's the verdict of former f1 ace heinz-harald frentzen . it 's been a year of surprises and shake-ups in the world of formula one racing .
a team that looked on the verge of extinction a couple of months ago has a commanding lead in the formula one championship after three grands prix .
brawn gp have gone from rank outsiders to hot favorites in what seems like the blink of an eye .
red bull and toyota - both of whom have been also-rans throughout their histories in the sport - are the closest competition for the former honda works team .
the only traditionally big name anywhere near the top is mclaren mercedes .
world champion lewis hamilton 's team are currently fourth in the constructor 's championship , but their future is in serious doubt due to off-track controversy .
meanwhile , ferrari , f1 's top team in eight of the last ten seasons , are dead last in the championship with no points from three races .
formula one has been turned on its head this season , and germany 's former f1 superstar heinz-harald frentzen told deutsche welle that he thinks it 's a breath of fresh air .
" it 's mixed up formula one completely , " frentzen says .
" i mean , before the season started , could you imagine the top teams spending a lot of money and effort and finding themselves in the midfield ?
no one expected that ! "
initial testing results for the fourth race of the season in bahrain this weekend do n't suggest that normality is going to be restored just yet , if at all .
surprising , but not inexplicable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brawn gp and other ' underdogs ' are dominating f1 however , while frentzen said this new order in formula one is unexpected , he also pointed to rules , a hard fought 2008 season , and the introduction of new technoloiges as explanations for this surprising turn of events .
" there has been a big modification from one year to the other , in terms of regulations , chassis layout and with the introduction of kers -lrb- kinetic energy recovery system -rrb- .
everything 's been mixed up , " he says .
he said the last time there was a similar comprehensive change was between 1997 and 1998 .
" just like it was back then , the teams who made the best decisions and found the best strategy for the new regulations over the winter have earned the glory , " he said .
little wonder frentzen is so conscious of how rule changes can affect f1 .
he was one of the losers after the rule changes a decade ago .
then driving for williams , frentzen watched his team morph from the quickest in the sport into a relatively mediocre outfit in a matter of months .
it was during this same shakeup that mclaren and ferrari re-established themselves as major players in the sport , a position neither team ever really relinquished , until this year , perhaps .
getting better and better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel has won both his races in wet conditions one major winner in the new-look f1 is sebastian vettel .
the 21-year-old german won round three of the season in china from pole position , taking the second race win of his fledgling career .
in friday testing in bahrain , his red bull car looked quick again and the young german is optimistic about the season .
" i do n't want to talk about the title , but we have the potential to drive for victory in the next races , " vettel told reporters trackside in bahrain .
frentzen - who was 29 years old when he won his first grand prix with williams - is impressed that vettel has grabbed two wins so early in his career .
" i am a big fan of vettel because he developed himself steadily , starting in the sport at a very young age , " he says .
" but now , he 's already a very experienced driver .
he still makes some mistakes , but what really impresses me is that he is able to improve the development of his car , to help the mechanics make his car faster .
he 's getting better and better and better . "
the newey factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrian newey 's latest f1 masterpiece may be the 2009 red bull however , frentzen says that there 's more to red bull 's success than the talented young german behind the wheel .
adrian newey , red bull 's chief technical officer and designer , is a legend in formula one circles .
he has designed a slew of blisteringly quick f1 cars for williams and then mclaren mercedes over the years .
" i have also driven an adrian newey car in 1997 , " frentzen points out .
" for me , when i was closely involved in f1 , he was the best aerodynamic engineer in the sport , and the cars he built were always fantastic . "
" and remember that if vettel had n't won that race -lsb- in china -rsb- , then his teammate mark webber would have won instead .
also , rookie sebastien buemi was up there fighting with double world champion fernando alonso , also in an adrian newey car .
so i have to give the credit to the team as well , they 've built a fantstic car this season . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frentzen knows first hand that an adrian newey car is usually a fast car f1 's drastic rule changes meant that designers could n't simply improve on the foundation of their 2008 models in 2009 .
innovation was the order of the day , as design teams all along the pitlane went back to the drawing board .
taking this into account , the success of red bull with adrian newey 's involvement , and of championship leaders brawn gp with a car developed by ross brawn , the mastermind of michael schumacher 's dominant years with benetton and ferrari , seems a little less shocking .
however , these relatively small teams may yet struggle to maintain their early season advantage .
there are bigger , richer outfits working round the clock to close the gap on formula one 's unlikely front-runners .

merck finck analyst konrad becker told news agency afp the weak response by investors so far was not surpising , because " people often wait until the very last day before deciding to sell in hopes the purchaser will raise the offer . "
only 1.28 percent of shares had been acquired as of thursday afternoon , soffin said .

laura ling and euna lee were arrested on march 17 near the tumen river , which runs along the border between north korea and china , while reporting on north korean refugees for san francisco-based current-tv .
north korea has accused them of illegally entering its territory with " hostile " intent .
the associated press reports the journalists could face at least five years in prison if they are convicted of espionage under north korean law .
the planned trial comes as the reclusive state faces un security council condemnation for its april 5 launch of a long-range rocket , which regional powers say was a ballistic missile test .
frustration with north korea has grown after pyongyang said it would cancel all agreements to dismantle its nuclear program and quit six-party disarmament talks with south korea , the united states , japan , russia and china .
us secretary of state hillary clinton said on wednesday washington was willing to have a dialogue with pyongyang but urged the world not to give in to its unpredictable behavior . sje / nrt , reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the proposed law change would bar members of management and supervisory boards from cashing in their stock options during their period of employment .
it would also set senior executives ' personal liability for breaches of duty at up to one year 's salary in every instance .
currently most german executives obtain personal-liability insurance at their employer 's expense , meaning that even if they are sued , the full sum of damages must be paid by the insurer .
the new liability rule would mean that if a court imposed a 5-million-euro damages award on an executive who is paid 2 million euros per annum , the insurer would pay 3 million while the executive would pay the other 2 million .
the points agreed to on thursday are to be passed on to the justice ministry to be formulated into formal draft laws that must still be approved by both houses of parliament .
as in other nations , germans have expressed outrage at executives escaping penalty for past misdeeds and obtaining huge remuneration , even when their companies are in deep financial trouble and sacking staff .

berlin would ask the shareholders at a meeting on june 2 to vote for an increase in equity from just under 700 million euros -lrb- $ 925 million -rrb- at present to 6.3 billion euros , with the german state pumping in all the new funds .
the equity issue would sharply dilute the stakes of the existing shareholders , leaving them with less than a 10th of voting stock .
the new equity would be held by soffin , the government agency charged with helping german banks via guarantees and equity infusions .
soffin disclosed earlier in frankfurt that a government takeover offer for hre of 1.39 euros per share had made little progress .
merck finck analyst konrad becker told news agency afp the weak response by investors so far was not surpising , because " people often wait until the very last day before deciding to sell in hopes the purchaser will raise the offer . "
only 1.28 percent of shares had been acquired as of thursday afternoon , soffin said .
that brought berlin 's present stake to 9.94 percent .
the move could come at his expense of us investor jc flowers , who heads a consortium owning almost 24 percent of shares in hre .
so far , he has been dismissive towards the bid .
" accept bid " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are real fears hre could go the way of lehman brothers but the hre supervisory and executive boards advised shareholders friday to accept the takeover bid for their shares .
that offer expires on may 4 .
hre stock rose 1.4 percent in stock-market trading friday to 1.41 euros .
last month , germany legislated compulsory purchase powers in case the shareholders did not accept the bid .
chancellor angela merkel 's government is concerned that a collapse of hre could lead to the sort of financial market chaos that followed the failure of us investment bank lehman brothers in september last year .
hre 's problems arose at its depfa bank unit , which operated from largely deregulated dublin .
depfa is a principal lender to german local government , raising bond issues for roads and new buildings .
the government has so far given the bank support worth 102 billion euros .

carstensen said big differences remained on financing technological improvements and meeting targeted emissions cuts .
" we need countries like japan , canada , russia and the us to come out and say what exactly is it that we want to contribute , " he said .
" we need to see a stronger and more articulated political will on the side of developed countries to move this really forward . "

an elusive global warming pact still looks unlikely anytime before a un climate change conference in copenhagen in december , when it is hoped a global strategy for the post-kyoto protocol era can be laid down .
g8 industrial countries and major developing economies meeting on the island of sicily signed a charter pledging to tackle deforestation , curb illegal trade in wildlife and boost research into the rate of species loss .
extinction rates are currently running at around 1,000 times their natural pace , with three species vanishing every hour , according to un statistics .
time running out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim steiner was unconvinced leaving the syracuse meeting " we set objectives on biodiversity for 2010 ... but unfortunately we have all recognized they have not been met , " said italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo , who hosted the summit .
" we are all convinced of the urgency ... of intervening to safeguard our biodiversity , " she said .
the head of the un environment program , achim steiner , said several significant hurdles still needed ironing out .
these included setting targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and financing the greening of developing countries .
key nations , he said , are coming to the realization that time is running out ahead of the un talks in copenhagen .
" i leave syracuse very much concerned that there is no clear pathway to resolving the gaps that remain , " he said . details please kim carstensen , director of the world wide fund for nature ’ s global climate initiative , said after the meeting that the charter on curbing biodiversity loss sends out a clear message on the importance of biodiversity , but was lacking in details .
" it 's a political signal of a will that is higher than i think we 've seen before at this level , and that i think is positive , " he said .
" but in terms of actual implementation , it 's not at all at the level of an action plan , or funded , which would also be nice .
and which would be needed as a next step going forward .
he remarked that ministers ’ agreement that action to move toward a low carbon economy was needed now rather than later could be an important signal for the coming talks in copenhagen .
differences of opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developed and emerging economies will both need to come to the table the g8 grouping of rich nations , along with emerging economies such as china , brazil and india , agreed at the meeting that climate change and species extinction were linked , and emphasized the economic value of preserving biodiversity .
but the game of chicken between industrialized and developing nations over who should foot the bill for plans to mitigate or even reverse climate change looks unlikely to end .
carstensen said big differences remained on financing technological improvements and meeting targeted emissions cuts .
" we need countries like japan , canada , russia and the us to come out and say what exactly is it that we want to contribute , " he said .
" we need to see a stronger and more articulated political will on the side of developed countries to move this really forward . "
reimund schwarze , head of climate change policy at the helmholtz center for environmental research in leipzig , germany , said emerging economies like china will have to make sacrifices too .
" china not only has to move ahead , it has to accept the fact that in the very long run they will be in the role of giving financial aid to other countries , " he said .
the leaders of 16 major economies are due to meet in washington on monday for further talks aimed at generating political leadership for the end-of-year un climate change meeting in denmark .
environmentalists will hope , by then , that both developed and developing countries will be ready to back up their intentions with concrete actions .

the proposed law change would bar members of management and supervisory boards from cashing in their stock options during their period of employment .
it would also set senior executives ' personal liability for breaches of duty at up to one year 's salary in every instance .
currently most german executives obtain personal-liability insurance at their employer 's expense , meaning that even if they are sued , the full sum of damages must be paid by the insurer .
the new liability rule would mean that if a court imposed a 5-million-euro damages award on an executive who is paid 2 million euros per annum , the insurer would pay 3 million while the executive would pay the other 2 million .
the points agreed to on thursday are to be passed on to the justice ministry to be formulated into formal draft laws that must still be approved by both houses of parliament .
as in other nations , germans have expressed outrage at executives escaping penalty for past misdeeds and obtaining huge remuneration , even when their companies are in deep financial trouble and sacking staff .
germany has been pushing for an overhaul of the global financial framework and has blamed the world recession on the " casino capitalism " prevalent in the united states and britain . sje / nrt , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

time running out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim steiner was unconvinced leaving the syracuse meeting " we set objectives on biodiversity for 2010 ... but unfortunately we have all recognized they have not been met , " said italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo , who hosted the summit .
" we are all convinced of the urgency ... of intervening to safeguard our biodiversity , " she said .
the head of the un environment program , achim steiner , said several significant hurdles still needed ironing out .
these included setting targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and financing the greening of developing countries .
key nations , he said , are coming to the realization that time is running out ahead of the un talks in copenhagen .
" i leave syracuse very much concerned that there is no clear pathway to resolving the gaps that remain , " he said . details please kim carstensen , director of the world wide fund for nature ’ s global climate initiative , said after the meeting that the charter on curbing biodiversity loss sends out a clear message on the importance of biodiversity , but was lacking in details .
" it 's a political signal of a will that is higher than i think we 've seen before at this level , and that i think is positive , " he said .
" but in terms of actual implementation , it 's not at all at the level of an action plan , or funded , which would also be nice .
and which would be needed as a next step going forward .
he remarked that ministers ’ agreement that action to move toward a low carbon economy was needed now rather than later could be an important signal for the coming talks in copenhagen .
differences of opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developed and emerging economies will both need to come to the table the g8 grouping of rich nations , along with emerging economies such as china , brazil and india , agreed at the meeting that climate change and species extinction were linked , and emphasized the economic value of preserving biodiversity .
but the game of chicken between industrialized and developing nations over who should foot the bill for plans to mitigate or even reverse climate change looks unlikely to end .
carstensen said big differences remained on financing technological improvements and meeting targeted emissions cuts .
" we need countries like japan , canada , russia and the us to come out and say what exactly is it that we want to contribute , " he said .
" we need to see a stronger and more articulated political will on the side of developed countries to move this really forward . "
reimund schwarze , head of climate change policy at the helmholtz center for environmental research in leipzig , germany , said emerging economies like china will have to make sacrifices too .
" china not only has to move ahead , it has to accept the fact that in the very long run they will be in the role of giving financial aid to other countries , " he said .
the leaders of 16 major economies are due to meet in washington on monday for further talks aimed at generating political leadership for the end-of-year un climate change meeting in denmark .
environmentalists will hope , by then , that both developed and developing countries will be ready to back up their intentions with concrete actions .

the original strategic arms reduction treaty , or start , is set to expire in december . at a joint news conference at the us embassy in rome , negotiators described the one-day preliminary talks as a " productive beginning . "
us assistant secretary of state for verification and compliance rose gottemoeller said that friday 's meeting " got off to a fast start . " the talks focused largely on procedural issues and paved the way for the start of formal negotiations next month .
talks will be held in washington and moscow in may and june ahead of us president barack obama 's first visit to russia in july .
anatoly antonov , the chief of security and disarmament issues at the russian foreign ministry , said the two sides hoped they would meet the december deadline for a new treaty .
" we are sure that this new treaty will help to improve relations between the us and the russian federation , " added antonov .
a new start under obama ?
the first start arms control treaty , signed in 1991 , committed both russia and the us to cutting their nuclear arsenals , including reducing missile numbers to a maximum of 1,600 and warheads to no more than 6,000 . this led to steep reduction in nuclear weapons stocks on both sides .
the two countries agreed on a successor treaty , start ii , in 1993 , but russia ’ s parliament never ratified it .
and when us president barack obama 's predecessor george w. bush pulled the us out of the anti-ballistic missile treaty in 2002 , russia said it would give up plans of ever bringing start ii into force .
the initiative to resume talks toward a new start treaty was launched at the recent g-20 summit in london by russian president dmitri medvedev and barack obama , after which obama vowed to press for a world free of nuclear weapons . wl / jam , dpa / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the time is right for a new beginning on nuclear disarmament , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said , referring to an agreement earlier this month between us president barack obama and his russian counterpart , dimitry medvedev , aimed at negotiating a new deal on strategic nuclear arms reduction .
in the debate , the german foreign minister outlined steps which he said were crucial for reaching the goal of a nuclear-free world .
he said us-russian talks on a follow-up to the strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start 1 -rrb- , due to expire in december , must be successfully completed .
in addition , iran and north korea - two countries thought to be on the threshold of becoming nuclear powers - must be convinced to enter talks on their nuclear programs as proposed by the us president .
other efforts must be made on reducing the number of short- and medium-range nuclear weapons and to unfreeze negotiations on conventional arms reduction .
scrap nukes in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner hoyer -lrb- fdp -rrb- wants to rid germany of nuclear weapons in separate motions , germany ’ s opposition parties - the environmentalist greens , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the left party - called on the government to press for the removal of american tactical nuclear weapons based on german soil .
the weapons are a remnant of the cold war , although details about their number and location are not known .
" it ’ s a myth that the scrapping of these weapons would go along with a loss of security for germany and reduced influence in decision-making at nato , " the fdp ’ s foreign policy expert werner hoyer said in reference to the government ’ s stance that the weapons are important .
gregor gysi , the parliamentary leader of the left party , also urged chancellor angela merkel to abandon her policy of participation in nato ’ s nuclear strategy .
under nato policy , non-nuclear alliance members must provide troops and technical assistance in the event of a nuclear strike .
greece and canada have already opted out of this strategy .
gysi said germany should become the third nato country to do so .
" the idea that a departure from this policy would diminish german influence in nato is cold war thinking , " he added .
cool response by the government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel rejects calls for us nuclear weapons to be withdrawn from german soil eckart von klaeden , foreign policy expert of chancellor merkel 's conservative cdu , expressed skepticism about the demands .
" unfortunately we ’ ve seen a rapid increase in the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the world , " he said .
stressing that iran was on the verge of becoming a nuclear power , and that india and pakistan are eager to upgrade their nuclear weapons technology , he said that the tactical nuclear arms based in germany were an important part of nato ’ s policy of nuclear deterrence .
" president obama himself has stressed , " he concluded , " that his drive towards disarmament must go hand in hand with maintaining security for his country and that of its nato partners . "
the social democratic-conservative coalition government used its large majority to turn down the motions put foward by the opposition .
a nuclear-free germany can only be part of nato ’ s disarmament inititative , they said , and not the start of it . uh / pfd / jam , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it bans secret paternity tests and severely restricts the use of genetic testing by employers and insurance companies . health minister ulla schmidt welcomed the new law as a crucial step in protecting the rights of patients .
she said that after 10 years of discussions a legal framework had been put in place that would prevent the abuse of sensitive personal data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister schmidt says the law is crucial to protect patients genetic testing can be used to determine a person 's disposition to develop certain illnesses such as cancer - information which in the hands of an employer or a health insurance company could easily lead to discrimination .
the new legislation defines under which circumstances an analysis of genetic material is legal .
now , testing can only be conducted with the patient 's consent and after consultation with a doctor .
medical tourism to find out who 's the father ?
under the new law , paternity tests , for example , will be only legal if both the woman and man agree .
conducting a secret test can result in a fine of up to 5,000 euros .
paternity tests during pregnancy will be only legal in cases of sexual abuse or rape .
the german medical association however has warned that this might lead to medical tourism , with people trying to get genetic testing done abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who 's the father ?
clandestine testing will be illegal employers will also be affected by the new law .
they will not be able to demand a genetic test from their employees to check for illnesses or health problems .
the only exceptions to the rule are if some specific jobs entail potential health risks - as can be the case in the chemical industry .
insurance companies may not demand that their clients undergo genetic testing - with exceptions only in cases in which the pay-out sum is very high .
critics say there are too many exceptions the need for a clear law on the issue had been expressed by all parties across the political spectrum - but the details of the new legislation have been controversial .
the opposition green party , the free democratic party and the left party have all criticised the law for not going far enough and being open to too many loopholes . ai / pfd , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a former chairman of the social democrats suggested on public radio that german workers , just like their french counterparts , should kidnap their boss if they 're worried about their future . the leader of germany ’ s left party has urged german workers to copy the example of disgruntled french counterparts and kidnap their bosses .
several managers in france who announced restructuring measures to deal with the economic crisis have been detained in factories in recent weeks by employees who fear losing their jobs .
managers from companies in france , including molex , sony , 3m and hewlett-packard , have all reported " bossnapping " incidents .
" when the government continues to do nothing , there is increasing danger that the far-right will gain in strength , " warned oskar lafontaine on public radio wdr .
the left party has also been calling for national strikes to be legalized again .
despite these warnings , experts see there is little risk of serious social unrest and mass protests breaking out in europe 's biggest economy .
the left party was established two years ago and is made up largely of former east german communists and disaffected social democrats , including its former chairman oskar lafontaine .
he quit former chancellor gerhard schroeder 's cabinet because he found its policies too centrist .
unexpected support from presidential candidate lafontaine 's " bossnapping " suggestions have received unexpected support from the social democrat presidential candidate gesine schwan who " warned of growing anger throughout the country . "
she was immediately sharply criticized from within her own party for scaremongering and spreading excessive pessimism .
" the economy is doing badly , but we are a long way from social unrest , " warned spd colleague , dieter wiefelspuetz .
" it does n't do anyone any good to be talking about unrest erupting here or in france or anywhere else , " said peter struck , the head of the bundestag faction of the social democrats .
" that is undermining efforts by the federal government which is doing everything possible to help make it easier for people to get through the crisis . "
german chancellor angela merkel said at a meeting of senior christian democrat party officials that she does not share the concerns that social unrest will break out .
" it is totally irresponsible to encourage panic and fear and to predict things that do not correspond with reality , " she said . wl / mrh , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the only viable future for northern ireland is a totally peaceful and reconciled future based on mutual respect and a shared commitment to peaceful and democratic means of dealing with age-old political differences .
" our meeting today with the uprg is , in my view , a reason to be hopeful about the future . "
guns while the issue of uda decommissioning had expected to be on the agenda during the two-hour meeting , uprg spokesman frankie gallagher said the issue was not discussed .
he said the matter of the uda 's continued possession of guns was a matter for that organisation to address itself .
he added : " we acknowledge the concerns expressed by cardinal brady of the fears that exist within the catholic community as many of the protestant community share similar fears from extreme nationalist elements , " he said .
" these elements want to take us back to a bloody past where many lives were lost ; we hope that today 's meeting has gone some way to alleviating those fears and understand that a lot more work is still to be done .
" the uprg states quite clearly , there will be no going back ; we are building a new future . "

labour is well behind in uk opinion polls and with the government in westminster mired down by the economic crisis , and the assembly government facing painful spending decisions , delegates are desperately in need of a boost to their morale .
party members ' spirits have been further battered by what are seen as the self inflicted wounds over mps allowances and the damien mcbride affair .
with the european elections just six weeks away and a general election to follow within a year , time is short for the party to make up lost ground .
the european elections are seen as a crucial test for the party , with both plaid cymru and the conservatives predicting that labour could come second or third in terms of the popular vote in wales - for the first time since the 1930s .
' low ebb ' welsh labour insiders admit that the party is at a low ebb both in terms of popular support and organisationally .
following last year 's disastrous local council results the party has been forced to merge branches in attempt to construct a more effective campaigning force .
speaking before the conference , first minister rhodri morgan appealed to welsh voters to keep faith with the party .
he said : " in these difficult economic times labour does not give up on people .
" we are keeping welsh people as close to the job market as possible , with training and investment in skills for those who need it . "
mr morgan also cautioned the party against looking inward , saying that he was " reaching out " beyond the party membership .
" labour has done the heavy-lifting , with the health service , the minimum wage and devolution , but the work is not done , " he added .
' possible successors ' with mr morgan planning to retire from the leadership later this year possible successors are certain to use the conference to raise their profiles , although with party unity at a premium they 'll be eager to avoid appearing to be campaigning .
attempts are also likely to further ease tensions between the party 's mps and ams following a series of " away days " designed to bring the two groups closer together .
in an article for the " tribune " newspaper , wrexham mp ian lucas appealed to the two groups to work together across a broad range of issues .
mr lucas said that politicians must " shift the focus away from obsession with the processes of government and towards policy " .
the importance being attached to this year 's conference is clear from the number of party 's heavy hitters who will be addressing the delegates , with deputy leader harriet harman and her predecessor john prescott both delivering keynote speeches .

step by step the tweets gave an insight into what it is like to be in custody in cairo .
the outspoken egyptian blogger wael abbas and palestinian journalist laila el haddad both shared the minute details of their experience of custody , in two separate incidents , with fellow twitter users .
in about 40 tweets , wael abbas managed to inform his readers of his day-long experience in a cairo city centre police station , where he had gone to complain about an alleged assault by two men , one of them a police officer , but ended up being arrested himself .
abbas started his day by tweeting : " fyi -lrb- for your information -rrb- , i 'm currently under arrest , if u did not hear from me today then i was not released " .
but using his mobile phone , he carried on blogging during his eight hours of custody .
the number of his page followers increased dramatically during the day -lrb- 11 april -rrb- , adding around 300 new followers , as his friends re-tweeted his messages , spreading them around to reach more readers .
by the end of the day , fellow activists , and a number of lawyers had arrived at the police station to offer their support .
abbas wrote while moving between two stations : " fellow bloggers , activists and lawyers are following us in their cars to the police station " .
he told bbc that his was not a political case .
" but it goes in line with the issues that i raise in my blog on the abuse of police power against citizens " he added .
wael abbas 's blogging was a dynamic , up-to-the-minute stream .
at nearly midnight he wrote " i 'm free now and safe for the moment " stuck at airport earlier this month the 31- year-old palestinian female journalist laila el haddad was travelling from washington dc to cairo on the way to her home which is the gaza strip but the egyptian authorities would n't allow her into the country .
in her message , she said " i was placed in a detention room with 17 others for 3 hours then taken to a room and asked if that 's what i wanted for the foreseeable future " .
i was sick to my stomach and throwing up since 5am laila el haddad laila and her two children , yousuf and noor , were denied entry into egypt , as an officer put it , because palestinians without permanent residency are not allowed in as long as the rafah crossing point to gaza is closed .
she and her family had to wait two days before being told that they would be deported back to the us via london despite not having valid british and us visas .
on her page , she said she was " waiting and waiting .
this man has no answers and my file has disappeared or cast aside for the moment .
-lrb- i am -rrb- running out of diapers " .
she says that her favourite line from airport officials was " honestly , we did not get any sleep over your ordeal , we feel for you , really we do " .
laila and her children wondered why it was so difficult to go home .
she wrote " this must be a very high order because every call i have made has failed .
i told them it 's not my fault i have to go through egypt to get to my home in gaza " .
at noon on thursday she wrote a " quick tweet to let everyone know we were allowed back into the us - and that i am sick to my stomach and throwing up since 5am " .
restricted freedom the internet has been part of egyptian political life since the 2005 legislative elections , according to the group reporters without borders .
such direct communication with members of the public causes discomfort among the ruling elites in countries that are n't used to transparency and such open and immediate sharing of information .
reporters without borders says that in january alone , 31 legal cases were launched against bloggers and journalists .
gamal eid , director of the arabic network for human rights , said 2008 had been the worst year for freedom of expression since egypt was declared a republic in 1952 .
but with the proliferating ways of communicating across the internet , the authorities may struggle to be able to contain the ever-present appetite for debate about their actions and their impact on ordinary people .

restricted freedom the internet has been part of egyptian political life since the 2005 legislative elections , according to the group reporters without borders .

step by step the tweets gave an insight into what it is like to be in custody in cairo .
the outspoken egyptian blogger wael abbas and palestinian journalist laila el haddad both shared the minute details of their experience of custody , in two separate incidents , with fellow twitter users .
in about 40 tweets , wael abbas managed to inform his readers of his day-long experience in a cairo city centre police station , where he had gone to complain about an alleged assault by two men , one of them a police officer , but ended up being arrested himself .
abbas started his day by tweeting : " fyi -lrb- for your information -rrb- , i 'm currently under arrest , if u did not hear from me today then i was not released " .
but using his mobile phone , he carried on blogging during his eight hours of custody .
the number of his page followers increased dramatically during the day -lrb- 11 april -rrb- , adding around 300 new followers , as his friends re-tweeted his messages , spreading them around to reach more readers .
by the end of the day , fellow activists , and a number of lawyers had arrived at the police station to offer their support .
abbas wrote while moving between two stations : " fellow bloggers , activists and lawyers are following us in their cars to the police station " .
he told bbc that his was not a political case .
" but it goes in line with the issues that i raise in my blog on the abuse of police power against citizens " he added .
wael abbas 's blogging was a dynamic , up-to-the-minute stream .
at nearly midnight he wrote " i 'm free now and safe for the moment " stuck at airport earlier this month the 31- year-old palestinian female journalist laila el haddad was travelling from washington dc to cairo on the way to her home which is the gaza strip but the egyptian authorities would n't allow her into the country .
in her message , she said " i was placed in a detention room with 17 others for 3 hours then taken to a room and asked if that 's what i wanted for the foreseeable future " .
i was sick to my stomach and throwing up since 5am laila el haddad laila and her two children , yousuf and noor , were denied entry into egypt , as an officer put it , because palestinians without permanent residency are not allowed in as long as the rafah crossing point to gaza is closed .
she and her family had to wait two days before being told that they would be deported back to the us via london despite not having valid british and us visas .
on her page , she said she was " waiting and waiting .
this man has no answers and my file has disappeared or cast aside for the moment .
-lrb- i am -rrb- running out of diapers " .
she says that her favourite line from airport officials was " honestly , we did not get any sleep over your ordeal , we feel for you , really we do " .
laila and her children wondered why it was so difficult to go home .
she wrote " this must be a very high order because every call i have made has failed .
