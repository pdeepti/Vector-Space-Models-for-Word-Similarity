the statements " i never doped !
and i will never resort to doping ! " were clearly visible together with saturday 's date and pechstein 's signature . " there is no positive test .
i was banned on very shaky circumstantial evidence .
i ca n't help those who do n't believe me , but my conscience is clear , " pechstein said in an interview which the tabloid printed under the title " liar or victim ? " . asked why she had not made any public comments on the case when the sport 's ruling body , the isu , first informed her of the blood sample irregularities in february , pechstein responded that it was very difficult to get rid of the doping stigma once things were made public .
while apologizing for not coming clean with public at the time , pechstein offered a potential explanation for the irregularities of the blood samples . " there was an independent expert involved in my case who said it was possible i may have a blood disorder , " said pechstein . " close to blackmail " pechstein also told bild am sonntag that the isu had exerted strong pressure on her to make a split second decision to pull out of world championship competitions to avoid public scandal , adding that this experience came close to blackmail . pechstein also stepped up her media campaign against the doping ruling by appearing in a well-known german sports show on public broadcaster zdf on saturday , where she adamantly refuted all doping claims brought against her . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pechstein has won numerous speed skating medals for germany the isu handed pechstein a two-year ban for blood doping on july 3 . the isu said on its website on friday that it had found pechstein guilty of " the prohibited method of blood doping " from evidence gathered through the 37-year-old 's blood sample . pechstein is germany 's most successful winter olympian , having won nine medals overall – five of them gold – between 1992 and 2006 .
she is also a six-time world champion , with another 20 silver and eight bronze world championship medals to her credit . the isu said its decision was " based on the evidence of ms pechstein 's -lrb- sample -rrb- which included abnormal values and abnormal changes of values in a series of tests -lrb- in particular in the tests conducted during the essent isu world allround championships held in hamar on february 7-8 , 2009 -rrb- . " the two-year ban , which expires on february 8 , 2011 , means pechstein will miss the 2010 winter olympics in vancouver and , given her age , may even end her career .
the isu said pechstein had chosen to appeal against the ban before the court of arbitration for sport . nk / dfm / dpa / ap / sid / bams editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it comes as israeli premier benjamin netanyahu has referred to a ' ' two-state solution " for the first time . the aim of minister frank-walter steinmeier 's two-day trip is to jumpstart the dormant peace process .
on monday , he is to hold talks with israeli president shimon peres , prime minister benyamin netanyahu , and foreign minister avigdor lieberman in jerusalem .
he will also visit lebanon and syria .
steinmeier has been among world leaders who have criticized israeli settlement building programs in east jerusalem and the west bank .
thus far , netanyahu 's government had refused to freeze settlement activities and had not agreed to a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu is known for his tough stance on the palestinian issue however , on sunday , netanyahu referred for the first time to a " two-state solution " to bring peace to the middle east .
" we have achieved a national agreement on the formula of two states for two peoples , " the israeli prime minister said during the weekly cabinet meeting .
steinmeier is expected to pay a visit to the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem on monday .
media reports said that a meeting planned with palestinian president mahmoud abbas in the west bank town of ramallah was not likely to take place , because abbas is visiting jordan for talks on forming a palestinian unity government with the rival hamas movement .
support for us efforts it will be steinmeier 's 14th trip to the region since becoming germany 's foreign minister in 2005 .
it involves an exacting schedule , covering nearly 6,500 kilometers and four countries in just 36 hours .
the whirlwind tour of the middle east is meant to lend impetus to germany 's desire for peace in the region as soon as possible , according to a foreign ministry spokesman in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the obama administration wants to reinvigorate the peace process " we have had new momentum in the middle east peace process since the new government took office in washington and we support its fresh efforts to reach a two-state solution and a return to negotiations , " said andreas peschke ahead of steinmeier 's trip .
peschke added that berlin was pursuing a middle east policy focused on practical assistance on the ground , including development assistance for the palestinians and training for security forces in the territories to help prepare for eventual statehood .
during his visit to the west bank on monday , steinmeier will assess the progress of such projects .
the foreign ministry spokesman said that germany 's engagement in the region was determined in consultation with its european partners and the government of us president barack obama .
the new administration in washington consulted berlin in the conceptual stages of the reorientation of its middle east policy . in a further reflection of the ongoing efforts to harmonize international peace efforts in the region , steinmeier held intensive discussions via telephone with his american counterpart hillary clinton and the us the middle east mediator george mitchell , prior to his middle east trip .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syrian president assad has been engaging the international community neighbors have crucial role german officials said steinmeier hoped to persuade neighboring arab states to play a more active role in diplomatic efforts to end the israeli-palestinian conflict .
acknowledging the crucial role of the neighbors in any peace process , foreign ministry spokesman andreas peschke said that germany saw several rays of hope in the region , including last month 's peaceful elections in lebanon and improved relations between lebanon and syria .
he added that all these factors presented a " window of opportunity . "
in light of these developments , steinmeier will also travel to damascus for talks with his syrian counterpart wali al-muallem and president bashar al-assad .
in the past , steinmeier , who is set to challenge chancellor angela merkel in september 's general election , faced criticism from the chancellery and the us administration for his efforts to engage syria .
however , the obama administration has dramatically softened washington 's stance towards damascus .
and this week , the us announced that it would send an ambassador back to damascus after a four-year gap .
the move comes amid a region-wide campaign to lay the groundwork for middle east peace .
in response , president assad invited obama to visit syria .
when he travels to the lebanese capital beirut , steinmeier will become the first western politician to meet prime minister-designate saad hariri , the son of former premier rafik hariri , who was killed in a bomb blast in 2005 .
hariri 's pro-western alliance won last month 's general elections .
some observers say germany is aware that it does not have the influence to broker middle east peace on its own , but that steinmeier clearly wants to be part of the obama administration 's efforts in that direction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : settlement activity in the occupied territories is a point of contention issue on g8 agenda the trip comes ahead of next week 's g8 summit in italy .
chancellor merkel indicated last week that the middle east conflict would figure prominently in those talks .
she said " concessions from all sides were necessary , " for the peace process to succeed .
calling for a halt to the construction of israeli settlements , merkel said " there has to be a freeze .
otherwise i am convinced we will not achieve the two-state solution that we urgently need - a jewish state of israel and a palestinian state that can live in security .

it comes as israeli premier benjamin netanyahu has referred to a ' ' two-state solution " for the first time . the aim of minister frank-walter steinmeier 's two-day trip is to jumpstart the dormant peace process .
on monday , he is to hold talks with israeli president shimon peres , prime minister benyamin netanyahu , and foreign minister avigdor lieberman in jerusalem .
he will also visit lebanon and syria .
steinmeier has been among world leaders who have criticized israeli settlement building programs in east jerusalem and the west bank .
thus far , netanyahu 's government had refused to freeze settlement activities and had not agreed to a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu is known for his tough stance on the palestinian issue however , on sunday , netanyahu referred for the first time to a " two-state solution " to bring peace to the middle east .
" we have achieved a national agreement on the formula of two states for two peoples , " the israeli prime minister said during the weekly cabinet meeting .
steinmeier is expected to pay a visit to the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem on monday .
media reports said that a meeting planned with palestinian president mahmoud abbas in the west bank town of ramallah was not likely to take place , because abbas is visiting jordan for talks on forming a palestinian unity government with the rival hamas movement .
support for us efforts it will be steinmeier 's 14th trip to the region since becoming germany 's foreign minister in 2005 .
it involves an exacting schedule , covering nearly 6,500 kilometers and four countries in just 36 hours .
the whirlwind tour of the middle east is meant to lend impetus to germany 's desire for peace in the region as soon as possible , according to a foreign ministry spokesman in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the obama administration wants to reinvigorate the peace process " we have had new momentum in the middle east peace process since the new government took office in washington and we support its fresh efforts to reach a two-state solution and a return to negotiations , " said andreas peschke ahead of steinmeier 's trip .
peschke added that berlin was pursuing a middle east policy focused on practical assistance on the ground , including development assistance for the palestinians and training for security forces in the territories to help prepare for eventual statehood .
during his visit to the west bank on monday , steinmeier will assess the progress of such projects .
the foreign ministry spokesman said that germany 's engagement in the region was determined in consultation with its european partners and the government of us president barack obama .
the new administration in washington consulted berlin in the conceptual stages of the reorientation of its middle east policy . in a further reflection of the ongoing efforts to harmonize international peace efforts in the region , steinmeier held intensive discussions via telephone with his american counterpart hillary clinton and the us the middle east mediator george mitchell , prior to his middle east trip .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syrian president assad has been engaging the international community neighbors have crucial role german officials said steinmeier hoped to persuade neighboring arab states to play a more active role in diplomatic efforts to end the israeli-palestinian conflict .
acknowledging the crucial role of the neighbors in any peace process , foreign ministry spokesman andreas peschke said that germany saw several rays of hope in the region , including last month 's peaceful elections in lebanon and improved relations between lebanon and syria .
he added that all these factors presented a " window of opportunity . "
in light of these developments , steinmeier will also travel to damascus for talks with his syrian counterpart wali al-muallem and president bashar al-assad .
in the past , steinmeier , who is set to challenge chancellor angela merkel in september 's general election , faced criticism from the chancellery and the us administration for his efforts to engage syria .
however , the obama administration has dramatically softened washington 's stance towards damascus .
and this week , the us announced that it would send an ambassador back to damascus after a four-year gap .
the move comes amid a region-wide campaign to lay the groundwork for middle east peace .
in response , president assad invited obama to visit syria .
when he travels to the lebanese capital beirut , steinmeier will become the first western politician to meet prime minister-designate saad hariri , the son of former premier rafik hariri , who was killed in a bomb blast in 2005 .
hariri 's pro-western alliance won last month 's general elections .
some observers say germany is aware that it does not have the influence to broker middle east peace on its own , but that steinmeier clearly wants to be part of the obama administration 's efforts in that direction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : settlement activity in the occupied territories is a point of contention issue on g8 agenda the trip comes ahead of next week 's g8 summit in italy .
chancellor merkel indicated last week that the middle east conflict would figure prominently in those talks .
she said " concessions from all sides were necessary , " for the peace process to succeed .
calling for a halt to the construction of israeli settlements , merkel said " there has to be a freeze .
otherwise i am convinced we will not achieve the two-state solution that we urgently need - a jewish state of israel and a palestinian state that can live in security .

ecclestone , 78 , praised the virtues of strong leadership and condemned contemporary politicians for their weakness .

"
ecclestone also criticised ousting saddam hussein and the taliban . the comment , made to the times newspaper in an interview published on friday , has led to a furore among jewish groups and politicians .
ecclestone , 78 , praised the virtues of strong leadership and condemned contemporary politicians for their weakness .
the times quoted ecclestone as saying that democracy " has n't done a lot of good for many countries , including this one . "
" in a lot of ways , terrible to say this i suppose , " ecclestone said , " but apart from the fact that hitler got taken away and persuaded to do things that i have no idea whether he wanted to do or not , he was in the way that he could command a lot of people , able to get things done . "
ecclestone told the paper that politicians were too worried about elections and that he would support the concept of a government based on tyranny .
" we did a terrible thing when we supported the idea of getting rid of saddam hussein , " ecclestone went on to say , " he was the only one who could control that country . "
" it was the same -lrb- with the taliban -rrb- .
we move into countries and we have no idea of the culture . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max mosley- prime ministerial material ?
he went on to include british prime minister margaret thatcher , and max mosley , outgoing head of formula one 's governing body , as leadership examples - even suggesting max mosley should be britain 's prime minister .
eccleston went on to say " the americans probably thought bosnia was a town in miami .
there are people starving in africa and we sit back and do nothing but we get involved in things we should leave alone . "
jewish groups have crticized the comments , with a spokesman for the board of deputies of british jews calling them " quite bizarre . "
meanwhile , stephen pollard , editor of the jewish chronicle , said ecclestone was either " an idiot or morally repulsive . "
" either he has no idea how stupid and offensive his views are , or he does - and deserves to be held in contempt by all decent people , " he said .
ecclestone 's remarks are certain to revive memories of the controversy around reports of a bizarre sex scandal involving fia president max mosley .
the head of motorsport 's ruling body fia and son of the british fascist leader sir oswald mosley last year sued the news of the world for breach of privacy after the newspaper alleged he had taken part in a seemingly concentration camp-themed scene involving five prostitutes. ch / dpa / ape editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sofia 's mayor boiko borisov has taken the prize exit polls by sova harris and alpha research suggested gerb would take between 115 and 117 seats in the 240-strong chamber , compared with 39 to 42 seats for the ruling socialists . if the exit polls are confirmed , there may be a hung parliament : both gerb and the socialists will need more than one ally to form a governing coalition . " we 'll wait and see what the final results are , and the distribution of parliamentary seats .
then we 'll analyse our options , " borisov said . potential partners although borisov and stanishev have been tight-lipped about potential coalition partners , both men have reportedly rejected a left-right alliance .
they have also ruled out a coalition with the ultra nationalist ataka party , which took 8.8-9.2 percent of sunday 's vote , according to the exit polls . gerb 's most likely partner , the blue coalition of two small udf and dsb parties , reportedly secured 7.5-8.2 percent of votes . the turkish minority mrf party - the socialists ' current junior coalition partner - was credited with 11.3-13.5 percent . smaller parties such as the centrist nmsp of former king simeon saxe coburg , the nationalist olj party or the business formation lider could play a crucial role in forming the next government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist leader sergey stanishev is not smiling now " the most important thing now is an anti-crisis programme and cracking down on political corruption , " said martin dimitrov , the co-leader of the rightist blue coalition . the current government under sergey stanishev , which led bulgaria to eu membership in 2007 , has come under strong pressure from brussels to fight the country 's endemic corruption and organized crime . as a result , it did not come as a surprise that sunday 's election was marred by allegations of irregularities , particularly vote buying . with official results expected on monday , coalition talks could drag on for months and observers have voiced concern about a political impasse at a time when the economic crisis is expected to peak in bulgaria . some analysts have warned that bulgaria may even be forced to turn to the international monetary fund for help , joining several of its neighbours in central and eastern europe including hungary , latvia , romania and serbia . nk / afp / reuters / dpa editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 05.07.2009 financial crisis hits african trade , aid as wto gears up for summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trade is an important way of helping africa the world trade organization is preparing to review its aid for trade initiative at an international conference in geneva .
the trade situation of developing countries in the economic crisis will be top of the agenda . give developing countries the tools to improve their position as trade partners and both their own development and the international trade situation will also improve .
that 's the idea behind " aid for trade , " which the wto launched in hong kong four years ago , wto director general pascal lamy tells deutsche welle .
" developing countries very often face trade barriers , which either stem from their own infrastructure - for example roadways , transport or energy - or they face technical trade barriers , for example if someone wants to export flowers to the us or to europe he will have to meet the maximum pesticide residue standard , " he says .
africa , more so than any other continent , faces these kinds of problems as it tries to increase its trade capacity .
and to make matter worse , lamy says , africa has seen a decrease in participation in international trade over the last 10 years .
" in absolute value african trade has grown , but in relative value , as compared to the whole world trade , it has decreased , " he explains .
" the fundamental point for africa is , one , trying to diversify exports to meet international demand , and , two , making sure that inter-african trade grows .
at the moment the trade between african countries is incredibly low . "
lamy underlines that international trade accounts for around 15 percent of economic activity in europe and the us , but three to four times as much in africa .
" hence the enormous importance of keeping trade open during the crisis , which means fighting protectionism , because that would hit developing countries most .
and then , keeping investment in the future so they can trade their way out of the crisis . "
downward spiral bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more trade with the eu and within africa will make a difference the ongoing international economic crisis has hit africa in particular , dr. mohammed ibn chambas tells deutsche welle .
chambas is executive secretary of ecowas , the economic community of west african states .
he explains the downward spiral : the shrinking global economy leads to lower demand for commodities from west africa and africa as a whole .
lower demand also means lower prices .
but there is more : " the strong global growth led to 5 percent growth in africa in the year preceding the crisis , " he says .
" the slowdown has of course led to a reduced african growth rate .
we will end 2009 at less than 3 percent .
that is not good because it 's very close to the population growth rate .
" secondly the transfer of funds from african diasporas is also invested in many activities for expanding trade , export trade in particular .
and all of this has obviously now been reduced . "
chambas says he is also worried that donor countries may reduce their support for the aid for trade program because of the crisis .
" of course aid for trade funding is dependant on support of the economies of the developed countries .
and now that these economies are under stress and in recession , naturally there is likely to be a shuffle in the promised resources .
these are legitimate concerns that we have on the african side , that not all the pledges that have been made will be provided . "
european responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without trade , illegal immigration will continue chambas says europe has a special duty to increase its aid to africa .
" the bulk of african trade is with europe .
we believe that the partnership between europe and africa should translate into concrete support for africa to reduce the impact of the global crisis , " he says .
" it 's a historic relationship that we can not wish away and i believe that in the context of this new partnership we should see how we can work together , europe and africa , to overcome the current economic slowdown . "
john clancy , spokesman for european commissioner for development and humanitarian aid louis michel , says europe 's history with africa is unique , and that the focus should be on measures to improve that relationship .
" i think what is important is not to look backward to the past , but to the present day and the future .
aid for trade is about partnership .
it is a complimentary aspect to assisting developing countries , those in africa in particular .
it should soften , to some extent , the changes that have to take place at a socio-economic level in these countries , so that they can profit from the global marketplace more than before . "

financial institutes remain reluctant to lend despite having received billions in finanical aid . german finance minister peer steinbrueck has warned banking managers over their reluctance to lend .
in sunday 's edition of the tabloid bild he says he was doubtful that a bill passed on friday in berlin to allow german banks to park their toxic assets in a so-called bad bank structure will be enough to get the banks back into the business of providing credit . instead , he 's threatening banks with unnamed sanctions should a credit crunch be the result of their too conservative lending policies .
his warning is that the government and the central bank will have to take steps to force the bankers ' hand .
these as yet unspecified actions , steinbrueck warns , would include measures never before used against financial institutions in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck warned banking managers over their reluctance to lend late last year , banks all over the world demanded billions in financial aid from their governments .
otherwise , they said , they would be forced into bankruptcy with unforeseeable consequences for the world economy . governments from washington , to london , to tokyo to berlin complied , despite the enormously high political risk involved .
there was political consensus that the banks were simply too big to be allowed to fail . despite state aid , banks are reluctant to lend today , german banks are doing far better , but stand accused of still being reluctant to lend to businesses and companies which increasingly feel the pinch of the global recession . for months , small and medium sized companies in germany have been finding it more and more difficult - if not impossible - to keep credit lines with their banks open . " at the moment there is no credit crunch , " said martin wansleben , managing director of the german chamber of industry and commerce . " but more and more companies are having difficulty getting needed loans .
it 's more complicated .
it 's more expensive .
and many are simply being rejected outright . " but , could the german government actually force banks to lend money ?
finance minister peer steinbrueck refused to fuel speculation on that .
however , other politicians are less subtle in their warnings to the banks . condemnation from across party lines " we helped the banks with massive funding and political support , " saarland state premier peter mueller said on saturday . " now , it 's up to the banks to provide that help to companies . " the banks are accused of taking the government 's money but using it only to improve their own financial situation , not the country 's economy . " we must now ensure that banks are obliged to offer credit on a more liberal basis , " urged fritz kuhn , parliamentary leader of the greens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's president accused the banks of causing the crisis politicians of all parties are united in their determination to force german banks to make credit available over fears of unemployment rising even further due to a lack of credit for businesses . german president horst koehler - himself a former head of the world bank - added his voice to the critics in a television interview . " i appeal to the banks to do more to ensure that the economy can grow , " he said . koehler 's criticism of the banks was the most pointed of all .
he accused them of first causing the worldwide economic crisis and now hesitating to help find a solution for it . rd / afp / dpa editor : carl holm send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 05.07.2009 financial crisis hits african trade , aid as wto gears up for summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trade is an important way of helping africa the world trade organization is preparing to review its aid for trade initiative at an international conference in geneva .
the trade situation of developing countries in the economic crisis will be top of the agenda . give developing countries the tools to improve their position as trade partners and both their own development and the international trade situation will also improve .
that 's the idea behind " aid for trade , " which the wto launched in hong kong four years ago , wto director general pascal lamy tells deutsche welle .
" developing countries very often face trade barriers , which either stem from their own infrastructure - for example roadways , transport or energy - or they face technical trade barriers , for example if someone wants to export flowers to the us or to europe he will have to meet the maximum pesticide residue standard , " he says .
africa , more so than any other continent , faces these kinds of problems as it tries to increase its trade capacity .
and to make matter worse , lamy says , africa has seen a decrease in participation in international trade over the last 10 years .
" in absolute value african trade has grown , but in relative value , as compared to the whole world trade , it has decreased , " he explains .
" the fundamental point for africa is , one , trying to diversify exports to meet international demand , and , two , making sure that inter-african trade grows .
at the moment the trade between african countries is incredibly low . "
lamy underlines that international trade accounts for around 15 percent of economic activity in europe and the us , but three to four times as much in africa .
" hence the enormous importance of keeping trade open during the crisis , which means fighting protectionism , because that would hit developing countries most .
and then , keeping investment in the future so they can trade their way out of the crisis . "
downward spiral bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more trade with the eu and within africa will make a difference the ongoing international economic crisis has hit africa in particular , dr. mohammed ibn chambas tells deutsche welle .
chambas is executive secretary of ecowas , the economic community of west african states .
he explains the downward spiral : the shrinking global economy leads to lower demand for commodities from west africa and africa as a whole .
lower demand also means lower prices .
but there is more : " the strong global growth led to 5 percent growth in africa in the year preceding the crisis , " he says .
" the slowdown has of course led to a reduced african growth rate .
we will end 2009 at less than 3 percent .
that is not good because it 's very close to the population growth rate .
" secondly the transfer of funds from african diasporas is also invested in many activities for expanding trade , export trade in particular .
and all of this has obviously now been reduced . "
chambas says he is also worried that donor countries may reduce their support for the aid for trade program because of the crisis .
" of course aid for trade funding is dependant on support of the economies of the developed countries .
and now that these economies are under stress and in recession , naturally there is likely to be a shuffle in the promised resources .
these are legitimate concerns that we have on the african side , that not all the pledges that have been made will be provided . "
european responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without trade , illegal immigration will continue chambas says europe has a special duty to increase its aid to africa .
" the bulk of african trade is with europe .
we believe that the partnership between europe and africa should translate into concrete support for africa to reduce the impact of the global crisis , " he says .
" it 's a historic relationship that we can not wish away and i believe that in the context of this new partnership we should see how we can work together , europe and africa , to overcome the current economic slowdown . "
john clancy , spokesman for european commissioner for development and humanitarian aid louis michel , says europe 's history with africa is unique , and that the focus should be on measures to improve that relationship .
" i think what is important is not to look backward to the past , but to the present day and the future .
aid for trade is about partnership .
it is a complimentary aspect to assisting developing countries , those in africa in particular .
it should soften , to some extent , the changes that have to take place at a socio-economic level in these countries , so that they can profit from the global marketplace more than before . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 05.07.2009 financial crisis hits african trade , aid as wto gears up for summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trade is an important way of helping africa the world trade organization is preparing to review its aid for trade initiative at an international conference in geneva .
the trade situation of developing countries in the economic crisis will be top of the agenda . give developing countries the tools to improve their position as trade partners and both their own development and the international trade situation will also improve .
that 's the idea behind " aid for trade , " which the wto launched in hong kong four years ago , wto director general pascal lamy tells deutsche welle .
" developing countries very often face trade barriers , which either stem from their own infrastructure - for example roadways , transport or energy - or they face technical trade barriers , for example if someone wants to export flowers to the us or to europe he will have to meet the maximum pesticide residue standard , " he says .
africa , more so than any other continent , faces these kinds of problems as it tries to increase its trade capacity .
and to make matter worse , lamy says , africa has seen a decrease in participation in international trade over the last 10 years .
" in absolute value african trade has grown , but in relative value , as compared to the whole world trade , it has decreased , " he explains .
" the fundamental point for africa is , one , trying to diversify exports to meet international demand , and , two , making sure that inter-african trade grows .
at the moment the trade between african countries is incredibly low . "
lamy underlines that international trade accounts for around 15 percent of economic activity in europe and the us , but three to four times as much in africa .
" hence the enormous importance of keeping trade open during the crisis , which means fighting protectionism , because that would hit developing countries most .
and then , keeping investment in the future so they can trade their way out of the crisis . "
downward spiral bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more trade with the eu and within africa will make a difference the ongoing international economic crisis has hit africa in particular , dr. mohammed ibn chambas tells deutsche welle .
chambas is executive secretary of ecowas , the economic community of west african states .
he explains the downward spiral : the shrinking global economy leads to lower demand for commodities from west africa and africa as a whole .
lower demand also means lower prices .
but there is more : " the strong global growth led to 5 percent growth in africa in the year preceding the crisis , " he says .
" the slowdown has of course led to a reduced african growth rate .
we will end 2009 at less than 3 percent .
that is not good because it 's very close to the population growth rate .
" secondly the transfer of funds from african diasporas is also invested in many activities for expanding trade , export trade in particular .
and all of this has obviously now been reduced . "
chambas says he is also worried that donor countries may reduce their support for the aid for trade program because of the crisis .
" of course aid for trade funding is dependant on support of the economies of the developed countries .
and now that these economies are under stress and in recession , naturally there is likely to be a shuffle in the promised resources .
these are legitimate concerns that we have on the african side , that not all the pledges that have been made will be provided . "
european responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without trade , illegal immigration will continue chambas says europe has a special duty to increase its aid to africa .
" the bulk of african trade is with europe .
we believe that the partnership between europe and africa should translate into concrete support for africa to reduce the impact of the global crisis , " he says .
" it 's a historic relationship that we can not wish away and i believe that in the context of this new partnership we should see how we can work together , europe and africa , to overcome the current economic slowdown . "

financial institutes remain reluctant to lend despite having received billions in finanical aid . german finance minister peer steinbrueck has warned banking managers over their reluctance to lend .
in sunday 's edition of the tabloid bild he says he was doubtful that a bill passed on friday in berlin to allow german banks to park their toxic assets in a so-called bad bank structure will be enough to get the banks back into the business of providing credit . instead , he 's threatening banks with unnamed sanctions should a credit crunch be the result of their too conservative lending policies .
his warning is that the government and the central bank will have to take steps to force the bankers ' hand .
these as yet unspecified actions , steinbrueck warns , would include measures never before used against financial institutions in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck warned banking managers over their reluctance to lend late last year , banks all over the world demanded billions in financial aid from their governments .
otherwise , they said , they would be forced into bankruptcy with unforeseeable consequences for the world economy . governments from washington , to london , to tokyo to berlin complied , despite the enormously high political risk involved .
there was political consensus that the banks were simply too big to be allowed to fail . despite state aid , banks are reluctant to lend today , german banks are doing far better , but stand accused of still being reluctant to lend to businesses and companies which increasingly feel the pinch of the global recession . for months , small and medium sized companies in germany have been finding it more and more difficult - if not impossible - to keep credit lines with their banks open . " at the moment there is no credit crunch , " said martin wansleben , managing director of the german chamber of industry and commerce . " but more and more companies are having difficulty getting needed loans .
it 's more complicated .
it 's more expensive .
and many are simply being rejected outright . " but , could the german government actually force banks to lend money ?
finance minister peer steinbrueck refused to fuel speculation on that .
however , other politicians are less subtle in their warnings to the banks . condemnation from across party lines " we helped the banks with massive funding and political support , " saarland state premier peter mueller said on saturday . " now , it 's up to the banks to provide that help to companies . " the banks are accused of taking the government 's money but using it only to improve their own financial situation , not the country 's economy . " we must now ensure that banks are obliged to offer credit on a more liberal basis , " urged fritz kuhn , parliamentary leader of the greens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's president accused the banks of causing the crisis politicians of all parties are united in their determination to force german banks to make credit available over fears of unemployment rising even further due to a lack of credit for businesses . german president horst koehler - himself a former head of the world bank - added his voice to the critics in a television interview . " i appeal to the banks to do more to ensure that the economy can grow , " he said . koehler 's criticism of the banks was the most pointed of all .
he accused them of first causing the worldwide economic crisis and now hesitating to help find a solution for it . rd / afp / dpa editor : carl holm send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.07.2009 normality comes in small doses in bosnia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instead of scenes of war , sarajevo today is characterized by a fragile peace more than 13 years after the dayton accord was signed , ending the bosnia 's inter-ethnic conflict in 1995 , the balkan country remains a very divided place . while peace and security have long since been established , few of those displaced during the three-year war have returned to homes in areas where their ethnic group is not in the majority .
despite this , there is a growing feeling among some people that it is time for the international community to step back , and hand over more responsibility for bosnia 's future to that country 's politicians .
the dayton accord that ended the bloodshed in bosnia-hercegovina in late 1995 is one of the few things that most bosnians can agree on .
they 'll tell you that it was successful in ending the war , but that it has been deficient when it comes to plotting a long-term path for the country 's future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it provided for the creation of a very weak central government , with the two entities , the bosniak / croat federation and the republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , wielding much of the legislative power .
this has led to divisions that had their roots in the 1992-95 war becoming formally ingrained during more than a decade of peace .
perhaps one of the most significant issues for the future of the country is the fact that children receive instruction in separate bosniak , serb or croat school systems .
seventy percent of the curriculum is set out by the state , with the remaining 30 percent left at the discretion of the schools .
croat high school student ante zelic explains that typically , these 30 percent are used for subjects like history or language instruction .
the students learn history , for example , from a croat point of view , or read two or three more novels by croatian authors than one would in other schools , says zelic .
while outsiders may think that this sort of division is the last thing that bosnian students need if the country is to grow more united in future , zelic does n't seem to see this as much of a problem .
his bosniak counterpart , adnan pripoljac , says the fact that students are divided in school is n't the point . “ i have my lessons in the morning and my croat colleagues go to classes in the afternoon .
but after school or in the evening we hang out together as usual .
most young people in bosnia do n't want to be separated , it 's just a political issue that has to be resolved . ”
practical problems while some politicians admit that the school situation is n't ideal , nobody seems to have a plan for integrating the educational systems .
a third student , dzeznan karic says there are practical considerations discouraging politicians from taking steps to change the status quo .
“ you have to realize that in every school there are , for example , two professors of geography , two professors of history , language , mathematics , physics , etc .
if they were to unite the school , this would leave one professor out of a job , and this is in nobody 's interest .
everyone is protecting their national interests .
why should a croat professor lose his job when there is also a bosniak professor who could lose his job ?
so it is a very political matter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valentin inzko hopes to be bosnia 's last high representative not even the international community 's special representative in bosnia has the answer .
the high representative still holds absolute power in this country , to be used to do whatever it takes to ensure that the provisions of the dayton accord are complied with .
this includes the power to revoke legislation or even remove politicians from office .
valentin inzko , the seventh person to hold this post , hopes he will be bosnia 's last high representative .
he recently told reporters in sarajevo that he hoped a decision would be taken in october , which would see the office of the high representative close at the end of this year .
“ i am moderately optimistic and i am doing everything in my power to ensure that this happens .
but the bosnians themselves also have to do something to improve the political climate , because -lrb- one -rrb- condition is a positive political climate and the implementation of dayton . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milorad dodik would like to seek the ohr close sooner rather than later it would be a stretch to describe the current political climate as positive .
recently , the high representative has been at loggerheads with the prime minister of the republika srpska , milorad dodik .
last month , the rs assembly passed a resolution demanding , among other things , that inzko transfer a package of powers to it from the central bosnian government .
after weeks of consultations , the high representative revoked the resolution , arguing that it violated the dayton agreement . pressure to leave it 's not surprising then , that the serbs want to see the office of the high representative shut down , sooner rather than later .
speaking to reporters in the republika srpska capital , banja luka , before the resolution was revoked , prime minister dodik said he was n't convinced that the office of the high representative was working in the best interests of the republika srbska .
“ by and large the office of the high representative -lrb- ohr -rrb- has employed a few international representatives , but most were local staff , mainly from the federation side , from sarajevo .
these people have created ill-feelings towards the republika srpska . ”
as with so many issues in bosnia , republika srpska and federation politicians are divided on this issue .
federation leaders say the country does n't have strong enough central institutions to close down the ohr .
haris silajdzic , the bosniak member of the bosnian presidency told reporters that he would do what he could to ensure that the ohr remains beyond the end of this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haris silajdzic says it is too early for the ohr to close up shop but he also conceded that there seemed to be an international political consensus that now was the time to pull the plug on the ohr , leaving only a non-executive european union special representative in its place .
despite dayton 's and bosnia 's flaws , the fact that the country has been at peace for more than 13 years is a considerable achievement in itself .
unemployment is high , but the cafes in both sarajevo and banja luka are full .
as one opposition politician in republika srpska put it : “ we do n't like each other very much , but at least we are not killing each other on the basis of our ethnic groups anymore .
we do n't have the most beautiful democracy in the world , but it 's not that bad . ” author : chuck penfold editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite this , there is a growing feeling among some people that it is time for the international community to step back , and hand over more responsibility for bosnia 's future to that country 's politicians .
the dayton accord that ended the bloodshed in bosnia-hercegovina in late 1995 is one of the few things that most bosnians can agree on .
they 'll tell you that it was successful in ending the war , but that it has been deficient when it comes to plotting a long-term path for the country 's future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it provided for the creation of a very weak central government , with the two entities , the bosniak / croat federation and the republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , wielding much of the legislative power .
this has led to divisions that had their roots in the 1992-95 war becoming formally ingrained during more than a decade of peace .
perhaps one of the most significant issues for the future of the country is the fact that children receive instruction in separate bosniak , serb or croat school systems .
seventy percent of the curriculum is set out by the state , with the remaining 30 percent left at the discretion of the schools .
croat high school student ante zelic explains that typically , these 30 percent are used for subjects like history or language instruction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.07.2009 normality comes in small doses in bosnia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instead of scenes of war , sarajevo today is characterized by a fragile peace more than 13 years after the dayton accord was signed , ending the bosnia 's inter-ethnic conflict in 1995 , the balkan country remains a very divided place . while peace and security have long since been established , few of those displaced during the three-year war have returned to homes in areas where their ethnic group is not in the majority .
despite this , there is a growing feeling among some people that it is time for the international community to step back , and hand over more responsibility for bosnia 's future to that country 's politicians .
the dayton accord that ended the bloodshed in bosnia-hercegovina in late 1995 is one of the few things that most bosnians can agree on .
they 'll tell you that it was successful in ending the war , but that it has been deficient when it comes to plotting a long-term path for the country 's future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it provided for the creation of a very weak central government , with the two entities , the bosniak / croat federation and the republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , wielding much of the legislative power .
this has led to divisions that had their roots in the 1992-95 war becoming formally ingrained during more than a decade of peace .
perhaps one of the most significant issues for the future of the country is the fact that children receive instruction in separate bosniak , serb or croat school systems .
seventy percent of the curriculum is set out by the state , with the remaining 30 percent left at the discretion of the schools .
croat high school student ante zelic explains that typically , these 30 percent are used for subjects like history or language instruction .
the students learn history , for example , from a croat point of view , or read two or three more novels by croatian authors than one would in other schools , says zelic .
while outsiders may think that this sort of division is the last thing that bosnian students need if the country is to grow more united in future , zelic does n't seem to see this as much of a problem .
his bosniak counterpart , adnan pripoljac , says the fact that students are divided in school is n't the point . “ i have my lessons in the morning and my croat colleagues go to classes in the afternoon .
but after school or in the evening we hang out together as usual .
most young people in bosnia do n't want to be separated , it 's just a political issue that has to be resolved . ”
practical problems while some politicians admit that the school situation is n't ideal , nobody seems to have a plan for integrating the educational systems .
a third student , dzeznan karic says there are practical considerations discouraging politicians from taking steps to change the status quo .
“ you have to realize that in every school there are , for example , two professors of geography , two professors of history , language , mathematics , physics , etc .
if they were to unite the school , this would leave one professor out of a job , and this is in nobody 's interest .
everyone is protecting their national interests .
why should a croat professor lose his job when there is also a bosniak professor who could lose his job ?
so it is a very political matter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valentin inzko hopes to be bosnia 's last high representative not even the international community 's special representative in bosnia has the answer .
the high representative still holds absolute power in this country , to be used to do whatever it takes to ensure that the provisions of the dayton accord are complied with .
this includes the power to revoke legislation or even remove politicians from office .
valentin inzko , the seventh person to hold this post , hopes he will be bosnia 's last high representative .
he recently told reporters in sarajevo that he hoped a decision would be taken in october , which would see the office of the high representative close at the end of this year .
“ i am moderately optimistic and i am doing everything in my power to ensure that this happens .
but the bosnians themselves also have to do something to improve the political climate , because -lrb- one -rrb- condition is a positive political climate and the implementation of dayton . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milorad dodik would like to seek the ohr close sooner rather than later it would be a stretch to describe the current political climate as positive .
recently , the high representative has been at loggerheads with the prime minister of the republika srpska , milorad dodik .
last month , the rs assembly passed a resolution demanding , among other things , that inzko transfer a package of powers to it from the central bosnian government .
after weeks of consultations , the high representative revoked the resolution , arguing that it violated the dayton agreement . pressure to leave it 's not surprising then , that the serbs want to see the office of the high representative shut down , sooner rather than later .
speaking to reporters in the republika srpska capital , banja luka , before the resolution was revoked , prime minister dodik said he was n't convinced that the office of the high representative was working in the best interests of the republika srbska .
“ by and large the office of the high representative -lrb- ohr -rrb- has employed a few international representatives , but most were local staff , mainly from the federation side , from sarajevo .
these people have created ill-feelings towards the republika srpska . ”
as with so many issues in bosnia , republika srpska and federation politicians are divided on this issue .
federation leaders say the country does n't have strong enough central institutions to close down the ohr .
haris silajdzic , the bosniak member of the bosnian presidency told reporters that he would do what he could to ensure that the ohr remains beyond the end of this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haris silajdzic says it is too early for the ohr to close up shop but he also conceded that there seemed to be an international political consensus that now was the time to pull the plug on the ohr , leaving only a non-executive european union special representative in its place .

the ruling socialist party is predicted to do badly , with corruption allegations largely to blame . the parliamentary election campaign in bulgaria has been a fierce one .
the ruling socialist party has attacked the opposition center-right gerb in particularly vicious television advertisements .
a few weeks before the election , the government also changed voting rights in its favour .
this could be a last-ditch attempt to stay in power , with opinion polls predicting a change . bulgaria is currently governed by a coalition made up of prime minister sergei stanishev 's socialist party and two junior partners : the movement for rights and freedom , a party representing bulgaria 's turkish minority ; and the national movement formed by the former tsar of bulgaria .
many bulgarians blame the coalition for the country 's widespread corruption , the misappropriation of millions in aid money from the european union , and the ire of brussels .
these are the factors that will likely see voters turn away from the governing parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarians are some of the poorest people in the eu " the new government will probably try to send a few high-profile people to prison as a result of corruption allegations , " says georgi ganev , an economist at sofia 's centre for liberal strategies .
" that 's why the election campaign has been fought so hard . " 50 euros for a vote but corruption in bulgaria may have even entered the ballot booth .
during the recent european parliamentary elections , there were allegations that voters were bought on a large scale .
watchdogs are concerned that this type of manipulation may continue in the national election .
tihomir beslov from bulgaria 's centre for democratic research says votes can be bought for between 50 and 150 euros .
he says that kind of money can support a family in one of bulgaria 's poorer regions for two or three months .
" an entire company 's employees could also be pressured by their bosses to vote for a particular party , " beslov says .
" for example , muslims would be forced to swear before allah that they would vote for the party representing the turkish minority . "
" bulgarians want justice " the party likely to win the most votes in sunday 's election is the center-right gerb , led by sofia mayor boyko borisov .
the party has promised to fight corruption , and gerb member maria nedelcheva recently told the european parliament that bulgarians wanted justice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boyko borisov only founded gerb a few years ago " they expect criminal convictions and they want criminal proceedings to finally be launched against those responsible , " nedelcheva said .
" we are determined to do that . "
but even gerb is not expected to win an outright majority .
experts believe that disillusioned bulgarians may not turn up to polling booths at all .
a recent opinion poll showed gerb grabbing just over 30 percent of the vote , while the ruling socialists are predicted to take just over 20 percent .
with no one party likely to win a majority , another coalition for bulgaria looks likely - talks that could drag on for months .

the ruling socialist party is predicted to do badly , with corruption allegations largely to blame . the parliamentary election campaign in bulgaria has been a fierce one .
the ruling socialist party has attacked the opposition center-right gerb in particularly vicious television advertisements .
a few weeks before the election , the government also changed voting rights in its favour .
this could be a last-ditch attempt to stay in power , with opinion polls predicting a change . bulgaria is currently governed by a coalition made up of prime minister sergei stanishev 's socialist party and two junior partners : the movement for rights and freedom , a party representing bulgaria 's turkish minority ; and the national movement formed by the former tsar of bulgaria .
many bulgarians blame the coalition for the country 's widespread corruption , the misappropriation of millions in aid money from the european union , and the ire of brussels .
these are the factors that will likely see voters turn away from the governing parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarians are some of the poorest people in the eu " the new government will probably try to send a few high-profile people to prison as a result of corruption allegations , " says georgi ganev , an economist at sofia 's centre for liberal strategies .
" that 's why the election campaign has been fought so hard . " 50 euros for a vote but corruption in bulgaria may have even entered the ballot booth .
during the recent european parliamentary elections , there were allegations that voters were bought on a large scale .
watchdogs are concerned that this type of manipulation may continue in the national election .
tihomir beslov from bulgaria 's centre for democratic research says votes can be bought for between 50 and 150 euros .
he says that kind of money can support a family in one of bulgaria 's poorer regions for two or three months .
" an entire company 's employees could also be pressured by their bosses to vote for a particular party , " beslov says .
" for example , muslims would be forced to swear before allah that they would vote for the party representing the turkish minority . "
" bulgarians want justice " the party likely to win the most votes in sunday 's election is the center-right gerb , led by sofia mayor boyko borisov .
the party has promised to fight corruption , and gerb member maria nedelcheva recently told the european parliament that bulgarians wanted justice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boyko borisov only founded gerb a few years ago " they expect criminal convictions and they want criminal proceedings to finally be launched against those responsible , " nedelcheva said .
" we are determined to do that . "
but even gerb is not expected to win an outright majority .
experts believe that disillusioned bulgarians may not turn up to polling booths at all .
a recent opinion poll showed gerb grabbing just over 30 percent of the vote , while the ruling socialists are predicted to take just over 20 percent .
with no one party likely to win a majority , another coalition for bulgaria looks likely - talks that could drag on for months .

at sunday 's historic wimbledon , roger federer broke the grand slam record .
but the personal stakes at the 1937 germany-us davis cup duel were higher for german baron gottfried von cramm : he was playing for his life . " a terrible splendor : three extraordinary men , a world poised for war and the greatest tennis match ever played " tells the story of tennis champion gottfried von cramm , who had been secretly gay in hitler 's germany and his opponent don budge , who was the top ranked us player .
it is also the story of von cramm 's gay american coach bill tilden , who was training the nazi german team against his own country in a decisive davis cup match in 1937 .
deutsche welle spoke to marshall jon fisher , the author of the newly released book . deutsche welle : why was gottfried von cramm so popular with the crowds ?
and why was he so important to the nazi leadership ?
marshall jon fisher : von cramm was a remarkable character .
he was gracious , famous for his sportsmanship and from a noble background , but did n't act that way at all .
he was tall , very handsome , very germanic-looking - blond , blue-eyed - the nazis were holding him up as the perfect model of the aryan athlete .
the nazi officials were of course very interested in using sports figures as propaganda tools , such as -lrb- boxing legend -rrb- max schmeling .
-lrb- nazi propaganda minister joseph -rrb- goebbels made a big deal out of the 1936 berlin olympics and declared it a triumph for germany , so the davis cup could have served similar purposes for him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's nadal ended federer 's wimbledon winning streak last year there have been a few other " greatest matches ever " on centre court at wimbledon - the epic bjorn borg - john mcenroe duel in 1980 and the stunning marathon between roger federer and rafael nadal last year .
what makes budge vs. von cramm , the " greatest match ever " ?
borg-mcenroe and federer-nadal were incredible tennis matches , but what was at stake really , except which multi-millionaire would get to hold up the trophy afterwards ?
it was just tennis .
but in the von cramm-budge case , it was about winning the davis cup , which meant playing for their nation 's glory .
there were also the personal stakes for von cramm - he was playing for his life at a time when the winds of war were building up .
he was also playing for a regime which he loathed .
it turned out that gottfried von cramm was a gay man playing for a government that was executing people like him .
he had of course been followed by the gestapo .
they had a big file on him .
his lover was jewish .
his wife - he had married a childhood friend - was one-quarter jewish .
the gestapo had made it clear to him that as long as he kept winning and that germany had a chance to win the davis cup with him , he would be safe .
but if things did n't go too well with him on the tennis court , that might not be the case .
there was quite an amazing amount of pressure on him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von cramm was secretly gay , but married barbara hutton .
how did the match go ?
this 1937 davis cup match was supposed to be a walk away for don budge , who had destroyed von cramm two weeks earlier at the wimbledon final in three straight sets , so everyone thought budge was going to win this match easily and the americans would win the davis cup , but von cramm just played stupendous tennis .
von cramm won the first two sets .
budge came back and won the second two sets .
in the decisive fifth set , von cramm was up 4 to 1 .
at this point everyone thought von cramm was going to win , but budge comes back again and it goes past 6-6 .
i 'd rather not give away the ending , but it turned into a remarkable fifth set .
so what happened to von cramm after the match ?
it was inevitable that no matter what happened in the match , von cramm was going to run into trouble in germany .
when he travelled around the world , he became more and more outspoken against the nazis and upon returning home from his travels in 1938 , he was arrested and sentenced to prison for homosexual acts .
now he got off a bit easy due to some good connections he had .
most homosexuals were going to the camps , but he simply went to prison in berlin for less than a year .
was it generally known that von cramm was homosexual ?
other players did know , but it was not publicly known even after the war when von cramm played the davis cup for west germany .
with -lrb- von cramm 's american coach -rrb- bill tilden , people knew .
he was not quite as dignified as von cramm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us champ bill tilden coached germany 's davis cup team regarding bill tilden - it 's very common nowadays for the coach of a national team to be foreign .
we see that a lot in international soccer .
but on the eve of world war ii , what tilden did , appears treacherous .
it was extraordinary , but not because tilden was a foreigner .
" big bill " tilden completely dominated the tennis world throughout the 1920s and kept the davis cup in the united states almost single-handedly .
he was also a gay man when one could n't talk about such things .
it was amazing the nazis hired not only an american , but a gay american to coach their davis cup team .
how did tilden , an american tennis idol , wind up coaching the nazi german team , of all teams ?
tilden had wanted to coach the americans for years , even offering to do it for free , but they turned him down every year , presumably because they were afraid of some scandal due to his homosexuality .
so when the germans finally gave him an offer , he was happy to take it . tennis today is an individual sport , you play for yourself rather than for your country and it 's the grand slam tournaments - the us , french , australian open and wimbledon of course - that are important .
could you explain the significance of the davis cup back then ?
well of course , we still have the davis cup , but it was much more significant back then .
all the big international tournaments then were also only open to amateurs .
tennis was much bigger in the sports world back then and the davis cup was even bigger than wimbledon .
the pro era in tennis began in 1968 .
gottfried von cramm survived the war , married woolworth heiress barbara hutton in the 1950s and became a successful cotton importer .
he died in a car accident on a business trip in egypt in 1976 .
bill tilden tried to pursue an acting career in hollywood , but served prison time for homosexual acts after the war .
because of his convictions , he was shunned from playing and teaching tennis .
he died of a stroke in 1953 .

at sunday 's historic wimbledon , roger federer broke the grand slam record .
but the personal stakes at the 1937 germany-us davis cup duel were higher for german baron gottfried von cramm : he was playing for his life . " a terrible splendor : three extraordinary men , a world poised for war and the greatest tennis match ever played " tells the story of tennis champion gottfried von cramm , who had been secretly gay in hitler 's germany and his opponent don budge , who was the top ranked us player .
it is also the story of von cramm 's gay american coach bill tilden , who was training the nazi german team against his own country in a decisive davis cup match in 1937 .
deutsche welle spoke to marshall jon fisher , the author of the newly released book . deutsche welle : why was gottfried von cramm so popular with the crowds ?
and why was he so important to the nazi leadership ?
marshall jon fisher : von cramm was a remarkable character .
he was gracious , famous for his sportsmanship and from a noble background , but did n't act that way at all .
he was tall , very handsome , very germanic-looking - blond , blue-eyed - the nazis were holding him up as the perfect model of the aryan athlete .
the nazi officials were of course very interested in using sports figures as propaganda tools , such as -lrb- boxing legend -rrb- max schmeling .
-lrb- nazi propaganda minister joseph -rrb- goebbels made a big deal out of the 1936 berlin olympics and declared it a triumph for germany , so the davis cup could have served similar purposes for him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's nadal ended federer 's wimbledon winning streak last year there have been a few other " greatest matches ever " on centre court at wimbledon - the epic bjorn borg - john mcenroe duel in 1980 and the stunning marathon between roger federer and rafael nadal last year .
what makes budge vs. von cramm , the " greatest match ever " ?
borg-mcenroe and federer-nadal were incredible tennis matches , but what was at stake really , except which multi-millionaire would get to hold up the trophy afterwards ?
it was just tennis .
but in the von cramm-budge case , it was about winning the davis cup , which meant playing for their nation 's glory .
there were also the personal stakes for von cramm - he was playing for his life at a time when the winds of war were building up .
he was also playing for a regime which he loathed .
it turned out that gottfried von cramm was a gay man playing for a government that was executing people like him .
he had of course been followed by the gestapo .
they had a big file on him .
his lover was jewish .
his wife - he had married a childhood friend - was one-quarter jewish .
the gestapo had made it clear to him that as long as he kept winning and that germany had a chance to win the davis cup with him , he would be safe .
but if things did n't go too well with him on the tennis court , that might not be the case .
there was quite an amazing amount of pressure on him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von cramm was secretly gay , but married barbara hutton .
how did the match go ?
this 1937 davis cup match was supposed to be a walk away for don budge , who had destroyed von cramm two weeks earlier at the wimbledon final in three straight sets , so everyone thought budge was going to win this match easily and the americans would win the davis cup , but von cramm just played stupendous tennis .
von cramm won the first two sets .
budge came back and won the second two sets .
in the decisive fifth set , von cramm was up 4 to 1 .
at this point everyone thought von cramm was going to win , but budge comes back again and it goes past 6-6 .
i 'd rather not give away the ending , but it turned into a remarkable fifth set .
so what happened to von cramm after the match ?
it was inevitable that no matter what happened in the match , von cramm was going to run into trouble in germany .
when he travelled around the world , he became more and more outspoken against the nazis and upon returning home from his travels in 1938 , he was arrested and sentenced to prison for homosexual acts .
now he got off a bit easy due to some good connections he had .
most homosexuals were going to the camps , but he simply went to prison in berlin for less than a year .
was it generally known that von cramm was homosexual ?
other players did know , but it was not publicly known even after the war when von cramm played the davis cup for west germany .
with -lrb- von cramm 's american coach -rrb- bill tilden , people knew .
he was not quite as dignified as von cramm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us champ bill tilden coached germany 's davis cup team regarding bill tilden - it 's very common nowadays for the coach of a national team to be foreign .
we see that a lot in international soccer .
but on the eve of world war ii , what tilden did , appears treacherous .
it was extraordinary , but not because tilden was a foreigner .
" big bill " tilden completely dominated the tennis world throughout the 1920s and kept the davis cup in the united states almost single-handedly .
he was also a gay man when one could n't talk about such things .
it was amazing the nazis hired not only an american , but a gay american to coach their davis cup team .
how did tilden , an american tennis idol , wind up coaching the nazi german team , of all teams ?
tilden had wanted to coach the americans for years , even offering to do it for free , but they turned him down every year , presumably because they were afraid of some scandal due to his homosexuality .
so when the germans finally gave him an offer , he was happy to take it . tennis today is an individual sport , you play for yourself rather than for your country and it 's the grand slam tournaments - the us , french , australian open and wimbledon of course - that are important .
could you explain the significance of the davis cup back then ?
well of course , we still have the davis cup , but it was much more significant back then .
all the big international tournaments then were also only open to amateurs .
tennis was much bigger in the sports world back then and the davis cup was even bigger than wimbledon .
the pro era in tennis began in 1968 .
gottfried von cramm survived the war , married woolworth heiress barbara hutton in the 1950s and became a successful cotton importer .
he died in a car accident on a business trip in egypt in 1976 .
bill tilden tried to pursue an acting career in hollywood , but served prison time for homosexual acts after the war .
because of his convictions , he was shunned from playing and teaching tennis .
he died of a stroke in 1953 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.07.2009 normality comes in small doses in bosnia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instead of scenes of war , sarajevo today is characterized by a fragile peace more than 13 years after the dayton accord was signed , ending the bosnia 's inter-ethnic conflict in 1995 , the balkan country remains a very divided place . while peace and security have long since been established , few of those displaced during the three-year war have returned to homes in areas where their ethnic group is not in the majority .
despite this , there is a growing feeling among some people that it is time for the international community to step back , and hand over more responsibility for bosnia 's future to that country 's politicians .
the dayton accord that ended the bloodshed in bosnia-hercegovina in late 1995 is one of the few things that most bosnians can agree on .
they 'll tell you that it was successful in ending the war , but that it has been deficient when it comes to plotting a long-term path for the country 's future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it provided for the creation of a very weak central government , with the two entities , the bosniak / croat federation and the republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , wielding much of the legislative power .
this has led to divisions that had their roots in the 1992-95 war becoming formally ingrained during more than a decade of peace .
perhaps one of the most significant issues for the future of the country is the fact that children receive instruction in separate bosniak , serb or croat school systems .
seventy percent of the curriculum is set out by the state , with the remaining 30 percent left at the discretion of the schools .
croat high school student ante zelic explains that typically , these 30 percent are used for subjects like history or language instruction .
the students learn history , for example , from a croat point of view , or read two or three more novels by croatian authors than one would in other schools , says zelic .
while outsiders may think that this sort of division is the last thing that bosnian students need if the country is to grow more united in future , zelic does n't seem to see this as much of a problem .
his bosniak counterpart , adnan pripoljac , says the fact that students are divided in school is n't the point . “ i have my lessons in the morning and my croat colleagues go to classes in the afternoon .
but after school or in the evening we hang out together as usual .
most young people in bosnia do n't want to be separated , it 's just a political issue that has to be resolved . ”
practical problems while some politicians admit that the school situation is n't ideal , nobody seems to have a plan for integrating the educational systems .
a third student , dzeznan karic says there are practical considerations discouraging politicians from taking steps to change the status quo .
“ you have to realize that in every school there are , for example , two professors of geography , two professors of history , language , mathematics , physics , etc .
if they were to unite the school , this would leave one professor out of a job , and this is in nobody 's interest .
everyone is protecting their national interests .
why should a croat professor lose his job when there is also a bosniak professor who could lose his job ?
so it is a very political matter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valentin inzko hopes to be bosnia 's last high representative not even the international community 's special representative in bosnia has the answer .
the high representative still holds absolute power in this country , to be used to do whatever it takes to ensure that the provisions of the dayton accord are complied with .
this includes the power to revoke legislation or even remove politicians from office .
valentin inzko , the seventh person to hold this post , hopes he will be bosnia 's last high representative .
he recently told reporters in sarajevo that he hoped a decision would be taken in october , which would see the office of the high representative close at the end of this year .
“ i am moderately optimistic and i am doing everything in my power to ensure that this happens .
but the bosnians themselves also have to do something to improve the political climate , because -lrb- one -rrb- condition is a positive political climate and the implementation of dayton . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milorad dodik would like to seek the ohr close sooner rather than later it would be a stretch to describe the current political climate as positive .
recently , the high representative has been at loggerheads with the prime minister of the republika srpska , milorad dodik .
last month , the rs assembly passed a resolution demanding , among other things , that inzko transfer a package of powers to it from the central bosnian government .
after weeks of consultations , the high representative revoked the resolution , arguing that it violated the dayton agreement . pressure to leave it 's not surprising then , that the serbs want to see the office of the high representative shut down , sooner rather than later .
speaking to reporters in the republika srpska capital , banja luka , before the resolution was revoked , prime minister dodik said he was n't convinced that the office of the high representative was working in the best interests of the republika srbska .
“ by and large the office of the high representative -lrb- ohr -rrb- has employed a few international representatives , but most were local staff , mainly from the federation side , from sarajevo .
these people have created ill-feelings towards the republika srpska . ”
as with so many issues in bosnia , republika srpska and federation politicians are divided on this issue .
federation leaders say the country does n't have strong enough central institutions to close down the ohr .
haris silajdzic , the bosniak member of the bosnian presidency told reporters that he would do what he could to ensure that the ohr remains beyond the end of this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haris silajdzic says it is too early for the ohr to close up shop but he also conceded that there seemed to be an international political consensus that now was the time to pull the plug on the ohr , leaving only a non-executive european union special representative in its place .
despite dayton 's and bosnia 's flaws , the fact that the country has been at peace for more than 13 years is a considerable achievement in itself .
unemployment is high , but the cafes in both sarajevo and banja luka are full .
as one opposition politician in republika srpska put it : “ we do n't like each other very much , but at least we are not killing each other on the basis of our ethnic groups anymore .
we do n't have the most beautiful democracy in the world , but it 's not that bad . ” author : chuck penfold editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the statements " i never doped !
and i will never resort to doping ! " were clearly visible together with saturday 's date and pechstein 's signature . " there is no positive test .
i was banned on very shaky circumstantial evidence .
i ca n't help those who do n't believe me , but my conscience is clear , " pechstein said in an interview which the tabloid printed under the title " liar or victim ? " . asked why she had not made any public comments on the case when the sport 's ruling body , the isu , first informed her of the blood sample irregularities in february , pechstein responded that it was very difficult to get rid of the doping stigma once things were made public .
while apologizing for not coming clean with public at the time , pechstein offered a potential explanation for the irregularities of the blood samples . " there was an independent expert involved in my case who said it was possible i may have a blood disorder , " said pechstein . " close to blackmail " pechstein also told bild am sonntag that the isu had exerted strong pressure on her to make a split second decision to pull out of world championship competitions to avoid public scandal , adding that this experience came close to blackmail . pechstein also stepped up her media campaign against the doping ruling by appearing in a well-known german sports show on public broadcaster zdf on saturday , where she adamantly refuted all doping claims brought against her . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pechstein has won numerous speed skating medals for germany the isu handed pechstein a two-year ban for blood doping on july 3 . the isu said on its website on friday that it had found pechstein guilty of " the prohibited method of blood doping " from evidence gathered through the 37-year-old 's blood sample . pechstein is germany 's most successful winter olympian , having won nine medals overall – five of them gold – between 1992 and 2006 .

the statements " i never doped !
and i will never resort to doping ! " were clearly visible together with saturday 's date and pechstein 's signature . " there is no positive test .
i was banned on very shaky circumstantial evidence .
i ca n't help those who do n't believe me , but my conscience is clear , " pechstein said in an interview which the tabloid printed under the title " liar or victim ? " . asked why she had not made any public comments on the case when the sport 's ruling body , the isu , first informed her of the blood sample irregularities in february , pechstein responded that it was very difficult to get rid of the doping stigma once things were made public .
while apologizing for not coming clean with public at the time , pechstein offered a potential explanation for the irregularities of the blood samples . " there was an independent expert involved in my case who said it was possible i may have a blood disorder , " said pechstein . " close to blackmail " pechstein also told bild am sonntag that the isu had exerted strong pressure on her to make a split second decision to pull out of world championship competitions to avoid public scandal , adding that this experience came close to blackmail . pechstein also stepped up her media campaign against the doping ruling by appearing in a well-known german sports show on public broadcaster zdf on saturday , where she adamantly refuted all doping claims brought against her . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pechstein has won numerous speed skating medals for germany the isu handed pechstein a two-year ban for blood doping on july 3 . the isu said on its website on friday that it had found pechstein guilty of " the prohibited method of blood doping " from evidence gathered through the 37-year-old 's blood sample . pechstein is germany 's most successful winter olympian , having won nine medals overall – five of them gold – between 1992 and 2006 .
she is also a six-time world champion , with another 20 silver and eight bronze world championship medals to her credit . the isu said its decision was " based on the evidence of ms pechstein 's -lrb- sample -rrb- which included abnormal values and abnormal changes of values in a series of tests -lrb- in particular in the tests conducted during the essent isu world allround championships held in hamar on february 7-8 , 2009 -rrb- .

the trade situation of developing countries in the economic crisis will be top of the agenda . give developing countries the tools to improve their position as trade partners and both their own development and the international trade situation will also improve .
that 's the idea behind " aid for trade , " which the wto launched in hong kong four years ago , wto director general pascal lamy tells deutsche welle .
" developing countries very often face trade barriers , which either stem from their own infrastructure - for example roadways , transport or energy - or they face technical trade barriers , for example if someone wants to export flowers to the us or to europe he will have to meet the maximum pesticide residue standard , " he says .
africa , more so than any other continent , faces these kinds of problems as it tries to increase its trade capacity .
and to make matter worse , lamy says , africa has seen a decrease in participation in international trade over the last 10 years .
" in absolute value african trade has grown , but in relative value , as compared to the whole world trade , it has decreased , " he explains .
" the fundamental point for africa is , one , trying to diversify exports to meet international demand , and , two , making sure that inter-african trade grows .
at the moment the trade between african countries is incredibly low . "
lamy underlines that international trade accounts for around 15 percent of economic activity in europe and the us , but three to four times as much in africa .
" hence the enormous importance of keeping trade open during the crisis , which means fighting protectionism , because that would hit developing countries most .
and then , keeping investment in the future so they can trade their way out of the crisis . "
downward spiral bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more trade with the eu and within africa will make a difference the ongoing international economic crisis has hit africa in particular , dr. mohammed ibn chambas tells deutsche welle .
chambas is executive secretary of ecowas , the economic community of west african states .
he explains the downward spiral : the shrinking global economy leads to lower demand for commodities from west africa and africa as a whole .
lower demand also means lower prices .
but there is more : " the strong global growth led to 5 percent growth in africa in the year preceding the crisis , " he says .
" the slowdown has of course led to a reduced african growth rate .
we will end 2009 at less than 3 percent .
that is not good because it 's very close to the population growth rate .
" secondly the transfer of funds from african diasporas is also invested in many activities for expanding trade , export trade in particular .
and all of this has obviously now been reduced . "
chambas says he is also worried that donor countries may reduce their support for the aid for trade program because of the crisis .
" of course aid for trade funding is dependant on support of the economies of the developed countries .
and now that these economies are under stress and in recession , naturally there is likely to be a shuffle in the promised resources .
these are legitimate concerns that we have on the african side , that not all the pledges that have been made will be provided . "
european responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without trade , illegal immigration will continue chambas says europe has a special duty to increase its aid to africa .
" the bulk of african trade is with europe .
we believe that the partnership between europe and africa should translate into concrete support for africa to reduce the impact of the global crisis , " he says .
" it 's a historic relationship that we can not wish away and i believe that in the context of this new partnership we should see how we can work together , europe and africa , to overcome the current economic slowdown . "
john clancy , spokesman for european commissioner for development and humanitarian aid louis michel , says europe 's history with africa is unique , and that the focus should be on measures to improve that relationship .
" i think what is important is not to look backward to the past , but to the present day and the future .
aid for trade is about partnership .
it is a complimentary aspect to assisting developing countries , those in africa in particular .
it should soften , to some extent , the changes that have to take place at a socio-economic level in these countries , so that they can profit from the global marketplace more than before . "

it comes as israeli premier benjamin netanyahu has referred to a ' ' two-state solution " for the first time . the aim of minister frank-walter steinmeier 's two-day trip is to jumpstart the dormant peace process .
on monday , he is to hold talks with israeli president shimon peres , prime minister benyamin netanyahu , and foreign minister avigdor lieberman in jerusalem .
he will also visit lebanon and syria .
steinmeier has been among world leaders who have criticized israeli settlement building programs in east jerusalem and the west bank .
thus far , netanyahu 's government had refused to freeze settlement activities and had not agreed to a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu is known for his tough stance on the palestinian issue however , on sunday , netanyahu referred for the first time to a " two-state solution " to bring peace to the middle east .
" we have achieved a national agreement on the formula of two states for two peoples , " the israeli prime minister said during the weekly cabinet meeting .
steinmeier is expected to pay a visit to the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem on monday .
media reports said that a meeting planned with palestinian president mahmoud abbas in the west bank town of ramallah was not likely to take place , because abbas is visiting jordan for talks on forming a palestinian unity government with the rival hamas movement .
support for us efforts it will be steinmeier 's 14th trip to the region since becoming germany 's foreign minister in 2005 .
it involves an exacting schedule , covering nearly 6,500 kilometers and four countries in just 36 hours .
the whirlwind tour of the middle east is meant to lend impetus to germany 's desire for peace in the region as soon as possible , according to a foreign ministry spokesman in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the obama administration wants to reinvigorate the peace process " we have had new momentum in the middle east peace process since the new government took office in washington and we support its fresh efforts to reach a two-state solution and a return to negotiations , " said andreas peschke ahead of steinmeier 's trip .
peschke added that berlin was pursuing a middle east policy focused on practical assistance on the ground , including development assistance for the palestinians and training for security forces in the territories to help prepare for eventual statehood .
during his visit to the west bank on monday , steinmeier will assess the progress of such projects .
the foreign ministry spokesman said that germany 's engagement in the region was determined in consultation with its european partners and the government of us president barack obama .
the new administration in washington consulted berlin in the conceptual stages of the reorientation of its middle east policy . in a further reflection of the ongoing efforts to harmonize international peace efforts in the region , steinmeier held intensive discussions via telephone with his american counterpart hillary clinton and the us the middle east mediator george mitchell , prior to his middle east trip .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syrian president assad has been engaging the international community neighbors have crucial role german officials said steinmeier hoped to persuade neighboring arab states to play a more active role in diplomatic efforts to end the israeli-palestinian conflict .
acknowledging the crucial role of the neighbors in any peace process , foreign ministry spokesman andreas peschke said that germany saw several rays of hope in the region , including last month 's peaceful elections in lebanon and improved relations between lebanon and syria .
he added that all these factors presented a " window of opportunity . "
in light of these developments , steinmeier will also travel to damascus for talks with his syrian counterpart wali al-muallem and president bashar al-assad .
in the past , steinmeier , who is set to challenge chancellor angela merkel in september 's general election , faced criticism from the chancellery and the us administration for his efforts to engage syria .
however , the obama administration has dramatically softened washington 's stance towards damascus .
and this week , the us announced that it would send an ambassador back to damascus after a four-year gap .
the move comes amid a region-wide campaign to lay the groundwork for middle east peace .
in response , president assad invited obama to visit syria .
when he travels to the lebanese capital beirut , steinmeier will become the first western politician to meet prime minister-designate saad hariri , the son of former premier rafik hariri , who was killed in a bomb blast in 2005 .
hariri 's pro-western alliance won last month 's general elections .
some observers say germany is aware that it does not have the influence to broker middle east peace on its own , but that steinmeier clearly wants to be part of the obama administration 's efforts in that direction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : settlement activity in the occupied territories is a point of contention issue on g8 agenda the trip comes ahead of next week 's g8 summit in italy .
chancellor merkel indicated last week that the middle east conflict would figure prominently in those talks .
she said " concessions from all sides were necessary , " for the peace process to succeed .
calling for a halt to the construction of israeli settlements , merkel said " there has to be a freeze .

financial institutes remain reluctant to lend despite having received billions in finanical aid . german finance minister peer steinbrueck has warned banking managers over their reluctance to lend .
in sunday 's edition of the tabloid bild he says he was doubtful that a bill passed on friday in berlin to allow german banks to park their toxic assets in a so-called bad bank structure will be enough to get the banks back into the business of providing credit . instead , he 's threatening banks with unnamed sanctions should a credit crunch be the result of their too conservative lending policies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 05.07.2009 financial crisis hits african trade , aid as wto gears up for summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trade is an important way of helping africa the world trade organization is preparing to review its aid for trade initiative at an international conference in geneva .
the trade situation of developing countries in the economic crisis will be top of the agenda . give developing countries the tools to improve their position as trade partners and both their own development and the international trade situation will also improve .
that 's the idea behind " aid for trade , " which the wto launched in hong kong four years ago , wto director general pascal lamy tells deutsche welle .
" developing countries very often face trade barriers , which either stem from their own infrastructure - for example roadways , transport or energy - or they face technical trade barriers , for example if someone wants to export flowers to the us or to europe he will have to meet the maximum pesticide residue standard , " he says .
africa , more so than any other continent , faces these kinds of problems as it tries to increase its trade capacity .
and to make matter worse , lamy says , africa has seen a decrease in participation in international trade over the last 10 years .
" in absolute value african trade has grown , but in relative value , as compared to the whole world trade , it has decreased , " he explains .
" the fundamental point for africa is , one , trying to diversify exports to meet international demand , and , two , making sure that inter-african trade grows .
at the moment the trade between african countries is incredibly low . "
lamy underlines that international trade accounts for around 15 percent of economic activity in europe and the us , but three to four times as much in africa .
" hence the enormous importance of keeping trade open during the crisis , which means fighting protectionism , because that would hit developing countries most .
and then , keeping investment in the future so they can trade their way out of the crisis . "
downward spiral bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more trade with the eu and within africa will make a difference the ongoing international economic crisis has hit africa in particular , dr. mohammed ibn chambas tells deutsche welle .
chambas is executive secretary of ecowas , the economic community of west african states .
he explains the downward spiral : the shrinking global economy leads to lower demand for commodities from west africa and africa as a whole .
lower demand also means lower prices .
but there is more : " the strong global growth led to 5 percent growth in africa in the year preceding the crisis , " he says .
" the slowdown has of course led to a reduced african growth rate .
we will end 2009 at less than 3 percent .
that is not good because it 's very close to the population growth rate .
" secondly the transfer of funds from african diasporas is also invested in many activities for expanding trade , export trade in particular .

"
ecclestone also criticised ousting saddam hussein and the taliban . the comment , made to the times newspaper in an interview published on friday , has led to a furore among jewish groups and politicians .
ecclestone , 78 , praised the virtues of strong leadership and condemned contemporary politicians for their weakness .
the times quoted ecclestone as saying that democracy " has n't done a lot of good for many countries , including this one . "
" in a lot of ways , terrible to say this i suppose , " ecclestone said , " but apart from the fact that hitler got taken away and persuaded to do things that i have no idea whether he wanted to do or not , he was in the way that he could command a lot of people , able to get things done . "
ecclestone told the paper that politicians were too worried about elections and that he would support the concept of a government based on tyranny .
" we did a terrible thing when we supported the idea of getting rid of saddam hussein , " ecclestone went on to say , " he was the only one who could control that country . "
" it was the same -lrb- with the taliban -rrb- .
we move into countries and we have no idea of the culture . "

he went on to include british prime minister margaret thatcher , and max mosley , outgoing head of formula one 's governing body , as leadership examples - even suggesting max mosley should be britain 's prime minister .
eccleston went on to say " the americans probably thought bosnia was a town in miami .
there are people starving in africa and we sit back and do nothing but we get involved in things we should leave alone . "
jewish groups have crticized the comments , with a spokesman for the board of deputies of british jews calling them " quite bizarre . "
meanwhile , stephen pollard , editor of the jewish chronicle , said ecclestone was either " an idiot or morally repulsive . "
" either he has no idea how stupid and offensive his views are , or he does - and deserves to be held in contempt by all decent people , " he said .
ecclestone 's remarks are certain to revive memories of the controversy around reports of a bizarre sex scandal involving fia president max mosley .

these are legitimate concerns that we have on the african side , that not all the pledges that have been made will be provided . "
european responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without trade , illegal immigration will continue chambas says europe has a special duty to increase its aid to africa .
" the bulk of african trade is with europe .
we believe that the partnership between europe and africa should translate into concrete support for africa to reduce the impact of the global crisis , " he says .
" it 's a historic relationship that we can not wish away and i believe that in the context of this new partnership we should see how we can work together , europe and africa , to overcome the current economic slowdown . "
john clancy , spokesman for european commissioner for development and humanitarian aid louis michel , says europe 's history with africa is unique , and that the focus should be on measures to improve that relationship .
" i think what is important is not to look backward to the past , but to the present day and the future .
aid for trade is about partnership .
it is a complimentary aspect to assisting developing countries , those in africa in particular .
it should soften , to some extent , the changes that have to take place at a socio-economic level in these countries , so that they can profit from the global marketplace more than before . "

despite this , there is a growing feeling among some people that it is time for the international community to step back , and hand over more responsibility for bosnia 's future to that country 's politicians .
the dayton accord that ended the bloodshed in bosnia-hercegovina in late 1995 is one of the few things that most bosnians can agree on .
they 'll tell you that it was successful in ending the war , but that it has been deficient when it comes to plotting a long-term path for the country 's future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it provided for the creation of a very weak central government , with the two entities , the bosniak / croat federation and the republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , wielding much of the legislative power .
this has led to divisions that had their roots in the 1992-95 war becoming formally ingrained during more than a decade of peace .
perhaps one of the most significant issues for the future of the country is the fact that children receive instruction in separate bosniak , serb or croat school systems .
seventy percent of the curriculum is set out by the state , with the remaining 30 percent left at the discretion of the schools .
croat high school student ante zelic explains that typically , these 30 percent are used for subjects like history or language instruction .
the students learn history , for example , from a croat point of view , or read two or three more novels by croatian authors than one would in other schools , says zelic .
while outsiders may think that this sort of division is the last thing that bosnian students need if the country is to grow more united in future , zelic does n't seem to see this as much of a problem .
his bosniak counterpart , adnan pripoljac , says the fact that students are divided in school is n't the point . “ i have my lessons in the morning and my croat colleagues go to classes in the afternoon .
but after school or in the evening we hang out together as usual .
most young people in bosnia do n't want to be separated , it 's just a political issue that has to be resolved . ”
practical problems while some politicians admit that the school situation is n't ideal , nobody seems to have a plan for integrating the educational systems .
a third student , dzeznan karic says there are practical considerations discouraging politicians from taking steps to change the status quo .
“ you have to realize that in every school there are , for example , two professors of geography , two professors of history , language , mathematics , physics , etc .
if they were to unite the school , this would leave one professor out of a job , and this is in nobody 's interest .
everyone is protecting their national interests .
why should a croat professor lose his job when there is also a bosniak professor who could lose his job ?
so it is a very political matter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valentin inzko hopes to be bosnia 's last high representative not even the international community 's special representative in bosnia has the answer .
the high representative still holds absolute power in this country , to be used to do whatever it takes to ensure that the provisions of the dayton accord are complied with .
this includes the power to revoke legislation or even remove politicians from office .
valentin inzko , the seventh person to hold this post , hopes he will be bosnia 's last high representative .
he recently told reporters in sarajevo that he hoped a decision would be taken in october , which would see the office of the high representative close at the end of this year .
“ i am moderately optimistic and i am doing everything in my power to ensure that this happens .
but the bosnians themselves also have to do something to improve the political climate , because -lrb- one -rrb- condition is a positive political climate and the implementation of dayton . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milorad dodik would like to seek the ohr close sooner rather than later it would be a stretch to describe the current political climate as positive .
recently , the high representative has been at loggerheads with the prime minister of the republika srpska , milorad dodik .
last month , the rs assembly passed a resolution demanding , among other things , that inzko transfer a package of powers to it from the central bosnian government .
after weeks of consultations , the high representative revoked the resolution , arguing that it violated the dayton agreement . pressure to leave it 's not surprising then , that the serbs want to see the office of the high representative shut down , sooner rather than later .
speaking to reporters in the republika srpska capital , banja luka , before the resolution was revoked , prime minister dodik said he was n't convinced that the office of the high representative was working in the best interests of the republika srbska .
“ by and large the office of the high representative -lrb- ohr -rrb- has employed a few international representatives , but most were local staff , mainly from the federation side , from sarajevo .
these people have created ill-feelings towards the republika srpska . ”
as with so many issues in bosnia , republika srpska and federation politicians are divided on this issue .
federation leaders say the country does n't have strong enough central institutions to close down the ohr .
haris silajdzic , the bosniak member of the bosnian presidency told reporters that he would do what he could to ensure that the ohr remains beyond the end of this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haris silajdzic says it is too early for the ohr to close up shop but he also conceded that there seemed to be an international political consensus that now was the time to pull the plug on the ohr , leaving only a non-executive european union special representative in its place .
despite dayton 's and bosnia 's flaws , the fact that the country has been at peace for more than 13 years is a considerable achievement in itself .
unemployment is high , but the cafes in both sarajevo and banja luka are full .
as one opposition politician in republika srpska put it : “ we do n't like each other very much , but at least we are not killing each other on the basis of our ethnic groups anymore .

at sunday 's historic wimbledon , roger federer broke the grand slam record .
but the personal stakes at the 1937 germany-us davis cup duel were higher for german baron gottfried von cramm : he was playing for his life . " a terrible splendor : three extraordinary men , a world poised for war and the greatest tennis match ever played " tells the story of tennis champion gottfried von cramm , who had been secretly gay in hitler 's germany and his opponent don budge , who was the top ranked us player .
it is also the story of von cramm 's gay american coach bill tilden , who was training the nazi german team against his own country in a decisive davis cup match in 1937 .
deutsche welle spoke to marshall jon fisher , the author of the newly released book . deutsche welle : why was gottfried von cramm so popular with the crowds ?
and why was he so important to the nazi leadership ?
marshall jon fisher : von cramm was a remarkable character .
he was gracious , famous for his sportsmanship and from a noble background , but did n't act that way at all .
he was tall , very handsome , very germanic-looking - blond , blue-eyed - the nazis were holding him up as the perfect model of the aryan athlete .
the nazi officials were of course very interested in using sports figures as propaganda tools , such as -lrb- boxing legend -rrb- max schmeling .
-lrb- nazi propaganda minister joseph -rrb- goebbels made a big deal out of the 1936 berlin olympics and declared it a triumph for germany , so the davis cup could have served similar purposes for him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's nadal ended federer 's wimbledon winning streak last year there have been a few other " greatest matches ever " on centre court at wimbledon - the epic bjorn borg - john mcenroe duel in 1980 and the stunning marathon between roger federer and rafael nadal last year .
what makes budge vs. von cramm , the " greatest match ever " ?
borg-mcenroe and federer-nadal were incredible tennis matches , but what was at stake really , except which multi-millionaire would get to hold up the trophy afterwards ?
it was just tennis .
but in the von cramm-budge case , it was about winning the davis cup , which meant playing for their nation 's glory .
there were also the personal stakes for von cramm - he was playing for his life at a time when the winds of war were building up .
he was also playing for a regime which he loathed .
it turned out that gottfried von cramm was a gay man playing for a government that was executing people like him .
he had of course been followed by the gestapo .
they had a big file on him .
his lover was jewish .
his wife - he had married a childhood friend - was one-quarter jewish .
the gestapo had made it clear to him that as long as he kept winning and that germany had a chance to win the davis cup with him , he would be safe .
but if things did n't go too well with him on the tennis court , that might not be the case .
there was quite an amazing amount of pressure on him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von cramm was secretly gay , but married barbara hutton .
how did the match go ?
this 1937 davis cup match was supposed to be a walk away for don budge , who had destroyed von cramm two weeks earlier at the wimbledon final in three straight sets , so everyone thought budge was going to win this match easily and the americans would win the davis cup , but von cramm just played stupendous tennis .
von cramm won the first two sets .
budge came back and won the second two sets .
in the decisive fifth set , von cramm was up 4 to 1 .
at this point everyone thought von cramm was going to win , but budge comes back again and it goes past 6-6 .
i 'd rather not give away the ending , but it turned into a remarkable fifth set .
so what happened to von cramm after the match ?
it was inevitable that no matter what happened in the match , von cramm was going to run into trouble in germany .
when he travelled around the world , he became more and more outspoken against the nazis and upon returning home from his travels in 1938 , he was arrested and sentenced to prison for homosexual acts .
now he got off a bit easy due to some good connections he had .
most homosexuals were going to the camps , but he simply went to prison in berlin for less than a year .
was it generally known that von cramm was homosexual ?
other players did know , but it was not publicly known even after the war when von cramm played the davis cup for west germany .
with -lrb- von cramm 's american coach -rrb- bill tilden , people knew .
he was not quite as dignified as von cramm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us champ bill tilden coached germany 's davis cup team regarding bill tilden - it 's very common nowadays for the coach of a national team to be foreign .
we see that a lot in international soccer .
but on the eve of world war ii , what tilden did , appears treacherous .
it was extraordinary , but not because tilden was a foreigner .
" big bill " tilden completely dominated the tennis world throughout the 1920s and kept the davis cup in the united states almost single-handedly .
he was also a gay man when one could n't talk about such things .
it was amazing the nazis hired not only an american , but a gay american to coach their davis cup team .
how did tilden , an american tennis idol , wind up coaching the nazi german team , of all teams ?
tilden had wanted to coach the americans for years , even offering to do it for free , but they turned him down every year , presumably because they were afraid of some scandal due to his homosexuality .
so when the germans finally gave him an offer , he was happy to take it . tennis today is an individual sport , you play for yourself rather than for your country and it 's the grand slam tournaments - the us , french , australian open and wimbledon of course - that are important .
could you explain the significance of the davis cup back then ?
well of course , we still have the davis cup , but it was much more significant back then .
all the big international tournaments then were also only open to amateurs .
tennis was much bigger in the sports world back then and the davis cup was even bigger than wimbledon .
the pro era in tennis began in 1968 .
gottfried von cramm survived the war , married woolworth heiress barbara hutton in the 1950s and became a successful cotton importer .
he died in a car accident on a business trip in egypt in 1976 .
bill tilden tried to pursue an acting career in hollywood , but served prison time for homosexual acts after the war .
because of his convictions , he was shunned from playing and teaching tennis .
he died of a stroke in 1953 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.07.2009 normality comes in small doses in bosnia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instead of scenes of war , sarajevo today is characterized by a fragile peace more than 13 years after the dayton accord was signed , ending the bosnia 's inter-ethnic conflict in 1995 , the balkan country remains a very divided place . while peace and security have long since been established , few of those displaced during the three-year war have returned to homes in areas where their ethnic group is not in the majority .
despite this , there is a growing feeling among some people that it is time for the international community to step back , and hand over more responsibility for bosnia 's future to that country 's politicians .
the dayton accord that ended the bloodshed in bosnia-hercegovina in late 1995 is one of the few things that most bosnians can agree on .
they 'll tell you that it was successful in ending the war , but that it has been deficient when it comes to plotting a long-term path for the country 's future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it provided for the creation of a very weak central government , with the two entities , the bosniak / croat federation and the republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , wielding much of the legislative power .
this has led to divisions that had their roots in the 1992-95 war becoming formally ingrained during more than a decade of peace .
perhaps one of the most significant issues for the future of the country is the fact that children receive instruction in separate bosniak , serb or croat school systems .
seventy percent of the curriculum is set out by the state , with the remaining 30 percent left at the discretion of the schools .
croat high school student ante zelic explains that typically , these 30 percent are used for subjects like history or language instruction .
the students learn history , for example , from a croat point of view , or read two or three more novels by croatian authors than one would in other schools , says zelic .
while outsiders may think that this sort of division is the last thing that bosnian students need if the country is to grow more united in future , zelic does n't seem to see this as much of a problem .
his bosniak counterpart , adnan pripoljac , says the fact that students are divided in school is n't the point . “ i have my lessons in the morning and my croat colleagues go to classes in the afternoon .
but after school or in the evening we hang out together as usual .
most young people in bosnia do n't want to be separated , it 's just a political issue that has to be resolved . ”
practical problems while some politicians admit that the school situation is n't ideal , nobody seems to have a plan for integrating the educational systems .
a third student , dzeznan karic says there are practical considerations discouraging politicians from taking steps to change the status quo .
“ you have to realize that in every school there are , for example , two professors of geography , two professors of history , language , mathematics , physics , etc .
if they were to unite the school , this would leave one professor out of a job , and this is in nobody 's interest .
everyone is protecting their national interests .
why should a croat professor lose his job when there is also a bosniak professor who could lose his job ?
so it is a very political matter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valentin inzko hopes to be bosnia 's last high representative not even the international community 's special representative in bosnia has the answer .
the high representative still holds absolute power in this country , to be used to do whatever it takes to ensure that the provisions of the dayton accord are complied with .
this includes the power to revoke legislation or even remove politicians from office .
valentin inzko , the seventh person to hold this post , hopes he will be bosnia 's last high representative .
he recently told reporters in sarajevo that he hoped a decision would be taken in october , which would see the office of the high representative close at the end of this year .
“ i am moderately optimistic and i am doing everything in my power to ensure that this happens .
but the bosnians themselves also have to do something to improve the political climate , because -lrb- one -rrb- condition is a positive political climate and the implementation of dayton . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milorad dodik would like to seek the ohr close sooner rather than later it would be a stretch to describe the current political climate as positive .
recently , the high representative has been at loggerheads with the prime minister of the republika srpska , milorad dodik .
last month , the rs assembly passed a resolution demanding , among other things , that inzko transfer a package of powers to it from the central bosnian government .
after weeks of consultations , the high representative revoked the resolution , arguing that it violated the dayton agreement . pressure to leave it 's not surprising then , that the serbs want to see the office of the high representative shut down , sooner rather than later .
speaking to reporters in the republika srpska capital , banja luka , before the resolution was revoked , prime minister dodik said he was n't convinced that the office of the high representative was working in the best interests of the republika srbska .
“ by and large the office of the high representative -lrb- ohr -rrb- has employed a few international representatives , but most were local staff , mainly from the federation side , from sarajevo .
these people have created ill-feelings towards the republika srpska . ”
as with so many issues in bosnia , republika srpska and federation politicians are divided on this issue .
federation leaders say the country does n't have strong enough central institutions to close down the ohr .
haris silajdzic , the bosniak member of the bosnian presidency told reporters that he would do what he could to ensure that the ohr remains beyond the end of this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haris silajdzic says it is too early for the ohr to close up shop but he also conceded that there seemed to be an international political consensus that now was the time to pull the plug on the ohr , leaving only a non-executive european union special representative in its place .
despite dayton 's and bosnia 's flaws , the fact that the country has been at peace for more than 13 years is a considerable achievement in itself .
unemployment is high , but the cafes in both sarajevo and banja luka are full .
as one opposition politician in republika srpska put it : “ we do n't like each other very much , but at least we are not killing each other on the basis of our ethnic groups anymore .
we do n't have the most beautiful democracy in the world , but it 's not that bad . ” author : chuck penfold editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.07.2009 normality comes in small doses in bosnia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instead of scenes of war , sarajevo today is characterized by a fragile peace more than 13 years after the dayton accord was signed , ending the bosnia 's inter-ethnic conflict in 1995 , the balkan country remains a very divided place . while peace and security have long since been established , few of those displaced during the three-year war have returned to homes in areas where their ethnic group is not in the majority .
despite this , there is a growing feeling among some people that it is time for the international community to step back , and hand over more responsibility for bosnia 's future to that country 's politicians .
the dayton accord that ended the bloodshed in bosnia-hercegovina in late 1995 is one of the few things that most bosnians can agree on .
they 'll tell you that it was successful in ending the war , but that it has been deficient when it comes to plotting a long-term path for the country 's future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it provided for the creation of a very weak central government , with the two entities , the bosniak / croat federation and the republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , wielding much of the legislative power .
this has led to divisions that had their roots in the 1992-95 war becoming formally ingrained during more than a decade of peace .
perhaps one of the most significant issues for the future of the country is the fact that children receive instruction in separate bosniak , serb or croat school systems .
seventy percent of the curriculum is set out by the state , with the remaining 30 percent left at the discretion of the schools .
croat high school student ante zelic explains that typically , these 30 percent are used for subjects like history or language instruction .
the students learn history , for example , from a croat point of view , or read two or three more novels by croatian authors than one would in other schools , says zelic .
while outsiders may think that this sort of division is the last thing that bosnian students need if the country is to grow more united in future , zelic does n't seem to see this as much of a problem .
his bosniak counterpart , adnan pripoljac , says the fact that students are divided in school is n't the point . “ i have my lessons in the morning and my croat colleagues go to classes in the afternoon .
but after school or in the evening we hang out together as usual .
most young people in bosnia do n't want to be separated , it 's just a political issue that has to be resolved . ”
practical problems while some politicians admit that the school situation is n't ideal , nobody seems to have a plan for integrating the educational systems .
a third student , dzeznan karic says there are practical considerations discouraging politicians from taking steps to change the status quo .
“ you have to realize that in every school there are , for example , two professors of geography , two professors of history , language , mathematics , physics , etc .
if they were to unite the school , this would leave one professor out of a job , and this is in nobody 's interest .
everyone is protecting their national interests .
why should a croat professor lose his job when there is also a bosniak professor who could lose his job ?
so it is a very political matter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valentin inzko hopes to be bosnia 's last high representative not even the international community 's special representative in bosnia has the answer .
the high representative still holds absolute power in this country , to be used to do whatever it takes to ensure that the provisions of the dayton accord are complied with .
this includes the power to revoke legislation or even remove politicians from office .
valentin inzko , the seventh person to hold this post , hopes he will be bosnia 's last high representative .
he recently told reporters in sarajevo that he hoped a decision would be taken in october , which would see the office of the high representative close at the end of this year .
“ i am moderately optimistic and i am doing everything in my power to ensure that this happens .
but the bosnians themselves also have to do something to improve the political climate , because -lrb- one -rrb- condition is a positive political climate and the implementation of dayton . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milorad dodik would like to seek the ohr close sooner rather than later it would be a stretch to describe the current political climate as positive .
recently , the high representative has been at loggerheads with the prime minister of the republika srpska , milorad dodik .
last month , the rs assembly passed a resolution demanding , among other things , that inzko transfer a package of powers to it from the central bosnian government .
after weeks of consultations , the high representative revoked the resolution , arguing that it violated the dayton agreement . pressure to leave it 's not surprising then , that the serbs want to see the office of the high representative shut down , sooner rather than later .
speaking to reporters in the republika srpska capital , banja luka , before the resolution was revoked , prime minister dodik said he was n't convinced that the office of the high representative was working in the best interests of the republika srbska .
“ by and large the office of the high representative -lrb- ohr -rrb- has employed a few international representatives , but most were local staff , mainly from the federation side , from sarajevo .
these people have created ill-feelings towards the republika srpska . ”
as with so many issues in bosnia , republika srpska and federation politicians are divided on this issue .
federation leaders say the country does n't have strong enough central institutions to close down the ohr .
haris silajdzic , the bosniak member of the bosnian presidency told reporters that he would do what he could to ensure that the ohr remains beyond the end of this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haris silajdzic says it is too early for the ohr to close up shop but he also conceded that there seemed to be an international political consensus that now was the time to pull the plug on the ohr , leaving only a non-executive european union special representative in its place .
despite dayton 's and bosnia 's flaws , the fact that the country has been at peace for more than 13 years is a considerable achievement in itself .
unemployment is high , but the cafes in both sarajevo and banja luka are full .
as one opposition politician in republika srpska put it : “ we do n't like each other very much , but at least we are not killing each other on the basis of our ethnic groups anymore .

it comes as israeli premier benjamin netanyahu has referred to a ' ' two-state solution " for the first time . the aim of minister frank-walter steinmeier 's two-day trip is to jumpstart the dormant peace process .
on monday , he is to hold talks with israeli president shimon peres , prime minister benyamin netanyahu , and foreign minister avigdor lieberman in jerusalem .
he will also visit lebanon and syria .
steinmeier has been among world leaders who have criticized israeli settlement building programs in east jerusalem and the west bank .
thus far , netanyahu 's government had refused to freeze settlement activities and had not agreed to a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu is known for his tough stance on the palestinian issue however , on sunday , netanyahu referred for the first time to a " two-state solution " to bring peace to the middle east .
" we have achieved a national agreement on the formula of two states for two peoples , " the israeli prime minister said during the weekly cabinet meeting .
steinmeier is expected to pay a visit to the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem on monday .
media reports said that a meeting planned with palestinian president mahmoud abbas in the west bank town of ramallah was not likely to take place , because abbas is visiting jordan for talks on forming a palestinian unity government with the rival hamas movement .
support for us efforts it will be steinmeier 's 14th trip to the region since becoming germany 's foreign minister in 2005 .
it involves an exacting schedule , covering nearly 6,500 kilometers and four countries in just 36 hours .
the whirlwind tour of the middle east is meant to lend impetus to germany 's desire for peace in the region as soon as possible , according to a foreign ministry spokesman in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the obama administration wants to reinvigorate the peace process " we have had new momentum in the middle east peace process since the new government took office in washington and we support its fresh efforts to reach a two-state solution and a return to negotiations , " said andreas peschke ahead of steinmeier 's trip .
peschke added that berlin was pursuing a middle east policy focused on practical assistance on the ground , including development assistance for the palestinians and training for security forces in the territories to help prepare for eventual statehood .
during his visit to the west bank on monday , steinmeier will assess the progress of such projects .
the foreign ministry spokesman said that germany 's engagement in the region was determined in consultation with its european partners and the government of us president barack obama .
the new administration in washington consulted berlin in the conceptual stages of the reorientation of its middle east policy . in a further reflection of the ongoing efforts to harmonize international peace efforts in the region , steinmeier held intensive discussions via telephone with his american counterpart hillary clinton and the us the middle east mediator george mitchell , prior to his middle east trip .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syrian president assad has been engaging the international community neighbors have crucial role german officials said steinmeier hoped to persuade neighboring arab states to play a more active role in diplomatic efforts to end the israeli-palestinian conflict .
acknowledging the crucial role of the neighbors in any peace process , foreign ministry spokesman andreas peschke said that germany saw several rays of hope in the region , including last month 's peaceful elections in lebanon and improved relations between lebanon and syria .
he added that all these factors presented a " window of opportunity . "
in light of these developments , steinmeier will also travel to damascus for talks with his syrian counterpart wali al-muallem and president bashar al-assad .
in the past , steinmeier , who is set to challenge chancellor angela merkel in september 's general election , faced criticism from the chancellery and the us administration for his efforts to engage syria .
however , the obama administration has dramatically softened washington 's stance towards damascus .
and this week , the us announced that it would send an ambassador back to damascus after a four-year gap .
the move comes amid a region-wide campaign to lay the groundwork for middle east peace .
in response , president assad invited obama to visit syria .
when he travels to the lebanese capital beirut , steinmeier will become the first western politician to meet prime minister-designate saad hariri , the son of former premier rafik hariri , who was killed in a bomb blast in 2005 .
hariri 's pro-western alliance won last month 's general elections .
some observers say germany is aware that it does not have the influence to broker middle east peace on its own , but that steinmeier clearly wants to be part of the obama administration 's efforts in that direction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : settlement activity in the occupied territories is a point of contention issue on g8 agenda the trip comes ahead of next week 's g8 summit in italy .
chancellor merkel indicated last week that the middle east conflict would figure prominently in those talks .
she said " concessions from all sides were necessary , " for the peace process to succeed .
calling for a halt to the construction of israeli settlements , merkel said " there has to be a freeze .
otherwise i am convinced we will not achieve the two-state solution that we urgently need - a jewish state of israel and a palestinian state that can live in security .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.07.2009 normality comes in small doses in bosnia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instead of scenes of war , sarajevo today is characterized by a fragile peace more than 13 years after the dayton accord was signed , ending the bosnia 's inter-ethnic conflict in 1995 , the balkan country remains a very divided place . while peace and security have long since been established , few of those displaced during the three-year war have returned to homes in areas where their ethnic group is not in the majority .
despite this , there is a growing feeling among some people that it is time for the international community to step back , and hand over more responsibility for bosnia 's future to that country 's politicians .
the dayton accord that ended the bloodshed in bosnia-hercegovina in late 1995 is one of the few things that most bosnians can agree on .
they 'll tell you that it was successful in ending the war , but that it has been deficient when it comes to plotting a long-term path for the country 's future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it provided for the creation of a very weak central government , with the two entities , the bosniak / croat federation and the republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , wielding much of the legislative power .
this has led to divisions that had their roots in the 1992-95 war becoming formally ingrained during more than a decade of peace .
perhaps one of the most significant issues for the future of the country is the fact that children receive instruction in separate bosniak , serb or croat school systems .
seventy percent of the curriculum is set out by the state , with the remaining 30 percent left at the discretion of the schools .
croat high school student ante zelic explains that typically , these 30 percent are used for subjects like history or language instruction .
the students learn history , for example , from a croat point of view , or read two or three more novels by croatian authors than one would in other schools , says zelic .
while outsiders may think that this sort of division is the last thing that bosnian students need if the country is to grow more united in future , zelic does n't seem to see this as much of a problem .
his bosniak counterpart , adnan pripoljac , says the fact that students are divided in school is n't the point . “ i have my lessons in the morning and my croat colleagues go to classes in the afternoon .
but after school or in the evening we hang out together as usual .
most young people in bosnia do n't want to be separated , it 's just a political issue that has to be resolved . ”
practical problems while some politicians admit that the school situation is n't ideal , nobody seems to have a plan for integrating the educational systems .
a third student , dzeznan karic says there are practical considerations discouraging politicians from taking steps to change the status quo .
“ you have to realize that in every school there are , for example , two professors of geography , two professors of history , language , mathematics , physics , etc .
if they were to unite the school , this would leave one professor out of a job , and this is in nobody 's interest .
everyone is protecting their national interests .
why should a croat professor lose his job when there is also a bosniak professor who could lose his job ?
so it is a very political matter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valentin inzko hopes to be bosnia 's last high representative not even the international community 's special representative in bosnia has the answer .
the high representative still holds absolute power in this country , to be used to do whatever it takes to ensure that the provisions of the dayton accord are complied with .
this includes the power to revoke legislation or even remove politicians from office .
valentin inzko , the seventh person to hold this post , hopes he will be bosnia 's last high representative .
he recently told reporters in sarajevo that he hoped a decision would be taken in october , which would see the office of the high representative close at the end of this year .
“ i am moderately optimistic and i am doing everything in my power to ensure that this happens .
but the bosnians themselves also have to do something to improve the political climate , because -lrb- one -rrb- condition is a positive political climate and the implementation of dayton . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milorad dodik would like to seek the ohr close sooner rather than later it would be a stretch to describe the current political climate as positive .
recently , the high representative has been at loggerheads with the prime minister of the republika srpska , milorad dodik .
last month , the rs assembly passed a resolution demanding , among other things , that inzko transfer a package of powers to it from the central bosnian government .
after weeks of consultations , the high representative revoked the resolution , arguing that it violated the dayton agreement . pressure to leave it 's not surprising then , that the serbs want to see the office of the high representative shut down , sooner rather than later .
speaking to reporters in the republika srpska capital , banja luka , before the resolution was revoked , prime minister dodik said he was n't convinced that the office of the high representative was working in the best interests of the republika srbska .
“ by and large the office of the high representative -lrb- ohr -rrb- has employed a few international representatives , but most were local staff , mainly from the federation side , from sarajevo .
these people have created ill-feelings towards the republika srpska . ”
as with so many issues in bosnia , republika srpska and federation politicians are divided on this issue .
federation leaders say the country does n't have strong enough central institutions to close down the ohr .
haris silajdzic , the bosniak member of the bosnian presidency told reporters that he would do what he could to ensure that the ohr remains beyond the end of this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haris silajdzic says it is too early for the ohr to close up shop but he also conceded that there seemed to be an international political consensus that now was the time to pull the plug on the ohr , leaving only a non-executive european union special representative in its place .
despite dayton 's and bosnia 's flaws , the fact that the country has been at peace for more than 13 years is a considerable achievement in itself .
unemployment is high , but the cafes in both sarajevo and banja luka are full .
as one opposition politician in republika srpska put it : “ we do n't like each other very much , but at least we are not killing each other on the basis of our ethnic groups anymore .
we do n't have the most beautiful democracy in the world , but it 's not that bad . ” author : chuck penfold editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it comes as israeli premier benjamin netanyahu has referred to a ' ' two-state solution " for the first time . the aim of minister frank-walter steinmeier 's two-day trip is to jumpstart the dormant peace process .
on monday , he is to hold talks with israeli president shimon peres , prime minister benyamin netanyahu , and foreign minister avigdor lieberman in jerusalem .
he will also visit lebanon and syria .
steinmeier has been among world leaders who have criticized israeli settlement building programs in east jerusalem and the west bank .
thus far , netanyahu 's government had refused to freeze settlement activities and had not agreed to a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu is known for his tough stance on the palestinian issue however , on sunday , netanyahu referred for the first time to a " two-state solution " to bring peace to the middle east .
" we have achieved a national agreement on the formula of two states for two peoples , " the israeli prime minister said during the weekly cabinet meeting .
steinmeier is expected to pay a visit to the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem on monday .
media reports said that a meeting planned with palestinian president mahmoud abbas in the west bank town of ramallah was not likely to take place , because abbas is visiting jordan for talks on forming a palestinian unity government with the rival hamas movement .
support for us efforts it will be steinmeier 's 14th trip to the region since becoming germany 's foreign minister in 2005 .
it involves an exacting schedule , covering nearly 6,500 kilometers and four countries in just 36 hours .
the whirlwind tour of the middle east is meant to lend impetus to germany 's desire for peace in the region as soon as possible , according to a foreign ministry spokesman in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the obama administration wants to reinvigorate the peace process " we have had new momentum in the middle east peace process since the new government took office in washington and we support its fresh efforts to reach a two-state solution and a return to negotiations , " said andreas peschke ahead of steinmeier 's trip .
peschke added that berlin was pursuing a middle east policy focused on practical assistance on the ground , including development assistance for the palestinians and training for security forces in the territories to help prepare for eventual statehood .
during his visit to the west bank on monday , steinmeier will assess the progress of such projects .
the foreign ministry spokesman said that germany 's engagement in the region was determined in consultation with its european partners and the government of us president barack obama .
the new administration in washington consulted berlin in the conceptual stages of the reorientation of its middle east policy . in a further reflection of the ongoing efforts to harmonize international peace efforts in the region , steinmeier held intensive discussions via telephone with his american counterpart hillary clinton and the us the middle east mediator george mitchell , prior to his middle east trip .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syrian president assad has been engaging the international community neighbors have crucial role german officials said steinmeier hoped to persuade neighboring arab states to play a more active role in diplomatic efforts to end the israeli-palestinian conflict .
acknowledging the crucial role of the neighbors in any peace process , foreign ministry spokesman andreas peschke said that germany saw several rays of hope in the region , including last month 's peaceful elections in lebanon and improved relations between lebanon and syria .
he added that all these factors presented a " window of opportunity . "
in light of these developments , steinmeier will also travel to damascus for talks with his syrian counterpart wali al-muallem and president bashar al-assad .
in the past , steinmeier , who is set to challenge chancellor angela merkel in september 's general election , faced criticism from the chancellery and the us administration for his efforts to engage syria .
however , the obama administration has dramatically softened washington 's stance towards damascus .
and this week , the us announced that it would send an ambassador back to damascus after a four-year gap .
the move comes amid a region-wide campaign to lay the groundwork for middle east peace .
in response , president assad invited obama to visit syria .
when he travels to the lebanese capital beirut , steinmeier will become the first western politician to meet prime minister-designate saad hariri , the son of former premier rafik hariri , who was killed in a bomb blast in 2005 .
hariri 's pro-western alliance won last month 's general elections .
some observers say germany is aware that it does not have the influence to broker middle east peace on its own , but that steinmeier clearly wants to be part of the obama administration 's efforts in that direction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : settlement activity in the occupied territories is a point of contention issue on g8 agenda the trip comes ahead of next week 's g8 summit in italy .
chancellor merkel indicated last week that the middle east conflict would figure prominently in those talks .
she said " concessions from all sides were necessary , " for the peace process to succeed .
calling for a halt to the construction of israeli settlements , merkel said " there has to be a freeze .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 05.07.2009 financial crisis hits african trade , aid as wto gears up for summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trade is an important way of helping africa the world trade organization is preparing to review its aid for trade initiative at an international conference in geneva .
the trade situation of developing countries in the economic crisis will be top of the agenda . give developing countries the tools to improve their position as trade partners and both their own development and the international trade situation will also improve .
that 's the idea behind " aid for trade , " which the wto launched in hong kong four years ago , wto director general pascal lamy tells deutsche welle .
" developing countries very often face trade barriers , which either stem from their own infrastructure - for example roadways , transport or energy - or they face technical trade barriers , for example if someone wants to export flowers to the us or to europe he will have to meet the maximum pesticide residue standard , " he says .
africa , more so than any other continent , faces these kinds of problems as it tries to increase its trade capacity .
and to make matter worse , lamy says , africa has seen a decrease in participation in international trade over the last 10 years .
" in absolute value african trade has grown , but in relative value , as compared to the whole world trade , it has decreased , " he explains .
" the fundamental point for africa is , one , trying to diversify exports to meet international demand , and , two , making sure that inter-african trade grows .
at the moment the trade between african countries is incredibly low . "
lamy underlines that international trade accounts for around 15 percent of economic activity in europe and the us , but three to four times as much in africa .
" hence the enormous importance of keeping trade open during the crisis , which means fighting protectionism , because that would hit developing countries most .
and then , keeping investment in the future so they can trade their way out of the crisis . "
downward spiral bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more trade with the eu and within africa will make a difference the ongoing international economic crisis has hit africa in particular , dr. mohammed ibn chambas tells deutsche welle .
chambas is executive secretary of ecowas , the economic community of west african states .
he explains the downward spiral : the shrinking global economy leads to lower demand for commodities from west africa and africa as a whole .
lower demand also means lower prices .
but there is more : " the strong global growth led to 5 percent growth in africa in the year preceding the crisis , " he says .
" the slowdown has of course led to a reduced african growth rate .
we will end 2009 at less than 3 percent .
that is not good because it 's very close to the population growth rate .
" secondly the transfer of funds from african diasporas is also invested in many activities for expanding trade , export trade in particular .
and all of this has obviously now been reduced . "
chambas says he is also worried that donor countries may reduce their support for the aid for trade program because of the crisis .
" of course aid for trade funding is dependant on support of the economies of the developed countries .
and now that these economies are under stress and in recession , naturally there is likely to be a shuffle in the promised resources .
these are legitimate concerns that we have on the african side , that not all the pledges that have been made will be provided . "
european responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without trade , illegal immigration will continue chambas says europe has a special duty to increase its aid to africa .
" the bulk of african trade is with europe .
we believe that the partnership between europe and africa should translate into concrete support for africa to reduce the impact of the global crisis , " he says .
" it 's a historic relationship that we can not wish away and i believe that in the context of this new partnership we should see how we can work together , europe and africa , to overcome the current economic slowdown . "
john clancy , spokesman for european commissioner for development and humanitarian aid louis michel , says europe 's history with africa is unique , and that the focus should be on measures to improve that relationship .
" i think what is important is not to look backward to the past , but to the present day and the future .
aid for trade is about partnership .
it is a complimentary aspect to assisting developing countries , those in africa in particular .
it should soften , to some extent , the changes that have to take place at a socio-economic level in these countries , so that they can profit from the global marketplace more than before . "

the trade situation of developing countries in the economic crisis will be top of the agenda . give developing countries the tools to improve their position as trade partners and both their own development and the international trade situation will also improve .
that 's the idea behind " aid for trade , " which the wto launched in hong kong four years ago , wto director general pascal lamy tells deutsche welle .
" developing countries very often face trade barriers , which either stem from their own infrastructure - for example roadways , transport or energy - or they face technical trade barriers , for example if someone wants to export flowers to the us or to europe he will have to meet the maximum pesticide residue standard , " he says .
africa , more so than any other continent , faces these kinds of problems as it tries to increase its trade capacity .
and to make matter worse , lamy says , africa has seen a decrease in participation in international trade over the last 10 years .
" in absolute value african trade has grown , but in relative value , as compared to the whole world trade , it has decreased , " he explains .
" the fundamental point for africa is , one , trying to diversify exports to meet international demand , and , two , making sure that inter-african trade grows .
at the moment the trade between african countries is incredibly low . "
lamy underlines that international trade accounts for around 15 percent of economic activity in europe and the us , but three to four times as much in africa .
" hence the enormous importance of keeping trade open during the crisis , which means fighting protectionism , because that would hit developing countries most .
and then , keeping investment in the future so they can trade their way out of the crisis . "
downward spiral bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more trade with the eu and within africa will make a difference the ongoing international economic crisis has hit africa in particular , dr. mohammed ibn chambas tells deutsche welle .
chambas is executive secretary of ecowas , the economic community of west african states .
he explains the downward spiral : the shrinking global economy leads to lower demand for commodities from west africa and africa as a whole .
lower demand also means lower prices .
but there is more : " the strong global growth led to 5 percent growth in africa in the year preceding the crisis , " he says .
" the slowdown has of course led to a reduced african growth rate .
we will end 2009 at less than 3 percent .
that is not good because it 's very close to the population growth rate .
" secondly the transfer of funds from african diasporas is also invested in many activities for expanding trade , export trade in particular .
and all of this has obviously now been reduced . "
chambas says he is also worried that donor countries may reduce their support for the aid for trade program because of the crisis .
" of course aid for trade funding is dependant on support of the economies of the developed countries .
and now that these economies are under stress and in recession , naturally there is likely to be a shuffle in the promised resources .
these are legitimate concerns that we have on the african side , that not all the pledges that have been made will be provided . "

" as a uefa member , i would like to see it in europe but it is an open race as to which country might get it … there are a lot of different countries bidding .
let 's wait and see . "
he added however that " it will be europe 's turn -lrb- in 2018 -rrb- . "
beckenbauer , known as " der kaiser " for his legendary playing and coaching achievements , sits on governing body fifa 's 24-member executive committee that is charged with voting on which countries host the world cup every four years .

the 2010 world cup will be hosted by south africa , while brazil will hold the 2014 edition of the tournament .
beckenbauer added that if the 2018 world cup was awarded to a european country , then a country like australia could be a strong contender for the 2022 event .

"
ecclestone also criticised ousting saddam hussein and the taliban . the comment , made to the times newspaper in an interview published on friday , has led to a furore among jewish groups and politicians .
ecclestone , 78 , praised the virtues of strong leadership and condemned contemporary politicians for their weakness .
the times quoted ecclestone as saying that democracy " has n't done a lot of good for many countries , including this one . "
" in a lot of ways , terrible to say this i suppose , " ecclestone said , " but apart from the fact that hitler got taken away and persuaded to do things that i have no idea whether he wanted to do or not , he was in the way that he could command a lot of people , able to get things done . "
ecclestone told the paper that politicians were too worried about elections and that he would support the concept of a government based on tyranny .
" we did a terrible thing when we supported the idea of getting rid of saddam hussein , " ecclestone went on to say , " he was the only one who could control that country . "
" it was the same -lrb- with the taliban -rrb- .
we move into countries and we have no idea of the culture . "
max mosley for prime minister ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max mosley- prime ministerial material ?
he went on to include british prime minister margaret thatcher , and max mosley , outgoing head of formula one 's governing body , as leadership examples - even suggesting max mosley should be britain 's prime minister .
eccleston went on to say " the americans probably thought bosnia was a town in miami .
there are people starving in africa and we sit back and do nothing but we get involved in things we should leave alone . "
jewish groups have crticized the comments , with a spokesman for the board of deputies of british jews calling them " quite bizarre . "
meanwhile , stephen pollard , editor of the jewish chronicle , said ecclestone was either " an idiot or morally repulsive . "
" either he has no idea how stupid and offensive his views are , or he does - and deserves to be held in contempt by all decent people , " he said .

the ruling socialist party is predicted to do badly , with corruption allegations largely to blame . the parliamentary election campaign in bulgaria has been a fierce one .
the ruling socialist party has attacked the opposition center-right gerb in particularly vicious television advertisements .
a few weeks before the election , the government also changed voting rights in its favour .
this could be a last-ditch attempt to stay in power , with opinion polls predicting a change . bulgaria is currently governed by a coalition made up of prime minister sergei stanishev 's socialist party and two junior partners : the movement for rights and freedom , a party representing bulgaria 's turkish minority ; and the national movement formed by the former tsar of bulgaria .
many bulgarians blame the coalition for the country 's widespread corruption , the misappropriation of millions in aid money from the european union , and the ire of brussels .
these are the factors that will likely see voters turn away from the governing parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarians are some of the poorest people in the eu " the new government will probably try to send a few high-profile people to prison as a result of corruption allegations , " says georgi ganev , an economist at sofia 's centre for liberal strategies .
" that 's why the election campaign has been fought so hard . " 50 euros for a vote but corruption in bulgaria may have even entered the ballot booth .
during the recent european parliamentary elections , there were allegations that voters were bought on a large scale .
watchdogs are concerned that this type of manipulation may continue in the national election .
tihomir beslov from bulgaria 's centre for democratic research says votes can be bought for between 50 and 150 euros .
he says that kind of money can support a family in one of bulgaria 's poorer regions for two or three months .
" an entire company 's employees could also be pressured by their bosses to vote for a particular party , " beslov says .
" for example , muslims would be forced to swear before allah that they would vote for the party representing the turkish minority . "
" bulgarians want justice " the party likely to win the most votes in sunday 's election is the center-right gerb , led by sofia mayor boyko borisov .
the party has promised to fight corruption , and gerb member maria nedelcheva recently told the european parliament that bulgarians wanted justice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boyko borisov only founded gerb a few years ago " they expect criminal convictions and they want criminal proceedings to finally be launched against those responsible , " nedelcheva said .
" we are determined to do that . "
but even gerb is not expected to win an outright majority .
experts believe that disillusioned bulgarians may not turn up to polling booths at all .
a recent opinion poll showed gerb grabbing just over 30 percent of the vote , while the ruling socialists are predicted to take just over 20 percent .
with no one party likely to win a majority , another coalition for bulgaria looks likely - talks that could drag on for months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 05.07.2009 bulgarians head to polls amid vote-buying allegations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allegations of vote-buying may overshadow bulgarian elections bulgarians are heading to the polls on sunday for the country 's first parliamentary election since joining the eu .
the ruling socialist party is predicted to do badly , with corruption allegations largely to blame . the parliamentary election campaign in bulgaria has been a fierce one .
the ruling socialist party has attacked the opposition center-right gerb in particularly vicious television advertisements .
a few weeks before the election , the government also changed voting rights in its favour .
this could be a last-ditch attempt to stay in power , with opinion polls predicting a change . bulgaria is currently governed by a coalition made up of prime minister sergei stanishev 's socialist party and two junior partners : the movement for rights and freedom , a party representing bulgaria 's turkish minority ; and the national movement formed by the former tsar of bulgaria .
many bulgarians blame the coalition for the country 's widespread corruption , the misappropriation of millions in aid money from the european union , and the ire of brussels .
these are the factors that will likely see voters turn away from the governing parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarians are some of the poorest people in the eu " the new government will probably try to send a few high-profile people to prison as a result of corruption allegations , " says georgi ganev , an economist at sofia 's centre for liberal strategies .
" that 's why the election campaign has been fought so hard . " 50 euros for a vote but corruption in bulgaria may have even entered the ballot booth .
during the recent european parliamentary elections , there were allegations that voters were bought on a large scale .
watchdogs are concerned that this type of manipulation may continue in the national election .
tihomir beslov from bulgaria 's centre for democratic research says votes can be bought for between 50 and 150 euros .
he says that kind of money can support a family in one of bulgaria 's poorer regions for two or three months .
" an entire company 's employees could also be pressured by their bosses to vote for a particular party , " beslov says .
" for example , muslims would be forced to swear before allah that they would vote for the party representing the turkish minority . "
" bulgarians want justice " the party likely to win the most votes in sunday 's election is the center-right gerb , led by sofia mayor boyko borisov .
the party has promised to fight corruption , and gerb member maria nedelcheva recently told the european parliament that bulgarians wanted justice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boyko borisov only founded gerb a few years ago " they expect criminal convictions and they want criminal proceedings to finally be launched against those responsible , " nedelcheva said .
" we are determined to do that . "
but even gerb is not expected to win an outright majority .
experts believe that disillusioned bulgarians may not turn up to polling booths at all .
a recent opinion poll showed gerb grabbing just over 30 percent of the vote , while the ruling socialists are predicted to take just over 20 percent .
with no one party likely to win a majority , another coalition for bulgaria looks likely - talks that could drag on for months .

financial institutes remain reluctant to lend despite having received billions in finanical aid . german finance minister peer steinbrueck has warned banking managers over their reluctance to lend .
in sunday 's edition of the tabloid bild he says he was doubtful that a bill passed on friday in berlin to allow german banks to park their toxic assets in a so-called bad bank structure will be enough to get the banks back into the business of providing credit . instead , he 's threatening banks with unnamed sanctions should a credit crunch be the result of their too conservative lending policies .
his warning is that the government and the central bank will have to take steps to force the bankers ' hand .
these as yet unspecified actions , steinbrueck warns , would include measures never before used against financial institutions in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck warned banking managers over their reluctance to lend late last year , banks all over the world demanded billions in financial aid from their governments .
otherwise , they said , they would be forced into bankruptcy with unforeseeable consequences for the world economy . governments from washington , to london , to tokyo to berlin complied , despite the enormously high political risk involved .
there was political consensus that the banks were simply too big to be allowed to fail . despite state aid , banks are reluctant to lend today , german banks are doing far better , but stand accused of still being reluctant to lend to businesses and companies which increasingly feel the pinch of the global recession . for months , small and medium sized companies in germany have been finding it more and more difficult - if not impossible - to keep credit lines with their banks open . " at the moment there is no credit crunch , " said martin wansleben , managing director of the german chamber of industry and commerce . " but more and more companies are having difficulty getting needed loans .
it 's more complicated .
it 's more expensive .
and many are simply being rejected outright . " but , could the german government actually force banks to lend money ?
finance minister peer steinbrueck refused to fuel speculation on that .
however , other politicians are less subtle in their warnings to the banks . condemnation from across party lines " we helped the banks with massive funding and political support , " saarland state premier peter mueller said on saturday . " now , it 's up to the banks to provide that help to companies . " the banks are accused of taking the government 's money but using it only to improve their own financial situation , not the country 's economy . " we must now ensure that banks are obliged to offer credit on a more liberal basis , " urged fritz kuhn , parliamentary leader of the greens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's president accused the banks of causing the crisis politicians of all parties are united in their determination to force german banks to make credit available over fears of unemployment rising even further due to a lack of credit for businesses . german president horst koehler - himself a former head of the world bank - added his voice to the critics in a television interview . " i appeal to the banks to do more to ensure that the economy can grow , " he said . koehler 's criticism of the banks was the most pointed of all .
he accused them of first causing the worldwide economic crisis and now hesitating to help find a solution for it . rd / afp / dpa editor : carl holm send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at sunday 's historic wimbledon , roger federer broke the grand slam record .
but the personal stakes at the 1937 germany-us davis cup duel were higher for german baron gottfried von cramm : he was playing for his life . " a terrible splendor : three extraordinary men , a world poised for war and the greatest tennis match ever played " tells the story of tennis champion gottfried von cramm , who had been secretly gay in hitler 's germany and his opponent don budge , who was the top ranked us player .
it is also the story of von cramm 's gay american coach bill tilden , who was training the nazi german team against his own country in a decisive davis cup match in 1937 .
deutsche welle spoke to marshall jon fisher , the author of the newly released book . deutsche welle : why was gottfried von cramm so popular with the crowds ?
and why was he so important to the nazi leadership ?
marshall jon fisher : von cramm was a remarkable character .
he was gracious , famous for his sportsmanship and from a noble background , but did n't act that way at all .
he was tall , very handsome , very germanic-looking - blond , blue-eyed - the nazis were holding him up as the perfect model of the aryan athlete .
the nazi officials were of course very interested in using sports figures as propaganda tools , such as -lrb- boxing legend -rrb- max schmeling .
-lrb- nazi propaganda minister joseph -rrb- goebbels made a big deal out of the 1936 berlin olympics and declared it a triumph for germany , so the davis cup could have served similar purposes for him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's nadal ended federer 's wimbledon winning streak last year there have been a few other " greatest matches ever " on centre court at wimbledon - the epic bjorn borg - john mcenroe duel in 1980 and the stunning marathon between roger federer and rafael nadal last year .
what makes budge vs. von cramm , the " greatest match ever " ?
borg-mcenroe and federer-nadal were incredible tennis matches , but what was at stake really , except which multi-millionaire would get to hold up the trophy afterwards ?
it was just tennis .
but in the von cramm-budge case , it was about winning the davis cup , which meant playing for their nation 's glory .
there were also the personal stakes for von cramm - he was playing for his life at a time when the winds of war were building up .
he was also playing for a regime which he loathed .
it turned out that gottfried von cramm was a gay man playing for a government that was executing people like him .
he had of course been followed by the gestapo .
they had a big file on him .
his lover was jewish .
his wife - he had married a childhood friend - was one-quarter jewish .
the gestapo had made it clear to him that as long as he kept winning and that germany had a chance to win the davis cup with him , he would be safe .
but if things did n't go too well with him on the tennis court , that might not be the case .
there was quite an amazing amount of pressure on him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von cramm was secretly gay , but married barbara hutton .
how did the match go ?
this 1937 davis cup match was supposed to be a walk away for don budge , who had destroyed von cramm two weeks earlier at the wimbledon final in three straight sets , so everyone thought budge was going to win this match easily and the americans would win the davis cup , but von cramm just played stupendous tennis .
von cramm won the first two sets .
budge came back and won the second two sets .
in the decisive fifth set , von cramm was up 4 to 1 .
at this point everyone thought von cramm was going to win , but budge comes back again and it goes past 6-6 .
i 'd rather not give away the ending , but it turned into a remarkable fifth set .
so what happened to von cramm after the match ?
it was inevitable that no matter what happened in the match , von cramm was going to run into trouble in germany .
when he travelled around the world , he became more and more outspoken against the nazis and upon returning home from his travels in 1938 , he was arrested and sentenced to prison for homosexual acts .
now he got off a bit easy due to some good connections he had .
most homosexuals were going to the camps , but he simply went to prison in berlin for less than a year .
was it generally known that von cramm was homosexual ?
other players did know , but it was not publicly known even after the war when von cramm played the davis cup for west germany .
with -lrb- von cramm 's american coach -rrb- bill tilden , people knew .
he was not quite as dignified as von cramm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us champ bill tilden coached germany 's davis cup team regarding bill tilden - it 's very common nowadays for the coach of a national team to be foreign .
we see that a lot in international soccer .
but on the eve of world war ii , what tilden did , appears treacherous .
it was extraordinary , but not because tilden was a foreigner .
" big bill " tilden completely dominated the tennis world throughout the 1920s and kept the davis cup in the united states almost single-handedly .
he was also a gay man when one could n't talk about such things .
it was amazing the nazis hired not only an american , but a gay american to coach their davis cup team .
how did tilden , an american tennis idol , wind up coaching the nazi german team , of all teams ?
tilden had wanted to coach the americans for years , even offering to do it for free , but they turned him down every year , presumably because they were afraid of some scandal due to his homosexuality .
so when the germans finally gave him an offer , he was happy to take it . tennis today is an individual sport , you play for yourself rather than for your country and it 's the grand slam tournaments - the us , french , australian open and wimbledon of course - that are important .
could you explain the significance of the davis cup back then ?
well of course , we still have the davis cup , but it was much more significant back then .
all the big international tournaments then were also only open to amateurs .
tennis was much bigger in the sports world back then and the davis cup was even bigger than wimbledon .
the pro era in tennis began in 1968 .
gottfried von cramm survived the war , married woolworth heiress barbara hutton in the 1950s and became a successful cotton importer .
he died in a car accident on a business trip in egypt in 1976 .
bill tilden tried to pursue an acting career in hollywood , but served prison time for homosexual acts after the war .
because of his convictions , he was shunned from playing and teaching tennis .
he died of a stroke in 1953 .

at sunday 's historic wimbledon , roger federer broke the grand slam record .
but the personal stakes at the 1937 germany-us davis cup duel were higher for german baron gottfried von cramm : he was playing for his life . " a terrible splendor : three extraordinary men , a world poised for war and the greatest tennis match ever played " tells the story of tennis champion gottfried von cramm , who had been secretly gay in hitler 's germany and his opponent don budge , who was the top ranked us player .
it is also the story of von cramm 's gay american coach bill tilden , who was training the nazi german team against his own country in a decisive davis cup match in 1937 .
deutsche welle spoke to marshall jon fisher , the author of the newly released book . deutsche welle : why was gottfried von cramm so popular with the crowds ?
and why was he so important to the nazi leadership ?
marshall jon fisher : von cramm was a remarkable character .
he was gracious , famous for his sportsmanship and from a noble background , but did n't act that way at all .
he was tall , very handsome , very germanic-looking - blond , blue-eyed - the nazis were holding him up as the perfect model of the aryan athlete .
the nazi officials were of course very interested in using sports figures as propaganda tools , such as -lrb- boxing legend -rrb- max schmeling .
-lrb- nazi propaganda minister joseph -rrb- goebbels made a big deal out of the 1936 berlin olympics and declared it a triumph for germany , so the davis cup could have served similar purposes for him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's nadal ended federer 's wimbledon winning streak last year there have been a few other " greatest matches ever " on centre court at wimbledon - the epic bjorn borg - john mcenroe duel in 1980 and the stunning marathon between roger federer and rafael nadal last year .
what makes budge vs. von cramm , the " greatest match ever " ?
borg-mcenroe and federer-nadal were incredible tennis matches , but what was at stake really , except which multi-millionaire would get to hold up the trophy afterwards ?
it was just tennis .
but in the von cramm-budge case , it was about winning the davis cup , which meant playing for their nation 's glory .
there were also the personal stakes for von cramm - he was playing for his life at a time when the winds of war were building up .
he was also playing for a regime which he loathed .
it turned out that gottfried von cramm was a gay man playing for a government that was executing people like him .
he had of course been followed by the gestapo .
they had a big file on him .
his lover was jewish .
his wife - he had married a childhood friend - was one-quarter jewish .
the gestapo had made it clear to him that as long as he kept winning and that germany had a chance to win the davis cup with him , he would be safe .
but if things did n't go too well with him on the tennis court , that might not be the case .
there was quite an amazing amount of pressure on him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von cramm was secretly gay , but married barbara hutton .
how did the match go ?
this 1937 davis cup match was supposed to be a walk away for don budge , who had destroyed von cramm two weeks earlier at the wimbledon final in three straight sets , so everyone thought budge was going to win this match easily and the americans would win the davis cup , but von cramm just played stupendous tennis .
von cramm won the first two sets .
budge came back and won the second two sets .
in the decisive fifth set , von cramm was up 4 to 1 .
at this point everyone thought von cramm was going to win , but budge comes back again and it goes past 6-6 .
i 'd rather not give away the ending , but it turned into a remarkable fifth set .
so what happened to von cramm after the match ?
it was inevitable that no matter what happened in the match , von cramm was going to run into trouble in germany .
when he travelled around the world , he became more and more outspoken against the nazis and upon returning home from his travels in 1938 , he was arrested and sentenced to prison for homosexual acts .
now he got off a bit easy due to some good connections he had .
most homosexuals were going to the camps , but he simply went to prison in berlin for less than a year .
was it generally known that von cramm was homosexual ?
other players did know , but it was not publicly known even after the war when von cramm played the davis cup for west germany .
with -lrb- von cramm 's american coach -rrb- bill tilden , people knew .
he was not quite as dignified as von cramm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us champ bill tilden coached germany 's davis cup team regarding bill tilden - it 's very common nowadays for the coach of a national team to be foreign .
we see that a lot in international soccer .
but on the eve of world war ii , what tilden did , appears treacherous .
it was extraordinary , but not because tilden was a foreigner .
" big bill " tilden completely dominated the tennis world throughout the 1920s and kept the davis cup in the united states almost single-handedly .
he was also a gay man when one could n't talk about such things .
it was amazing the nazis hired not only an american , but a gay american to coach their davis cup team .
how did tilden , an american tennis idol , wind up coaching the nazi german team , of all teams ?
tilden had wanted to coach the americans for years , even offering to do it for free , but they turned him down every year , presumably because they were afraid of some scandal due to his homosexuality .
so when the germans finally gave him an offer , he was happy to take it . tennis today is an individual sport , you play for yourself rather than for your country and it 's the grand slam tournaments - the us , french , australian open and wimbledon of course - that are important .
could you explain the significance of the davis cup back then ?
well of course , we still have the davis cup , but it was much more significant back then .
all the big international tournaments then were also only open to amateurs .
tennis was much bigger in the sports world back then and the davis cup was even bigger than wimbledon .
the pro era in tennis began in 1968 .
gottfried von cramm survived the war , married woolworth heiress barbara hutton in the 1950s and became a successful cotton importer .
he died in a car accident on a business trip in egypt in 1976 .
bill tilden tried to pursue an acting career in hollywood , but served prison time for homosexual acts after the war .
because of his convictions , he was shunned from playing and teaching tennis .
he died of a stroke in 1953 .

despite this , there is a growing feeling among some people that it is time for the international community to step back , and hand over more responsibility for bosnia 's future to that country 's politicians .
the dayton accord that ended the bloodshed in bosnia-hercegovina in late 1995 is one of the few things that most bosnians can agree on .
they 'll tell you that it was successful in ending the war , but that it has been deficient when it comes to plotting a long-term path for the country 's future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it provided for the creation of a very weak central government , with the two entities , the bosniak / croat federation and the republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , wielding much of the legislative power .
this has led to divisions that had their roots in the 1992-95 war becoming formally ingrained during more than a decade of peace .
perhaps one of the most significant issues for the future of the country is the fact that children receive instruction in separate bosniak , serb or croat school systems .
seventy percent of the curriculum is set out by the state , with the remaining 30 percent left at the discretion of the schools .
croat high school student ante zelic explains that typically , these 30 percent are used for subjects like history or language instruction .
the students learn history , for example , from a croat point of view , or read two or three more novels by croatian authors than one would in other schools , says zelic .
while outsiders may think that this sort of division is the last thing that bosnian students need if the country is to grow more united in future , zelic does n't seem to see this as much of a problem .
his bosniak counterpart , adnan pripoljac , says the fact that students are divided in school is n't the point . “ i have my lessons in the morning and my croat colleagues go to classes in the afternoon .
but after school or in the evening we hang out together as usual .
most young people in bosnia do n't want to be separated , it 's just a political issue that has to be resolved . ”
practical problems while some politicians admit that the school situation is n't ideal , nobody seems to have a plan for integrating the educational systems .
a third student , dzeznan karic says there are practical considerations discouraging politicians from taking steps to change the status quo .
“ you have to realize that in every school there are , for example , two professors of geography , two professors of history , language , mathematics , physics , etc .
if they were to unite the school , this would leave one professor out of a job , and this is in nobody 's interest .
everyone is protecting their national interests .
why should a croat professor lose his job when there is also a bosniak professor who could lose his job ?
so it is a very political matter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valentin inzko hopes to be bosnia 's last high representative not even the international community 's special representative in bosnia has the answer .
the high representative still holds absolute power in this country , to be used to do whatever it takes to ensure that the provisions of the dayton accord are complied with .
this includes the power to revoke legislation or even remove politicians from office .
valentin inzko , the seventh person to hold this post , hopes he will be bosnia 's last high representative .
he recently told reporters in sarajevo that he hoped a decision would be taken in october , which would see the office of the high representative close at the end of this year .
“ i am moderately optimistic and i am doing everything in my power to ensure that this happens .
but the bosnians themselves also have to do something to improve the political climate , because -lrb- one -rrb- condition is a positive political climate and the implementation of dayton . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milorad dodik would like to seek the ohr close sooner rather than later it would be a stretch to describe the current political climate as positive .
recently , the high representative has been at loggerheads with the prime minister of the republika srpska , milorad dodik .
last month , the rs assembly passed a resolution demanding , among other things , that inzko transfer a package of powers to it from the central bosnian government .
after weeks of consultations , the high representative revoked the resolution , arguing that it violated the dayton agreement . pressure to leave it 's not surprising then , that the serbs want to see the office of the high representative shut down , sooner rather than later .
speaking to reporters in the republika srpska capital , banja luka , before the resolution was revoked , prime minister dodik said he was n't convinced that the office of the high representative was working in the best interests of the republika srbska .
“ by and large the office of the high representative -lrb- ohr -rrb- has employed a few international representatives , but most were local staff , mainly from the federation side , from sarajevo .
these people have created ill-feelings towards the republika srpska . ”
as with so many issues in bosnia , republika srpska and federation politicians are divided on this issue .
federation leaders say the country does n't have strong enough central institutions to close down the ohr .
haris silajdzic , the bosniak member of the bosnian presidency told reporters that he would do what he could to ensure that the ohr remains beyond the end of this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haris silajdzic says it is too early for the ohr to close up shop but he also conceded that there seemed to be an international political consensus that now was the time to pull the plug on the ohr , leaving only a non-executive european union special representative in its place .
despite dayton 's and bosnia 's flaws , the fact that the country has been at peace for more than 13 years is a considerable achievement in itself .
unemployment is high , but the cafes in both sarajevo and banja luka are full .
as one opposition politician in republika srpska put it : “ we do n't like each other very much , but at least we are not killing each other on the basis of our ethnic groups anymore .
we do n't have the most beautiful democracy in the world , but it 's not that bad . ” author : chuck penfold editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.07.2009 normality comes in small doses in bosnia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instead of scenes of war , sarajevo today is characterized by a fragile peace more than 13 years after the dayton accord was signed , ending the bosnia 's inter-ethnic conflict in 1995 , the balkan country remains a very divided place . while peace and security have long since been established , few of those displaced during the three-year war have returned to homes in areas where their ethnic group is not in the majority .
despite this , there is a growing feeling among some people that it is time for the international community to step back , and hand over more responsibility for bosnia 's future to that country 's politicians .
the dayton accord that ended the bloodshed in bosnia-hercegovina in late 1995 is one of the few things that most bosnians can agree on .
they 'll tell you that it was successful in ending the war , but that it has been deficient when it comes to plotting a long-term path for the country 's future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it provided for the creation of a very weak central government , with the two entities , the bosniak / croat federation and the republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , wielding much of the legislative power .
this has led to divisions that had their roots in the 1992-95 war becoming formally ingrained during more than a decade of peace .
perhaps one of the most significant issues for the future of the country is the fact that children receive instruction in separate bosniak , serb or croat school systems .
seventy percent of the curriculum is set out by the state , with the remaining 30 percent left at the discretion of the schools .
croat high school student ante zelic explains that typically , these 30 percent are used for subjects like history or language instruction .
the students learn history , for example , from a croat point of view , or read two or three more novels by croatian authors than one would in other schools , says zelic .
while outsiders may think that this sort of division is the last thing that bosnian students need if the country is to grow more united in future , zelic does n't seem to see this as much of a problem .
his bosniak counterpart , adnan pripoljac , says the fact that students are divided in school is n't the point . “ i have my lessons in the morning and my croat colleagues go to classes in the afternoon .
but after school or in the evening we hang out together as usual .
most young people in bosnia do n't want to be separated , it 's just a political issue that has to be resolved . ”
practical problems while some politicians admit that the school situation is n't ideal , nobody seems to have a plan for integrating the educational systems .
a third student , dzeznan karic says there are practical considerations discouraging politicians from taking steps to change the status quo .
“ you have to realize that in every school there are , for example , two professors of geography , two professors of history , language , mathematics , physics , etc .
if they were to unite the school , this would leave one professor out of a job , and this is in nobody 's interest .
everyone is protecting their national interests .
why should a croat professor lose his job when there is also a bosniak professor who could lose his job ?
so it is a very political matter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valentin inzko hopes to be bosnia 's last high representative not even the international community 's special representative in bosnia has the answer .
the high representative still holds absolute power in this country , to be used to do whatever it takes to ensure that the provisions of the dayton accord are complied with .
this includes the power to revoke legislation or even remove politicians from office .
valentin inzko , the seventh person to hold this post , hopes he will be bosnia 's last high representative .
he recently told reporters in sarajevo that he hoped a decision would be taken in october , which would see the office of the high representative close at the end of this year .
“ i am moderately optimistic and i am doing everything in my power to ensure that this happens .
but the bosnians themselves also have to do something to improve the political climate , because -lrb- one -rrb- condition is a positive political climate and the implementation of dayton . "

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sofia 's mayor boiko borisov has taken the prize exit polls by sova harris and alpha research suggested gerb would take between 115 and 117 seats in the 240-strong chamber , compared with 39 to 42 seats for the ruling socialists . if the exit polls are confirmed , there may be a hung parliament : both gerb and the socialists will need more than one ally to form a governing coalition .

they have also ruled out a coalition with the ultra nationalist ataka party , which took 8.8-9.2 percent of sunday 's vote , according to the exit polls . gerb 's most likely partner , the blue coalition of two small udf and dsb parties , reportedly secured 7.5-8.2 percent of votes . the turkish minority mrf party - the socialists ' current junior coalition partner - was credited with 11.3-13.5 percent . smaller parties such as the centrist nmsp of former king simeon saxe coburg , the nationalist olj party or the business formation lider could play a crucial role in forming the next government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist leader sergey stanishev is not smiling now " the most important thing now is an anti-crisis programme and cracking down on political corruption , " said martin dimitrov , the co-leader of the rightist blue coalition . the current government under sergey stanishev , which led bulgaria to eu membership in 2007 , has come under strong pressure from brussels to fight the country 's endemic corruption and organized crime . as a result , it did not come as a surprise that sunday 's election was marred by allegations of irregularities , particularly vote buying . with official results expected on monday , coalition talks could drag on for months and observers have voiced concern about a political impasse at a time when the economic crisis is expected to peak in bulgaria . some analysts have warned that bulgaria may even be forced to turn to the international monetary fund for help , joining several of its neighbours in central and eastern europe including hungary , latvia , romania and serbia . nk / afp / reuters / dpa editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 05.07.2009 german fm steinmeier kicks off middle east tour großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has a tough diplomatic schedule ahead foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has landed in israel to begin a whirlwind trip to the middle east .
it comes as israeli premier benjamin netanyahu has referred to a ' ' two-state solution " for the first time . the aim of minister frank-walter steinmeier 's two-day trip is to jumpstart the dormant peace process .
on monday , he is to hold talks with israeli president shimon peres , prime minister benyamin netanyahu , and foreign minister avigdor lieberman in jerusalem .
he will also visit lebanon and syria .
steinmeier has been among world leaders who have criticized israeli settlement building programs in east jerusalem and the west bank .
thus far , netanyahu 's government had refused to freeze settlement activities and had not agreed to a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu is known for his tough stance on the palestinian issue however , on sunday , netanyahu referred for the first time to a " two-state solution " to bring peace to the middle east .
" we have achieved a national agreement on the formula of two states for two peoples , " the israeli prime minister said during the weekly cabinet meeting .
steinmeier is expected to pay a visit to the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem on monday .
media reports said that a meeting planned with palestinian president mahmoud abbas in the west bank town of ramallah was not likely to take place , because abbas is visiting jordan for talks on forming a palestinian unity government with the rival hamas movement .
support for us efforts it will be steinmeier 's 14th trip to the region since becoming germany 's foreign minister in 2005 .
it involves an exacting schedule , covering nearly 6,500 kilometers and four countries in just 36 hours .
the whirlwind tour of the middle east is meant to lend impetus to germany 's desire for peace in the region as soon as possible , according to a foreign ministry spokesman in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the obama administration wants to reinvigorate the peace process " we have had new momentum in the middle east peace process since the new government took office in washington and we support its fresh efforts to reach a two-state solution and a return to negotiations , " said andreas peschke ahead of steinmeier 's trip .
peschke added that berlin was pursuing a middle east policy focused on practical assistance on the ground , including development assistance for the palestinians and training for security forces in the territories to help prepare for eventual statehood .
during his visit to the west bank on monday , steinmeier will assess the progress of such projects .
the foreign ministry spokesman said that germany 's engagement in the region was determined in consultation with its european partners and the government of us president barack obama .
the new administration in washington consulted berlin in the conceptual stages of the reorientation of its middle east policy . in a further reflection of the ongoing efforts to harmonize international peace efforts in the region , steinmeier held intensive discussions via telephone with his american counterpart hillary clinton and the us the middle east mediator george mitchell , prior to his middle east trip .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syrian president assad has been engaging the international community neighbors have crucial role german officials said steinmeier hoped to persuade neighboring arab states to play a more active role in diplomatic efforts to end the israeli-palestinian conflict .
acknowledging the crucial role of the neighbors in any peace process , foreign ministry spokesman andreas peschke said that germany saw several rays of hope in the region , including last month 's peaceful elections in lebanon and improved relations between lebanon and syria .
he added that all these factors presented a " window of opportunity . "
in light of these developments , steinmeier will also travel to damascus for talks with his syrian counterpart wali al-muallem and president bashar al-assad .
in the past , steinmeier , who is set to challenge chancellor angela merkel in september 's general election , faced criticism from the chancellery and the us administration for his efforts to engage syria .
however , the obama administration has dramatically softened washington 's stance towards damascus .
and this week , the us announced that it would send an ambassador back to damascus after a four-year gap .
the move comes amid a region-wide campaign to lay the groundwork for middle east peace .

the whirlwind tour of the middle east is meant to lend impetus to germany 's desire for peace in the region as soon as possible , according to a foreign ministry spokesman in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the obama administration wants to reinvigorate the peace process " we have had new momentum in the middle east peace process since the new government took office in washington and we support its fresh efforts to reach a two-state solution and a return to negotiations , " said andreas peschke ahead of steinmeier 's trip .
peschke added that berlin was pursuing a middle east policy focused on practical assistance on the ground , including development assistance for the palestinians and training for security forces in the territories to help prepare for eventual statehood .
during his visit to the west bank on monday , steinmeier will assess the progress of such projects .
the foreign ministry spokesman said that germany 's engagement in the region was determined in consultation with its european partners and the government of us president barack obama .
the new administration in washington consulted berlin in the conceptual stages of the reorientation of its middle east policy . in a further reflection of the ongoing efforts to harmonize international peace efforts in the region , steinmeier held intensive discussions via telephone with his american counterpart hillary clinton and the us the middle east mediator george mitchell , prior to his middle east trip .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syrian president assad has been engaging the international community neighbors have crucial role german officials said steinmeier hoped to persuade neighboring arab states to play a more active role in diplomatic efforts to end the israeli-palestinian conflict .
acknowledging the crucial role of the neighbors in any peace process , foreign ministry spokesman andreas peschke said that germany saw several rays of hope in the region , including last month 's peaceful elections in lebanon and improved relations between lebanon and syria .
he added that all these factors presented a " window of opportunity . "
in light of these developments , steinmeier will also travel to damascus for talks with his syrian counterpart wali al-muallem and president bashar al-assad .
in the past , steinmeier , who is set to challenge chancellor angela merkel in september 's general election , faced criticism from the chancellery and the us administration for his efforts to engage syria .
however , the obama administration has dramatically softened washington 's stance towards damascus .
and this week , the us announced that it would send an ambassador back to damascus after a four-year gap .
the move comes amid a region-wide campaign to lay the groundwork for middle east peace .
in response , president assad invited obama to visit syria .
when he travels to the lebanese capital beirut , steinmeier will become the first western politician to meet prime minister-designate saad hariri , the son of former premier rafik hariri , who was killed in a bomb blast in 2005 .
hariri 's pro-western alliance won last month 's general elections .
some observers say germany is aware that it does not have the influence to broker middle east peace on its own , but that steinmeier clearly wants to be part of the obama administration 's efforts in that direction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 05.07.2009 financial crisis hits african trade , aid as wto gears up for summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trade is an important way of helping africa the world trade organization is preparing to review its aid for trade initiative at an international conference in geneva .
the trade situation of developing countries in the economic crisis will be top of the agenda . give developing countries the tools to improve their position as trade partners and both their own development and the international trade situation will also improve .
that 's the idea behind " aid for trade , " which the wto launched in hong kong four years ago , wto director general pascal lamy tells deutsche welle .
" developing countries very often face trade barriers , which either stem from their own infrastructure - for example roadways , transport or energy - or they face technical trade barriers , for example if someone wants to export flowers to the us or to europe he will have to meet the maximum pesticide residue standard , " he says .
africa , more so than any other continent , faces these kinds of problems as it tries to increase its trade capacity .
and to make matter worse , lamy says , africa has seen a decrease in participation in international trade over the last 10 years .
" in absolute value african trade has grown , but in relative value , as compared to the whole world trade , it has decreased , " he explains .
" the fundamental point for africa is , one , trying to diversify exports to meet international demand , and , two , making sure that inter-african trade grows .
at the moment the trade between african countries is incredibly low . "
lamy underlines that international trade accounts for around 15 percent of economic activity in europe and the us , but three to four times as much in africa .
" hence the enormous importance of keeping trade open during the crisis , which means fighting protectionism , because that would hit developing countries most .
and then , keeping investment in the future so they can trade their way out of the crisis . "
downward spiral bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more trade with the eu and within africa will make a difference the ongoing international economic crisis has hit africa in particular , dr. mohammed ibn chambas tells deutsche welle .
chambas is executive secretary of ecowas , the economic community of west african states .
he explains the downward spiral : the shrinking global economy leads to lower demand for commodities from west africa and africa as a whole .
lower demand also means lower prices .
but there is more : " the strong global growth led to 5 percent growth in africa in the year preceding the crisis , " he says .
" the slowdown has of course led to a reduced african growth rate .
we will end 2009 at less than 3 percent .
that is not good because it 's very close to the population growth rate .
" secondly the transfer of funds from african diasporas is also invested in many activities for expanding trade , export trade in particular .
and all of this has obviously now been reduced . "
chambas says he is also worried that donor countries may reduce their support for the aid for trade program because of the crisis .
" of course aid for trade funding is dependant on support of the economies of the developed countries .
and now that these economies are under stress and in recession , naturally there is likely to be a shuffle in the promised resources .
these are legitimate concerns that we have on the african side , that not all the pledges that have been made will be provided . "
european responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without trade , illegal immigration will continue chambas says europe has a special duty to increase its aid to africa .
" the bulk of african trade is with europe .
we believe that the partnership between europe and africa should translate into concrete support for africa to reduce the impact of the global crisis , " he says .
" it 's a historic relationship that we can not wish away and i believe that in the context of this new partnership we should see how we can work together , europe and africa , to overcome the current economic slowdown . "
john clancy , spokesman for european commissioner for development and humanitarian aid louis michel , says europe 's history with africa is unique , and that the focus should be on measures to improve that relationship .
" i think what is important is not to look backward to the past , but to the present day and the future .
aid for trade is about partnership .
it is a complimentary aspect to assisting developing countries , those in africa in particular .
it should soften , to some extent , the changes that have to take place at a socio-economic level in these countries , so that they can profit from the global marketplace more than before . "

the trade situation of developing countries in the economic crisis will be top of the agenda . give developing countries the tools to improve their position as trade partners and both their own development and the international trade situation will also improve .
that 's the idea behind " aid for trade , " which the wto launched in hong kong four years ago , wto director general pascal lamy tells deutsche welle .
" developing countries very often face trade barriers , which either stem from their own infrastructure - for example roadways , transport or energy - or they face technical trade barriers , for example if someone wants to export flowers to the us or to europe he will have to meet the maximum pesticide residue standard , " he says .
africa , more so than any other continent , faces these kinds of problems as it tries to increase its trade capacity .
and to make matter worse , lamy says , africa has seen a decrease in participation in international trade over the last 10 years .
" in absolute value african trade has grown , but in relative value , as compared to the whole world trade , it has decreased , " he explains .
" the fundamental point for africa is , one , trying to diversify exports to meet international demand , and , two , making sure that inter-african trade grows .
at the moment the trade between african countries is incredibly low . "
lamy underlines that international trade accounts for around 15 percent of economic activity in europe and the us , but three to four times as much in africa .
" hence the enormous importance of keeping trade open during the crisis , which means fighting protectionism , because that would hit developing countries most .
and then , keeping investment in the future so they can trade their way out of the crisis . "
downward spiral bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more trade with the eu and within africa will make a difference the ongoing international economic crisis has hit africa in particular , dr. mohammed ibn chambas tells deutsche welle .
chambas is executive secretary of ecowas , the economic community of west african states .
he explains the downward spiral : the shrinking global economy leads to lower demand for commodities from west africa and africa as a whole .
lower demand also means lower prices .
but there is more : " the strong global growth led to 5 percent growth in africa in the year preceding the crisis , " he says .
" the slowdown has of course led to a reduced african growth rate .
we will end 2009 at less than 3 percent .
that is not good because it 's very close to the population growth rate .
" secondly the transfer of funds from african diasporas is also invested in many activities for expanding trade , export trade in particular .
and all of this has obviously now been reduced . "
chambas says he is also worried that donor countries may reduce their support for the aid for trade program because of the crisis .
" of course aid for trade funding is dependant on support of the economies of the developed countries .
and now that these economies are under stress and in recession , naturally there is likely to be a shuffle in the promised resources .
these are legitimate concerns that we have on the african side , that not all the pledges that have been made will be provided . "
european responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without trade , illegal immigration will continue chambas says europe has a special duty to increase its aid to africa .
" the bulk of african trade is with europe .
we believe that the partnership between europe and africa should translate into concrete support for africa to reduce the impact of the global crisis , " he says .
" it 's a historic relationship that we can not wish away and i believe that in the context of this new partnership we should see how we can work together , europe and africa , to overcome the current economic slowdown . "
john clancy , spokesman for european commissioner for development and humanitarian aid louis michel , says europe 's history with africa is unique , and that the focus should be on measures to improve that relationship .
" i think what is important is not to look backward to the past , but to the present day and the future .
aid for trade is about partnership .
it is a complimentary aspect to assisting developing countries , those in africa in particular .
it should soften , to some extent , the changes that have to take place at a socio-economic level in these countries , so that they can profit from the global marketplace more than before . "

"
ecclestone also criticised ousting saddam hussein and the taliban . the comment , made to the times newspaper in an interview published on friday , has led to a furore among jewish groups and politicians .
ecclestone , 78 , praised the virtues of strong leadership and condemned contemporary politicians for their weakness .
the times quoted ecclestone as saying that democracy " has n't done a lot of good for many countries , including this one . "
" in a lot of ways , terrible to say this i suppose , " ecclestone said , " but apart from the fact that hitler got taken away and persuaded to do things that i have no idea whether he wanted to do or not , he was in the way that he could command a lot of people , able to get things done . "
ecclestone told the paper that politicians were too worried about elections and that he would support the concept of a government based on tyranny .
" we did a terrible thing when we supported the idea of getting rid of saddam hussein , " ecclestone went on to say , " he was the only one who could control that country . "
" it was the same -lrb- with the taliban -rrb- .
we move into countries and we have no idea of the culture . "
max mosley for prime minister ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max mosley- prime ministerial material ?
he went on to include british prime minister margaret thatcher , and max mosley , outgoing head of formula one 's governing body , as leadership examples - even suggesting max mosley should be britain 's prime minister .
eccleston went on to say " the americans probably thought bosnia was a town in miami .
there are people starving in africa and we sit back and do nothing but we get involved in things we should leave alone . "

financial institutes remain reluctant to lend despite having received billions in finanical aid . german finance minister peer steinbrueck has warned banking managers over their reluctance to lend .
in sunday 's edition of the tabloid bild he says he was doubtful that a bill passed on friday in berlin to allow german banks to park their toxic assets in a so-called bad bank structure will be enough to get the banks back into the business of providing credit . instead , he 's threatening banks with unnamed sanctions should a credit crunch be the result of their too conservative lending policies .
his warning is that the government and the central bank will have to take steps to force the bankers ' hand .
these as yet unspecified actions , steinbrueck warns , would include measures never before used against financial institutions in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck warned banking managers over their reluctance to lend late last year , banks all over the world demanded billions in financial aid from their governments .
otherwise , they said , they would be forced into bankruptcy with unforeseeable consequences for the world economy . governments from washington , to london , to tokyo to berlin complied , despite the enormously high political risk involved .
there was political consensus that the banks were simply too big to be allowed to fail . despite state aid , banks are reluctant to lend today , german banks are doing far better , but stand accused of still being reluctant to lend to businesses and companies which increasingly feel the pinch of the global recession . for months , small and medium sized companies in germany have been finding it more and more difficult - if not impossible - to keep credit lines with their banks open . " at the moment there is no credit crunch , " said martin wansleben , managing director of the german chamber of industry and commerce . " but more and more companies are having difficulty getting needed loans .
it 's more complicated .
it 's more expensive .
and many are simply being rejected outright . " but , could the german government actually force banks to lend money ?
finance minister peer steinbrueck refused to fuel speculation on that .
however , other politicians are less subtle in their warnings to the banks . condemnation from across party lines " we helped the banks with massive funding and political support , " saarland state premier peter mueller said on saturday . " now , it 's up to the banks to provide that help to companies . " the banks are accused of taking the government 's money but using it only to improve their own financial situation , not the country 's economy . " we must now ensure that banks are obliged to offer credit on a more liberal basis , " urged fritz kuhn , parliamentary leader of the greens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's president accused the banks of causing the crisis politicians of all parties are united in their determination to force german banks to make credit available over fears of unemployment rising even further due to a lack of credit for businesses . german president horst koehler - himself a former head of the world bank - added his voice to the critics in a television interview .

at sunday 's historic wimbledon , roger federer broke the grand slam record .
but the personal stakes at the 1937 germany-us davis cup duel were higher for german baron gottfried von cramm : he was playing for his life . " a terrible splendor : three extraordinary men , a world poised for war and the greatest tennis match ever played " tells the story of tennis champion gottfried von cramm , who had been secretly gay in hitler 's germany and his opponent don budge , who was the top ranked us player .
it is also the story of von cramm 's gay american coach bill tilden , who was training the nazi german team against his own country in a decisive davis cup match in 1937 .
deutsche welle spoke to marshall jon fisher , the author of the newly released book . deutsche welle : why was gottfried von cramm so popular with the crowds ?
and why was he so important to the nazi leadership ?
marshall jon fisher : von cramm was a remarkable character .
he was gracious , famous for his sportsmanship and from a noble background , but did n't act that way at all .
he was tall , very handsome , very germanic-looking - blond , blue-eyed - the nazis were holding him up as the perfect model of the aryan athlete .
the nazi officials were of course very interested in using sports figures as propaganda tools , such as -lrb- boxing legend -rrb- max schmeling .
-lrb- nazi propaganda minister joseph -rrb- goebbels made a big deal out of the 1936 berlin olympics and declared it a triumph for germany , so the davis cup could have served similar purposes for him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's nadal ended federer 's wimbledon winning streak last year there have been a few other " greatest matches ever " on centre court at wimbledon - the epic bjorn borg - john mcenroe duel in 1980 and the stunning marathon between roger federer and rafael nadal last year .
what makes budge vs. von cramm , the " greatest match ever " ?
borg-mcenroe and federer-nadal were incredible tennis matches , but what was at stake really , except which multi-millionaire would get to hold up the trophy afterwards ?
it was just tennis .
but in the von cramm-budge case , it was about winning the davis cup , which meant playing for their nation 's glory .
there were also the personal stakes for von cramm - he was playing for his life at a time when the winds of war were building up .
he was also playing for a regime which he loathed .
it turned out that gottfried von cramm was a gay man playing for a government that was executing people like him .
he had of course been followed by the gestapo .
they had a big file on him .
his lover was jewish .
his wife - he had married a childhood friend - was one-quarter jewish .
the gestapo had made it clear to him that as long as he kept winning and that germany had a chance to win the davis cup with him , he would be safe .
but if things did n't go too well with him on the tennis court , that might not be the case .
there was quite an amazing amount of pressure on him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von cramm was secretly gay , but married barbara hutton .
how did the match go ?
this 1937 davis cup match was supposed to be a walk away for don budge , who had destroyed von cramm two weeks earlier at the wimbledon final in three straight sets , so everyone thought budge was going to win this match easily and the americans would win the davis cup , but von cramm just played stupendous tennis .
von cramm won the first two sets .
budge came back and won the second two sets .
in the decisive fifth set , von cramm was up 4 to 1 .
at this point everyone thought von cramm was going to win , but budge comes back again and it goes past 6-6 .
i 'd rather not give away the ending , but it turned into a remarkable fifth set .
so what happened to von cramm after the match ?
it was inevitable that no matter what happened in the match , von cramm was going to run into trouble in germany .
when he travelled around the world , he became more and more outspoken against the nazis and upon returning home from his travels in 1938 , he was arrested and sentenced to prison for homosexual acts .
now he got off a bit easy due to some good connections he had .
most homosexuals were going to the camps , but he simply went to prison in berlin for less than a year .
was it generally known that von cramm was homosexual ?
other players did know , but it was not publicly known even after the war when von cramm played the davis cup for west germany .
with -lrb- von cramm 's american coach -rrb- bill tilden , people knew .
he was not quite as dignified as von cramm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us champ bill tilden coached germany 's davis cup team regarding bill tilden - it 's very common nowadays for the coach of a national team to be foreign .
we see that a lot in international soccer .
but on the eve of world war ii , what tilden did , appears treacherous .
it was extraordinary , but not because tilden was a foreigner .
" big bill " tilden completely dominated the tennis world throughout the 1920s and kept the davis cup in the united states almost single-handedly .
he was also a gay man when one could n't talk about such things .
it was amazing the nazis hired not only an american , but a gay american to coach their davis cup team .
how did tilden , an american tennis idol , wind up coaching the nazi german team , of all teams ?
tilden had wanted to coach the americans for years , even offering to do it for free , but they turned him down every year , presumably because they were afraid of some scandal due to his homosexuality .
so when the germans finally gave him an offer , he was happy to take it . tennis today is an individual sport , you play for yourself rather than for your country and it 's the grand slam tournaments - the us , french , australian open and wimbledon of course - that are important .
could you explain the significance of the davis cup back then ?
well of course , we still have the davis cup , but it was much more significant back then .
all the big international tournaments then were also only open to amateurs .
tennis was much bigger in the sports world back then and the davis cup was even bigger than wimbledon .
the pro era in tennis began in 1968 .
gottfried von cramm survived the war , married woolworth heiress barbara hutton in the 1950s and became a successful cotton importer .
he died in a car accident on a business trip in egypt in 1976 .
bill tilden tried to pursue an acting career in hollywood , but served prison time for homosexual acts after the war .
because of his convictions , he was shunned from playing and teaching tennis .
he died of a stroke in 1953 .

this 1937 davis cup match was supposed to be a walk away for don budge , who had destroyed von cramm two weeks earlier at the wimbledon final in three straight sets , so everyone thought budge was going to win this match easily and the americans would win the davis cup , but von cramm just played stupendous tennis .
von cramm won the first two sets .
budge came back and won the second two sets .
in the decisive fifth set , von cramm was up 4 to 1 .
at this point everyone thought von cramm was going to win , but budge comes back again and it goes past 6-6 .
i 'd rather not give away the ending , but it turned into a remarkable fifth set .
so what happened to von cramm after the match ?
it was inevitable that no matter what happened in the match , von cramm was going to run into trouble in germany .
when he travelled around the world , he became more and more outspoken against the nazis and upon returning home from his travels in 1938 , he was arrested and sentenced to prison for homosexual acts .
now he got off a bit easy due to some good connections he had .
most homosexuals were going to the camps , but he simply went to prison in berlin for less than a year .
was it generally known that von cramm was homosexual ?
other players did know , but it was not publicly known even after the war when von cramm played the davis cup for west germany .
with -lrb- von cramm 's american coach -rrb- bill tilden , people knew .
he was not quite as dignified as von cramm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us champ bill tilden coached germany 's davis cup team regarding bill tilden - it 's very common nowadays for the coach of a national team to be foreign .
we see that a lot in international soccer .
but on the eve of world war ii , what tilden did , appears treacherous .
it was extraordinary , but not because tilden was a foreigner .
" big bill " tilden completely dominated the tennis world throughout the 1920s and kept the davis cup in the united states almost single-handedly .
he was also a gay man when one could n't talk about such things .
it was amazing the nazis hired not only an american , but a gay american to coach their davis cup team .
how did tilden , an american tennis idol , wind up coaching the nazi german team , of all teams ?
tilden had wanted to coach the americans for years , even offering to do it for free , but they turned him down every year , presumably because they were afraid of some scandal due to his homosexuality .
so when the germans finally gave him an offer , he was happy to take it . tennis today is an individual sport , you play for yourself rather than for your country and it 's the grand slam tournaments - the us , french , australian open and wimbledon of course - that are important .
could you explain the significance of the davis cup back then ?
well of course , we still have the davis cup , but it was much more significant back then .
all the big international tournaments then were also only open to amateurs .
tennis was much bigger in the sports world back then and the davis cup was even bigger than wimbledon .
the pro era in tennis began in 1968 .
gottfried von cramm survived the war , married woolworth heiress barbara hutton in the 1950s and became a successful cotton importer .
he died in a car accident on a business trip in egypt in 1976 .
bill tilden tried to pursue an acting career in hollywood , but served prison time for homosexual acts after the war .
because of his convictions , he was shunned from playing and teaching tennis .
he died of a stroke in 1953 .

at sunday 's historic wimbledon , roger federer broke the grand slam record .
but the personal stakes at the 1937 germany-us davis cup duel were higher for german baron gottfried von cramm : he was playing for his life . " a terrible splendor : three extraordinary men , a world poised for war and the greatest tennis match ever played " tells the story of tennis champion gottfried von cramm , who had been secretly gay in hitler 's germany and his opponent don budge , who was the top ranked us player .
it is also the story of von cramm 's gay american coach bill tilden , who was training the nazi german team against his own country in a decisive davis cup match in 1937 .
deutsche welle spoke to marshall jon fisher , the author of the newly released book . deutsche welle : why was gottfried von cramm so popular with the crowds ?
and why was he so important to the nazi leadership ?
marshall jon fisher : von cramm was a remarkable character .
he was gracious , famous for his sportsmanship and from a noble background , but did n't act that way at all .
he was tall , very handsome , very germanic-looking - blond , blue-eyed - the nazis were holding him up as the perfect model of the aryan athlete .
the nazi officials were of course very interested in using sports figures as propaganda tools , such as -lrb- boxing legend -rrb- max schmeling .
-lrb- nazi propaganda minister joseph -rrb- goebbels made a big deal out of the 1936 berlin olympics and declared it a triumph for germany , so the davis cup could have served similar purposes for him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's nadal ended federer 's wimbledon winning streak last year there have been a few other " greatest matches ever " on centre court at wimbledon - the epic bjorn borg - john mcenroe duel in 1980 and the stunning marathon between roger federer and rafael nadal last year .
what makes budge vs. von cramm , the " greatest match ever " ?
borg-mcenroe and federer-nadal were incredible tennis matches , but what was at stake really , except which multi-millionaire would get to hold up the trophy afterwards ?
it was just tennis .
but in the von cramm-budge case , it was about winning the davis cup , which meant playing for their nation 's glory .
there were also the personal stakes for von cramm - he was playing for his life at a time when the winds of war were building up .
he was also playing for a regime which he loathed .
it turned out that gottfried von cramm was a gay man playing for a government that was executing people like him .
he had of course been followed by the gestapo .
they had a big file on him .
his lover was jewish .
his wife - he had married a childhood friend - was one-quarter jewish .
the gestapo had made it clear to him that as long as he kept winning and that germany had a chance to win the davis cup with him , he would be safe .
but if things did n't go too well with him on the tennis court , that might not be the case .
there was quite an amazing amount of pressure on him .

the ruling socialist party is predicted to do badly , with corruption allegations largely to blame . the parliamentary election campaign in bulgaria has been a fierce one .
the ruling socialist party has attacked the opposition center-right gerb in particularly vicious television advertisements .
a few weeks before the election , the government also changed voting rights in its favour .
this could be a last-ditch attempt to stay in power , with opinion polls predicting a change . bulgaria is currently governed by a coalition made up of prime minister sergei stanishev 's socialist party and two junior partners : the movement for rights and freedom , a party representing bulgaria 's turkish minority ; and the national movement formed by the former tsar of bulgaria .
many bulgarians blame the coalition for the country 's widespread corruption , the misappropriation of millions in aid money from the european union , and the ire of brussels .
these are the factors that will likely see voters turn away from the governing parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarians are some of the poorest people in the eu " the new government will probably try to send a few high-profile people to prison as a result of corruption allegations , " says georgi ganev , an economist at sofia 's centre for liberal strategies .
" that 's why the election campaign has been fought so hard . " 50 euros for a vote but corruption in bulgaria may have even entered the ballot booth .
during the recent european parliamentary elections , there were allegations that voters were bought on a large scale .
watchdogs are concerned that this type of manipulation may continue in the national election .
tihomir beslov from bulgaria 's centre for democratic research says votes can be bought for between 50 and 150 euros .
he says that kind of money can support a family in one of bulgaria 's poorer regions for two or three months .
" an entire company 's employees could also be pressured by their bosses to vote for a particular party , " beslov says .
" for example , muslims would be forced to swear before allah that they would vote for the party representing the turkish minority . "
" bulgarians want justice " the party likely to win the most votes in sunday 's election is the center-right gerb , led by sofia mayor boyko borisov .
the party has promised to fight corruption , and gerb member maria nedelcheva recently told the european parliament that bulgarians wanted justice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boyko borisov only founded gerb a few years ago " they expect criminal convictions and they want criminal proceedings to finally be launched against those responsible , " nedelcheva said .
" we are determined to do that . "
but even gerb is not expected to win an outright majority .
experts believe that disillusioned bulgarians may not turn up to polling booths at all .
a recent opinion poll showed gerb grabbing just over 30 percent of the vote , while the ruling socialists are predicted to take just over 20 percent .
with no one party likely to win a majority , another coalition for bulgaria looks likely - talks that could drag on for months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 05.07.2009 bulgarians head to polls amid vote-buying allegations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allegations of vote-buying may overshadow bulgarian elections bulgarians are heading to the polls on sunday for the country 's first parliamentary election since joining the eu .
the ruling socialist party is predicted to do badly , with corruption allegations largely to blame . the parliamentary election campaign in bulgaria has been a fierce one .
the ruling socialist party has attacked the opposition center-right gerb in particularly vicious television advertisements .
a few weeks before the election , the government also changed voting rights in its favour .
this could be a last-ditch attempt to stay in power , with opinion polls predicting a change . bulgaria is currently governed by a coalition made up of prime minister sergei stanishev 's socialist party and two junior partners : the movement for rights and freedom , a party representing bulgaria 's turkish minority ; and the national movement formed by the former tsar of bulgaria .
many bulgarians blame the coalition for the country 's widespread corruption , the misappropriation of millions in aid money from the european union , and the ire of brussels .
these are the factors that will likely see voters turn away from the governing parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarians are some of the poorest people in the eu " the new government will probably try to send a few high-profile people to prison as a result of corruption allegations , " says georgi ganev , an economist at sofia 's centre for liberal strategies .
" that 's why the election campaign has been fought so hard . " 50 euros for a vote but corruption in bulgaria may have even entered the ballot booth .
during the recent european parliamentary elections , there were allegations that voters were bought on a large scale .
watchdogs are concerned that this type of manipulation may continue in the national election .
tihomir beslov from bulgaria 's centre for democratic research says votes can be bought for between 50 and 150 euros .
he says that kind of money can support a family in one of bulgaria 's poorer regions for two or three months .
" an entire company 's employees could also be pressured by their bosses to vote for a particular party , " beslov says .
" for example , muslims would be forced to swear before allah that they would vote for the party representing the turkish minority . "
" bulgarians want justice " the party likely to win the most votes in sunday 's election is the center-right gerb , led by sofia mayor boyko borisov .
the party has promised to fight corruption , and gerb member maria nedelcheva recently told the european parliament that bulgarians wanted justice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boyko borisov only founded gerb a few years ago " they expect criminal convictions and they want criminal proceedings to finally be launched against those responsible , " nedelcheva said .
" we are determined to do that . "
but even gerb is not expected to win an outright majority .
experts believe that disillusioned bulgarians may not turn up to polling booths at all .
a recent opinion poll showed gerb grabbing just over 30 percent of the vote , while the ruling socialists are predicted to take just over 20 percent .
with no one party likely to win a majority , another coalition for bulgaria looks likely - talks that could drag on for months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.07.2009 normality comes in small doses in bosnia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instead of scenes of war , sarajevo today is characterized by a fragile peace more than 13 years after the dayton accord was signed , ending the bosnia 's inter-ethnic conflict in 1995 , the balkan country remains a very divided place . while peace and security have long since been established , few of those displaced during the three-year war have returned to homes in areas where their ethnic group is not in the majority .
despite this , there is a growing feeling among some people that it is time for the international community to step back , and hand over more responsibility for bosnia 's future to that country 's politicians .
the dayton accord that ended the bloodshed in bosnia-hercegovina in late 1995 is one of the few things that most bosnians can agree on .
they 'll tell you that it was successful in ending the war , but that it has been deficient when it comes to plotting a long-term path for the country 's future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it provided for the creation of a very weak central government , with the two entities , the bosniak / croat federation and the republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , wielding much of the legislative power .
this has led to divisions that had their roots in the 1992-95 war becoming formally ingrained during more than a decade of peace .
perhaps one of the most significant issues for the future of the country is the fact that children receive instruction in separate bosniak , serb or croat school systems .
seventy percent of the curriculum is set out by the state , with the remaining 30 percent left at the discretion of the schools .
croat high school student ante zelic explains that typically , these 30 percent are used for subjects like history or language instruction .
the students learn history , for example , from a croat point of view , or read two or three more novels by croatian authors than one would in other schools , says zelic .
while outsiders may think that this sort of division is the last thing that bosnian students need if the country is to grow more united in future , zelic does n't seem to see this as much of a problem .
his bosniak counterpart , adnan pripoljac , says the fact that students are divided in school is n't the point . “ i have my lessons in the morning and my croat colleagues go to classes in the afternoon .
but after school or in the evening we hang out together as usual .
most young people in bosnia do n't want to be separated , it 's just a political issue that has to be resolved . ”
practical problems while some politicians admit that the school situation is n't ideal , nobody seems to have a plan for integrating the educational systems .
a third student , dzeznan karic says there are practical considerations discouraging politicians from taking steps to change the status quo .
“ you have to realize that in every school there are , for example , two professors of geography , two professors of history , language , mathematics , physics , etc .
if they were to unite the school , this would leave one professor out of a job , and this is in nobody 's interest .
everyone is protecting their national interests .
why should a croat professor lose his job when there is also a bosniak professor who could lose his job ?
so it is a very political matter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valentin inzko hopes to be bosnia 's last high representative not even the international community 's special representative in bosnia has the answer .
the high representative still holds absolute power in this country , to be used to do whatever it takes to ensure that the provisions of the dayton accord are complied with .
this includes the power to revoke legislation or even remove politicians from office .
valentin inzko , the seventh person to hold this post , hopes he will be bosnia 's last high representative .
he recently told reporters in sarajevo that he hoped a decision would be taken in october , which would see the office of the high representative close at the end of this year .
“ i am moderately optimistic and i am doing everything in my power to ensure that this happens .
but the bosnians themselves also have to do something to improve the political climate , because -lrb- one -rrb- condition is a positive political climate and the implementation of dayton . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milorad dodik would like to seek the ohr close sooner rather than later it would be a stretch to describe the current political climate as positive .
recently , the high representative has been at loggerheads with the prime minister of the republika srpska , milorad dodik .
last month , the rs assembly passed a resolution demanding , among other things , that inzko transfer a package of powers to it from the central bosnian government .
after weeks of consultations , the high representative revoked the resolution , arguing that it violated the dayton agreement . pressure to leave it 's not surprising then , that the serbs want to see the office of the high representative shut down , sooner rather than later .
speaking to reporters in the republika srpska capital , banja luka , before the resolution was revoked , prime minister dodik said he was n't convinced that the office of the high representative was working in the best interests of the republika srbska .
“ by and large the office of the high representative -lrb- ohr -rrb- has employed a few international representatives , but most were local staff , mainly from the federation side , from sarajevo .
these people have created ill-feelings towards the republika srpska . ”
as with so many issues in bosnia , republika srpska and federation politicians are divided on this issue .
federation leaders say the country does n't have strong enough central institutions to close down the ohr .
haris silajdzic , the bosniak member of the bosnian presidency told reporters that he would do what he could to ensure that the ohr remains beyond the end of this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haris silajdzic says it is too early for the ohr to close up shop but he also conceded that there seemed to be an international political consensus that now was the time to pull the plug on the ohr , leaving only a non-executive european union special representative in its place .
despite dayton 's and bosnia 's flaws , the fact that the country has been at peace for more than 13 years is a considerable achievement in itself .
unemployment is high , but the cafes in both sarajevo and banja luka are full .
as one opposition politician in republika srpska put it : “ we do n't like each other very much , but at least we are not killing each other on the basis of our ethnic groups anymore .
we do n't have the most beautiful democracy in the world , but it 's not that bad . ” author : chuck penfold editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" but more and more companies are having difficulty getting needed loans .
it 's more complicated .
it 's more expensive .
and many are simply being rejected outright . " but , could the german government actually force banks to lend money ?
finance minister peer steinbrueck refused to fuel speculation on that .
however , other politicians are less subtle in their warnings to the banks . condemnation from across party lines " we helped the banks with massive funding and political support , " saarland state premier peter mueller said on saturday . " now , it 's up to the banks to provide that help to companies . " the banks are accused of taking the government 's money but using it only to improve their own financial situation , not the country 's economy . " we must now ensure that banks are obliged to offer credit on a more liberal basis , " urged fritz kuhn , parliamentary leader of the greens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's president accused the banks of causing the crisis politicians of all parties are united in their determination to force german banks to make credit available over fears of unemployment rising even further due to a lack of credit for businesses . german president horst koehler - himself a former head of the world bank - added his voice to the critics in a television interview . " i appeal to the banks to do more to ensure that the economy can grow , " he said . koehler 's criticism of the banks was the most pointed of all .
he accused them of first causing the worldwide economic crisis and now hesitating to help find a solution for it . rd / afp / dpa editor : carl holm send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
ecclestone also criticised ousting saddam hussein and the taliban . the comment , made to the times newspaper in an interview published on friday , has led to a furore among jewish groups and politicians .
ecclestone , 78 , praised the virtues of strong leadership and condemned contemporary politicians for their weakness .
the times quoted ecclestone as saying that democracy " has n't done a lot of good for many countries , including this one . "
" in a lot of ways , terrible to say this i suppose , " ecclestone said , " but apart from the fact that hitler got taken away and persuaded to do things that i have no idea whether he wanted to do or not , he was in the way that he could command a lot of people , able to get things done . "
ecclestone told the paper that politicians were too worried about elections and that he would support the concept of a government based on tyranny .
" we did a terrible thing when we supported the idea of getting rid of saddam hussein , " ecclestone went on to say , " he was the only one who could control that country . "
" it was the same -lrb- with the taliban -rrb- .
we move into countries and we have no idea of the culture . "
max mosley for prime minister ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max mosley- prime ministerial material ?
he went on to include british prime minister margaret thatcher , and max mosley , outgoing head of formula one 's governing body , as leadership examples - even suggesting max mosley should be britain 's prime minister .
eccleston went on to say " the americans probably thought bosnia was a town in miami .
there are people starving in africa and we sit back and do nothing but we get involved in things we should leave alone . "
jewish groups have crticized the comments , with a spokesman for the board of deputies of british jews calling them " quite bizarre . "
meanwhile , stephen pollard , editor of the jewish chronicle , said ecclestone was either " an idiot or morally repulsive . "
" either he has no idea how stupid and offensive his views are , or he does - and deserves to be held in contempt by all decent people , " he said .
ecclestone 's remarks are certain to revive memories of the controversy around reports of a bizarre sex scandal involving fia president max mosley .
the head of motorsport 's ruling body fia and son of the british fascist leader sir oswald mosley last year sued the news of the world for breach of privacy after the newspaper alleged he had taken part in a seemingly concentration camp-themed scene involving five prostitutes. ch / dpa / ape editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.07.2009 normality comes in small doses in bosnia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instead of scenes of war , sarajevo today is characterized by a fragile peace more than 13 years after the dayton accord was signed , ending the bosnia 's inter-ethnic conflict in 1995 , the balkan country remains a very divided place . while peace and security have long since been established , few of those displaced during the three-year war have returned to homes in areas where their ethnic group is not in the majority .
despite this , there is a growing feeling among some people that it is time for the international community to step back , and hand over more responsibility for bosnia 's future to that country 's politicians .
the dayton accord that ended the bloodshed in bosnia-hercegovina in late 1995 is one of the few things that most bosnians can agree on .
they 'll tell you that it was successful in ending the war , but that it has been deficient when it comes to plotting a long-term path for the country 's future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it provided for the creation of a very weak central government , with the two entities , the bosniak / croat federation and the republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , wielding much of the legislative power .
this has led to divisions that had their roots in the 1992-95 war becoming formally ingrained during more than a decade of peace .
perhaps one of the most significant issues for the future of the country is the fact that children receive instruction in separate bosniak , serb or croat school systems .
seventy percent of the curriculum is set out by the state , with the remaining 30 percent left at the discretion of the schools .
croat high school student ante zelic explains that typically , these 30 percent are used for subjects like history or language instruction .
the students learn history , for example , from a croat point of view , or read two or three more novels by croatian authors than one would in other schools , says zelic .
while outsiders may think that this sort of division is the last thing that bosnian students need if the country is to grow more united in future , zelic does n't seem to see this as much of a problem .
his bosniak counterpart , adnan pripoljac , says the fact that students are divided in school is n't the point . “ i have my lessons in the morning and my croat colleagues go to classes in the afternoon .
but after school or in the evening we hang out together as usual .
most young people in bosnia do n't want to be separated , it 's just a political issue that has to be resolved . ”
practical problems while some politicians admit that the school situation is n't ideal , nobody seems to have a plan for integrating the educational systems .
a third student , dzeznan karic says there are practical considerations discouraging politicians from taking steps to change the status quo .
“ you have to realize that in every school there are , for example , two professors of geography , two professors of history , language , mathematics , physics , etc .
if they were to unite the school , this would leave one professor out of a job , and this is in nobody 's interest .
everyone is protecting their national interests .
why should a croat professor lose his job when there is also a bosniak professor who could lose his job ?
so it is a very political matter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valentin inzko hopes to be bosnia 's last high representative not even the international community 's special representative in bosnia has the answer .
the high representative still holds absolute power in this country , to be used to do whatever it takes to ensure that the provisions of the dayton accord are complied with .
this includes the power to revoke legislation or even remove politicians from office .
valentin inzko , the seventh person to hold this post , hopes he will be bosnia 's last high representative .
he recently told reporters in sarajevo that he hoped a decision would be taken in october , which would see the office of the high representative close at the end of this year .
“ i am moderately optimistic and i am doing everything in my power to ensure that this happens .
but the bosnians themselves also have to do something to improve the political climate , because -lrb- one -rrb- condition is a positive political climate and the implementation of dayton . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milorad dodik would like to seek the ohr close sooner rather than later it would be a stretch to describe the current political climate as positive .
recently , the high representative has been at loggerheads with the prime minister of the republika srpska , milorad dodik .
last month , the rs assembly passed a resolution demanding , among other things , that inzko transfer a package of powers to it from the central bosnian government .
after weeks of consultations , the high representative revoked the resolution , arguing that it violated the dayton agreement . pressure to leave it 's not surprising then , that the serbs want to see the office of the high representative shut down , sooner rather than later .
speaking to reporters in the republika srpska capital , banja luka , before the resolution was revoked , prime minister dodik said he was n't convinced that the office of the high representative was working in the best interests of the republika srbska .
“ by and large the office of the high representative -lrb- ohr -rrb- has employed a few international representatives , but most were local staff , mainly from the federation side , from sarajevo .
these people have created ill-feelings towards the republika srpska . ”
as with so many issues in bosnia , republika srpska and federation politicians are divided on this issue .
federation leaders say the country does n't have strong enough central institutions to close down the ohr .
haris silajdzic , the bosniak member of the bosnian presidency told reporters that he would do what he could to ensure that the ohr remains beyond the end of this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haris silajdzic says it is too early for the ohr to close up shop but he also conceded that there seemed to be an international political consensus that now was the time to pull the plug on the ohr , leaving only a non-executive european union special representative in its place .
despite dayton 's and bosnia 's flaws , the fact that the country has been at peace for more than 13 years is a considerable achievement in itself .
unemployment is high , but the cafes in both sarajevo and banja luka are full .
as one opposition politician in republika srpska put it : “ we do n't like each other very much , but at least we are not killing each other on the basis of our ethnic groups anymore .
we do n't have the most beautiful democracy in the world , but it 's not that bad . ” author : chuck penfold editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

speaking to reporters in the republika srpska capital , banja luka , before the resolution was revoked , prime minister dodik said he was n't convinced that the office of the high representative was working in the best interests of the republika srbska .
“ by and large the office of the high representative -lrb- ohr -rrb- has employed a few international representatives , but most were local staff , mainly from the federation side , from sarajevo .

as with so many issues in bosnia , republika srpska and federation politicians are divided on this issue .
federation leaders say the country does n't have strong enough central institutions to close down the ohr .
haris silajdzic , the bosniak member of the bosnian presidency told reporters that he would do what he could to ensure that the ohr remains beyond the end of this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.07.2009 normality comes in small doses in bosnia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instead of scenes of war , sarajevo today is characterized by a fragile peace more than 13 years after the dayton accord was signed , ending the bosnia 's inter-ethnic conflict in 1995 , the balkan country remains a very divided place . while peace and security have long since been established , few of those displaced during the three-year war have returned to homes in areas where their ethnic group is not in the majority .
despite this , there is a growing feeling among some people that it is time for the international community to step back , and hand over more responsibility for bosnia 's future to that country 's politicians .
the dayton accord that ended the bloodshed in bosnia-hercegovina in late 1995 is one of the few things that most bosnians can agree on .
they 'll tell you that it was successful in ending the war , but that it has been deficient when it comes to plotting a long-term path for the country 's future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it provided for the creation of a very weak central government , with the two entities , the bosniak / croat federation and the republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , wielding much of the legislative power .
this has led to divisions that had their roots in the 1992-95 war becoming formally ingrained during more than a decade of peace .
perhaps one of the most significant issues for the future of the country is the fact that children receive instruction in separate bosniak , serb or croat school systems .
seventy percent of the curriculum is set out by the state , with the remaining 30 percent left at the discretion of the schools .
croat high school student ante zelic explains that typically , these 30 percent are used for subjects like history or language instruction .
the students learn history , for example , from a croat point of view , or read two or three more novels by croatian authors than one would in other schools , says zelic .
while outsiders may think that this sort of division is the last thing that bosnian students need if the country is to grow more united in future , zelic does n't seem to see this as much of a problem .
his bosniak counterpart , adnan pripoljac , says the fact that students are divided in school is n't the point . “ i have my lessons in the morning and my croat colleagues go to classes in the afternoon .
but after school or in the evening we hang out together as usual .
most young people in bosnia do n't want to be separated , it 's just a political issue that has to be resolved . ”
practical problems while some politicians admit that the school situation is n't ideal , nobody seems to have a plan for integrating the educational systems .
a third student , dzeznan karic says there are practical considerations discouraging politicians from taking steps to change the status quo .
“ you have to realize that in every school there are , for example , two professors of geography , two professors of history , language , mathematics , physics , etc .
if they were to unite the school , this would leave one professor out of a job , and this is in nobody 's interest .
everyone is protecting their national interests .
why should a croat professor lose his job when there is also a bosniak professor who could lose his job ?
so it is a very political matter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valentin inzko hopes to be bosnia 's last high representative not even the international community 's special representative in bosnia has the answer .
the high representative still holds absolute power in this country , to be used to do whatever it takes to ensure that the provisions of the dayton accord are complied with .
this includes the power to revoke legislation or even remove politicians from office .
valentin inzko , the seventh person to hold this post , hopes he will be bosnia 's last high representative .
he recently told reporters in sarajevo that he hoped a decision would be taken in october , which would see the office of the high representative close at the end of this year .
“ i am moderately optimistic and i am doing everything in my power to ensure that this happens .
but the bosnians themselves also have to do something to improve the political climate , because -lrb- one -rrb- condition is a positive political climate and the implementation of dayton . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milorad dodik would like to seek the ohr close sooner rather than later it would be a stretch to describe the current political climate as positive .
recently , the high representative has been at loggerheads with the prime minister of the republika srpska , milorad dodik .
last month , the rs assembly passed a resolution demanding , among other things , that inzko transfer a package of powers to it from the central bosnian government .

at sunday 's historic wimbledon , roger federer broke the grand slam record .
but the personal stakes at the 1937 germany-us davis cup duel were higher for german baron gottfried von cramm : he was playing for his life . " a terrible splendor : three extraordinary men , a world poised for war and the greatest tennis match ever played " tells the story of tennis champion gottfried von cramm , who had been secretly gay in hitler 's germany and his opponent don budge , who was the top ranked us player .
it is also the story of von cramm 's gay american coach bill tilden , who was training the nazi german team against his own country in a decisive davis cup match in 1937 .
deutsche welle spoke to marshall jon fisher , the author of the newly released book . deutsche welle : why was gottfried von cramm so popular with the crowds ?
and why was he so important to the nazi leadership ?
marshall jon fisher : von cramm was a remarkable character .
he was gracious , famous for his sportsmanship and from a noble background , but did n't act that way at all .
he was tall , very handsome , very germanic-looking - blond , blue-eyed - the nazis were holding him up as the perfect model of the aryan athlete .
the nazi officials were of course very interested in using sports figures as propaganda tools , such as -lrb- boxing legend -rrb- max schmeling .
-lrb- nazi propaganda minister joseph -rrb- goebbels made a big deal out of the 1936 berlin olympics and declared it a triumph for germany , so the davis cup could have served similar purposes for him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's nadal ended federer 's wimbledon winning streak last year there have been a few other " greatest matches ever " on centre court at wimbledon - the epic bjorn borg - john mcenroe duel in 1980 and the stunning marathon between roger federer and rafael nadal last year .
what makes budge vs. von cramm , the " greatest match ever " ?
borg-mcenroe and federer-nadal were incredible tennis matches , but what was at stake really , except which multi-millionaire would get to hold up the trophy afterwards ?
it was just tennis .
but in the von cramm-budge case , it was about winning the davis cup , which meant playing for their nation 's glory .
there were also the personal stakes for von cramm - he was playing for his life at a time when the winds of war were building up .
he was also playing for a regime which he loathed .
it turned out that gottfried von cramm was a gay man playing for a government that was executing people like him .
he had of course been followed by the gestapo .
they had a big file on him .
his lover was jewish .
his wife - he had married a childhood friend - was one-quarter jewish .
the gestapo had made it clear to him that as long as he kept winning and that germany had a chance to win the davis cup with him , he would be safe .
but if things did n't go too well with him on the tennis court , that might not be the case .
there was quite an amazing amount of pressure on him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von cramm was secretly gay , but married barbara hutton .
how did the match go ?
this 1937 davis cup match was supposed to be a walk away for don budge , who had destroyed von cramm two weeks earlier at the wimbledon final in three straight sets , so everyone thought budge was going to win this match easily and the americans would win the davis cup , but von cramm just played stupendous tennis .
von cramm won the first two sets .
budge came back and won the second two sets .
in the decisive fifth set , von cramm was up 4 to 1 .
at this point everyone thought von cramm was going to win , but budge comes back again and it goes past 6-6 .
i 'd rather not give away the ending , but it turned into a remarkable fifth set .
so what happened to von cramm after the match ?
it was inevitable that no matter what happened in the match , von cramm was going to run into trouble in germany .
when he travelled around the world , he became more and more outspoken against the nazis and upon returning home from his travels in 1938 , he was arrested and sentenced to prison for homosexual acts .
now he got off a bit easy due to some good connections he had .
most homosexuals were going to the camps , but he simply went to prison in berlin for less than a year .
was it generally known that von cramm was homosexual ?
other players did know , but it was not publicly known even after the war when von cramm played the davis cup for west germany .
with -lrb- von cramm 's american coach -rrb- bill tilden , people knew .
he was not quite as dignified as von cramm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us champ bill tilden coached germany 's davis cup team regarding bill tilden - it 's very common nowadays for the coach of a national team to be foreign .
we see that a lot in international soccer .
but on the eve of world war ii , what tilden did , appears treacherous .
it was extraordinary , but not because tilden was a foreigner .
" big bill " tilden completely dominated the tennis world throughout the 1920s and kept the davis cup in the united states almost single-handedly .
he was also a gay man when one could n't talk about such things .
it was amazing the nazis hired not only an american , but a gay american to coach their davis cup team .
how did tilden , an american tennis idol , wind up coaching the nazi german team , of all teams ?
tilden had wanted to coach the americans for years , even offering to do it for free , but they turned him down every year , presumably because they were afraid of some scandal due to his homosexuality .
so when the germans finally gave him an offer , he was happy to take it . tennis today is an individual sport , you play for yourself rather than for your country and it 's the grand slam tournaments - the us , french , australian open and wimbledon of course - that are important .
could you explain the significance of the davis cup back then ?
well of course , we still have the davis cup , but it was much more significant back then .
all the big international tournaments then were also only open to amateurs .
tennis was much bigger in the sports world back then and the davis cup was even bigger than wimbledon .
the pro era in tennis began in 1968 .
gottfried von cramm survived the war , married woolworth heiress barbara hutton in the 1950s and became a successful cotton importer .
he died in a car accident on a business trip in egypt in 1976 .
bill tilden tried to pursue an acting career in hollywood , but served prison time for homosexual acts after the war .
because of his convictions , he was shunned from playing and teaching tennis .
he died of a stroke in 1953 .

his wife - he had married a childhood friend - was one-quarter jewish .
the gestapo had made it clear to him that as long as he kept winning and that germany had a chance to win the davis cup with him , he would be safe .
but if things did n't go too well with him on the tennis court , that might not be the case .
there was quite an amazing amount of pressure on him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von cramm was secretly gay , but married barbara hutton .
how did the match go ?
this 1937 davis cup match was supposed to be a walk away for don budge , who had destroyed von cramm two weeks earlier at the wimbledon final in three straight sets , so everyone thought budge was going to win this match easily and the americans would win the davis cup , but von cramm just played stupendous tennis .
von cramm won the first two sets .
budge came back and won the second two sets .
in the decisive fifth set , von cramm was up 4 to 1 .
at this point everyone thought von cramm was going to win , but budge comes back again and it goes past 6-6 .
i 'd rather not give away the ending , but it turned into a remarkable fifth set .
so what happened to von cramm after the match ?
it was inevitable that no matter what happened in the match , von cramm was going to run into trouble in germany .
when he travelled around the world , he became more and more outspoken against the nazis and upon returning home from his travels in 1938 , he was arrested and sentenced to prison for homosexual acts .
now he got off a bit easy due to some good connections he had .
most homosexuals were going to the camps , but he simply went to prison in berlin for less than a year .
was it generally known that von cramm was homosexual ?
other players did know , but it was not publicly known even after the war when von cramm played the davis cup for west germany .
with -lrb- von cramm 's american coach -rrb- bill tilden , people knew .
he was not quite as dignified as von cramm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us champ bill tilden coached germany 's davis cup team regarding bill tilden - it 's very common nowadays for the coach of a national team to be foreign .
we see that a lot in international soccer .
but on the eve of world war ii , what tilden did , appears treacherous .
it was extraordinary , but not because tilden was a foreigner .
" big bill " tilden completely dominated the tennis world throughout the 1920s and kept the davis cup in the united states almost single-handedly .
he was also a gay man when one could n't talk about such things .
it was amazing the nazis hired not only an american , but a gay american to coach their davis cup team .
how did tilden , an american tennis idol , wind up coaching the nazi german team , of all teams ?
tilden had wanted to coach the americans for years , even offering to do it for free , but they turned him down every year , presumably because they were afraid of some scandal due to his homosexuality .
so when the germans finally gave him an offer , he was happy to take it . tennis today is an individual sport , you play for yourself rather than for your country and it 's the grand slam tournaments - the us , french , australian open and wimbledon of course - that are important .
could you explain the significance of the davis cup back then ?
well of course , we still have the davis cup , but it was much more significant back then .
all the big international tournaments then were also only open to amateurs .
tennis was much bigger in the sports world back then and the davis cup was even bigger than wimbledon .
the pro era in tennis began in 1968 .
gottfried von cramm survived the war , married woolworth heiress barbara hutton in the 1950s and became a successful cotton importer .
he died in a car accident on a business trip in egypt in 1976 .
bill tilden tried to pursue an acting career in hollywood , but served prison time for homosexual acts after the war .
because of his convictions , he was shunned from playing and teaching tennis .
he died of a stroke in 1953 .

at sunday 's historic wimbledon , roger federer broke the grand slam record .
but the personal stakes at the 1937 germany-us davis cup duel were higher for german baron gottfried von cramm : he was playing for his life . " a terrible splendor : three extraordinary men , a world poised for war and the greatest tennis match ever played " tells the story of tennis champion gottfried von cramm , who had been secretly gay in hitler 's germany and his opponent don budge , who was the top ranked us player .
it is also the story of von cramm 's gay american coach bill tilden , who was training the nazi german team against his own country in a decisive davis cup match in 1937 .
deutsche welle spoke to marshall jon fisher , the author of the newly released book . deutsche welle : why was gottfried von cramm so popular with the crowds ?
and why was he so important to the nazi leadership ?
marshall jon fisher : von cramm was a remarkable character .
he was gracious , famous for his sportsmanship and from a noble background , but did n't act that way at all .
he was tall , very handsome , very germanic-looking - blond , blue-eyed - the nazis were holding him up as the perfect model of the aryan athlete .
the nazi officials were of course very interested in using sports figures as propaganda tools , such as -lrb- boxing legend -rrb- max schmeling .
-lrb- nazi propaganda minister joseph -rrb- goebbels made a big deal out of the 1936 berlin olympics and declared it a triumph for germany , so the davis cup could have served similar purposes for him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's nadal ended federer 's wimbledon winning streak last year there have been a few other " greatest matches ever " on centre court at wimbledon - the epic bjorn borg - john mcenroe duel in 1980 and the stunning marathon between roger federer and rafael nadal last year .
what makes budge vs. von cramm , the " greatest match ever " ?
borg-mcenroe and federer-nadal were incredible tennis matches , but what was at stake really , except which multi-millionaire would get to hold up the trophy afterwards ?
it was just tennis .
but in the von cramm-budge case , it was about winning the davis cup , which meant playing for their nation 's glory .
there were also the personal stakes for von cramm - he was playing for his life at a time when the winds of war were building up .
he was also playing for a regime which he loathed .
it turned out that gottfried von cramm was a gay man playing for a government that was executing people like him .
he had of course been followed by the gestapo .

the ruling socialist party is predicted to do badly , with corruption allegations largely to blame . the parliamentary election campaign in bulgaria has been a fierce one .
the ruling socialist party has attacked the opposition center-right gerb in particularly vicious television advertisements .
a few weeks before the election , the government also changed voting rights in its favour .
this could be a last-ditch attempt to stay in power , with opinion polls predicting a change . bulgaria is currently governed by a coalition made up of prime minister sergei stanishev 's socialist party and two junior partners : the movement for rights and freedom , a party representing bulgaria 's turkish minority ; and the national movement formed by the former tsar of bulgaria .
many bulgarians blame the coalition for the country 's widespread corruption , the misappropriation of millions in aid money from the european union , and the ire of brussels .
these are the factors that will likely see voters turn away from the governing parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarians are some of the poorest people in the eu " the new government will probably try to send a few high-profile people to prison as a result of corruption allegations , " says georgi ganev , an economist at sofia 's centre for liberal strategies .
" that 's why the election campaign has been fought so hard . " 50 euros for a vote but corruption in bulgaria may have even entered the ballot booth .
during the recent european parliamentary elections , there were allegations that voters were bought on a large scale .
watchdogs are concerned that this type of manipulation may continue in the national election .
tihomir beslov from bulgaria 's centre for democratic research says votes can be bought for between 50 and 150 euros .
he says that kind of money can support a family in one of bulgaria 's poorer regions for two or three months .
" an entire company 's employees could also be pressured by their bosses to vote for a particular party , " beslov says .
" for example , muslims would be forced to swear before allah that they would vote for the party representing the turkish minority . "
" bulgarians want justice " the party likely to win the most votes in sunday 's election is the center-right gerb , led by sofia mayor boyko borisov .
the party has promised to fight corruption , and gerb member maria nedelcheva recently told the european parliament that bulgarians wanted justice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boyko borisov only founded gerb a few years ago " they expect criminal convictions and they want criminal proceedings to finally be launched against those responsible , " nedelcheva said .
" we are determined to do that . "
but even gerb is not expected to win an outright majority .
experts believe that disillusioned bulgarians may not turn up to polling booths at all .
a recent opinion poll showed gerb grabbing just over 30 percent of the vote , while the ruling socialists are predicted to take just over 20 percent .
with no one party likely to win a majority , another coalition for bulgaria looks likely - talks that could drag on for months .

a few weeks before the election , the government also changed voting rights in its favour .
this could be a last-ditch attempt to stay in power , with opinion polls predicting a change . bulgaria is currently governed by a coalition made up of prime minister sergei stanishev 's socialist party and two junior partners : the movement for rights and freedom , a party representing bulgaria 's turkish minority ; and the national movement formed by the former tsar of bulgaria .
many bulgarians blame the coalition for the country 's widespread corruption , the misappropriation of millions in aid money from the european union , and the ire of brussels .
these are the factors that will likely see voters turn away from the governing parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarians are some of the poorest people in the eu " the new government will probably try to send a few high-profile people to prison as a result of corruption allegations , " says georgi ganev , an economist at sofia 's centre for liberal strategies .
" that 's why the election campaign has been fought so hard . " 50 euros for a vote but corruption in bulgaria may have even entered the ballot booth .
during the recent european parliamentary elections , there were allegations that voters were bought on a large scale .
watchdogs are concerned that this type of manipulation may continue in the national election .
tihomir beslov from bulgaria 's centre for democratic research says votes can be bought for between 50 and 150 euros .
he says that kind of money can support a family in one of bulgaria 's poorer regions for two or three months .
" an entire company 's employees could also be pressured by their bosses to vote for a particular party , " beslov says .
" for example , muslims would be forced to swear before allah that they would vote for the party representing the turkish minority . "
" bulgarians want justice " the party likely to win the most votes in sunday 's election is the center-right gerb , led by sofia mayor boyko borisov .
the party has promised to fight corruption , and gerb member maria nedelcheva recently told the european parliament that bulgarians wanted justice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boyko borisov only founded gerb a few years ago " they expect criminal convictions and they want criminal proceedings to finally be launched against those responsible , " nedelcheva said .
" we are determined to do that . "
but even gerb is not expected to win an outright majority .
experts believe that disillusioned bulgarians may not turn up to polling booths at all .
a recent opinion poll showed gerb grabbing just over 30 percent of the vote , while the ruling socialists are predicted to take just over 20 percent .
with no one party likely to win a majority , another coalition for bulgaria looks likely - talks that could drag on for months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 05.07.2009 bulgarians head to polls amid vote-buying allegations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allegations of vote-buying may overshadow bulgarian elections bulgarians are heading to the polls on sunday for the country 's first parliamentary election since joining the eu .
the ruling socialist party is predicted to do badly , with corruption allegations largely to blame . the parliamentary election campaign in bulgaria has been a fierce one .
the ruling socialist party has attacked the opposition center-right gerb in particularly vicious television advertisements .
a few weeks before the election , the government also changed voting rights in its favour .
this could be a last-ditch attempt to stay in power , with opinion polls predicting a change . bulgaria is currently governed by a coalition made up of prime minister sergei stanishev 's socialist party and two junior partners : the movement for rights and freedom , a party representing bulgaria 's turkish minority ; and the national movement formed by the former tsar of bulgaria .
many bulgarians blame the coalition for the country 's widespread corruption , the misappropriation of millions in aid money from the european union , and the ire of brussels .
these are the factors that will likely see voters turn away from the governing parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarians are some of the poorest people in the eu " the new government will probably try to send a few high-profile people to prison as a result of corruption allegations , " says georgi ganev , an economist at sofia 's centre for liberal strategies .
" that 's why the election campaign has been fought so hard . " 50 euros for a vote but corruption in bulgaria may have even entered the ballot booth .
during the recent european parliamentary elections , there were allegations that voters were bought on a large scale .
watchdogs are concerned that this type of manipulation may continue in the national election .
tihomir beslov from bulgaria 's centre for democratic research says votes can be bought for between 50 and 150 euros .
he says that kind of money can support a family in one of bulgaria 's poorer regions for two or three months .
" an entire company 's employees could also be pressured by their bosses to vote for a particular party , " beslov says .
" for example , muslims would be forced to swear before allah that they would vote for the party representing the turkish minority . "
" bulgarians want justice " the party likely to win the most votes in sunday 's election is the center-right gerb , led by sofia mayor boyko borisov .
the party has promised to fight corruption , and gerb member maria nedelcheva recently told the european parliament that bulgarians wanted justice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boyko borisov only founded gerb a few years ago " they expect criminal convictions and they want criminal proceedings to finally be launched against those responsible , " nedelcheva said .
" we are determined to do that . "
but even gerb is not expected to win an outright majority .
experts believe that disillusioned bulgarians may not turn up to polling booths at all .
a recent opinion poll showed gerb grabbing just over 30 percent of the vote , while the ruling socialists are predicted to take just over 20 percent .
with no one party likely to win a majority , another coalition for bulgaria looks likely - talks that could drag on for months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.07.2009 normality comes in small doses in bosnia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instead of scenes of war , sarajevo today is characterized by a fragile peace more than 13 years after the dayton accord was signed , ending the bosnia 's inter-ethnic conflict in 1995 , the balkan country remains a very divided place . while peace and security have long since been established , few of those displaced during the three-year war have returned to homes in areas where their ethnic group is not in the majority .
despite this , there is a growing feeling among some people that it is time for the international community to step back , and hand over more responsibility for bosnia 's future to that country 's politicians .
the dayton accord that ended the bloodshed in bosnia-hercegovina in late 1995 is one of the few things that most bosnians can agree on .
they 'll tell you that it was successful in ending the war , but that it has been deficient when it comes to plotting a long-term path for the country 's future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it provided for the creation of a very weak central government , with the two entities , the bosniak / croat federation and the republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , wielding much of the legislative power .
this has led to divisions that had their roots in the 1992-95 war becoming formally ingrained during more than a decade of peace .
perhaps one of the most significant issues for the future of the country is the fact that children receive instruction in separate bosniak , serb or croat school systems .
seventy percent of the curriculum is set out by the state , with the remaining 30 percent left at the discretion of the schools .
croat high school student ante zelic explains that typically , these 30 percent are used for subjects like history or language instruction .
the students learn history , for example , from a croat point of view , or read two or three more novels by croatian authors than one would in other schools , says zelic .
while outsiders may think that this sort of division is the last thing that bosnian students need if the country is to grow more united in future , zelic does n't seem to see this as much of a problem .
his bosniak counterpart , adnan pripoljac , says the fact that students are divided in school is n't the point . “ i have my lessons in the morning and my croat colleagues go to classes in the afternoon .
but after school or in the evening we hang out together as usual .
most young people in bosnia do n't want to be separated , it 's just a political issue that has to be resolved . ”
practical problems while some politicians admit that the school situation is n't ideal , nobody seems to have a plan for integrating the educational systems .
a third student , dzeznan karic says there are practical considerations discouraging politicians from taking steps to change the status quo .
“ you have to realize that in every school there are , for example , two professors of geography , two professors of history , language , mathematics , physics , etc .
if they were to unite the school , this would leave one professor out of a job , and this is in nobody 's interest .
everyone is protecting their national interests .
why should a croat professor lose his job when there is also a bosniak professor who could lose his job ?
so it is a very political matter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valentin inzko hopes to be bosnia 's last high representative not even the international community 's special representative in bosnia has the answer .
the high representative still holds absolute power in this country , to be used to do whatever it takes to ensure that the provisions of the dayton accord are complied with .
this includes the power to revoke legislation or even remove politicians from office .
valentin inzko , the seventh person to hold this post , hopes he will be bosnia 's last high representative .
he recently told reporters in sarajevo that he hoped a decision would be taken in october , which would see the office of the high representative close at the end of this year .
“ i am moderately optimistic and i am doing everything in my power to ensure that this happens .
but the bosnians themselves also have to do something to improve the political climate , because -lrb- one -rrb- condition is a positive political climate and the implementation of dayton . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milorad dodik would like to seek the ohr close sooner rather than later it would be a stretch to describe the current political climate as positive .
recently , the high representative has been at loggerheads with the prime minister of the republika srpska , milorad dodik .
last month , the rs assembly passed a resolution demanding , among other things , that inzko transfer a package of powers to it from the central bosnian government .
after weeks of consultations , the high representative revoked the resolution , arguing that it violated the dayton agreement . pressure to leave it 's not surprising then , that the serbs want to see the office of the high representative shut down , sooner rather than later .
speaking to reporters in the republika srpska capital , banja luka , before the resolution was revoked , prime minister dodik said he was n't convinced that the office of the high representative was working in the best interests of the republika srbska .
“ by and large the office of the high representative -lrb- ohr -rrb- has employed a few international representatives , but most were local staff , mainly from the federation side , from sarajevo .
these people have created ill-feelings towards the republika srpska . ”
as with so many issues in bosnia , republika srpska and federation politicians are divided on this issue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.07.2009 normality comes in small doses in bosnia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instead of scenes of war , sarajevo today is characterized by a fragile peace more than 13 years after the dayton accord was signed , ending the bosnia 's inter-ethnic conflict in 1995 , the balkan country remains a very divided place . while peace and security have long since been established , few of those displaced during the three-year war have returned to homes in areas where their ethnic group is not in the majority .
despite this , there is a growing feeling among some people that it is time for the international community to step back , and hand over more responsibility for bosnia 's future to that country 's politicians .
the dayton accord that ended the bloodshed in bosnia-hercegovina in late 1995 is one of the few things that most bosnians can agree on .
they 'll tell you that it was successful in ending the war , but that it has been deficient when it comes to plotting a long-term path for the country 's future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it provided for the creation of a very weak central government , with the two entities , the bosniak / croat federation and the republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , wielding much of the legislative power .
this has led to divisions that had their roots in the 1992-95 war becoming formally ingrained during more than a decade of peace .
perhaps one of the most significant issues for the future of the country is the fact that children receive instruction in separate bosniak , serb or croat school systems .
seventy percent of the curriculum is set out by the state , with the remaining 30 percent left at the discretion of the schools .
croat high school student ante zelic explains that typically , these 30 percent are used for subjects like history or language instruction .
the students learn history , for example , from a croat point of view , or read two or three more novels by croatian authors than one would in other schools , says zelic .
while outsiders may think that this sort of division is the last thing that bosnian students need if the country is to grow more united in future , zelic does n't seem to see this as much of a problem .
his bosniak counterpart , adnan pripoljac , says the fact that students are divided in school is n't the point . “ i have my lessons in the morning and my croat colleagues go to classes in the afternoon .
but after school or in the evening we hang out together as usual .
most young people in bosnia do n't want to be separated , it 's just a political issue that has to be resolved . ”
practical problems while some politicians admit that the school situation is n't ideal , nobody seems to have a plan for integrating the educational systems .
a third student , dzeznan karic says there are practical considerations discouraging politicians from taking steps to change the status quo .
“ you have to realize that in every school there are , for example , two professors of geography , two professors of history , language , mathematics , physics , etc .
if they were to unite the school , this would leave one professor out of a job , and this is in nobody 's interest .
everyone is protecting their national interests .
why should a croat professor lose his job when there is also a bosniak professor who could lose his job ?
so it is a very political matter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valentin inzko hopes to be bosnia 's last high representative not even the international community 's special representative in bosnia has the answer .
the high representative still holds absolute power in this country , to be used to do whatever it takes to ensure that the provisions of the dayton accord are complied with .
this includes the power to revoke legislation or even remove politicians from office .
valentin inzko , the seventh person to hold this post , hopes he will be bosnia 's last high representative .
he recently told reporters in sarajevo that he hoped a decision would be taken in october , which would see the office of the high representative close at the end of this year .
“ i am moderately optimistic and i am doing everything in my power to ensure that this happens .
but the bosnians themselves also have to do something to improve the political climate , because -lrb- one -rrb- condition is a positive political climate and the implementation of dayton . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milorad dodik would like to seek the ohr close sooner rather than later it would be a stretch to describe the current political climate as positive .
recently , the high representative has been at loggerheads with the prime minister of the republika srpska , milorad dodik .
last month , the rs assembly passed a resolution demanding , among other things , that inzko transfer a package of powers to it from the central bosnian government .
after weeks of consultations , the high representative revoked the resolution , arguing that it violated the dayton agreement . pressure to leave it 's not surprising then , that the serbs want to see the office of the high representative shut down , sooner rather than later .
speaking to reporters in the republika srpska capital , banja luka , before the resolution was revoked , prime minister dodik said he was n't convinced that the office of the high representative was working in the best interests of the republika srbska .
“ by and large the office of the high representative -lrb- ohr -rrb- has employed a few international representatives , but most were local staff , mainly from the federation side , from sarajevo .
these people have created ill-feelings towards the republika srpska . ”
as with so many issues in bosnia , republika srpska and federation politicians are divided on this issue .
federation leaders say the country does n't have strong enough central institutions to close down the ohr .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.07.2009 normality comes in small doses in bosnia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instead of scenes of war , sarajevo today is characterized by a fragile peace more than 13 years after the dayton accord was signed , ending the bosnia 's inter-ethnic conflict in 1995 , the balkan country remains a very divided place . while peace and security have long since been established , few of those displaced during the three-year war have returned to homes in areas where their ethnic group is not in the majority .
despite this , there is a growing feeling among some people that it is time for the international community to step back , and hand over more responsibility for bosnia 's future to that country 's politicians .
the dayton accord that ended the bloodshed in bosnia-hercegovina in late 1995 is one of the few things that most bosnians can agree on .
they 'll tell you that it was successful in ending the war , but that it has been deficient when it comes to plotting a long-term path for the country 's future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it provided for the creation of a very weak central government , with the two entities , the bosniak / croat federation and the republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , wielding much of the legislative power .
this has led to divisions that had their roots in the 1992-95 war becoming formally ingrained during more than a decade of peace .
perhaps one of the most significant issues for the future of the country is the fact that children receive instruction in separate bosniak , serb or croat school systems .
seventy percent of the curriculum is set out by the state , with the remaining 30 percent left at the discretion of the schools .
croat high school student ante zelic explains that typically , these 30 percent are used for subjects like history or language instruction .
the students learn history , for example , from a croat point of view , or read two or three more novels by croatian authors than one would in other schools , says zelic .
while outsiders may think that this sort of division is the last thing that bosnian students need if the country is to grow more united in future , zelic does n't seem to see this as much of a problem .
his bosniak counterpart , adnan pripoljac , says the fact that students are divided in school is n't the point . “ i have my lessons in the morning and my croat colleagues go to classes in the afternoon .
but after school or in the evening we hang out together as usual .
most young people in bosnia do n't want to be separated , it 's just a political issue that has to be resolved . ”
practical problems while some politicians admit that the school situation is n't ideal , nobody seems to have a plan for integrating the educational systems .
a third student , dzeznan karic says there are practical considerations discouraging politicians from taking steps to change the status quo .
“ you have to realize that in every school there are , for example , two professors of geography , two professors of history , language , mathematics , physics , etc .
if they were to unite the school , this would leave one professor out of a job , and this is in nobody 's interest .
everyone is protecting their national interests .
why should a croat professor lose his job when there is also a bosniak professor who could lose his job ?
so it is a very political matter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valentin inzko hopes to be bosnia 's last high representative not even the international community 's special representative in bosnia has the answer .
the high representative still holds absolute power in this country , to be used to do whatever it takes to ensure that the provisions of the dayton accord are complied with .
this includes the power to revoke legislation or even remove politicians from office .
valentin inzko , the seventh person to hold this post , hopes he will be bosnia 's last high representative .
he recently told reporters in sarajevo that he hoped a decision would be taken in october , which would see the office of the high representative close at the end of this year .
“ i am moderately optimistic and i am doing everything in my power to ensure that this happens .
but the bosnians themselves also have to do something to improve the political climate , because -lrb- one -rrb- condition is a positive political climate and the implementation of dayton . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milorad dodik would like to seek the ohr close sooner rather than later it would be a stretch to describe the current political climate as positive .
recently , the high representative has been at loggerheads with the prime minister of the republika srpska , milorad dodik .
last month , the rs assembly passed a resolution demanding , among other things , that inzko transfer a package of powers to it from the central bosnian government .
after weeks of consultations , the high representative revoked the resolution , arguing that it violated the dayton agreement . pressure to leave it 's not surprising then , that the serbs want to see the office of the high representative shut down , sooner rather than later .
speaking to reporters in the republika srpska capital , banja luka , before the resolution was revoked , prime minister dodik said he was n't convinced that the office of the high representative was working in the best interests of the republika srbska .
“ by and large the office of the high representative -lrb- ohr -rrb- has employed a few international representatives , but most were local staff , mainly from the federation side , from sarajevo .
these people have created ill-feelings towards the republika srpska . ”
as with so many issues in bosnia , republika srpska and federation politicians are divided on this issue .
federation leaders say the country does n't have strong enough central institutions to close down the ohr .
haris silajdzic , the bosniak member of the bosnian presidency told reporters that he would do what he could to ensure that the ohr remains beyond the end of this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haris silajdzic says it is too early for the ohr to close up shop but he also conceded that there seemed to be an international political consensus that now was the time to pull the plug on the ohr , leaving only a non-executive european union special representative in its place .
despite dayton 's and bosnia 's flaws , the fact that the country has been at peace for more than 13 years is a considerable achievement in itself .
unemployment is high , but the cafes in both sarajevo and banja luka are full .
as one opposition politician in republika srpska put it : “ we do n't like each other very much , but at least we are not killing each other on the basis of our ethnic groups anymore .
we do n't have the most beautiful democracy in the world , but it 's not that bad . ” author : chuck penfold editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ruling socialist party is predicted to do badly , with corruption allegations largely to blame . the parliamentary election campaign in bulgaria has been a fierce one .
the ruling socialist party has attacked the opposition center-right gerb in particularly vicious television advertisements .
a few weeks before the election , the government also changed voting rights in its favour .
this could be a last-ditch attempt to stay in power , with opinion polls predicting a change . bulgaria is currently governed by a coalition made up of prime minister sergei stanishev 's socialist party and two junior partners : the movement for rights and freedom , a party representing bulgaria 's turkish minority ; and the national movement formed by the former tsar of bulgaria .
many bulgarians blame the coalition for the country 's widespread corruption , the misappropriation of millions in aid money from the european union , and the ire of brussels .
these are the factors that will likely see voters turn away from the governing parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarians are some of the poorest people in the eu " the new government will probably try to send a few high-profile people to prison as a result of corruption allegations , " says georgi ganev , an economist at sofia 's centre for liberal strategies .
" that 's why the election campaign has been fought so hard . " 50 euros for a vote but corruption in bulgaria may have even entered the ballot booth .
during the recent european parliamentary elections , there were allegations that voters were bought on a large scale .
watchdogs are concerned that this type of manipulation may continue in the national election .
tihomir beslov from bulgaria 's centre for democratic research says votes can be bought for between 50 and 150 euros .
he says that kind of money can support a family in one of bulgaria 's poorer regions for two or three months .
" an entire company 's employees could also be pressured by their bosses to vote for a particular party , " beslov says .
" for example , muslims would be forced to swear before allah that they would vote for the party representing the turkish minority . "
" bulgarians want justice " the party likely to win the most votes in sunday 's election is the center-right gerb , led by sofia mayor boyko borisov .
the party has promised to fight corruption , and gerb member maria nedelcheva recently told the european parliament that bulgarians wanted justice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boyko borisov only founded gerb a few years ago " they expect criminal convictions and they want criminal proceedings to finally be launched against those responsible , " nedelcheva said .
" we are determined to do that . "
but even gerb is not expected to win an outright majority .
experts believe that disillusioned bulgarians may not turn up to polling booths at all .
a recent opinion poll showed gerb grabbing just over 30 percent of the vote , while the ruling socialists are predicted to take just over 20 percent .
with no one party likely to win a majority , another coalition for bulgaria looks likely - talks that could drag on for months .

the ruling socialist party is predicted to do badly , with corruption allegations largely to blame . the parliamentary election campaign in bulgaria has been a fierce one .
the ruling socialist party has attacked the opposition center-right gerb in particularly vicious television advertisements .
a few weeks before the election , the government also changed voting rights in its favour .
this could be a last-ditch attempt to stay in power , with opinion polls predicting a change . bulgaria is currently governed by a coalition made up of prime minister sergei stanishev 's socialist party and two junior partners : the movement for rights and freedom , a party representing bulgaria 's turkish minority ; and the national movement formed by the former tsar of bulgaria .
many bulgarians blame the coalition for the country 's widespread corruption , the misappropriation of millions in aid money from the european union , and the ire of brussels .
these are the factors that will likely see voters turn away from the governing parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarians are some of the poorest people in the eu " the new government will probably try to send a few high-profile people to prison as a result of corruption allegations , " says georgi ganev , an economist at sofia 's centre for liberal strategies .
" that 's why the election campaign has been fought so hard . " 50 euros for a vote but corruption in bulgaria may have even entered the ballot booth .
during the recent european parliamentary elections , there were allegations that voters were bought on a large scale .
watchdogs are concerned that this type of manipulation may continue in the national election .
tihomir beslov from bulgaria 's centre for democratic research says votes can be bought for between 50 and 150 euros .
he says that kind of money can support a family in one of bulgaria 's poorer regions for two or three months .
" an entire company 's employees could also be pressured by their bosses to vote for a particular party , " beslov says .
" for example , muslims would be forced to swear before allah that they would vote for the party representing the turkish minority . "
" bulgarians want justice " the party likely to win the most votes in sunday 's election is the center-right gerb , led by sofia mayor boyko borisov .
the party has promised to fight corruption , and gerb member maria nedelcheva recently told the european parliament that bulgarians wanted justice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boyko borisov only founded gerb a few years ago " they expect criminal convictions and they want criminal proceedings to finally be launched against those responsible , " nedelcheva said .
" we are determined to do that . "
but even gerb is not expected to win an outright majority .
experts believe that disillusioned bulgarians may not turn up to polling booths at all .
a recent opinion poll showed gerb grabbing just over 30 percent of the vote , while the ruling socialists are predicted to take just over 20 percent .
with no one party likely to win a majority , another coalition for bulgaria looks likely - talks that could drag on for months .

at sunday 's historic wimbledon , roger federer broke the grand slam record .
but the personal stakes at the 1937 germany-us davis cup duel were higher for german baron gottfried von cramm : he was playing for his life . " a terrible splendor : three extraordinary men , a world poised for war and the greatest tennis match ever played " tells the story of tennis champion gottfried von cramm , who had been secretly gay in hitler 's germany and his opponent don budge , who was the top ranked us player .
it is also the story of von cramm 's gay american coach bill tilden , who was training the nazi german team against his own country in a decisive davis cup match in 1937 .
deutsche welle spoke to marshall jon fisher , the author of the newly released book . deutsche welle : why was gottfried von cramm so popular with the crowds ?
and why was he so important to the nazi leadership ?
marshall jon fisher : von cramm was a remarkable character .
he was gracious , famous for his sportsmanship and from a noble background , but did n't act that way at all .
he was tall , very handsome , very germanic-looking - blond , blue-eyed - the nazis were holding him up as the perfect model of the aryan athlete .
the nazi officials were of course very interested in using sports figures as propaganda tools , such as -lrb- boxing legend -rrb- max schmeling .
-lrb- nazi propaganda minister joseph -rrb- goebbels made a big deal out of the 1936 berlin olympics and declared it a triumph for germany , so the davis cup could have served similar purposes for him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's nadal ended federer 's wimbledon winning streak last year there have been a few other " greatest matches ever " on centre court at wimbledon - the epic bjorn borg - john mcenroe duel in 1980 and the stunning marathon between roger federer and rafael nadal last year .
what makes budge vs. von cramm , the " greatest match ever " ?
borg-mcenroe and federer-nadal were incredible tennis matches , but what was at stake really , except which multi-millionaire would get to hold up the trophy afterwards ?
it was just tennis .
but in the von cramm-budge case , it was about winning the davis cup , which meant playing for their nation 's glory .
there were also the personal stakes for von cramm - he was playing for his life at a time when the winds of war were building up .
he was also playing for a regime which he loathed .
it turned out that gottfried von cramm was a gay man playing for a government that was executing people like him .
he had of course been followed by the gestapo .
they had a big file on him .
his lover was jewish .
his wife - he had married a childhood friend - was one-quarter jewish .
the gestapo had made it clear to him that as long as he kept winning and that germany had a chance to win the davis cup with him , he would be safe .
but if things did n't go too well with him on the tennis court , that might not be the case .
there was quite an amazing amount of pressure on him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von cramm was secretly gay , but married barbara hutton .
how did the match go ?
this 1937 davis cup match was supposed to be a walk away for don budge , who had destroyed von cramm two weeks earlier at the wimbledon final in three straight sets , so everyone thought budge was going to win this match easily and the americans would win the davis cup , but von cramm just played stupendous tennis .
von cramm won the first two sets .
budge came back and won the second two sets .
in the decisive fifth set , von cramm was up 4 to 1 .
at this point everyone thought von cramm was going to win , but budge comes back again and it goes past 6-6 .
i 'd rather not give away the ending , but it turned into a remarkable fifth set .
so what happened to von cramm after the match ?
it was inevitable that no matter what happened in the match , von cramm was going to run into trouble in germany .
when he travelled around the world , he became more and more outspoken against the nazis and upon returning home from his travels in 1938 , he was arrested and sentenced to prison for homosexual acts .
now he got off a bit easy due to some good connections he had .
most homosexuals were going to the camps , but he simply went to prison in berlin for less than a year .
was it generally known that von cramm was homosexual ?
other players did know , but it was not publicly known even after the war when von cramm played the davis cup for west germany .
with -lrb- von cramm 's american coach -rrb- bill tilden , people knew .
he was not quite as dignified as von cramm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us champ bill tilden coached germany 's davis cup team regarding bill tilden - it 's very common nowadays for the coach of a national team to be foreign .
we see that a lot in international soccer .
but on the eve of world war ii , what tilden did , appears treacherous .
it was extraordinary , but not because tilden was a foreigner .
" big bill " tilden completely dominated the tennis world throughout the 1920s and kept the davis cup in the united states almost single-handedly .
he was also a gay man when one could n't talk about such things .
it was amazing the nazis hired not only an american , but a gay american to coach their davis cup team .
how did tilden , an american tennis idol , wind up coaching the nazi german team , of all teams ?
tilden had wanted to coach the americans for years , even offering to do it for free , but they turned him down every year , presumably because they were afraid of some scandal due to his homosexuality .
so when the germans finally gave him an offer , he was happy to take it . tennis today is an individual sport , you play for yourself rather than for your country and it 's the grand slam tournaments - the us , french , australian open and wimbledon of course - that are important .
could you explain the significance of the davis cup back then ?
well of course , we still have the davis cup , but it was much more significant back then .
all the big international tournaments then were also only open to amateurs .
tennis was much bigger in the sports world back then and the davis cup was even bigger than wimbledon .
the pro era in tennis began in 1968 .
gottfried von cramm survived the war , married woolworth heiress barbara hutton in the 1950s and became a successful cotton importer .
he died in a car accident on a business trip in egypt in 1976 .
bill tilden tried to pursue an acting career in hollywood , but served prison time for homosexual acts after the war .
because of his convictions , he was shunned from playing and teaching tennis .
he died of a stroke in 1953 .

at sunday 's historic wimbledon , roger federer broke the grand slam record .
but the personal stakes at the 1937 germany-us davis cup duel were higher for german baron gottfried von cramm : he was playing for his life . " a terrible splendor : three extraordinary men , a world poised for war and the greatest tennis match ever played " tells the story of tennis champion gottfried von cramm , who had been secretly gay in hitler 's germany and his opponent don budge , who was the top ranked us player .
it is also the story of von cramm 's gay american coach bill tilden , who was training the nazi german team against his own country in a decisive davis cup match in 1937 .
deutsche welle spoke to marshall jon fisher , the author of the newly released book . deutsche welle : why was gottfried von cramm so popular with the crowds ?
and why was he so important to the nazi leadership ?
marshall jon fisher : von cramm was a remarkable character .
he was gracious , famous for his sportsmanship and from a noble background , but did n't act that way at all .
he was tall , very handsome , very germanic-looking - blond , blue-eyed - the nazis were holding him up as the perfect model of the aryan athlete .
the nazi officials were of course very interested in using sports figures as propaganda tools , such as -lrb- boxing legend -rrb- max schmeling .
-lrb- nazi propaganda minister joseph -rrb- goebbels made a big deal out of the 1936 berlin olympics and declared it a triumph for germany , so the davis cup could have served similar purposes for him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's nadal ended federer 's wimbledon winning streak last year there have been a few other " greatest matches ever " on centre court at wimbledon - the epic bjorn borg - john mcenroe duel in 1980 and the stunning marathon between roger federer and rafael nadal last year .
what makes budge vs. von cramm , the " greatest match ever " ?
borg-mcenroe and federer-nadal were incredible tennis matches , but what was at stake really , except which multi-millionaire would get to hold up the trophy afterwards ?
it was just tennis .
but in the von cramm-budge case , it was about winning the davis cup , which meant playing for their nation 's glory .
there were also the personal stakes for von cramm - he was playing for his life at a time when the winds of war were building up .
he was also playing for a regime which he loathed .
it turned out that gottfried von cramm was a gay man playing for a government that was executing people like him .
he had of course been followed by the gestapo .
they had a big file on him .
his lover was jewish .
his wife - he had married a childhood friend - was one-quarter jewish .
the gestapo had made it clear to him that as long as he kept winning and that germany had a chance to win the davis cup with him , he would be safe .
but if things did n't go too well with him on the tennis court , that might not be the case .
there was quite an amazing amount of pressure on him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von cramm was secretly gay , but married barbara hutton .
how did the match go ?
this 1937 davis cup match was supposed to be a walk away for don budge , who had destroyed von cramm two weeks earlier at the wimbledon final in three straight sets , so everyone thought budge was going to win this match easily and the americans would win the davis cup , but von cramm just played stupendous tennis .
von cramm won the first two sets .
budge came back and won the second two sets .
in the decisive fifth set , von cramm was up 4 to 1 .
at this point everyone thought von cramm was going to win , but budge comes back again and it goes past 6-6 .
i 'd rather not give away the ending , but it turned into a remarkable fifth set .
so what happened to von cramm after the match ?
it was inevitable that no matter what happened in the match , von cramm was going to run into trouble in germany .
when he travelled around the world , he became more and more outspoken against the nazis and upon returning home from his travels in 1938 , he was arrested and sentenced to prison for homosexual acts .
now he got off a bit easy due to some good connections he had .
most homosexuals were going to the camps , but he simply went to prison in berlin for less than a year .
was it generally known that von cramm was homosexual ?
other players did know , but it was not publicly known even after the war when von cramm played the davis cup for west germany .
with -lrb- von cramm 's american coach -rrb- bill tilden , people knew .
he was not quite as dignified as von cramm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us champ bill tilden coached germany 's davis cup team regarding bill tilden - it 's very common nowadays for the coach of a national team to be foreign .
we see that a lot in international soccer .
but on the eve of world war ii , what tilden did , appears treacherous .
it was extraordinary , but not because tilden was a foreigner .
" big bill " tilden completely dominated the tennis world throughout the 1920s and kept the davis cup in the united states almost single-handedly .
he was also a gay man when one could n't talk about such things .
it was amazing the nazis hired not only an american , but a gay american to coach their davis cup team .
how did tilden , an american tennis idol , wind up coaching the nazi german team , of all teams ?
tilden had wanted to coach the americans for years , even offering to do it for free , but they turned him down every year , presumably because they were afraid of some scandal due to his homosexuality .
so when the germans finally gave him an offer , he was happy to take it . tennis today is an individual sport , you play for yourself rather than for your country and it 's the grand slam tournaments - the us , french , australian open and wimbledon of course - that are important .
could you explain the significance of the davis cup back then ?
well of course , we still have the davis cup , but it was much more significant back then .
all the big international tournaments then were also only open to amateurs .
tennis was much bigger in the sports world back then and the davis cup was even bigger than wimbledon .
the pro era in tennis began in 1968 .
gottfried von cramm survived the war , married woolworth heiress barbara hutton in the 1950s and became a successful cotton importer .
he died in a car accident on a business trip in egypt in 1976 .
bill tilden tried to pursue an acting career in hollywood , but served prison time for homosexual acts after the war .
because of his convictions , he was shunned from playing and teaching tennis .
he died of a stroke in 1953 .

it turned out that gottfried von cramm was a gay man playing for a government that was executing people like him .
he had of course been followed by the gestapo .
they had a big file on him .
his lover was jewish .
his wife - he had married a childhood friend - was one-quarter jewish .
the gestapo had made it clear to him that as long as he kept winning and that germany had a chance to win the davis cup with him , he would be safe .
but if things did n't go too well with him on the tennis court , that might not be the case .
there was quite an amazing amount of pressure on him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von cramm was secretly gay , but married barbara hutton .
how did the match go ?
this 1937 davis cup match was supposed to be a walk away for don budge , who had destroyed von cramm two weeks earlier at the wimbledon final in three straight sets , so everyone thought budge was going to win this match easily and the americans would win the davis cup , but von cramm just played stupendous tennis .
von cramm won the first two sets .
budge came back and won the second two sets .
in the decisive fifth set , von cramm was up 4 to 1 .
at this point everyone thought von cramm was going to win , but budge comes back again and it goes past 6-6 .
i 'd rather not give away the ending , but it turned into a remarkable fifth set .
so what happened to von cramm after the match ?
it was inevitable that no matter what happened in the match , von cramm was going to run into trouble in germany .
when he travelled around the world , he became more and more outspoken against the nazis and upon returning home from his travels in 1938 , he was arrested and sentenced to prison for homosexual acts .
now he got off a bit easy due to some good connections he had .
most homosexuals were going to the camps , but he simply went to prison in berlin for less than a year .
was it generally known that von cramm was homosexual ?
other players did know , but it was not publicly known even after the war when von cramm played the davis cup for west germany .
with -lrb- von cramm 's american coach -rrb- bill tilden , people knew .
he was not quite as dignified as von cramm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us champ bill tilden coached germany 's davis cup team regarding bill tilden - it 's very common nowadays for the coach of a national team to be foreign .
we see that a lot in international soccer .
but on the eve of world war ii , what tilden did , appears treacherous .
it was extraordinary , but not because tilden was a foreigner .
" big bill " tilden completely dominated the tennis world throughout the 1920s and kept the davis cup in the united states almost single-handedly .
he was also a gay man when one could n't talk about such things .
it was amazing the nazis hired not only an american , but a gay american to coach their davis cup team .
how did tilden , an american tennis idol , wind up coaching the nazi german team , of all teams ?
tilden had wanted to coach the americans for years , even offering to do it for free , but they turned him down every year , presumably because they were afraid of some scandal due to his homosexuality .
so when the germans finally gave him an offer , he was happy to take it . tennis today is an individual sport , you play for yourself rather than for your country and it 's the grand slam tournaments - the us , french , australian open and wimbledon of course - that are important .
could you explain the significance of the davis cup back then ?
well of course , we still have the davis cup , but it was much more significant back then .
all the big international tournaments then were also only open to amateurs .
tennis was much bigger in the sports world back then and the davis cup was even bigger than wimbledon .
the pro era in tennis began in 1968 .
gottfried von cramm survived the war , married woolworth heiress barbara hutton in the 1950s and became a successful cotton importer .
he died in a car accident on a business trip in egypt in 1976 .
bill tilden tried to pursue an acting career in hollywood , but served prison time for homosexual acts after the war .
because of his convictions , he was shunned from playing and teaching tennis .
he died of a stroke in 1953 .

financial institutes remain reluctant to lend despite having received billions in finanical aid . german finance minister peer steinbrueck has warned banking managers over their reluctance to lend .
in sunday 's edition of the tabloid bild he says he was doubtful that a bill passed on friday in berlin to allow german banks to park their toxic assets in a so-called bad bank structure will be enough to get the banks back into the business of providing credit . instead , he 's threatening banks with unnamed sanctions should a credit crunch be the result of their too conservative lending policies .

" as a uefa member , i would like to see it in europe but it is an open race as to which country might get it … there are a lot of different countries bidding .
let 's wait and see . "
he added however that " it will be europe 's turn -lrb- in 2018 -rrb- . "
beckenbauer , known as " der kaiser " for his legendary playing and coaching achievements , sits on governing body fifa 's 24-member executive committee that is charged with voting on which countries host the world cup every four years .
in december next year , the committee will decide the hosts of both the 2018 and 2022 world cups simultaneously , with bidding countries from the winning continent for the 2018 tourney becoming ineligible for the following tournament .

the 2010 world cup will be hosted by south africa , while brazil will hold the 2014 edition of the tournament .
beckenbauer added that if the 2018 world cup was awarded to a european country , then a country like australia could be a strong contender for the 2022 event .
" i think they have a good chance because the world cup 's never been to australia , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 05.07.2009 financial crisis hits african trade , aid as wto gears up for summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trade is an important way of helping africa the world trade organization is preparing to review its aid for trade initiative at an international conference in geneva .
the trade situation of developing countries in the economic crisis will be top of the agenda . give developing countries the tools to improve their position as trade partners and both their own development and the international trade situation will also improve .
that 's the idea behind " aid for trade , " which the wto launched in hong kong four years ago , wto director general pascal lamy tells deutsche welle .
" developing countries very often face trade barriers , which either stem from their own infrastructure - for example roadways , transport or energy - or they face technical trade barriers , for example if someone wants to export flowers to the us or to europe he will have to meet the maximum pesticide residue standard , " he says .
africa , more so than any other continent , faces these kinds of problems as it tries to increase its trade capacity .
and to make matter worse , lamy says , africa has seen a decrease in participation in international trade over the last 10 years .
" in absolute value african trade has grown , but in relative value , as compared to the whole world trade , it has decreased , " he explains .
" the fundamental point for africa is , one , trying to diversify exports to meet international demand , and , two , making sure that inter-african trade grows .
at the moment the trade between african countries is incredibly low . "
lamy underlines that international trade accounts for around 15 percent of economic activity in europe and the us , but three to four times as much in africa .
" hence the enormous importance of keeping trade open during the crisis , which means fighting protectionism , because that would hit developing countries most .
and then , keeping investment in the future so they can trade their way out of the crisis . "
downward spiral bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more trade with the eu and within africa will make a difference the ongoing international economic crisis has hit africa in particular , dr. mohammed ibn chambas tells deutsche welle .
chambas is executive secretary of ecowas , the economic community of west african states .
he explains the downward spiral : the shrinking global economy leads to lower demand for commodities from west africa and africa as a whole .
lower demand also means lower prices .
but there is more : " the strong global growth led to 5 percent growth in africa in the year preceding the crisis , " he says .
" the slowdown has of course led to a reduced african growth rate .
we will end 2009 at less than 3 percent .
that is not good because it 's very close to the population growth rate .
" secondly the transfer of funds from african diasporas is also invested in many activities for expanding trade , export trade in particular .
and all of this has obviously now been reduced . "
chambas says he is also worried that donor countries may reduce their support for the aid for trade program because of the crisis .
" of course aid for trade funding is dependant on support of the economies of the developed countries .
and now that these economies are under stress and in recession , naturally there is likely to be a shuffle in the promised resources .
these are legitimate concerns that we have on the african side , that not all the pledges that have been made will be provided . "
european responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without trade , illegal immigration will continue chambas says europe has a special duty to increase its aid to africa .
" the bulk of african trade is with europe .
we believe that the partnership between europe and africa should translate into concrete support for africa to reduce the impact of the global crisis , " he says .
" it 's a historic relationship that we can not wish away and i believe that in the context of this new partnership we should see how we can work together , europe and africa , to overcome the current economic slowdown . "
john clancy , spokesman for european commissioner for development and humanitarian aid louis michel , says europe 's history with africa is unique , and that the focus should be on measures to improve that relationship .
" i think what is important is not to look backward to the past , but to the present day and the future .
aid for trade is about partnership .
it is a complimentary aspect to assisting developing countries , those in africa in particular .
it should soften , to some extent , the changes that have to take place at a socio-economic level in these countries , so that they can profit from the global marketplace more than before . "

the trade situation of developing countries in the economic crisis will be top of the agenda . give developing countries the tools to improve their position as trade partners and both their own development and the international trade situation will also improve .
that 's the idea behind " aid for trade , " which the wto launched in hong kong four years ago , wto director general pascal lamy tells deutsche welle .
" developing countries very often face trade barriers , which either stem from their own infrastructure - for example roadways , transport or energy - or they face technical trade barriers , for example if someone wants to export flowers to the us or to europe he will have to meet the maximum pesticide residue standard , " he says .
africa , more so than any other continent , faces these kinds of problems as it tries to increase its trade capacity .
and to make matter worse , lamy says , africa has seen a decrease in participation in international trade over the last 10 years .
" in absolute value african trade has grown , but in relative value , as compared to the whole world trade , it has decreased , " he explains .
" the fundamental point for africa is , one , trying to diversify exports to meet international demand , and , two , making sure that inter-african trade grows .
at the moment the trade between african countries is incredibly low . "
lamy underlines that international trade accounts for around 15 percent of economic activity in europe and the us , but three to four times as much in africa .
" hence the enormous importance of keeping trade open during the crisis , which means fighting protectionism , because that would hit developing countries most .
and then , keeping investment in the future so they can trade their way out of the crisis . "
downward spiral bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more trade with the eu and within africa will make a difference the ongoing international economic crisis has hit africa in particular , dr. mohammed ibn chambas tells deutsche welle .
chambas is executive secretary of ecowas , the economic community of west african states .
he explains the downward spiral : the shrinking global economy leads to lower demand for commodities from west africa and africa as a whole .
lower demand also means lower prices .
but there is more : " the strong global growth led to 5 percent growth in africa in the year preceding the crisis , " he says .
" the slowdown has of course led to a reduced african growth rate .
we will end 2009 at less than 3 percent .
that is not good because it 's very close to the population growth rate .
" secondly the transfer of funds from african diasporas is also invested in many activities for expanding trade , export trade in particular .
and all of this has obviously now been reduced . "
chambas says he is also worried that donor countries may reduce their support for the aid for trade program because of the crisis .
" of course aid for trade funding is dependant on support of the economies of the developed countries .
and now that these economies are under stress and in recession , naturally there is likely to be a shuffle in the promised resources .
these are legitimate concerns that we have on the african side , that not all the pledges that have been made will be provided . "
european responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without trade , illegal immigration will continue chambas says europe has a special duty to increase its aid to africa .
" the bulk of african trade is with europe .
we believe that the partnership between europe and africa should translate into concrete support for africa to reduce the impact of the global crisis , " he says .
" it 's a historic relationship that we can not wish away and i believe that in the context of this new partnership we should see how we can work together , europe and africa , to overcome the current economic slowdown . "
john clancy , spokesman for european commissioner for development and humanitarian aid louis michel , says europe 's history with africa is unique , and that the focus should be on measures to improve that relationship .
" i think what is important is not to look backward to the past , but to the present day and the future .
aid for trade is about partnership .
it is a complimentary aspect to assisting developing countries , those in africa in particular .
it should soften , to some extent , the changes that have to take place at a socio-economic level in these countries , so that they can profit from the global marketplace more than before . "

it comes as israeli premier benjamin netanyahu has referred to a ' ' two-state solution " for the first time . the aim of minister frank-walter steinmeier 's two-day trip is to jumpstart the dormant peace process .
on monday , he is to hold talks with israeli president shimon peres , prime minister benyamin netanyahu , and foreign minister avigdor lieberman in jerusalem .
he will also visit lebanon and syria .
steinmeier has been among world leaders who have criticized israeli settlement building programs in east jerusalem and the west bank .
thus far , netanyahu 's government had refused to freeze settlement activities and had not agreed to a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu is known for his tough stance on the palestinian issue however , on sunday , netanyahu referred for the first time to a " two-state solution " to bring peace to the middle east .
" we have achieved a national agreement on the formula of two states for two peoples , " the israeli prime minister said during the weekly cabinet meeting .
steinmeier is expected to pay a visit to the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem on monday .
media reports said that a meeting planned with palestinian president mahmoud abbas in the west bank town of ramallah was not likely to take place , because abbas is visiting jordan for talks on forming a palestinian unity government with the rival hamas movement .
support for us efforts it will be steinmeier 's 14th trip to the region since becoming germany 's foreign minister in 2005 .
it involves an exacting schedule , covering nearly 6,500 kilometers and four countries in just 36 hours .
the whirlwind tour of the middle east is meant to lend impetus to germany 's desire for peace in the region as soon as possible , according to a foreign ministry spokesman in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the obama administration wants to reinvigorate the peace process " we have had new momentum in the middle east peace process since the new government took office in washington and we support its fresh efforts to reach a two-state solution and a return to negotiations , " said andreas peschke ahead of steinmeier 's trip .
peschke added that berlin was pursuing a middle east policy focused on practical assistance on the ground , including development assistance for the palestinians and training for security forces in the territories to help prepare for eventual statehood .
during his visit to the west bank on monday , steinmeier will assess the progress of such projects .
the foreign ministry spokesman said that germany 's engagement in the region was determined in consultation with its european partners and the government of us president barack obama .
the new administration in washington consulted berlin in the conceptual stages of the reorientation of its middle east policy . in a further reflection of the ongoing efforts to harmonize international peace efforts in the region , steinmeier held intensive discussions via telephone with his american counterpart hillary clinton and the us the middle east mediator george mitchell , prior to his middle east trip .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syrian president assad has been engaging the international community neighbors have crucial role german officials said steinmeier hoped to persuade neighboring arab states to play a more active role in diplomatic efforts to end the israeli-palestinian conflict .
acknowledging the crucial role of the neighbors in any peace process , foreign ministry spokesman andreas peschke said that germany saw several rays of hope in the region , including last month 's peaceful elections in lebanon and improved relations between lebanon and syria .
he added that all these factors presented a " window of opportunity . "
in light of these developments , steinmeier will also travel to damascus for talks with his syrian counterpart wali al-muallem and president bashar al-assad .
in the past , steinmeier , who is set to challenge chancellor angela merkel in september 's general election , faced criticism from the chancellery and the us administration for his efforts to engage syria .
however , the obama administration has dramatically softened washington 's stance towards damascus .
and this week , the us announced that it would send an ambassador back to damascus after a four-year gap .
the move comes amid a region-wide campaign to lay the groundwork for middle east peace .
in response , president assad invited obama to visit syria .
when he travels to the lebanese capital beirut , steinmeier will become the first western politician to meet prime minister-designate saad hariri , the son of former premier rafik hariri , who was killed in a bomb blast in 2005 .
hariri 's pro-western alliance won last month 's general elections .
some observers say germany is aware that it does not have the influence to broker middle east peace on its own , but that steinmeier clearly wants to be part of the obama administration 's efforts in that direction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : settlement activity in the occupied territories is a point of contention issue on g8 agenda the trip comes ahead of next week 's g8 summit in italy .
chancellor merkel indicated last week that the middle east conflict would figure prominently in those talks .
she said " concessions from all sides were necessary , " for the peace process to succeed .
calling for a halt to the construction of israeli settlements , merkel said " there has to be a freeze .

the new administration in washington consulted berlin in the conceptual stages of the reorientation of its middle east policy . in a further reflection of the ongoing efforts to harmonize international peace efforts in the region , steinmeier held intensive discussions via telephone with his american counterpart hillary clinton and the us the middle east mediator george mitchell , prior to his middle east trip .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syrian president assad has been engaging the international community neighbors have crucial role german officials said steinmeier hoped to persuade neighboring arab states to play a more active role in diplomatic efforts to end the israeli-palestinian conflict .
acknowledging the crucial role of the neighbors in any peace process , foreign ministry spokesman andreas peschke said that germany saw several rays of hope in the region , including last month 's peaceful elections in lebanon and improved relations between lebanon and syria .
he added that all these factors presented a " window of opportunity . "
in light of these developments , steinmeier will also travel to damascus for talks with his syrian counterpart wali al-muallem and president bashar al-assad .
in the past , steinmeier , who is set to challenge chancellor angela merkel in september 's general election , faced criticism from the chancellery and the us administration for his efforts to engage syria .
however , the obama administration has dramatically softened washington 's stance towards damascus .
and this week , the us announced that it would send an ambassador back to damascus after a four-year gap .
the move comes amid a region-wide campaign to lay the groundwork for middle east peace .
in response , president assad invited obama to visit syria .
when he travels to the lebanese capital beirut , steinmeier will become the first western politician to meet prime minister-designate saad hariri , the son of former premier rafik hariri , who was killed in a bomb blast in 2005 .
hariri 's pro-western alliance won last month 's general elections .
some observers say germany is aware that it does not have the influence to broker middle east peace on its own , but that steinmeier clearly wants to be part of the obama administration 's efforts in that direction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : settlement activity in the occupied territories is a point of contention issue on g8 agenda the trip comes ahead of next week 's g8 summit in italy .
chancellor merkel indicated last week that the middle east conflict would figure prominently in those talks .
she said " concessions from all sides were necessary , " for the peace process to succeed .
calling for a halt to the construction of israeli settlements , merkel said " there has to be a freeze .
otherwise i am convinced we will not achieve the two-state solution that we urgently need - a jewish state of israel and a palestinian state that can live in security .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 05.07.2009 financial crisis hits african trade , aid as wto gears up for summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trade is an important way of helping africa the world trade organization is preparing to review its aid for trade initiative at an international conference in geneva .
the trade situation of developing countries in the economic crisis will be top of the agenda . give developing countries the tools to improve their position as trade partners and both their own development and the international trade situation will also improve .
that 's the idea behind " aid for trade , " which the wto launched in hong kong four years ago , wto director general pascal lamy tells deutsche welle .
" developing countries very often face trade barriers , which either stem from their own infrastructure - for example roadways , transport or energy - or they face technical trade barriers , for example if someone wants to export flowers to the us or to europe he will have to meet the maximum pesticide residue standard , " he says .
africa , more so than any other continent , faces these kinds of problems as it tries to increase its trade capacity .
and to make matter worse , lamy says , africa has seen a decrease in participation in international trade over the last 10 years .
" in absolute value african trade has grown , but in relative value , as compared to the whole world trade , it has decreased , " he explains .
" the fundamental point for africa is , one , trying to diversify exports to meet international demand , and , two , making sure that inter-african trade grows .
at the moment the trade between african countries is incredibly low . "
lamy underlines that international trade accounts for around 15 percent of economic activity in europe and the us , but three to four times as much in africa .
" hence the enormous importance of keeping trade open during the crisis , which means fighting protectionism , because that would hit developing countries most .
and then , keeping investment in the future so they can trade their way out of the crisis . "
downward spiral bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more trade with the eu and within africa will make a difference the ongoing international economic crisis has hit africa in particular , dr. mohammed ibn chambas tells deutsche welle .
chambas is executive secretary of ecowas , the economic community of west african states .
he explains the downward spiral : the shrinking global economy leads to lower demand for commodities from west africa and africa as a whole .
lower demand also means lower prices .
but there is more : " the strong global growth led to 5 percent growth in africa in the year preceding the crisis , " he says .
" the slowdown has of course led to a reduced african growth rate .
we will end 2009 at less than 3 percent .
that is not good because it 's very close to the population growth rate .
" secondly the transfer of funds from african diasporas is also invested in many activities for expanding trade , export trade in particular .
and all of this has obviously now been reduced . "
chambas says he is also worried that donor countries may reduce their support for the aid for trade program because of the crisis .
" of course aid for trade funding is dependant on support of the economies of the developed countries .
and now that these economies are under stress and in recession , naturally there is likely to be a shuffle in the promised resources .
these are legitimate concerns that we have on the african side , that not all the pledges that have been made will be provided . "
european responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without trade , illegal immigration will continue chambas says europe has a special duty to increase its aid to africa .
" the bulk of african trade is with europe .
we believe that the partnership between europe and africa should translate into concrete support for africa to reduce the impact of the global crisis , " he says .
" it 's a historic relationship that we can not wish away and i believe that in the context of this new partnership we should see how we can work together , europe and africa , to overcome the current economic slowdown . "
john clancy , spokesman for european commissioner for development and humanitarian aid louis michel , says europe 's history with africa is unique , and that the focus should be on measures to improve that relationship .
" i think what is important is not to look backward to the past , but to the present day and the future .
aid for trade is about partnership .
it is a complimentary aspect to assisting developing countries , those in africa in particular .
it should soften , to some extent , the changes that have to take place at a socio-economic level in these countries , so that they can profit from the global marketplace more than before . "

financial institutes remain reluctant to lend despite having received billions in finanical aid . german finance minister peer steinbrueck has warned banking managers over their reluctance to lend .
in sunday 's edition of the tabloid bild he says he was doubtful that a bill passed on friday in berlin to allow german banks to park their toxic assets in a so-called bad bank structure will be enough to get the banks back into the business of providing credit . instead , he 's threatening banks with unnamed sanctions should a credit crunch be the result of their too conservative lending policies .
his warning is that the government and the central bank will have to take steps to force the bankers ' hand .
these as yet unspecified actions , steinbrueck warns , would include measures never before used against financial institutions in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck warned banking managers over their reluctance to lend late last year , banks all over the world demanded billions in financial aid from their governments .
otherwise , they said , they would be forced into bankruptcy with unforeseeable consequences for the world economy . governments from washington , to london , to tokyo to berlin complied , despite the enormously high political risk involved .
there was political consensus that the banks were simply too big to be allowed to fail . despite state aid , banks are reluctant to lend today , german banks are doing far better , but stand accused of still being reluctant to lend to businesses and companies which increasingly feel the pinch of the global recession . for months , small and medium sized companies in germany have been finding it more and more difficult - if not impossible - to keep credit lines with their banks open . " at the moment there is no credit crunch , " said martin wansleben , managing director of the german chamber of industry and commerce . " but more and more companies are having difficulty getting needed loans .
it 's more complicated .
it 's more expensive .
and many are simply being rejected outright . " but , could the german government actually force banks to lend money ?
finance minister peer steinbrueck refused to fuel speculation on that .
however , other politicians are less subtle in their warnings to the banks . condemnation from across party lines " we helped the banks with massive funding and political support , " saarland state premier peter mueller said on saturday . " now , it 's up to the banks to provide that help to companies . " the banks are accused of taking the government 's money but using it only to improve their own financial situation , not the country 's economy . " we must now ensure that banks are obliged to offer credit on a more liberal basis , " urged fritz kuhn , parliamentary leader of the greens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's president accused the banks of causing the crisis politicians of all parties are united in their determination to force german banks to make credit available over fears of unemployment rising even further due to a lack of credit for businesses . german president horst koehler - himself a former head of the world bank - added his voice to the critics in a television interview . " i appeal to the banks to do more to ensure that the economy can grow , " he said . koehler 's criticism of the banks was the most pointed of all .
he accused them of first causing the worldwide economic crisis and now hesitating to help find a solution for it . rd / afp / dpa editor : carl holm send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.07.2009 normality comes in small doses in bosnia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instead of scenes of war , sarajevo today is characterized by a fragile peace more than 13 years after the dayton accord was signed , ending the bosnia 's inter-ethnic conflict in 1995 , the balkan country remains a very divided place . while peace and security have long since been established , few of those displaced during the three-year war have returned to homes in areas where their ethnic group is not in the majority .
despite this , there is a growing feeling among some people that it is time for the international community to step back , and hand over more responsibility for bosnia 's future to that country 's politicians .
the dayton accord that ended the bloodshed in bosnia-hercegovina in late 1995 is one of the few things that most bosnians can agree on .
they 'll tell you that it was successful in ending the war , but that it has been deficient when it comes to plotting a long-term path for the country 's future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it provided for the creation of a very weak central government , with the two entities , the bosniak / croat federation and the republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , wielding much of the legislative power .
this has led to divisions that had their roots in the 1992-95 war becoming formally ingrained during more than a decade of peace .
perhaps one of the most significant issues for the future of the country is the fact that children receive instruction in separate bosniak , serb or croat school systems .
seventy percent of the curriculum is set out by the state , with the remaining 30 percent left at the discretion of the schools .
croat high school student ante zelic explains that typically , these 30 percent are used for subjects like history or language instruction .
the students learn history , for example , from a croat point of view , or read two or three more novels by croatian authors than one would in other schools , says zelic .
while outsiders may think that this sort of division is the last thing that bosnian students need if the country is to grow more united in future , zelic does n't seem to see this as much of a problem .
his bosniak counterpart , adnan pripoljac , says the fact that students are divided in school is n't the point . “ i have my lessons in the morning and my croat colleagues go to classes in the afternoon .
but after school or in the evening we hang out together as usual .
most young people in bosnia do n't want to be separated , it 's just a political issue that has to be resolved . ”
practical problems while some politicians admit that the school situation is n't ideal , nobody seems to have a plan for integrating the educational systems .
a third student , dzeznan karic says there are practical considerations discouraging politicians from taking steps to change the status quo .
“ you have to realize that in every school there are , for example , two professors of geography , two professors of history , language , mathematics , physics , etc .
if they were to unite the school , this would leave one professor out of a job , and this is in nobody 's interest .
everyone is protecting their national interests .
why should a croat professor lose his job when there is also a bosniak professor who could lose his job ?
so it is a very political matter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valentin inzko hopes to be bosnia 's last high representative not even the international community 's special representative in bosnia has the answer .
the high representative still holds absolute power in this country , to be used to do whatever it takes to ensure that the provisions of the dayton accord are complied with .
this includes the power to revoke legislation or even remove politicians from office .
valentin inzko , the seventh person to hold this post , hopes he will be bosnia 's last high representative .
he recently told reporters in sarajevo that he hoped a decision would be taken in october , which would see the office of the high representative close at the end of this year .
“ i am moderately optimistic and i am doing everything in my power to ensure that this happens .
but the bosnians themselves also have to do something to improve the political climate , because -lrb- one -rrb- condition is a positive political climate and the implementation of dayton . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milorad dodik would like to seek the ohr close sooner rather than later it would be a stretch to describe the current political climate as positive .
recently , the high representative has been at loggerheads with the prime minister of the republika srpska , milorad dodik .
last month , the rs assembly passed a resolution demanding , among other things , that inzko transfer a package of powers to it from the central bosnian government .
after weeks of consultations , the high representative revoked the resolution , arguing that it violated the dayton agreement . pressure to leave it 's not surprising then , that the serbs want to see the office of the high representative shut down , sooner rather than later .
speaking to reporters in the republika srpska capital , banja luka , before the resolution was revoked , prime minister dodik said he was n't convinced that the office of the high representative was working in the best interests of the republika srbska .
“ by and large the office of the high representative -lrb- ohr -rrb- has employed a few international representatives , but most were local staff , mainly from the federation side , from sarajevo .
these people have created ill-feelings towards the republika srpska . ”
as with so many issues in bosnia , republika srpska and federation politicians are divided on this issue .
federation leaders say the country does n't have strong enough central institutions to close down the ohr .
haris silajdzic , the bosniak member of the bosnian presidency told reporters that he would do what he could to ensure that the ohr remains beyond the end of this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haris silajdzic says it is too early for the ohr to close up shop but he also conceded that there seemed to be an international political consensus that now was the time to pull the plug on the ohr , leaving only a non-executive european union special representative in its place .
despite dayton 's and bosnia 's flaws , the fact that the country has been at peace for more than 13 years is a considerable achievement in itself .
unemployment is high , but the cafes in both sarajevo and banja luka are full .
as one opposition politician in republika srpska put it : “ we do n't like each other very much , but at least we are not killing each other on the basis of our ethnic groups anymore .
we do n't have the most beautiful democracy in the world , but it 's not that bad . ” author : chuck penfold editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the trade situation of developing countries in the economic crisis will be top of the agenda . give developing countries the tools to improve their position as trade partners and both their own development and the international trade situation will also improve .
that 's the idea behind " aid for trade , " which the wto launched in hong kong four years ago , wto director general pascal lamy tells deutsche welle .
" developing countries very often face trade barriers , which either stem from their own infrastructure - for example roadways , transport or energy - or they face technical trade barriers , for example if someone wants to export flowers to the us or to europe he will have to meet the maximum pesticide residue standard , " he says .
africa , more so than any other continent , faces these kinds of problems as it tries to increase its trade capacity .
and to make matter worse , lamy says , africa has seen a decrease in participation in international trade over the last 10 years .
" in absolute value african trade has grown , but in relative value , as compared to the whole world trade , it has decreased , " he explains .
" the fundamental point for africa is , one , trying to diversify exports to meet international demand , and , two , making sure that inter-african trade grows .
at the moment the trade between african countries is incredibly low . "
lamy underlines that international trade accounts for around 15 percent of economic activity in europe and the us , but three to four times as much in africa .
" hence the enormous importance of keeping trade open during the crisis , which means fighting protectionism , because that would hit developing countries most .
and then , keeping investment in the future so they can trade their way out of the crisis . "
downward spiral bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more trade with the eu and within africa will make a difference the ongoing international economic crisis has hit africa in particular , dr. mohammed ibn chambas tells deutsche welle .
chambas is executive secretary of ecowas , the economic community of west african states .
he explains the downward spiral : the shrinking global economy leads to lower demand for commodities from west africa and africa as a whole .
lower demand also means lower prices .
but there is more : " the strong global growth led to 5 percent growth in africa in the year preceding the crisis , " he says .
" the slowdown has of course led to a reduced african growth rate .
we will end 2009 at less than 3 percent .
that is not good because it 's very close to the population growth rate .
" secondly the transfer of funds from african diasporas is also invested in many activities for expanding trade , export trade in particular .
and all of this has obviously now been reduced . "
chambas says he is also worried that donor countries may reduce their support for the aid for trade program because of the crisis .
" of course aid for trade funding is dependant on support of the economies of the developed countries .
and now that these economies are under stress and in recession , naturally there is likely to be a shuffle in the promised resources .
these are legitimate concerns that we have on the african side , that not all the pledges that have been made will be provided . "
european responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without trade , illegal immigration will continue chambas says europe has a special duty to increase its aid to africa .
" the bulk of african trade is with europe .
we believe that the partnership between europe and africa should translate into concrete support for africa to reduce the impact of the global crisis , " he says .
" it 's a historic relationship that we can not wish away and i believe that in the context of this new partnership we should see how we can work together , europe and africa , to overcome the current economic slowdown . "
john clancy , spokesman for european commissioner for development and humanitarian aid louis michel , says europe 's history with africa is unique , and that the focus should be on measures to improve that relationship .
" i think what is important is not to look backward to the past , but to the present day and the future .
aid for trade is about partnership .
it is a complimentary aspect to assisting developing countries , those in africa in particular .
it should soften , to some extent , the changes that have to take place at a socio-economic level in these countries , so that they can profit from the global marketplace more than before . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de tennis -pipe- 05.07.2009 germany vs. the us in 1937 : the " greatest tennis match ever played " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gottfried von cramm -lrb- right -rrb- embodied the nazi aryan ideal .
at sunday 's historic wimbledon , roger federer broke the grand slam record .
but the personal stakes at the 1937 germany-us davis cup duel were higher for german baron gottfried von cramm : he was playing for his life . " a terrible splendor : three extraordinary men , a world poised for war and the greatest tennis match ever played " tells the story of tennis champion gottfried von cramm , who had been secretly gay in hitler 's germany and his opponent don budge , who was the top ranked us player .
it is also the story of von cramm 's gay american coach bill tilden , who was training the nazi german team against his own country in a decisive davis cup match in 1937 .
deutsche welle spoke to marshall jon fisher , the author of the newly released book . deutsche welle : why was gottfried von cramm so popular with the crowds ?
and why was he so important to the nazi leadership ?
marshall jon fisher : von cramm was a remarkable character .
he was gracious , famous for his sportsmanship and from a noble background , but did n't act that way at all .
he was tall , very handsome , very germanic-looking - blond , blue-eyed - the nazis were holding him up as the perfect model of the aryan athlete .
the nazi officials were of course very interested in using sports figures as propaganda tools , such as -lrb- boxing legend -rrb- max schmeling .
-lrb- nazi propaganda minister joseph -rrb- goebbels made a big deal out of the 1936 berlin olympics and declared it a triumph for germany , so the davis cup could have served similar purposes for him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's nadal ended federer 's wimbledon winning streak last year there have been a few other " greatest matches ever " on centre court at wimbledon - the epic bjorn borg - john mcenroe duel in 1980 and the stunning marathon between roger federer and rafael nadal last year .
what makes budge vs. von cramm , the " greatest match ever " ?
borg-mcenroe and federer-nadal were incredible tennis matches , but what was at stake really , except which multi-millionaire would get to hold up the trophy afterwards ?
it was just tennis .
but in the von cramm-budge case , it was about winning the davis cup , which meant playing for their nation 's glory .
there were also the personal stakes for von cramm - he was playing for his life at a time when the winds of war were building up .
he was also playing for a regime which he loathed .
it turned out that gottfried von cramm was a gay man playing for a government that was executing people like him .
he had of course been followed by the gestapo .
they had a big file on him .
his lover was jewish .
his wife - he had married a childhood friend - was one-quarter jewish .
the gestapo had made it clear to him that as long as he kept winning and that germany had a chance to win the davis cup with him , he would be safe .
but if things did n't go too well with him on the tennis court , that might not be the case .
there was quite an amazing amount of pressure on him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von cramm was secretly gay , but married barbara hutton .
how did the match go ?
this 1937 davis cup match was supposed to be a walk away for don budge , who had destroyed von cramm two weeks earlier at the wimbledon final in three straight sets , so everyone thought budge was going to win this match easily and the americans would win the davis cup , but von cramm just played stupendous tennis .
von cramm won the first two sets .
budge came back and won the second two sets .
in the decisive fifth set , von cramm was up 4 to 1 .
at this point everyone thought von cramm was going to win , but budge comes back again and it goes past 6-6 .
i 'd rather not give away the ending , but it turned into a remarkable fifth set .
so what happened to von cramm after the match ?
it was inevitable that no matter what happened in the match , von cramm was going to run into trouble in germany .
when he travelled around the world , he became more and more outspoken against the nazis and upon returning home from his travels in 1938 , he was arrested and sentenced to prison for homosexual acts .
now he got off a bit easy due to some good connections he had .
most homosexuals were going to the camps , but he simply went to prison in berlin for less than a year .
was it generally known that von cramm was homosexual ?
other players did know , but it was not publicly known even after the war when von cramm played the davis cup for west germany .
with -lrb- von cramm 's american coach -rrb- bill tilden , people knew .
he was not quite as dignified as von cramm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us champ bill tilden coached germany 's davis cup team regarding bill tilden - it 's very common nowadays for the coach of a national team to be foreign .
we see that a lot in international soccer .
but on the eve of world war ii , what tilden did , appears treacherous .
it was extraordinary , but not because tilden was a foreigner .
" big bill " tilden completely dominated the tennis world throughout the 1920s and kept the davis cup in the united states almost single-handedly .
he was also a gay man when one could n't talk about such things .
it was amazing the nazis hired not only an american , but a gay american to coach their davis cup team .
how did tilden , an american tennis idol , wind up coaching the nazi german team , of all teams ?
tilden had wanted to coach the americans for years , even offering to do it for free , but they turned him down every year , presumably because they were afraid of some scandal due to his homosexuality .
so when the germans finally gave him an offer , he was happy to take it . tennis today is an individual sport , you play for yourself rather than for your country and it 's the grand slam tournaments - the us , french , australian open and wimbledon of course - that are important .
could you explain the significance of the davis cup back then ?
well of course , we still have the davis cup , but it was much more significant back then .
all the big international tournaments then were also only open to amateurs .
tennis was much bigger in the sports world back then and the davis cup was even bigger than wimbledon .
the pro era in tennis began in 1968 .
gottfried von cramm survived the war , married woolworth heiress barbara hutton in the 1950s and became a successful cotton importer .
he died in a car accident on a business trip in egypt in 1976 .
bill tilden tried to pursue an acting career in hollywood , but served prison time for homosexual acts after the war .
because of his convictions , he was shunned from playing and teaching tennis .
he died of a stroke in 1953 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 05.07.2009 german fm steinmeier kicks off middle east tour großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has a tough diplomatic schedule ahead foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has landed in israel to begin a whirlwind trip to the middle east .
it comes as israeli premier benjamin netanyahu has referred to a ' ' two-state solution " for the first time . the aim of minister frank-walter steinmeier 's two-day trip is to jumpstart the dormant peace process .
on monday , he is to hold talks with israeli president shimon peres , prime minister benyamin netanyahu , and foreign minister avigdor lieberman in jerusalem .
he will also visit lebanon and syria .
steinmeier has been among world leaders who have criticized israeli settlement building programs in east jerusalem and the west bank .
thus far , netanyahu 's government had refused to freeze settlement activities and had not agreed to a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu is known for his tough stance on the palestinian issue however , on sunday , netanyahu referred for the first time to a " two-state solution " to bring peace to the middle east .
" we have achieved a national agreement on the formula of two states for two peoples , " the israeli prime minister said during the weekly cabinet meeting .
steinmeier is expected to pay a visit to the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem on monday .
media reports said that a meeting planned with palestinian president mahmoud abbas in the west bank town of ramallah was not likely to take place , because abbas is visiting jordan for talks on forming a palestinian unity government with the rival hamas movement .
support for us efforts it will be steinmeier 's 14th trip to the region since becoming germany 's foreign minister in 2005 .
it involves an exacting schedule , covering nearly 6,500 kilometers and four countries in just 36 hours .
the whirlwind tour of the middle east is meant to lend impetus to germany 's desire for peace in the region as soon as possible , according to a foreign ministry spokesman in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the obama administration wants to reinvigorate the peace process " we have had new momentum in the middle east peace process since the new government took office in washington and we support its fresh efforts to reach a two-state solution and a return to negotiations , " said andreas peschke ahead of steinmeier 's trip .
peschke added that berlin was pursuing a middle east policy focused on practical assistance on the ground , including development assistance for the palestinians and training for security forces in the territories to help prepare for eventual statehood .
during his visit to the west bank on monday , steinmeier will assess the progress of such projects .
the foreign ministry spokesman said that germany 's engagement in the region was determined in consultation with its european partners and the government of us president barack obama .
the new administration in washington consulted berlin in the conceptual stages of the reorientation of its middle east policy . in a further reflection of the ongoing efforts to harmonize international peace efforts in the region , steinmeier held intensive discussions via telephone with his american counterpart hillary clinton and the us the middle east mediator george mitchell , prior to his middle east trip .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syrian president assad has been engaging the international community neighbors have crucial role german officials said steinmeier hoped to persuade neighboring arab states to play a more active role in diplomatic efforts to end the israeli-palestinian conflict .
acknowledging the crucial role of the neighbors in any peace process , foreign ministry spokesman andreas peschke said that germany saw several rays of hope in the region , including last month 's peaceful elections in lebanon and improved relations between lebanon and syria .
he added that all these factors presented a " window of opportunity . "
in light of these developments , steinmeier will also travel to damascus for talks with his syrian counterpart wali al-muallem and president bashar al-assad .
in the past , steinmeier , who is set to challenge chancellor angela merkel in september 's general election , faced criticism from the chancellery and the us administration for his efforts to engage syria .
however , the obama administration has dramatically softened washington 's stance towards damascus .
and this week , the us announced that it would send an ambassador back to damascus after a four-year gap .
the move comes amid a region-wide campaign to lay the groundwork for middle east peace .
in response , president assad invited obama to visit syria .
when he travels to the lebanese capital beirut , steinmeier will become the first western politician to meet prime minister-designate saad hariri , the son of former premier rafik hariri , who was killed in a bomb blast in 2005 .
hariri 's pro-western alliance won last month 's general elections .
some observers say germany is aware that it does not have the influence to broker middle east peace on its own , but that steinmeier clearly wants to be part of the obama administration 's efforts in that direction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : settlement activity in the occupied territories is a point of contention issue on g8 agenda the trip comes ahead of next week 's g8 summit in italy .
chancellor merkel indicated last week that the middle east conflict would figure prominently in those talks .
she said " concessions from all sides were necessary , " for the peace process to succeed .
calling for a halt to the construction of israeli settlements , merkel said " there has to be a freeze .
otherwise i am convinced we will not achieve the two-state solution that we urgently need - a jewish state of israel and a palestinian state that can live in security .

the statements " i never doped !
and i will never resort to doping ! " were clearly visible together with saturday 's date and pechstein 's signature . " there is no positive test .
i was banned on very shaky circumstantial evidence .
i ca n't help those who do n't believe me , but my conscience is clear , " pechstein said in an interview which the tabloid printed under the title " liar or victim ? " . asked why she had not made any public comments on the case when the sport 's ruling body , the isu , first informed her of the blood sample irregularities in february , pechstein responded that it was very difficult to get rid of the doping stigma once things were made public .
while apologizing for not coming clean with public at the time , pechstein offered a potential explanation for the irregularities of the blood samples . " there was an independent expert involved in my case who said it was possible i may have a blood disorder , " said pechstein . " close to blackmail " pechstein also told bild am sonntag that the isu had exerted strong pressure on her to make a split second decision to pull out of world championship competitions to avoid public scandal , adding that this experience came close to blackmail . pechstein also stepped up her media campaign against the doping ruling by appearing in a well-known german sports show on public broadcaster zdf on saturday , where she adamantly refuted all doping claims brought against her . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pechstein has won numerous speed skating medals for germany the isu handed pechstein a two-year ban for blood doping on july 3 . the isu said on its website on friday that it had found pechstein guilty of " the prohibited method of blood doping " from evidence gathered through the 37-year-old 's blood sample . pechstein is germany 's most successful winter olympian , having won nine medals overall – five of them gold – between 1992 and 2006 .
she is also a six-time world champion , with another 20 silver and eight bronze world championship medals to her credit . the isu said its decision was " based on the evidence of ms pechstein 's -lrb- sample -rrb- which included abnormal values and abnormal changes of values in a series of tests -lrb- in particular in the tests conducted during the essent isu world allround championships held in hamar on february 7-8 , 2009 -rrb- . " the two-year ban , which expires on february 8 , 2011 , means pechstein will miss the 2010 winter olympics in vancouver and , given her age , may even end her career .
the isu said pechstein had chosen to appeal against the ban before the court of arbitration for sport . nk / dfm / dpa / ap / sid / bams editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? dw-tv europe live global 3000 - the globalization program we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sofia 's mayor boiko borisov has taken the prize exit polls by sova harris and alpha research suggested gerb would take between 115 and 117 seats in the 240-strong chamber , compared with 39 to 42 seats for the ruling socialists . if the exit polls are confirmed , there may be a hung parliament : both gerb and the socialists will need more than one ally to form a governing coalition . " we 'll wait and see what the final results are , and the distribution of parliamentary seats .
then we 'll analyse our options , " borisov said . potential partners although borisov and stanishev have been tight-lipped about potential coalition partners , both men have reportedly rejected a left-right alliance .
they have also ruled out a coalition with the ultra nationalist ataka party , which took 8.8-9.2 percent of sunday 's vote , according to the exit polls . gerb 's most likely partner , the blue coalition of two small udf and dsb parties , reportedly secured 7.5-8.2 percent of votes . the turkish minority mrf party - the socialists ' current junior coalition partner - was credited with 11.3-13.5 percent . smaller parties such as the centrist nmsp of former king simeon saxe coburg , the nationalist olj party or the business formation lider could play a crucial role in forming the next government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist leader sergey stanishev is not smiling now " the most important thing now is an anti-crisis programme and cracking down on political corruption , " said martin dimitrov , the co-leader of the rightist blue coalition . the current government under sergey stanishev , which led bulgaria to eu membership in 2007 , has come under strong pressure from brussels to fight the country 's endemic corruption and organized crime . as a result , it did not come as a surprise that sunday 's election was marred by allegations of irregularities , particularly vote buying . with official results expected on monday , coalition talks could drag on for months and observers have voiced concern about a political impasse at a time when the economic crisis is expected to peak in bulgaria . some analysts have warned that bulgaria may even be forced to turn to the international monetary fund for help , joining several of its neighbours in central and eastern europe including hungary , latvia , romania and serbia . nk / afp / reuters / dpa editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" as a uefa member , i would like to see it in europe but it is an open race as to which country might get it … there are a lot of different countries bidding .
let 's wait and see . "
he added however that " it will be europe 's turn -lrb- in 2018 -rrb- . "

the statements " i never doped !
and i will never resort to doping ! " were clearly visible together with saturday 's date and pechstein 's signature . " there is no positive test .
i was banned on very shaky circumstantial evidence .
i ca n't help those who do n't believe me , but my conscience is clear , " pechstein said in an interview which the tabloid printed under the title " liar or victim ? " . asked why she had not made any public comments on the case when the sport 's ruling body , the isu , first informed her of the blood sample irregularities in february , pechstein responded that it was very difficult to get rid of the doping stigma once things were made public .
while apologizing for not coming clean with public at the time , pechstein offered a potential explanation for the irregularities of the blood samples . " there was an independent expert involved in my case who said it was possible i may have a blood disorder , " said pechstein . " close to blackmail " pechstein also told bild am sonntag that the isu had exerted strong pressure on her to make a split second decision to pull out of world championship competitions to avoid public scandal , adding that this experience came close to blackmail . pechstein also stepped up her media campaign against the doping ruling by appearing in a well-known german sports show on public broadcaster zdf on saturday , where she adamantly refuted all doping claims brought against her . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pechstein has won numerous speed skating medals for germany the isu handed pechstein a two-year ban for blood doping on july 3 . the isu said on its website on friday that it had found pechstein guilty of " the prohibited method of blood doping " from evidence gathered through the 37-year-old 's blood sample . pechstein is germany 's most successful winter olympian , having won nine medals overall – five of them gold – between 1992 and 2006 .
she is also a six-time world champion , with another 20 silver and eight bronze world championship medals to her credit . the isu said its decision was " based on the evidence of ms pechstein 's -lrb- sample -rrb- which included abnormal values and abnormal changes of values in a series of tests -lrb- in particular in the tests conducted during the essent isu world allround championships held in hamar on february 7-8 , 2009 -rrb- . " the two-year ban , which expires on february 8 , 2011 , means pechstein will miss the 2010 winter olympics in vancouver and , given her age , may even end her career .
the isu said pechstein had chosen to appeal against the ban before the court of arbitration for sport . nk / dfm / dpa / ap / sid / bams editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? dw-tv europe live journal - nachrichten mit tagesthema we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 05.07.2009 financial crisis hits african trade , aid as wto gears up for summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trade is an important way of helping africa the world trade organization is preparing to review its aid for trade initiative at an international conference in geneva .
the trade situation of developing countries in the economic crisis will be top of the agenda . give developing countries the tools to improve their position as trade partners and both their own development and the international trade situation will also improve .
that 's the idea behind " aid for trade , " which the wto launched in hong kong four years ago , wto director general pascal lamy tells deutsche welle .
" developing countries very often face trade barriers , which either stem from their own infrastructure - for example roadways , transport or energy - or they face technical trade barriers , for example if someone wants to export flowers to the us or to europe he will have to meet the maximum pesticide residue standard , " he says .
africa , more so than any other continent , faces these kinds of problems as it tries to increase its trade capacity .
and to make matter worse , lamy says , africa has seen a decrease in participation in international trade over the last 10 years .
" in absolute value african trade has grown , but in relative value , as compared to the whole world trade , it has decreased , " he explains .
" the fundamental point for africa is , one , trying to diversify exports to meet international demand , and , two , making sure that inter-african trade grows .
at the moment the trade between african countries is incredibly low . "
lamy underlines that international trade accounts for around 15 percent of economic activity in europe and the us , but three to four times as much in africa .
" hence the enormous importance of keeping trade open during the crisis , which means fighting protectionism , because that would hit developing countries most .
and then , keeping investment in the future so they can trade their way out of the crisis . "
downward spiral bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more trade with the eu and within africa will make a difference the ongoing international economic crisis has hit africa in particular , dr. mohammed ibn chambas tells deutsche welle .
chambas is executive secretary of ecowas , the economic community of west african states .
he explains the downward spiral : the shrinking global economy leads to lower demand for commodities from west africa and africa as a whole .
lower demand also means lower prices .
but there is more : " the strong global growth led to 5 percent growth in africa in the year preceding the crisis , " he says .
" the slowdown has of course led to a reduced african growth rate .
we will end 2009 at less than 3 percent .
that is not good because it 's very close to the population growth rate .
" secondly the transfer of funds from african diasporas is also invested in many activities for expanding trade , export trade in particular .
and all of this has obviously now been reduced . "
chambas says he is also worried that donor countries may reduce their support for the aid for trade program because of the crisis .
" of course aid for trade funding is dependant on support of the economies of the developed countries .
and now that these economies are under stress and in recession , naturally there is likely to be a shuffle in the promised resources .
these are legitimate concerns that we have on the african side , that not all the pledges that have been made will be provided . "
european responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without trade , illegal immigration will continue chambas says europe has a special duty to increase its aid to africa .
" the bulk of african trade is with europe .
we believe that the partnership between europe and africa should translate into concrete support for africa to reduce the impact of the global crisis , " he says .
" it 's a historic relationship that we can not wish away and i believe that in the context of this new partnership we should see how we can work together , europe and africa , to overcome the current economic slowdown . "
john clancy , spokesman for european commissioner for development and humanitarian aid louis michel , says europe 's history with africa is unique , and that the focus should be on measures to improve that relationship .
" i think what is important is not to look backward to the past , but to the present day and the future .
aid for trade is about partnership .
it is a complimentary aspect to assisting developing countries , those in africa in particular .
it should soften , to some extent , the changes that have to take place at a socio-economic level in these countries , so that they can profit from the global marketplace more than before . "

" developing countries very often face trade barriers , which either stem from their own infrastructure - for example roadways , transport or energy - or they face technical trade barriers , for example if someone wants to export flowers to the us or to europe he will have to meet the maximum pesticide residue standard , " he says .
africa , more so than any other continent , faces these kinds of problems as it tries to increase its trade capacity .
and to make matter worse , lamy says , africa has seen a decrease in participation in international trade over the last 10 years .
" in absolute value african trade has grown , but in relative value , as compared to the whole world trade , it has decreased , " he explains .
" the fundamental point for africa is , one , trying to diversify exports to meet international demand , and , two , making sure that inter-african trade grows .
at the moment the trade between african countries is incredibly low . "
lamy underlines that international trade accounts for around 15 percent of economic activity in europe and the us , but three to four times as much in africa .
" hence the enormous importance of keeping trade open during the crisis , which means fighting protectionism , because that would hit developing countries most .
and then , keeping investment in the future so they can trade their way out of the crisis . "
downward spiral bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more trade with the eu and within africa will make a difference the ongoing international economic crisis has hit africa in particular , dr. mohammed ibn chambas tells deutsche welle .
chambas is executive secretary of ecowas , the economic community of west african states .
he explains the downward spiral : the shrinking global economy leads to lower demand for commodities from west africa and africa as a whole .
lower demand also means lower prices .
but there is more : " the strong global growth led to 5 percent growth in africa in the year preceding the crisis , " he says .
" the slowdown has of course led to a reduced african growth rate .
we will end 2009 at less than 3 percent .
that is not good because it 's very close to the population growth rate .
" secondly the transfer of funds from african diasporas is also invested in many activities for expanding trade , export trade in particular .
and all of this has obviously now been reduced . "
chambas says he is also worried that donor countries may reduce their support for the aid for trade program because of the crisis .
" of course aid for trade funding is dependant on support of the economies of the developed countries .
and now that these economies are under stress and in recession , naturally there is likely to be a shuffle in the promised resources .
these are legitimate concerns that we have on the african side , that not all the pledges that have been made will be provided . "
european responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without trade , illegal immigration will continue chambas says europe has a special duty to increase its aid to africa .
" the bulk of african trade is with europe .
we believe that the partnership between europe and africa should translate into concrete support for africa to reduce the impact of the global crisis , " he says .
" it 's a historic relationship that we can not wish away and i believe that in the context of this new partnership we should see how we can work together , europe and africa , to overcome the current economic slowdown . "
john clancy , spokesman for european commissioner for development and humanitarian aid louis michel , says europe 's history with africa is unique , and that the focus should be on measures to improve that relationship .
" i think what is important is not to look backward to the past , but to the present day and the future .
aid for trade is about partnership .
it is a complimentary aspect to assisting developing countries , those in africa in particular .
it should soften , to some extent , the changes that have to take place at a socio-economic level in these countries , so that they can profit from the global marketplace more than before . "

" as a uefa member , i would like to see it in europe but it is an open race as to which country might get it … there are a lot of different countries bidding .
let 's wait and see . "
he added however that " it will be europe 's turn -lrb- in 2018 -rrb- . "
beckenbauer , known as " der kaiser " for his legendary playing and coaching achievements , sits on governing body fifa 's 24-member executive committee that is charged with voting on which countries host the world cup every four years .
in december next year , the committee will decide the hosts of both the 2018 and 2022 world cups simultaneously , with bidding countries from the winning continent for the 2018 tourney becoming ineligible for the following tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england last hosted a world cup in 1966 the four european bids - england , russia and two joint bids from belgium-netherlands and portugal-spain - are joined by bids from asian football confederation -lrb- afc -rrb- members australia , japan and indonesia - afc members south korea and qatar are bidding only for 2022 - and from mexico and the united states , which belong to concacaf , the soccer body for north and central america and the caribbean .
the 2010 world cup will be hosted by south africa , while brazil will hold the 2014 edition of the tournament .
beckenbauer added that if the 2018 world cup was awarded to a european country , then a country like australia could be a strong contender for the 2022 event .
" i think they have a good chance because the world cup 's never been to australia , " he said .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sofia 's mayor boiko borisov has taken the prize exit polls by sova harris and alpha research suggested gerb would take between 115 and 117 seats in the 240-strong chamber , compared with 39 to 42 seats for the ruling socialists . if the exit polls are confirmed , there may be a hung parliament : both gerb and the socialists will need more than one ally to form a governing coalition . " we 'll wait and see what the final results are , and the distribution of parliamentary seats .
then we 'll analyse our options , " borisov said . potential partners although borisov and stanishev have been tight-lipped about potential coalition partners , both men have reportedly rejected a left-right alliance .
they have also ruled out a coalition with the ultra nationalist ataka party , which took 8.8-9.2 percent of sunday 's vote , according to the exit polls . gerb 's most likely partner , the blue coalition of two small udf and dsb parties , reportedly secured 7.5-8.2 percent of votes . the turkish minority mrf party - the socialists ' current junior coalition partner - was credited with 11.3-13.5 percent . smaller parties such as the centrist nmsp of former king simeon saxe coburg , the nationalist olj party or the business formation lider could play a crucial role in forming the next government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist leader sergey stanishev is not smiling now " the most important thing now is an anti-crisis programme and cracking down on political corruption , " said martin dimitrov , the co-leader of the rightist blue coalition . the current government under sergey stanishev , which led bulgaria to eu membership in 2007 , has come under strong pressure from brussels to fight the country 's endemic corruption and organized crime . as a result , it did not come as a surprise that sunday 's election was marred by allegations of irregularities , particularly vote buying . with official results expected on monday , coalition talks could drag on for months and observers have voiced concern about a political impasse at a time when the economic crisis is expected to peak in bulgaria . some analysts have warned that bulgaria may even be forced to turn to the international monetary fund for help , joining several of its neighbours in central and eastern europe including hungary , latvia , romania and serbia . nk / afp / reuters / dpa editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.07.2009 normality comes in small doses in bosnia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instead of scenes of war , sarajevo today is characterized by a fragile peace more than 13 years after the dayton accord was signed , ending the bosnia 's inter-ethnic conflict in 1995 , the balkan country remains a very divided place . while peace and security have long since been established , few of those displaced during the three-year war have returned to homes in areas where their ethnic group is not in the majority .
despite this , there is a growing feeling among some people that it is time for the international community to step back , and hand over more responsibility for bosnia 's future to that country 's politicians .
the dayton accord that ended the bloodshed in bosnia-hercegovina in late 1995 is one of the few things that most bosnians can agree on .
they 'll tell you that it was successful in ending the war , but that it has been deficient when it comes to plotting a long-term path for the country 's future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it provided for the creation of a very weak central government , with the two entities , the bosniak / croat federation and the republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , wielding much of the legislative power .
this has led to divisions that had their roots in the 1992-95 war becoming formally ingrained during more than a decade of peace .
perhaps one of the most significant issues for the future of the country is the fact that children receive instruction in separate bosniak , serb or croat school systems .
seventy percent of the curriculum is set out by the state , with the remaining 30 percent left at the discretion of the schools .
croat high school student ante zelic explains that typically , these 30 percent are used for subjects like history or language instruction .
the students learn history , for example , from a croat point of view , or read two or three more novels by croatian authors than one would in other schools , says zelic .
while outsiders may think that this sort of division is the last thing that bosnian students need if the country is to grow more united in future , zelic does n't seem to see this as much of a problem .
his bosniak counterpart , adnan pripoljac , says the fact that students are divided in school is n't the point . “ i have my lessons in the morning and my croat colleagues go to classes in the afternoon .
but after school or in the evening we hang out together as usual .
most young people in bosnia do n't want to be separated , it 's just a political issue that has to be resolved . ”
practical problems while some politicians admit that the school situation is n't ideal , nobody seems to have a plan for integrating the educational systems .
a third student , dzeznan karic says there are practical considerations discouraging politicians from taking steps to change the status quo .
“ you have to realize that in every school there are , for example , two professors of geography , two professors of history , language , mathematics , physics , etc .
if they were to unite the school , this would leave one professor out of a job , and this is in nobody 's interest .
everyone is protecting their national interests .
why should a croat professor lose his job when there is also a bosniak professor who could lose his job ?
so it is a very political matter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valentin inzko hopes to be bosnia 's last high representative not even the international community 's special representative in bosnia has the answer .
the high representative still holds absolute power in this country , to be used to do whatever it takes to ensure that the provisions of the dayton accord are complied with .
this includes the power to revoke legislation or even remove politicians from office .
valentin inzko , the seventh person to hold this post , hopes he will be bosnia 's last high representative .
he recently told reporters in sarajevo that he hoped a decision would be taken in october , which would see the office of the high representative close at the end of this year .
“ i am moderately optimistic and i am doing everything in my power to ensure that this happens .
but the bosnians themselves also have to do something to improve the political climate , because -lrb- one -rrb- condition is a positive political climate and the implementation of dayton . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milorad dodik would like to seek the ohr close sooner rather than later it would be a stretch to describe the current political climate as positive .
recently , the high representative has been at loggerheads with the prime minister of the republika srpska , milorad dodik .
last month , the rs assembly passed a resolution demanding , among other things , that inzko transfer a package of powers to it from the central bosnian government .
after weeks of consultations , the high representative revoked the resolution , arguing that it violated the dayton agreement . pressure to leave it 's not surprising then , that the serbs want to see the office of the high representative shut down , sooner rather than later .
speaking to reporters in the republika srpska capital , banja luka , before the resolution was revoked , prime minister dodik said he was n't convinced that the office of the high representative was working in the best interests of the republika srbska .
“ by and large the office of the high representative -lrb- ohr -rrb- has employed a few international representatives , but most were local staff , mainly from the federation side , from sarajevo .
these people have created ill-feelings towards the republika srpska . ”
as with so many issues in bosnia , republika srpska and federation politicians are divided on this issue .
federation leaders say the country does n't have strong enough central institutions to close down the ohr .
haris silajdzic , the bosniak member of the bosnian presidency told reporters that he would do what he could to ensure that the ohr remains beyond the end of this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haris silajdzic says it is too early for the ohr to close up shop but he also conceded that there seemed to be an international political consensus that now was the time to pull the plug on the ohr , leaving only a non-executive european union special representative in its place .
despite dayton 's and bosnia 's flaws , the fact that the country has been at peace for more than 13 years is a considerable achievement in itself .
unemployment is high , but the cafes in both sarajevo and banja luka are full .
as one opposition politician in republika srpska put it : “ we do n't like each other very much , but at least we are not killing each other on the basis of our ethnic groups anymore .
we do n't have the most beautiful democracy in the world , but it 's not that bad . ” author : chuck penfold editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at sunday 's historic wimbledon , roger federer broke the grand slam record .
but the personal stakes at the 1937 germany-us davis cup duel were higher for german baron gottfried von cramm : he was playing for his life . " a terrible splendor : three extraordinary men , a world poised for war and the greatest tennis match ever played " tells the story of tennis champion gottfried von cramm , who had been secretly gay in hitler 's germany and his opponent don budge , who was the top ranked us player .
it is also the story of von cramm 's gay american coach bill tilden , who was training the nazi german team against his own country in a decisive davis cup match in 1937 .
deutsche welle spoke to marshall jon fisher , the author of the newly released book . deutsche welle : why was gottfried von cramm so popular with the crowds ?
and why was he so important to the nazi leadership ?
marshall jon fisher : von cramm was a remarkable character .
he was gracious , famous for his sportsmanship and from a noble background , but did n't act that way at all .
he was tall , very handsome , very germanic-looking - blond , blue-eyed - the nazis were holding him up as the perfect model of the aryan athlete .
the nazi officials were of course very interested in using sports figures as propaganda tools , such as -lrb- boxing legend -rrb- max schmeling .
-lrb- nazi propaganda minister joseph -rrb- goebbels made a big deal out of the 1936 berlin olympics and declared it a triumph for germany , so the davis cup could have served similar purposes for him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's nadal ended federer 's wimbledon winning streak last year there have been a few other " greatest matches ever " on centre court at wimbledon - the epic bjorn borg - john mcenroe duel in 1980 and the stunning marathon between roger federer and rafael nadal last year .
what makes budge vs. von cramm , the " greatest match ever " ?
borg-mcenroe and federer-nadal were incredible tennis matches , but what was at stake really , except which multi-millionaire would get to hold up the trophy afterwards ?
it was just tennis .
but in the von cramm-budge case , it was about winning the davis cup , which meant playing for their nation 's glory .
there were also the personal stakes for von cramm - he was playing for his life at a time when the winds of war were building up .
he was also playing for a regime which he loathed .
it turned out that gottfried von cramm was a gay man playing for a government that was executing people like him .
he had of course been followed by the gestapo .
they had a big file on him .
his lover was jewish .
his wife - he had married a childhood friend - was one-quarter jewish .
the gestapo had made it clear to him that as long as he kept winning and that germany had a chance to win the davis cup with him , he would be safe .
but if things did n't go too well with him on the tennis court , that might not be the case .
there was quite an amazing amount of pressure on him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von cramm was secretly gay , but married barbara hutton .
how did the match go ?
this 1937 davis cup match was supposed to be a walk away for don budge , who had destroyed von cramm two weeks earlier at the wimbledon final in three straight sets , so everyone thought budge was going to win this match easily and the americans would win the davis cup , but von cramm just played stupendous tennis .
von cramm won the first two sets .
budge came back and won the second two sets .
in the decisive fifth set , von cramm was up 4 to 1 .
at this point everyone thought von cramm was going to win , but budge comes back again and it goes past 6-6 .
i 'd rather not give away the ending , but it turned into a remarkable fifth set .
so what happened to von cramm after the match ?
it was inevitable that no matter what happened in the match , von cramm was going to run into trouble in germany .
when he travelled around the world , he became more and more outspoken against the nazis and upon returning home from his travels in 1938 , he was arrested and sentenced to prison for homosexual acts .
now he got off a bit easy due to some good connections he had .
most homosexuals were going to the camps , but he simply went to prison in berlin for less than a year .
was it generally known that von cramm was homosexual ?
other players did know , but it was not publicly known even after the war when von cramm played the davis cup for west germany .
with -lrb- von cramm 's american coach -rrb- bill tilden , people knew .
he was not quite as dignified as von cramm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us champ bill tilden coached germany 's davis cup team regarding bill tilden - it 's very common nowadays for the coach of a national team to be foreign .
we see that a lot in international soccer .
but on the eve of world war ii , what tilden did , appears treacherous .
it was extraordinary , but not because tilden was a foreigner .
" big bill " tilden completely dominated the tennis world throughout the 1920s and kept the davis cup in the united states almost single-handedly .
he was also a gay man when one could n't talk about such things .
it was amazing the nazis hired not only an american , but a gay american to coach their davis cup team .
how did tilden , an american tennis idol , wind up coaching the nazi german team , of all teams ?
tilden had wanted to coach the americans for years , even offering to do it for free , but they turned him down every year , presumably because they were afraid of some scandal due to his homosexuality .
so when the germans finally gave him an offer , he was happy to take it . tennis today is an individual sport , you play for yourself rather than for your country and it 's the grand slam tournaments - the us , french , australian open and wimbledon of course - that are important .
could you explain the significance of the davis cup back then ?
well of course , we still have the davis cup , but it was much more significant back then .
all the big international tournaments then were also only open to amateurs .
tennis was much bigger in the sports world back then and the davis cup was even bigger than wimbledon .
the pro era in tennis began in 1968 .
gottfried von cramm survived the war , married woolworth heiress barbara hutton in the 1950s and became a successful cotton importer .
he died in a car accident on a business trip in egypt in 1976 .
bill tilden tried to pursue an acting career in hollywood , but served prison time for homosexual acts after the war .
because of his convictions , he was shunned from playing and teaching tennis .
he died of a stroke in 1953 .

the ruling socialist party is predicted to do badly , with corruption allegations largely to blame . the parliamentary election campaign in bulgaria has been a fierce one .
the ruling socialist party has attacked the opposition center-right gerb in particularly vicious television advertisements .
a few weeks before the election , the government also changed voting rights in its favour .
this could be a last-ditch attempt to stay in power , with opinion polls predicting a change . bulgaria is currently governed by a coalition made up of prime minister sergei stanishev 's socialist party and two junior partners : the movement for rights and freedom , a party representing bulgaria 's turkish minority ; and the national movement formed by the former tsar of bulgaria .
many bulgarians blame the coalition for the country 's widespread corruption , the misappropriation of millions in aid money from the european union , and the ire of brussels .
these are the factors that will likely see voters turn away from the governing parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarians are some of the poorest people in the eu " the new government will probably try to send a few high-profile people to prison as a result of corruption allegations , " says georgi ganev , an economist at sofia 's centre for liberal strategies .
" that 's why the election campaign has been fought so hard . " 50 euros for a vote but corruption in bulgaria may have even entered the ballot booth .
during the recent european parliamentary elections , there were allegations that voters were bought on a large scale .
watchdogs are concerned that this type of manipulation may continue in the national election .
tihomir beslov from bulgaria 's centre for democratic research says votes can be bought for between 50 and 150 euros .
he says that kind of money can support a family in one of bulgaria 's poorer regions for two or three months .
" an entire company 's employees could also be pressured by their bosses to vote for a particular party , " beslov says .
" for example , muslims would be forced to swear before allah that they would vote for the party representing the turkish minority . "
" bulgarians want justice " the party likely to win the most votes in sunday 's election is the center-right gerb , led by sofia mayor boyko borisov .
the party has promised to fight corruption , and gerb member maria nedelcheva recently told the european parliament that bulgarians wanted justice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boyko borisov only founded gerb a few years ago " they expect criminal convictions and they want criminal proceedings to finally be launched against those responsible , " nedelcheva said .
" we are determined to do that . "
but even gerb is not expected to win an outright majority .
experts believe that disillusioned bulgarians may not turn up to polling booths at all .
a recent opinion poll showed gerb grabbing just over 30 percent of the vote , while the ruling socialists are predicted to take just over 20 percent .
with no one party likely to win a majority , another coalition for bulgaria looks likely - talks that could drag on for months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 05.07.2009 bulgarians head to polls amid vote-buying allegations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allegations of vote-buying may overshadow bulgarian elections bulgarians are heading to the polls on sunday for the country 's first parliamentary election since joining the eu .
the ruling socialist party is predicted to do badly , with corruption allegations largely to blame . the parliamentary election campaign in bulgaria has been a fierce one .
the ruling socialist party has attacked the opposition center-right gerb in particularly vicious television advertisements .
a few weeks before the election , the government also changed voting rights in its favour .
this could be a last-ditch attempt to stay in power , with opinion polls predicting a change . bulgaria is currently governed by a coalition made up of prime minister sergei stanishev 's socialist party and two junior partners : the movement for rights and freedom , a party representing bulgaria 's turkish minority ; and the national movement formed by the former tsar of bulgaria .
many bulgarians blame the coalition for the country 's widespread corruption , the misappropriation of millions in aid money from the european union , and the ire of brussels .
these are the factors that will likely see voters turn away from the governing parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarians are some of the poorest people in the eu " the new government will probably try to send a few high-profile people to prison as a result of corruption allegations , " says georgi ganev , an economist at sofia 's centre for liberal strategies .
" that 's why the election campaign has been fought so hard . " 50 euros for a vote but corruption in bulgaria may have even entered the ballot booth .
during the recent european parliamentary elections , there were allegations that voters were bought on a large scale .
watchdogs are concerned that this type of manipulation may continue in the national election .
tihomir beslov from bulgaria 's centre for democratic research says votes can be bought for between 50 and 150 euros .
he says that kind of money can support a family in one of bulgaria 's poorer regions for two or three months .
" an entire company 's employees could also be pressured by their bosses to vote for a particular party , " beslov says .
" for example , muslims would be forced to swear before allah that they would vote for the party representing the turkish minority . "
" bulgarians want justice " the party likely to win the most votes in sunday 's election is the center-right gerb , led by sofia mayor boyko borisov .
the party has promised to fight corruption , and gerb member maria nedelcheva recently told the european parliament that bulgarians wanted justice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boyko borisov only founded gerb a few years ago " they expect criminal convictions and they want criminal proceedings to finally be launched against those responsible , " nedelcheva said .
" we are determined to do that . "
but even gerb is not expected to win an outright majority .
experts believe that disillusioned bulgarians may not turn up to polling booths at all .
a recent opinion poll showed gerb grabbing just over 30 percent of the vote , while the ruling socialists are predicted to take just over 20 percent .
with no one party likely to win a majority , another coalition for bulgaria looks likely - talks that could drag on for months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.07.2009 normality comes in small doses in bosnia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instead of scenes of war , sarajevo today is characterized by a fragile peace more than 13 years after the dayton accord was signed , ending the bosnia 's inter-ethnic conflict in 1995 , the balkan country remains a very divided place . while peace and security have long since been established , few of those displaced during the three-year war have returned to homes in areas where their ethnic group is not in the majority .
despite this , there is a growing feeling among some people that it is time for the international community to step back , and hand over more responsibility for bosnia 's future to that country 's politicians .
the dayton accord that ended the bloodshed in bosnia-hercegovina in late 1995 is one of the few things that most bosnians can agree on .
they 'll tell you that it was successful in ending the war , but that it has been deficient when it comes to plotting a long-term path for the country 's future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it provided for the creation of a very weak central government , with the two entities , the bosniak / croat federation and the republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , wielding much of the legislative power .
this has led to divisions that had their roots in the 1992-95 war becoming formally ingrained during more than a decade of peace .
perhaps one of the most significant issues for the future of the country is the fact that children receive instruction in separate bosniak , serb or croat school systems .
seventy percent of the curriculum is set out by the state , with the remaining 30 percent left at the discretion of the schools .
croat high school student ante zelic explains that typically , these 30 percent are used for subjects like history or language instruction .
the students learn history , for example , from a croat point of view , or read two or three more novels by croatian authors than one would in other schools , says zelic .
while outsiders may think that this sort of division is the last thing that bosnian students need if the country is to grow more united in future , zelic does n't seem to see this as much of a problem .
his bosniak counterpart , adnan pripoljac , says the fact that students are divided in school is n't the point . “ i have my lessons in the morning and my croat colleagues go to classes in the afternoon .
but after school or in the evening we hang out together as usual .
most young people in bosnia do n't want to be separated , it 's just a political issue that has to be resolved . ”
practical problems while some politicians admit that the school situation is n't ideal , nobody seems to have a plan for integrating the educational systems .
a third student , dzeznan karic says there are practical considerations discouraging politicians from taking steps to change the status quo .
“ you have to realize that in every school there are , for example , two professors of geography , two professors of history , language , mathematics , physics , etc .
if they were to unite the school , this would leave one professor out of a job , and this is in nobody 's interest .
everyone is protecting their national interests .
why should a croat professor lose his job when there is also a bosniak professor who could lose his job ?
so it is a very political matter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valentin inzko hopes to be bosnia 's last high representative not even the international community 's special representative in bosnia has the answer .
the high representative still holds absolute power in this country , to be used to do whatever it takes to ensure that the provisions of the dayton accord are complied with .
this includes the power to revoke legislation or even remove politicians from office .
valentin inzko , the seventh person to hold this post , hopes he will be bosnia 's last high representative .
he recently told reporters in sarajevo that he hoped a decision would be taken in october , which would see the office of the high representative close at the end of this year .
“ i am moderately optimistic and i am doing everything in my power to ensure that this happens .
but the bosnians themselves also have to do something to improve the political climate , because -lrb- one -rrb- condition is a positive political climate and the implementation of dayton . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milorad dodik would like to seek the ohr close sooner rather than later it would be a stretch to describe the current political climate as positive .
recently , the high representative has been at loggerheads with the prime minister of the republika srpska , milorad dodik .
last month , the rs assembly passed a resolution demanding , among other things , that inzko transfer a package of powers to it from the central bosnian government .
after weeks of consultations , the high representative revoked the resolution , arguing that it violated the dayton agreement . pressure to leave it 's not surprising then , that the serbs want to see the office of the high representative shut down , sooner rather than later .
speaking to reporters in the republika srpska capital , banja luka , before the resolution was revoked , prime minister dodik said he was n't convinced that the office of the high representative was working in the best interests of the republika srbska .
“ by and large the office of the high representative -lrb- ohr -rrb- has employed a few international representatives , but most were local staff , mainly from the federation side , from sarajevo .
these people have created ill-feelings towards the republika srpska . ”
as with so many issues in bosnia , republika srpska and federation politicians are divided on this issue .
federation leaders say the country does n't have strong enough central institutions to close down the ohr .
haris silajdzic , the bosniak member of the bosnian presidency told reporters that he would do what he could to ensure that the ohr remains beyond the end of this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haris silajdzic says it is too early for the ohr to close up shop but he also conceded that there seemed to be an international political consensus that now was the time to pull the plug on the ohr , leaving only a non-executive european union special representative in its place .
despite dayton 's and bosnia 's flaws , the fact that the country has been at peace for more than 13 years is a considerable achievement in itself .
unemployment is high , but the cafes in both sarajevo and banja luka are full .
as one opposition politician in republika srpska put it : “ we do n't like each other very much , but at least we are not killing each other on the basis of our ethnic groups anymore .
we do n't have the most beautiful democracy in the world , but it 's not that bad . ” author : chuck penfold editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at sunday 's historic wimbledon , roger federer broke the grand slam record .
but the personal stakes at the 1937 germany-us davis cup duel were higher for german baron gottfried von cramm : he was playing for his life . " a terrible splendor : three extraordinary men , a world poised for war and the greatest tennis match ever played " tells the story of tennis champion gottfried von cramm , who had been secretly gay in hitler 's germany and his opponent don budge , who was the top ranked us player .
it is also the story of von cramm 's gay american coach bill tilden , who was training the nazi german team against his own country in a decisive davis cup match in 1937 .
deutsche welle spoke to marshall jon fisher , the author of the newly released book . deutsche welle : why was gottfried von cramm so popular with the crowds ?
and why was he so important to the nazi leadership ?
marshall jon fisher : von cramm was a remarkable character .
he was gracious , famous for his sportsmanship and from a noble background , but did n't act that way at all .
he was tall , very handsome , very germanic-looking - blond , blue-eyed - the nazis were holding him up as the perfect model of the aryan athlete .
the nazi officials were of course very interested in using sports figures as propaganda tools , such as -lrb- boxing legend -rrb- max schmeling .
-lrb- nazi propaganda minister joseph -rrb- goebbels made a big deal out of the 1936 berlin olympics and declared it a triumph for germany , so the davis cup could have served similar purposes for him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's nadal ended federer 's wimbledon winning streak last year there have been a few other " greatest matches ever " on centre court at wimbledon - the epic bjorn borg - john mcenroe duel in 1980 and the stunning marathon between roger federer and rafael nadal last year .
what makes budge vs. von cramm , the " greatest match ever " ?
borg-mcenroe and federer-nadal were incredible tennis matches , but what was at stake really , except which multi-millionaire would get to hold up the trophy afterwards ?
it was just tennis .
but in the von cramm-budge case , it was about winning the davis cup , which meant playing for their nation 's glory .
there were also the personal stakes for von cramm - he was playing for his life at a time when the winds of war were building up .
he was also playing for a regime which he loathed .
it turned out that gottfried von cramm was a gay man playing for a government that was executing people like him .
he had of course been followed by the gestapo .
they had a big file on him .
his lover was jewish .
his wife - he had married a childhood friend - was one-quarter jewish .
the gestapo had made it clear to him that as long as he kept winning and that germany had a chance to win the davis cup with him , he would be safe .
but if things did n't go too well with him on the tennis court , that might not be the case .
there was quite an amazing amount of pressure on him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von cramm was secretly gay , but married barbara hutton .
how did the match go ?
this 1937 davis cup match was supposed to be a walk away for don budge , who had destroyed von cramm two weeks earlier at the wimbledon final in three straight sets , so everyone thought budge was going to win this match easily and the americans would win the davis cup , but von cramm just played stupendous tennis .
von cramm won the first two sets .
budge came back and won the second two sets .
in the decisive fifth set , von cramm was up 4 to 1 .
at this point everyone thought von cramm was going to win , but budge comes back again and it goes past 6-6 .
i 'd rather not give away the ending , but it turned into a remarkable fifth set .
so what happened to von cramm after the match ?
it was inevitable that no matter what happened in the match , von cramm was going to run into trouble in germany .
when he travelled around the world , he became more and more outspoken against the nazis and upon returning home from his travels in 1938 , he was arrested and sentenced to prison for homosexual acts .
now he got off a bit easy due to some good connections he had .
most homosexuals were going to the camps , but he simply went to prison in berlin for less than a year .
was it generally known that von cramm was homosexual ?
other players did know , but it was not publicly known even after the war when von cramm played the davis cup for west germany .
with -lrb- von cramm 's american coach -rrb- bill tilden , people knew .
he was not quite as dignified as von cramm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us champ bill tilden coached germany 's davis cup team regarding bill tilden - it 's very common nowadays for the coach of a national team to be foreign .
we see that a lot in international soccer .
but on the eve of world war ii , what tilden did , appears treacherous .
it was extraordinary , but not because tilden was a foreigner .
" big bill " tilden completely dominated the tennis world throughout the 1920s and kept the davis cup in the united states almost single-handedly .
he was also a gay man when one could n't talk about such things .
it was amazing the nazis hired not only an american , but a gay american to coach their davis cup team .
how did tilden , an american tennis idol , wind up coaching the nazi german team , of all teams ?
tilden had wanted to coach the americans for years , even offering to do it for free , but they turned him down every year , presumably because they were afraid of some scandal due to his homosexuality .
so when the germans finally gave him an offer , he was happy to take it . tennis today is an individual sport , you play for yourself rather than for your country and it 's the grand slam tournaments - the us , french , australian open and wimbledon of course - that are important .
could you explain the significance of the davis cup back then ?
well of course , we still have the davis cup , but it was much more significant back then .
all the big international tournaments then were also only open to amateurs .
tennis was much bigger in the sports world back then and the davis cup was even bigger than wimbledon .
the pro era in tennis began in 1968 .
gottfried von cramm survived the war , married woolworth heiress barbara hutton in the 1950s and became a successful cotton importer .
he died in a car accident on a business trip in egypt in 1976 .
bill tilden tried to pursue an acting career in hollywood , but served prison time for homosexual acts after the war .
because of his convictions , he was shunned from playing and teaching tennis .
he died of a stroke in 1953 .

at sunday 's historic wimbledon , roger federer broke the grand slam record .
but the personal stakes at the 1937 germany-us davis cup duel were higher for german baron gottfried von cramm : he was playing for his life . " a terrible splendor : three extraordinary men , a world poised for war and the greatest tennis match ever played " tells the story of tennis champion gottfried von cramm , who had been secretly gay in hitler 's germany and his opponent don budge , who was the top ranked us player .
it is also the story of von cramm 's gay american coach bill tilden , who was training the nazi german team against his own country in a decisive davis cup match in 1937 .
deutsche welle spoke to marshall jon fisher , the author of the newly released book . deutsche welle : why was gottfried von cramm so popular with the crowds ?
and why was he so important to the nazi leadership ?
marshall jon fisher : von cramm was a remarkable character .
he was gracious , famous for his sportsmanship and from a noble background , but did n't act that way at all .
he was tall , very handsome , very germanic-looking - blond , blue-eyed - the nazis were holding him up as the perfect model of the aryan athlete .
the nazi officials were of course very interested in using sports figures as propaganda tools , such as -lrb- boxing legend -rrb- max schmeling .
-lrb- nazi propaganda minister joseph -rrb- goebbels made a big deal out of the 1936 berlin olympics and declared it a triumph for germany , so the davis cup could have served similar purposes for him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's nadal ended federer 's wimbledon winning streak last year there have been a few other " greatest matches ever " on centre court at wimbledon - the epic bjorn borg - john mcenroe duel in 1980 and the stunning marathon between roger federer and rafael nadal last year .
what makes budge vs. von cramm , the " greatest match ever " ?
borg-mcenroe and federer-nadal were incredible tennis matches , but what was at stake really , except which multi-millionaire would get to hold up the trophy afterwards ?
it was just tennis .
but in the von cramm-budge case , it was about winning the davis cup , which meant playing for their nation 's glory .
there were also the personal stakes for von cramm - he was playing for his life at a time when the winds of war were building up .
he was also playing for a regime which he loathed .
it turned out that gottfried von cramm was a gay man playing for a government that was executing people like him .
he had of course been followed by the gestapo .
they had a big file on him .
his lover was jewish .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 05.07.2009 bulgarians head to polls amid vote-buying allegations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allegations of vote-buying may overshadow bulgarian elections bulgarians are heading to the polls on sunday for the country 's first parliamentary election since joining the eu .
the ruling socialist party is predicted to do badly , with corruption allegations largely to blame . the parliamentary election campaign in bulgaria has been a fierce one .
the ruling socialist party has attacked the opposition center-right gerb in particularly vicious television advertisements .
a few weeks before the election , the government also changed voting rights in its favour .
this could be a last-ditch attempt to stay in power , with opinion polls predicting a change . bulgaria is currently governed by a coalition made up of prime minister sergei stanishev 's socialist party and two junior partners : the movement for rights and freedom , a party representing bulgaria 's turkish minority ; and the national movement formed by the former tsar of bulgaria .
many bulgarians blame the coalition for the country 's widespread corruption , the misappropriation of millions in aid money from the european union , and the ire of brussels .
these are the factors that will likely see voters turn away from the governing parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarians are some of the poorest people in the eu " the new government will probably try to send a few high-profile people to prison as a result of corruption allegations , " says georgi ganev , an economist at sofia 's centre for liberal strategies .
" that 's why the election campaign has been fought so hard . " 50 euros for a vote but corruption in bulgaria may have even entered the ballot booth .
during the recent european parliamentary elections , there were allegations that voters were bought on a large scale .
watchdogs are concerned that this type of manipulation may continue in the national election .
tihomir beslov from bulgaria 's centre for democratic research says votes can be bought for between 50 and 150 euros .
he says that kind of money can support a family in one of bulgaria 's poorer regions for two or three months .
" an entire company 's employees could also be pressured by their bosses to vote for a particular party , " beslov says .
" for example , muslims would be forced to swear before allah that they would vote for the party representing the turkish minority . "
" bulgarians want justice " the party likely to win the most votes in sunday 's election is the center-right gerb , led by sofia mayor boyko borisov .
the party has promised to fight corruption , and gerb member maria nedelcheva recently told the european parliament that bulgarians wanted justice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boyko borisov only founded gerb a few years ago " they expect criminal convictions and they want criminal proceedings to finally be launched against those responsible , " nedelcheva said .
" we are determined to do that . "
but even gerb is not expected to win an outright majority .
experts believe that disillusioned bulgarians may not turn up to polling booths at all .
a recent opinion poll showed gerb grabbing just over 30 percent of the vote , while the ruling socialists are predicted to take just over 20 percent .
with no one party likely to win a majority , another coalition for bulgaria looks likely - talks that could drag on for months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.07.2009 normality comes in small doses in bosnia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instead of scenes of war , sarajevo today is characterized by a fragile peace more than 13 years after the dayton accord was signed , ending the bosnia 's inter-ethnic conflict in 1995 , the balkan country remains a very divided place . while peace and security have long since been established , few of those displaced during the three-year war have returned to homes in areas where their ethnic group is not in the majority .
despite this , there is a growing feeling among some people that it is time for the international community to step back , and hand over more responsibility for bosnia 's future to that country 's politicians .
the dayton accord that ended the bloodshed in bosnia-hercegovina in late 1995 is one of the few things that most bosnians can agree on .
they 'll tell you that it was successful in ending the war , but that it has been deficient when it comes to plotting a long-term path for the country 's future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it provided for the creation of a very weak central government , with the two entities , the bosniak / croat federation and the republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , wielding much of the legislative power .
this has led to divisions that had their roots in the 1992-95 war becoming formally ingrained during more than a decade of peace .
perhaps one of the most significant issues for the future of the country is the fact that children receive instruction in separate bosniak , serb or croat school systems .
seventy percent of the curriculum is set out by the state , with the remaining 30 percent left at the discretion of the schools .
croat high school student ante zelic explains that typically , these 30 percent are used for subjects like history or language instruction .
the students learn history , for example , from a croat point of view , or read two or three more novels by croatian authors than one would in other schools , says zelic .
while outsiders may think that this sort of division is the last thing that bosnian students need if the country is to grow more united in future , zelic does n't seem to see this as much of a problem .
his bosniak counterpart , adnan pripoljac , says the fact that students are divided in school is n't the point . “ i have my lessons in the morning and my croat colleagues go to classes in the afternoon .
but after school or in the evening we hang out together as usual .
most young people in bosnia do n't want to be separated , it 's just a political issue that has to be resolved . ”
practical problems while some politicians admit that the school situation is n't ideal , nobody seems to have a plan for integrating the educational systems .
a third student , dzeznan karic says there are practical considerations discouraging politicians from taking steps to change the status quo .
“ you have to realize that in every school there are , for example , two professors of geography , two professors of history , language , mathematics , physics , etc .
if they were to unite the school , this would leave one professor out of a job , and this is in nobody 's interest .
everyone is protecting their national interests .
why should a croat professor lose his job when there is also a bosniak professor who could lose his job ?
so it is a very political matter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valentin inzko hopes to be bosnia 's last high representative not even the international community 's special representative in bosnia has the answer .
the high representative still holds absolute power in this country , to be used to do whatever it takes to ensure that the provisions of the dayton accord are complied with .
this includes the power to revoke legislation or even remove politicians from office .
valentin inzko , the seventh person to hold this post , hopes he will be bosnia 's last high representative .
he recently told reporters in sarajevo that he hoped a decision would be taken in october , which would see the office of the high representative close at the end of this year .
“ i am moderately optimistic and i am doing everything in my power to ensure that this happens .
but the bosnians themselves also have to do something to improve the political climate , because -lrb- one -rrb- condition is a positive political climate and the implementation of dayton . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milorad dodik would like to seek the ohr close sooner rather than later it would be a stretch to describe the current political climate as positive .
recently , the high representative has been at loggerheads with the prime minister of the republika srpska , milorad dodik .
last month , the rs assembly passed a resolution demanding , among other things , that inzko transfer a package of powers to it from the central bosnian government .
after weeks of consultations , the high representative revoked the resolution , arguing that it violated the dayton agreement . pressure to leave it 's not surprising then , that the serbs want to see the office of the high representative shut down , sooner rather than later .
speaking to reporters in the republika srpska capital , banja luka , before the resolution was revoked , prime minister dodik said he was n't convinced that the office of the high representative was working in the best interests of the republika srbska .
“ by and large the office of the high representative -lrb- ohr -rrb- has employed a few international representatives , but most were local staff , mainly from the federation side , from sarajevo .
these people have created ill-feelings towards the republika srpska . ”
as with so many issues in bosnia , republika srpska and federation politicians are divided on this issue .
federation leaders say the country does n't have strong enough central institutions to close down the ohr .
haris silajdzic , the bosniak member of the bosnian presidency told reporters that he would do what he could to ensure that the ohr remains beyond the end of this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haris silajdzic says it is too early for the ohr to close up shop but he also conceded that there seemed to be an international political consensus that now was the time to pull the plug on the ohr , leaving only a non-executive european union special representative in its place .
despite dayton 's and bosnia 's flaws , the fact that the country has been at peace for more than 13 years is a considerable achievement in itself .
unemployment is high , but the cafes in both sarajevo and banja luka are full .
as one opposition politician in republika srpska put it : “ we do n't like each other very much , but at least we are not killing each other on the basis of our ethnic groups anymore .
we do n't have the most beautiful democracy in the world , but it 's not that bad . ” author : chuck penfold editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at sunday 's historic wimbledon , roger federer broke the grand slam record .
but the personal stakes at the 1937 germany-us davis cup duel were higher for german baron gottfried von cramm : he was playing for his life . " a terrible splendor : three extraordinary men , a world poised for war and the greatest tennis match ever played " tells the story of tennis champion gottfried von cramm , who had been secretly gay in hitler 's germany and his opponent don budge , who was the top ranked us player .
it is also the story of von cramm 's gay american coach bill tilden , who was training the nazi german team against his own country in a decisive davis cup match in 1937 .
deutsche welle spoke to marshall jon fisher , the author of the newly released book . deutsche welle : why was gottfried von cramm so popular with the crowds ?
and why was he so important to the nazi leadership ?
marshall jon fisher : von cramm was a remarkable character .
he was gracious , famous for his sportsmanship and from a noble background , but did n't act that way at all .
he was tall , very handsome , very germanic-looking - blond , blue-eyed - the nazis were holding him up as the perfect model of the aryan athlete .
the nazi officials were of course very interested in using sports figures as propaganda tools , such as -lrb- boxing legend -rrb- max schmeling .
-lrb- nazi propaganda minister joseph -rrb- goebbels made a big deal out of the 1936 berlin olympics and declared it a triumph for germany , so the davis cup could have served similar purposes for him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's nadal ended federer 's wimbledon winning streak last year there have been a few other " greatest matches ever " on centre court at wimbledon - the epic bjorn borg - john mcenroe duel in 1980 and the stunning marathon between roger federer and rafael nadal last year .
what makes budge vs. von cramm , the " greatest match ever " ?
borg-mcenroe and federer-nadal were incredible tennis matches , but what was at stake really , except which multi-millionaire would get to hold up the trophy afterwards ?
it was just tennis .
but in the von cramm-budge case , it was about winning the davis cup , which meant playing for their nation 's glory .
there were also the personal stakes for von cramm - he was playing for his life at a time when the winds of war were building up .
he was also playing for a regime which he loathed .
it turned out that gottfried von cramm was a gay man playing for a government that was executing people like him .
he had of course been followed by the gestapo .
they had a big file on him .
his lover was jewish .
his wife - he had married a childhood friend - was one-quarter jewish .
the gestapo had made it clear to him that as long as he kept winning and that germany had a chance to win the davis cup with him , he would be safe .
but if things did n't go too well with him on the tennis court , that might not be the case .
there was quite an amazing amount of pressure on him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von cramm was secretly gay , but married barbara hutton .
how did the match go ?
this 1937 davis cup match was supposed to be a walk away for don budge , who had destroyed von cramm two weeks earlier at the wimbledon final in three straight sets , so everyone thought budge was going to win this match easily and the americans would win the davis cup , but von cramm just played stupendous tennis .
von cramm won the first two sets .
budge came back and won the second two sets .
in the decisive fifth set , von cramm was up 4 to 1 .
at this point everyone thought von cramm was going to win , but budge comes back again and it goes past 6-6 .
i 'd rather not give away the ending , but it turned into a remarkable fifth set .
so what happened to von cramm after the match ?
it was inevitable that no matter what happened in the match , von cramm was going to run into trouble in germany .
when he travelled around the world , he became more and more outspoken against the nazis and upon returning home from his travels in 1938 , he was arrested and sentenced to prison for homosexual acts .
now he got off a bit easy due to some good connections he had .
most homosexuals were going to the camps , but he simply went to prison in berlin for less than a year .
was it generally known that von cramm was homosexual ?
other players did know , but it was not publicly known even after the war when von cramm played the davis cup for west germany .
with -lrb- von cramm 's american coach -rrb- bill tilden , people knew .
he was not quite as dignified as von cramm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us champ bill tilden coached germany 's davis cup team regarding bill tilden - it 's very common nowadays for the coach of a national team to be foreign .
we see that a lot in international soccer .
but on the eve of world war ii , what tilden did , appears treacherous .
it was extraordinary , but not because tilden was a foreigner .
" big bill " tilden completely dominated the tennis world throughout the 1920s and kept the davis cup in the united states almost single-handedly .
he was also a gay man when one could n't talk about such things .
it was amazing the nazis hired not only an american , but a gay american to coach their davis cup team .
how did tilden , an american tennis idol , wind up coaching the nazi german team , of all teams ?
tilden had wanted to coach the americans for years , even offering to do it for free , but they turned him down every year , presumably because they were afraid of some scandal due to his homosexuality .
so when the germans finally gave him an offer , he was happy to take it . tennis today is an individual sport , you play for yourself rather than for your country and it 's the grand slam tournaments - the us , french , australian open and wimbledon of course - that are important .
could you explain the significance of the davis cup back then ?
well of course , we still have the davis cup , but it was much more significant back then .
all the big international tournaments then were also only open to amateurs .
tennis was much bigger in the sports world back then and the davis cup was even bigger than wimbledon .
the pro era in tennis began in 1968 .
gottfried von cramm survived the war , married woolworth heiress barbara hutton in the 1950s and became a successful cotton importer .
he died in a car accident on a business trip in egypt in 1976 .
bill tilden tried to pursue an acting career in hollywood , but served prison time for homosexual acts after the war .
because of his convictions , he was shunned from playing and teaching tennis .
he died of a stroke in 1953 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us champ bill tilden coached germany 's davis cup team regarding bill tilden - it 's very common nowadays for the coach of a national team to be foreign .
we see that a lot in international soccer .
but on the eve of world war ii , what tilden did , appears treacherous .
it was extraordinary , but not because tilden was a foreigner .
" big bill " tilden completely dominated the tennis world throughout the 1920s and kept the davis cup in the united states almost single-handedly .
he was also a gay man when one could n't talk about such things .
it was amazing the nazis hired not only an american , but a gay american to coach their davis cup team .
how did tilden , an american tennis idol , wind up coaching the nazi german team , of all teams ?
tilden had wanted to coach the americans for years , even offering to do it for free , but they turned him down every year , presumably because they were afraid of some scandal due to his homosexuality .
so when the germans finally gave him an offer , he was happy to take it . tennis today is an individual sport , you play for yourself rather than for your country and it 's the grand slam tournaments - the us , french , australian open and wimbledon of course - that are important .
could you explain the significance of the davis cup back then ?
well of course , we still have the davis cup , but it was much more significant back then .
all the big international tournaments then were also only open to amateurs .
tennis was much bigger in the sports world back then and the davis cup was even bigger than wimbledon .
the pro era in tennis began in 1968 .
gottfried von cramm survived the war , married woolworth heiress barbara hutton in the 1950s and became a successful cotton importer .
he died in a car accident on a business trip in egypt in 1976 .
bill tilden tried to pursue an acting career in hollywood , but served prison time for homosexual acts after the war .
because of his convictions , he was shunned from playing and teaching tennis .
he died of a stroke in 1953 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.07.2009 normality comes in small doses in bosnia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instead of scenes of war , sarajevo today is characterized by a fragile peace more than 13 years after the dayton accord was signed , ending the bosnia 's inter-ethnic conflict in 1995 , the balkan country remains a very divided place . while peace and security have long since been established , few of those displaced during the three-year war have returned to homes in areas where their ethnic group is not in the majority .
despite this , there is a growing feeling among some people that it is time for the international community to step back , and hand over more responsibility for bosnia 's future to that country 's politicians .
the dayton accord that ended the bloodshed in bosnia-hercegovina in late 1995 is one of the few things that most bosnians can agree on .
they 'll tell you that it was successful in ending the war , but that it has been deficient when it comes to plotting a long-term path for the country 's future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it provided for the creation of a very weak central government , with the two entities , the bosniak / croat federation and the republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , wielding much of the legislative power .
this has led to divisions that had their roots in the 1992-95 war becoming formally ingrained during more than a decade of peace .
perhaps one of the most significant issues for the future of the country is the fact that children receive instruction in separate bosniak , serb or croat school systems .
seventy percent of the curriculum is set out by the state , with the remaining 30 percent left at the discretion of the schools .
croat high school student ante zelic explains that typically , these 30 percent are used for subjects like history or language instruction .
the students learn history , for example , from a croat point of view , or read two or three more novels by croatian authors than one would in other schools , says zelic .
while outsiders may think that this sort of division is the last thing that bosnian students need if the country is to grow more united in future , zelic does n't seem to see this as much of a problem .
his bosniak counterpart , adnan pripoljac , says the fact that students are divided in school is n't the point . “ i have my lessons in the morning and my croat colleagues go to classes in the afternoon .
but after school or in the evening we hang out together as usual .
most young people in bosnia do n't want to be separated , it 's just a political issue that has to be resolved . ”
practical problems while some politicians admit that the school situation is n't ideal , nobody seems to have a plan for integrating the educational systems .
a third student , dzeznan karic says there are practical considerations discouraging politicians from taking steps to change the status quo .
“ you have to realize that in every school there are , for example , two professors of geography , two professors of history , language , mathematics , physics , etc .
if they were to unite the school , this would leave one professor out of a job , and this is in nobody 's interest .
everyone is protecting their national interests .
why should a croat professor lose his job when there is also a bosniak professor who could lose his job ?
so it is a very political matter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valentin inzko hopes to be bosnia 's last high representative not even the international community 's special representative in bosnia has the answer .
the high representative still holds absolute power in this country , to be used to do whatever it takes to ensure that the provisions of the dayton accord are complied with .
this includes the power to revoke legislation or even remove politicians from office .
valentin inzko , the seventh person to hold this post , hopes he will be bosnia 's last high representative .
he recently told reporters in sarajevo that he hoped a decision would be taken in october , which would see the office of the high representative close at the end of this year .
“ i am moderately optimistic and i am doing everything in my power to ensure that this happens .
but the bosnians themselves also have to do something to improve the political climate , because -lrb- one -rrb- condition is a positive political climate and the implementation of dayton . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milorad dodik would like to seek the ohr close sooner rather than later it would be a stretch to describe the current political climate as positive .
recently , the high representative has been at loggerheads with the prime minister of the republika srpska , milorad dodik .
last month , the rs assembly passed a resolution demanding , among other things , that inzko transfer a package of powers to it from the central bosnian government .
after weeks of consultations , the high representative revoked the resolution , arguing that it violated the dayton agreement . pressure to leave it 's not surprising then , that the serbs want to see the office of the high representative shut down , sooner rather than later .
speaking to reporters in the republika srpska capital , banja luka , before the resolution was revoked , prime minister dodik said he was n't convinced that the office of the high representative was working in the best interests of the republika srbska .
“ by and large the office of the high representative -lrb- ohr -rrb- has employed a few international representatives , but most were local staff , mainly from the federation side , from sarajevo .
these people have created ill-feelings towards the republika srpska . ”
as with so many issues in bosnia , republika srpska and federation politicians are divided on this issue .
federation leaders say the country does n't have strong enough central institutions to close down the ohr .
haris silajdzic , the bosniak member of the bosnian presidency told reporters that he would do what he could to ensure that the ohr remains beyond the end of this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haris silajdzic says it is too early for the ohr to close up shop but he also conceded that there seemed to be an international political consensus that now was the time to pull the plug on the ohr , leaving only a non-executive european union special representative in its place .
despite dayton 's and bosnia 's flaws , the fact that the country has been at peace for more than 13 years is a considerable achievement in itself .
unemployment is high , but the cafes in both sarajevo and banja luka are full .
as one opposition politician in republika srpska put it : “ we do n't like each other very much , but at least we are not killing each other on the basis of our ethnic groups anymore .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sofia 's mayor boiko borisov has taken the prize exit polls by sova harris and alpha research suggested gerb would take between 115 and 117 seats in the 240-strong chamber , compared with 39 to 42 seats for the ruling socialists . if the exit polls are confirmed , there may be a hung parliament : both gerb and the socialists will need more than one ally to form a governing coalition .

then we 'll analyse our options , " borisov said . potential partners although borisov and stanishev have been tight-lipped about potential coalition partners , both men have reportedly rejected a left-right alliance .
they have also ruled out a coalition with the ultra nationalist ataka party , which took 8.8-9.2 percent of sunday 's vote , according to the exit polls . gerb 's most likely partner , the blue coalition of two small udf and dsb parties , reportedly secured 7.5-8.2 percent of votes . the turkish minority mrf party - the socialists ' current junior coalition partner - was credited with 11.3-13.5 percent . smaller parties such as the centrist nmsp of former king simeon saxe coburg , the nationalist olj party or the business formation lider could play a crucial role in forming the next government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist leader sergey stanishev is not smiling now " the most important thing now is an anti-crisis programme and cracking down on political corruption , " said martin dimitrov , the co-leader of the rightist blue coalition . the current government under sergey stanishev , which led bulgaria to eu membership in 2007 , has come under strong pressure from brussels to fight the country 's endemic corruption and organized crime . as a result , it did not come as a surprise that sunday 's election was marred by allegations of irregularities , particularly vote buying . with official results expected on monday , coalition talks could drag on for months and observers have voiced concern about a political impasse at a time when the economic crisis is expected to peak in bulgaria . some analysts have warned that bulgaria may even be forced to turn to the international monetary fund for help , joining several of its neighbours in central and eastern europe including hungary , latvia , romania and serbia . nk / afp / reuters / dpa editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

financial institutes remain reluctant to lend despite having received billions in finanical aid . german finance minister peer steinbrueck has warned banking managers over their reluctance to lend .
in sunday 's edition of the tabloid bild he says he was doubtful that a bill passed on friday in berlin to allow german banks to park their toxic assets in a so-called bad bank structure will be enough to get the banks back into the business of providing credit . instead , he 's threatening banks with unnamed sanctions should a credit crunch be the result of their too conservative lending policies .
his warning is that the government and the central bank will have to take steps to force the bankers ' hand .
these as yet unspecified actions , steinbrueck warns , would include measures never before used against financial institutions in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck warned banking managers over their reluctance to lend late last year , banks all over the world demanded billions in financial aid from their governments .
otherwise , they said , they would be forced into bankruptcy with unforeseeable consequences for the world economy . governments from washington , to london , to tokyo to berlin complied , despite the enormously high political risk involved .
there was political consensus that the banks were simply too big to be allowed to fail . despite state aid , banks are reluctant to lend today , german banks are doing far better , but stand accused of still being reluctant to lend to businesses and companies which increasingly feel the pinch of the global recession . for months , small and medium sized companies in germany have been finding it more and more difficult - if not impossible - to keep credit lines with their banks open . " at the moment there is no credit crunch , " said martin wansleben , managing director of the german chamber of industry and commerce . " but more and more companies are having difficulty getting needed loans .
it 's more complicated .
it 's more expensive .
and many are simply being rejected outright . " but , could the german government actually force banks to lend money ?
finance minister peer steinbrueck refused to fuel speculation on that .
however , other politicians are less subtle in their warnings to the banks . condemnation from across party lines " we helped the banks with massive funding and political support , " saarland state premier peter mueller said on saturday .

the ruling socialist party is predicted to do badly , with corruption allegations largely to blame . the parliamentary election campaign in bulgaria has been a fierce one .
the ruling socialist party has attacked the opposition center-right gerb in particularly vicious television advertisements .
a few weeks before the election , the government also changed voting rights in its favour .
this could be a last-ditch attempt to stay in power , with opinion polls predicting a change . bulgaria is currently governed by a coalition made up of prime minister sergei stanishev 's socialist party and two junior partners : the movement for rights and freedom , a party representing bulgaria 's turkish minority ; and the national movement formed by the former tsar of bulgaria .
many bulgarians blame the coalition for the country 's widespread corruption , the misappropriation of millions in aid money from the european union , and the ire of brussels .
these are the factors that will likely see voters turn away from the governing parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarians are some of the poorest people in the eu " the new government will probably try to send a few high-profile people to prison as a result of corruption allegations , " says georgi ganev , an economist at sofia 's centre for liberal strategies .
" that 's why the election campaign has been fought so hard . " 50 euros for a vote but corruption in bulgaria may have even entered the ballot booth .
during the recent european parliamentary elections , there were allegations that voters were bought on a large scale .
watchdogs are concerned that this type of manipulation may continue in the national election .
tihomir beslov from bulgaria 's centre for democratic research says votes can be bought for between 50 and 150 euros .
he says that kind of money can support a family in one of bulgaria 's poorer regions for two or three months .
" an entire company 's employees could also be pressured by their bosses to vote for a particular party , " beslov says .
" for example , muslims would be forced to swear before allah that they would vote for the party representing the turkish minority . "
" bulgarians want justice " the party likely to win the most votes in sunday 's election is the center-right gerb , led by sofia mayor boyko borisov .
the party has promised to fight corruption , and gerb member maria nedelcheva recently told the european parliament that bulgarians wanted justice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boyko borisov only founded gerb a few years ago " they expect criminal convictions and they want criminal proceedings to finally be launched against those responsible , " nedelcheva said .
" we are determined to do that . "
but even gerb is not expected to win an outright majority .
experts believe that disillusioned bulgarians may not turn up to polling booths at all .
a recent opinion poll showed gerb grabbing just over 30 percent of the vote , while the ruling socialists are predicted to take just over 20 percent .
with no one party likely to win a majority , another coalition for bulgaria looks likely - talks that could drag on for months .
