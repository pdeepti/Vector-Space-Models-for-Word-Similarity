the movie screened in the berlinales 's panorama section , which showcases independent and art-house cinema . " the yes men fix the world , " which was directed by mike bonanno , andy bichlbaum and kurt engfehr followed the yes men 's 2003 movie in which they impersonated employees of the world trade organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the storm " won a special prize awarded by the amnesty international movie-goers attending the berlin film festival were asked to cast their votes for the films screened in the panorama section , which screened a total of 48 movies films .
about 21,000 votes were cast . also on saturday as part of the berlinale , israeli-born director oren moverman won the peace prize for " the messenger , " a movie about two traumatized us soldiers back from iraq and on a new assignment to tell families their loved ones have been killed in combat . valued at 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 6,432 -rrb- , the first peace prize was awarded in 1986 . at the same time , german director hans-christian schmid won the amnesty international film prize for his thriller sturm -lrb- storm -rrb- , which is based around the war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia . starring ben foster and woody harrelson , " the messenger " along with sturm are favorites in the battle for the berlinale 's coveted golden bear , which is to be awarded on saturday . films in the age of war and terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brenda blethyn stars in rachid bouchareb 's " london river " a total of 18 films competed for the berlinale 's top honors with the field wide open in the race for the festival 's main prizes . among the leading contenders are paris-born rachid bouchareb 's " london river " and israeli-born oren moverman 's post-iraq-war film " the messenger . "
both helped to raise hopes about the berlinale 's main competition after a slow and uninspiring start to what is one of world 's top three festivals . with the berlinale never prepared to shy away from hard-edged political stories , " london river " is a compelling story of a muslim father and a christian mother searching for their children in the aftermath of london 's july 7 terrorist attacks .
it stars brenda blethyn and sotigui kouyate . iranian director asghar farhadi 's " about elly , " has also emerged as a possible favorite for the golden bear .
farhadi 's film explores the fine line between truth and lies in middle-class iranian society after a young woman suddenly vanishes . outcome impossible to predict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jury is out on who 'll win the top prizes this year but film festival juries are notoriously difficult to predict .
the berlinale 's seven-member international jury , headed up by academy award-winning british actress tilda swinton , also has to hand out festival prizes for best director , as well as awards for best actor and actress . indeed , top chinese actress zhang ziyi could also be recognized by the jury for her role as the lover of famed 20th-century peking opera star mei lan-fang , in beijing director chen kaige 's lavishly filmed " forever enthralled . " other possible contenders include german director maren ade 's " alle anderen " -lrb- everyone else -rrb- about a young couple that find their relationship is put to the test and british-born peter strickland 's " katalin varga . " set in transylvania , strickland 's first feature film tells the story of a woman who embarks on a journey of revenge as she travels through the carpathian mountains in search of her son 's real father .
once again , a major focus of the berlinale was stories about women . another film that could stand a chance of going home with a prize is british-born richard loncraine 's 1950 's comedy " my one and only , " which was a last-minute entry in the berlinale 's main competition . it stars hollywood actress renee zellweger as a mother who takes her two teenage sons on a road trip across america in search of a husband . stars out in force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clive owen stars in tom tykwer 's " the international " certainly the main focus of the world 's leading film festivals is about star power and this year 's berlinale has again managed to attract some of the biggest names in the business , including clive owen , kate winslet , michelle pfeiffer , demi moore , steve martin , keanu reeves and gael garcia bernal . but overhanging this year 's berlinale was the deepening sense of gloom in the global movie business as it braces itself for what is expected to be a tough 12 months of cost-cutting , layoffs and projects being put on hold . many of those attending the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- - the business side of the berlinale - appear somewhat relieved that the numbers of deals arranged over the last ten days meant that the efm was not quite as bad as many had expected . unusually for the world 's top film festivals , the berlinale opens up its screenings to the general public .
there appears to be no shortage of enthusiasm for the festival among ordinary moviegoers . by its midway point , the berlinale had sold a record 270,000 tickets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 14.02.2009 geneva motor show to highlight greener , smaller cars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greener and smaller cars will be all the rage at the geneva show next month 's geneva motor show is expected to be a little more upbeat than the gloomy detroit event in january , where manufacturers displayed their cars on poorly-lit stands or stayed away altogether . analysts expect car makers to showcase " green " concepts during the show march 5-15 that will hopefully lift them out of the worst crisis in the industry for decades .
the trend is toward electric cars , hybrid models , downsized combustion engines and smaller cars .
" geneva will be especially interesting for the small car segment , " according to german car analyst professor ferdinand dudenhoeffer , " giving a preview of what 's to come after the crisis - sometime after the year 2010 . "
the geneva show comes at a time when several european governments are providing stimulus packages and tax incentives to kick-start their domestic car industries as many workers are being made redundant or are working on short time .
first hopeful signs of a recovery can be seen in germany where the government is offering buyers of new cars a 2,500-euro -lrb- $ 3,222 -rrb- cashback scheme , if they scrap their old car - which must be at least nine years old .
some dealers are reporting up to ten times more business although official figures are not yet available .
a deep crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french government wants to help french auto producers amid the global economic crisis but the crisis is far from over yet .
the french government is injecting an additional 6 billion euros into the country 's car industry after renault ceo carlos ghosn warned that up to 20 percent of jobs in the car industry could be lost in europe this year as producers , suppliers and dealers have been badly hit by the global economic crisis .
even sports car manufacturer porsche , which long appeared to be riding out the storm , is feeling the pinch .
sales have plunged 18 percent since august 2008 .
nevertheless , all major car makers are expected to showcase their new vehicles in geneva with exhibitors making a special green pavilion available in which at least a dozen manufacturers are set to present clean technology vehicles .
the swiss specialist firm rinspeed is unveiling its ichange futuristic concept , designed to encourage innovative thinking among car makers .
it is not only fitted with a zero-emission 130 kw electric engine , but raises the rear end to add two additional seats behind the driver at the press of button .
" we have developed an extremely flexible vehicle , not only illustrating the theme of variability but also reflecting continuously changing energy needs , " says chief executive frank m. rinderknecht .
sporty and energy-efficient bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the geneva motor show is expected to be more upbeat that the event in detroit volkswagen will launch its new polo , which has a sportier look and energy-efficient engine .
the polo is expected to come out in a special , fuel-saving diesel version with start-stop technology reducing fuel consumption to 3.5 litres per 100km .

the movie screened in the berlinales 's panorama section , which showcases independent and art-house cinema . " the yes men fix the world , " which was directed by mike bonanno , andy bichlbaum and kurt engfehr followed the yes men 's 2003 movie in which they impersonated employees of the world trade organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the storm " won a special prize awarded by the amnesty international movie-goers attending the berlin film festival were asked to cast their votes for the films screened in the panorama section , which screened a total of 48 movies films .
about 21,000 votes were cast . also on saturday as part of the berlinale , israeli-born director oren moverman won the peace prize for " the messenger , " a movie about two traumatized us soldiers back from iraq and on a new assignment to tell families their loved ones have been killed in combat . valued at 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 6,432 -rrb- , the first peace prize was awarded in 1986 . at the same time , german director hans-christian schmid won the amnesty international film prize for his thriller sturm -lrb- storm -rrb- , which is based around the war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia . starring ben foster and woody harrelson , " the messenger " along with sturm are favorites in the battle for the berlinale 's coveted golden bear , which is to be awarded on saturday . films in the age of war and terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brenda blethyn stars in rachid bouchareb 's " london river " a total of 18 films competed for the berlinale 's top honors with the field wide open in the race for the festival 's main prizes . among the leading contenders are paris-born rachid bouchareb 's " london river " and israeli-born oren moverman 's post-iraq-war film " the messenger . "
both helped to raise hopes about the berlinale 's main competition after a slow and uninspiring start to what is one of world 's top three festivals . with the berlinale never prepared to shy away from hard-edged political stories , " london river " is a compelling story of a muslim father and a christian mother searching for their children in the aftermath of london 's july 7 terrorist attacks .
it stars brenda blethyn and sotigui kouyate . iranian director asghar farhadi 's " about elly , " has also emerged as a possible favorite for the golden bear .
farhadi 's film explores the fine line between truth and lies in middle-class iranian society after a young woman suddenly vanishes . outcome impossible to predict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jury is out on who 'll win the top prizes this year but film festival juries are notoriously difficult to predict .
the berlinale 's seven-member international jury , headed up by academy award-winning british actress tilda swinton , also has to hand out festival prizes for best director , as well as awards for best actor and actress . indeed , top chinese actress zhang ziyi could also be recognized by the jury for her role as the lover of famed 20th-century peking opera star mei lan-fang , in beijing director chen kaige 's lavishly filmed " forever enthralled . " other possible contenders include german director maren ade 's " alle anderen " -lrb- everyone else -rrb- about a young couple that find their relationship is put to the test and british-born peter strickland 's " katalin varga . " set in transylvania , strickland 's first feature film tells the story of a woman who embarks on a journey of revenge as she travels through the carpathian mountains in search of her son 's real father .
once again , a major focus of the berlinale was stories about women . another film that could stand a chance of going home with a prize is british-born richard loncraine 's 1950 's comedy " my one and only , " which was a last-minute entry in the berlinale 's main competition . it stars hollywood actress renee zellweger as a mother who takes her two teenage sons on a road trip across america in search of a husband . stars out in force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clive owen stars in tom tykwer 's " the international " certainly the main focus of the world 's leading film festivals is about star power and this year 's berlinale has again managed to attract some of the biggest names in the business , including clive owen , kate winslet , michelle pfeiffer , demi moore , steve martin , keanu reeves and gael garcia bernal . but overhanging this year 's berlinale was the deepening sense of gloom in the global movie business as it braces itself for what is expected to be a tough 12 months of cost-cutting , layoffs and projects being put on hold . many of those attending the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- - the business side of the berlinale - appear somewhat relieved that the numbers of deals arranged over the last ten days meant that the efm was not quite as bad as many had expected . unusually for the world 's top film festivals , the berlinale opens up its screenings to the general public .
there appears to be no shortage of enthusiasm for the festival among ordinary moviegoers . by its midway point , the berlinale had sold a record 270,000 tickets .
last year ticket sales totaled 240,000 .
after saturday 's awards , berlinale movie screenings will continue for a final day on sunday as the festival draws to a close . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the movie screened in the berlinales 's panorama section , which showcases independent and art-house cinema . " the yes men fix the world , " which was directed by mike bonanno , andy bichlbaum and kurt engfehr followed the yes men 's 2003 movie in which they impersonated employees of the world trade organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the storm " won a special prize awarded by the amnesty international movie-goers attending the berlin film festival were asked to cast their votes for the films screened in the panorama section , which screened a total of 48 movies films .
about 21,000 votes were cast . also on saturday as part of the berlinale , israeli-born director oren moverman won the peace prize for " the messenger , " a movie about two traumatized us soldiers back from iraq and on a new assignment to tell families their loved ones have been killed in combat . valued at 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 6,432 -rrb- , the first peace prize was awarded in 1986 . at the same time , german director hans-christian schmid won the amnesty international film prize for his thriller sturm -lrb- storm -rrb- , which is based around the war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia . starring ben foster and woody harrelson , " the messenger " along with sturm are favorites in the battle for the berlinale 's coveted golden bear , which is to be awarded on saturday . films in the age of war and terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brenda blethyn stars in rachid bouchareb 's " london river " a total of 18 films competed for the berlinale 's top honors with the field wide open in the race for the festival 's main prizes . among the leading contenders are paris-born rachid bouchareb 's " london river " and israeli-born oren moverman 's post-iraq-war film " the messenger . "
both helped to raise hopes about the berlinale 's main competition after a slow and uninspiring start to what is one of world 's top three festivals . with the berlinale never prepared to shy away from hard-edged political stories , " london river " is a compelling story of a muslim father and a christian mother searching for their children in the aftermath of london 's july 7 terrorist attacks .
it stars brenda blethyn and sotigui kouyate . iranian director asghar farhadi 's " about elly , " has also emerged as a possible favorite for the golden bear .
farhadi 's film explores the fine line between truth and lies in middle-class iranian society after a young woman suddenly vanishes . outcome impossible to predict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jury is out on who 'll win the top prizes this year but film festival juries are notoriously difficult to predict .
the berlinale 's seven-member international jury , headed up by academy award-winning british actress tilda swinton , also has to hand out festival prizes for best director , as well as awards for best actor and actress . indeed , top chinese actress zhang ziyi could also be recognized by the jury for her role as the lover of famed 20th-century peking opera star mei lan-fang , in beijing director chen kaige 's lavishly filmed " forever enthralled . " other possible contenders include german director maren ade 's " alle anderen " -lrb- everyone else -rrb- about a young couple that find their relationship is put to the test and british-born peter strickland 's " katalin varga . " set in transylvania , strickland 's first feature film tells the story of a woman who embarks on a journey of revenge as she travels through the carpathian mountains in search of her son 's real father .
once again , a major focus of the berlinale was stories about women . another film that could stand a chance of going home with a prize is british-born richard loncraine 's 1950 's comedy " my one and only , " which was a last-minute entry in the berlinale 's main competition . it stars hollywood actress renee zellweger as a mother who takes her two teenage sons on a road trip across america in search of a husband . stars out in force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clive owen stars in tom tykwer 's " the international " certainly the main focus of the world 's leading film festivals is about star power and this year 's berlinale has again managed to attract some of the biggest names in the business , including clive owen , kate winslet , michelle pfeiffer , demi moore , steve martin , keanu reeves and gael garcia bernal . but overhanging this year 's berlinale was the deepening sense of gloom in the global movie business as it braces itself for what is expected to be a tough 12 months of cost-cutting , layoffs and projects being put on hold . many of those attending the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- - the business side of the berlinale - appear somewhat relieved that the numbers of deals arranged over the last ten days meant that the efm was not quite as bad as many had expected . unusually for the world 's top film festivals , the berlinale opens up its screenings to the general public .
there appears to be no shortage of enthusiasm for the festival among ordinary moviegoers . by its midway point , the berlinale had sold a record 270,000 tickets .
last year ticket sales totaled 240,000 .
after saturday 's awards , berlinale movie screenings will continue for a final day on sunday as the festival draws to a close . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the awi experiment has met bitter opposition in germany from some environmentalists who fear that using algae to sequester carbon dioxide in the ocean might wreck the ecosystem .
awi says the debate requires facts , which the scientists are obtaining now . bathmann added it was still not certain if algae could capture vast amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and keep it out of circulation long term . project lohafex the experiment , codenamed lohafex , is continuing aboard a german ship , the polarstern , until mid-march .
the ship mixed 10 tons of ferrous sulphate -lrb- feso4 -rrb- with seawater and pumped it out into the south atlantic . " after just four days , the team observed a significant increase in algae , " said bathmann .
" it was a surprise that they reproduced so quickly . " in the previous experiments , it took 10 to 14 days for this to happen .
the haptophytes had responded to fertilization most . " other algae types barely increased or did not increase at all , " he said . haptophytes are common in coastal waters and blooms sometimes lead to them washing up on beaches as a foam .
tiny animals , the zooplankton , feed on them . " those organisms will eat a large part of the algae , " said the scientist , explaining that the zooplankton would breathe the carbon dioxide back into the surface water , instead of the gas sinking as dead algae to the ocean bottom . " at the moment , the algae are reproducing faster that than the zooplankton can eat them , " he said .
" the exciting question in the next few weeks will be how much of the algae will be left over .

the far-right marchers totaled around 6,000 , according to police , about a thousand more than gathered in 2005 , on the 60th anniversary of the bombing . many in the far-right scene call the widespread destruction in dresden a " holocaust , " and attempt to paint germany as a victim of the war .

this year , police forces numbered around 4,000 , some brought in from neighboring states . commemoration separately , thousands of pacifists took part in processions to both denounce the neo-nazi threat and remember the city 's dead . on saturday morning , peace services were held in churches and a synagogue .
afterwards , thousands of dresden residents went to a central square , the site where numerous victims of the bombing were burned to death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden after the firebombing and today also participating in the commemorations were politicians from dresden and saxony as well as representatives from the united states and great britain . many mainstream germans say that the huge loss of life must be remembered as a warning against war . on friday , the bell of the frauenkirche , or church of our lady , rang out in their memory .
the church , one of the symbols of dresden , collapsed two days after the raids .
it remained a pile of rubble for decades until us and british donors helped pay to rebuild it in a gesture of reconciliation .
it reopened in 2006 . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the awi experiment has met bitter opposition in germany from some environmentalists who fear that using algae to sequester carbon dioxide in the ocean might wreck the ecosystem .
awi says the debate requires facts , which the scientists are obtaining now . bathmann added it was still not certain if algae could capture vast amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and keep it out of circulation long term . project lohafex the experiment , codenamed lohafex , is continuing aboard a german ship , the polarstern , until mid-march .
the ship mixed 10 tons of ferrous sulphate -lrb- feso4 -rrb- with seawater and pumped it out into the south atlantic . " after just four days , the team observed a significant increase in algae , " said bathmann .
" it was a surprise that they reproduced so quickly . " in the previous experiments , it took 10 to 14 days for this to happen .
the haptophytes had responded to fertilization most . " other algae types barely increased or did not increase at all , " he said . haptophytes are common in coastal waters and blooms sometimes lead to them washing up on beaches as a foam .
tiny animals , the zooplankton , feed on them . " those organisms will eat a large part of the algae , " said the scientist , explaining that the zooplankton would breathe the carbon dioxide back into the surface water , instead of the gas sinking as dead algae to the ocean bottom . " at the moment , the algae are reproducing faster that than the zooplankton can eat them , " he said .
" the exciting question in the next few weeks will be how much of the algae will be left over . " that is why we can not make any predictions about how much carbon dioxide the algae are able to capture .

" it 's incomprehensible that banks which the state is propping up are in many cases paying out enormous bonuses , " merkel told the news weekly der spiegel in an article published on saturday , feb .
14 , adding that the subject would be up for discussion at a summit of the g20 nations in london in april . the g20 group comprises the world 's largest economies . merkel , head of the conservative christian democrats , called for bonus systems to be " internationally more explicitly linked to the genuinely sustainable business success of banks . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , member of the center-left social democrats , expressed a similar sentiment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " outrageous " was how us president obama described wall street 's billion-dollar bonuses in 2008 " the detachment from reality and the cynicism of executives continues to shock me .
executives are role models - in both good and bad ways , " he said . the german politicians join other leaders , such as us president barack obama , who said the billions in bonuses that wall street bankers had awarded themselves for 2008 was " outrageous . " growing anger resentment in germany toward bankers , who are largely perceived as having caused the global financial crisis , is growing .
even in late 2007 , before the full extent of the financial crisis was realized , germany was debating whether compensation for executives had gotten out of control . then , merkel did not argue with executives being " well paid , " as long as they " did a lot for their companies . " but in the wake of the global economic meltdown , attitudes have hardened . berlin has already agreed on a package of reforms aimed at curbing executive pay .
one would hold supervisory boards as a whole , rather than sub-committees , liable for pay packages for high-ranking managers that were " inappropriate . " the german government has already pushed through a 500-billion-euro -lrb- $ 630-billion -rrb- rescue package for german banks . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the movie screened in the berlinales 's panorama section , which showcases independent and art-house cinema . " the yes men fix the world , " which was directed by mike bonanno , andy bichlbaum and kurt engfehr followed the yes men 's 2003 movie in which they impersonated employees of the world trade organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the storm " won a special prize awarded by the amnesty international movie-goers attending the berlin film festival were asked to cast their votes for the films screened in the panorama section , which screened a total of 48 movies films .
about 21,000 votes were cast . also on saturday as part of the berlinale , israeli-born director oren moverman won the peace prize for " the messenger , " a movie about two traumatized us soldiers back from iraq and on a new assignment to tell families their loved ones have been killed in combat . valued at 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 6,432 -rrb- , the first peace prize was awarded in 1986 . at the same time , german director hans-christian schmid won the amnesty international film prize for his thriller sturm -lrb- storm -rrb- , which is based around the war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia . starring ben foster and woody harrelson , " the messenger " along with sturm are favorites in the battle for the berlinale 's coveted golden bear , which is to be awarded on saturday . films in the age of war and terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brenda blethyn stars in rachid bouchareb 's " london river " a total of 18 films competed for the berlinale 's top honors with the field wide open in the race for the festival 's main prizes . among the leading contenders are paris-born rachid bouchareb 's " london river " and israeli-born oren moverman 's post-iraq-war film " the messenger . "
both helped to raise hopes about the berlinale 's main competition after a slow and uninspiring start to what is one of world 's top three festivals . with the berlinale never prepared to shy away from hard-edged political stories , " london river " is a compelling story of a muslim father and a christian mother searching for their children in the aftermath of london 's july 7 terrorist attacks .
it stars brenda blethyn and sotigui kouyate . iranian director asghar farhadi 's " about elly , " has also emerged as a possible favorite for the golden bear .
farhadi 's film explores the fine line between truth and lies in middle-class iranian society after a young woman suddenly vanishes . outcome impossible to predict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jury is out on who 'll win the top prizes this year but film festival juries are notoriously difficult to predict .
the berlinale 's seven-member international jury , headed up by academy award-winning british actress tilda swinton , also has to hand out festival prizes for best director , as well as awards for best actor and actress . indeed , top chinese actress zhang ziyi could also be recognized by the jury for her role as the lover of famed 20th-century peking opera star mei lan-fang , in beijing director chen kaige 's lavishly filmed " forever enthralled . " other possible contenders include german director maren ade 's " alle anderen " -lrb- everyone else -rrb- about a young couple that find their relationship is put to the test and british-born peter strickland 's " katalin varga . " set in transylvania , strickland 's first feature film tells the story of a woman who embarks on a journey of revenge as she travels through the carpathian mountains in search of her son 's real father .
once again , a major focus of the berlinale was stories about women . another film that could stand a chance of going home with a prize is british-born richard loncraine 's 1950 's comedy " my one and only , " which was a last-minute entry in the berlinale 's main competition . it stars hollywood actress renee zellweger as a mother who takes her two teenage sons on a road trip across america in search of a husband . stars out in force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clive owen stars in tom tykwer 's " the international " certainly the main focus of the world 's leading film festivals is about star power and this year 's berlinale has again managed to attract some of the biggest names in the business , including clive owen , kate winslet , michelle pfeiffer , demi moore , steve martin , keanu reeves and gael garcia bernal . but overhanging this year 's berlinale was the deepening sense of gloom in the global movie business as it braces itself for what is expected to be a tough 12 months of cost-cutting , layoffs and projects being put on hold . many of those attending the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- - the business side of the berlinale - appear somewhat relieved that the numbers of deals arranged over the last ten days meant that the efm was not quite as bad as many had expected . unusually for the world 's top film festivals , the berlinale opens up its screenings to the general public .
there appears to be no shortage of enthusiasm for the festival among ordinary moviegoers . by its midway point , the berlinale had sold a record 270,000 tickets .

the movie screened in the berlinales 's panorama section , which showcases independent and art-house cinema . " the yes men fix the world , " which was directed by mike bonanno , andy bichlbaum and kurt engfehr followed the yes men 's 2003 movie in which they impersonated employees of the world trade organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the storm " won a special prize awarded by the amnesty international movie-goers attending the berlin film festival were asked to cast their votes for the films screened in the panorama section , which screened a total of 48 movies films .
about 21,000 votes were cast . also on saturday as part of the berlinale , israeli-born director oren moverman won the peace prize for " the messenger , " a movie about two traumatized us soldiers back from iraq and on a new assignment to tell families their loved ones have been killed in combat . valued at 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 6,432 -rrb- , the first peace prize was awarded in 1986 . at the same time , german director hans-christian schmid won the amnesty international film prize for his thriller sturm -lrb- storm -rrb- , which is based around the war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia . starring ben foster and woody harrelson , " the messenger " along with sturm are favorites in the battle for the berlinale 's coveted golden bear , which is to be awarded on saturday . films in the age of war and terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brenda blethyn stars in rachid bouchareb 's " london river " a total of 18 films competed for the berlinale 's top honors with the field wide open in the race for the festival 's main prizes . among the leading contenders are paris-born rachid bouchareb 's " london river " and israeli-born oren moverman 's post-iraq-war film " the messenger . "
both helped to raise hopes about the berlinale 's main competition after a slow and uninspiring start to what is one of world 's top three festivals . with the berlinale never prepared to shy away from hard-edged political stories , " london river " is a compelling story of a muslim father and a christian mother searching for their children in the aftermath of london 's july 7 terrorist attacks .
it stars brenda blethyn and sotigui kouyate . iranian director asghar farhadi 's " about elly , " has also emerged as a possible favorite for the golden bear .
farhadi 's film explores the fine line between truth and lies in middle-class iranian society after a young woman suddenly vanishes . outcome impossible to predict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jury is out on who 'll win the top prizes this year but film festival juries are notoriously difficult to predict .
the berlinale 's seven-member international jury , headed up by academy award-winning british actress tilda swinton , also has to hand out festival prizes for best director , as well as awards for best actor and actress . indeed , top chinese actress zhang ziyi could also be recognized by the jury for her role as the lover of famed 20th-century peking opera star mei lan-fang , in beijing director chen kaige 's lavishly filmed " forever enthralled . " other possible contenders include german director maren ade 's " alle anderen " -lrb- everyone else -rrb- about a young couple that find their relationship is put to the test and british-born peter strickland 's " katalin varga . " set in transylvania , strickland 's first feature film tells the story of a woman who embarks on a journey of revenge as she travels through the carpathian mountains in search of her son 's real father .
once again , a major focus of the berlinale was stories about women . another film that could stand a chance of going home with a prize is british-born richard loncraine 's 1950 's comedy " my one and only , " which was a last-minute entry in the berlinale 's main competition . it stars hollywood actress renee zellweger as a mother who takes her two teenage sons on a road trip across america in search of a husband . stars out in force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clive owen stars in tom tykwer 's " the international " certainly the main focus of the world 's leading film festivals is about star power and this year 's berlinale has again managed to attract some of the biggest names in the business , including clive owen , kate winslet , michelle pfeiffer , demi moore , steve martin , keanu reeves and gael garcia bernal . but overhanging this year 's berlinale was the deepening sense of gloom in the global movie business as it braces itself for what is expected to be a tough 12 months of cost-cutting , layoffs and projects being put on hold . many of those attending the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- - the business side of the berlinale - appear somewhat relieved that the numbers of deals arranged over the last ten days meant that the efm was not quite as bad as many had expected . unusually for the world 's top film festivals , the berlinale opens up its screenings to the general public .
there appears to be no shortage of enthusiasm for the festival among ordinary moviegoers . by its midway point , the berlinale had sold a record 270,000 tickets .
last year ticket sales totaled 240,000 .
after saturday 's awards , berlinale movie screenings will continue for a final day on sunday as the festival draws to a close . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the movie screened in the berlinales 's panorama section , which showcases independent and art-house cinema . " the yes men fix the world , " which was directed by mike bonanno , andy bichlbaum and kurt engfehr followed the yes men 's 2003 movie in which they impersonated employees of the world trade organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the storm " won a special prize awarded by the amnesty international movie-goers attending the berlin film festival were asked to cast their votes for the films screened in the panorama section , which screened a total of 48 movies films .
about 21,000 votes were cast . also on saturday as part of the berlinale , israeli-born director oren moverman won the peace prize for " the messenger , " a movie about two traumatized us soldiers back from iraq and on a new assignment to tell families their loved ones have been killed in combat . valued at 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 6,432 -rrb- , the first peace prize was awarded in 1986 . at the same time , german director hans-christian schmid won the amnesty international film prize for his thriller sturm -lrb- storm -rrb- , which is based around the war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia . starring ben foster and woody harrelson , " the messenger " along with sturm are favorites in the battle for the berlinale 's coveted golden bear , which is to be awarded on saturday . films in the age of war and terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brenda blethyn stars in rachid bouchareb 's " london river " a total of 18 films competed for the berlinale 's top honors with the field wide open in the race for the festival 's main prizes . among the leading contenders are paris-born rachid bouchareb 's " london river " and israeli-born oren moverman 's post-iraq-war film " the messenger . "
both helped to raise hopes about the berlinale 's main competition after a slow and uninspiring start to what is one of world 's top three festivals . with the berlinale never prepared to shy away from hard-edged political stories , " london river " is a compelling story of a muslim father and a christian mother searching for their children in the aftermath of london 's july 7 terrorist attacks .
it stars brenda blethyn and sotigui kouyate . iranian director asghar farhadi 's " about elly , " has also emerged as a possible favorite for the golden bear .
farhadi 's film explores the fine line between truth and lies in middle-class iranian society after a young woman suddenly vanishes . outcome impossible to predict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jury is out on who 'll win the top prizes this year but film festival juries are notoriously difficult to predict .
the berlinale 's seven-member international jury , headed up by academy award-winning british actress tilda swinton , also has to hand out festival prizes for best director , as well as awards for best actor and actress . indeed , top chinese actress zhang ziyi could also be recognized by the jury for her role as the lover of famed 20th-century peking opera star mei lan-fang , in beijing director chen kaige 's lavishly filmed " forever enthralled . " other possible contenders include german director maren ade 's " alle anderen " -lrb- everyone else -rrb- about a young couple that find their relationship is put to the test and british-born peter strickland 's " katalin varga .

the movie screened in the berlinales 's panorama section , which showcases independent and art-house cinema . " the yes men fix the world , " which was directed by mike bonanno , andy bichlbaum and kurt engfehr followed the yes men 's 2003 movie in which they impersonated employees of the world trade organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the storm " won a special prize awarded by the amnesty international movie-goers attending the berlin film festival were asked to cast their votes for the films screened in the panorama section , which screened a total of 48 movies films .
about 21,000 votes were cast . also on saturday as part of the berlinale , israeli-born director oren moverman won the peace prize for " the messenger , " a movie about two traumatized us soldiers back from iraq and on a new assignment to tell families their loved ones have been killed in combat . valued at 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 6,432 -rrb- , the first peace prize was awarded in 1986 . at the same time , german director hans-christian schmid won the amnesty international film prize for his thriller sturm -lrb- storm -rrb- , which is based around the war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia . starring ben foster and woody harrelson , " the messenger " along with sturm are favorites in the battle for the berlinale 's coveted golden bear , which is to be awarded on saturday . films in the age of war and terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brenda blethyn stars in rachid bouchareb 's " london river " a total of 18 films competed for the berlinale 's top honors with the field wide open in the race for the festival 's main prizes . among the leading contenders are paris-born rachid bouchareb 's " london river " and israeli-born oren moverman 's post-iraq-war film " the messenger . "
both helped to raise hopes about the berlinale 's main competition after a slow and uninspiring start to what is one of world 's top three festivals . with the berlinale never prepared to shy away from hard-edged political stories , " london river " is a compelling story of a muslim father and a christian mother searching for their children in the aftermath of london 's july 7 terrorist attacks .
it stars brenda blethyn and sotigui kouyate . iranian director asghar farhadi 's " about elly , " has also emerged as a possible favorite for the golden bear .
farhadi 's film explores the fine line between truth and lies in middle-class iranian society after a young woman suddenly vanishes . outcome impossible to predict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jury is out on who 'll win the top prizes this year but film festival juries are notoriously difficult to predict .
the berlinale 's seven-member international jury , headed up by academy award-winning british actress tilda swinton , also has to hand out festival prizes for best director , as well as awards for best actor and actress . indeed , top chinese actress zhang ziyi could also be recognized by the jury for her role as the lover of famed 20th-century peking opera star mei lan-fang , in beijing director chen kaige 's lavishly filmed " forever enthralled . " other possible contenders include german director maren ade 's " alle anderen " -lrb- everyone else -rrb- about a young couple that find their relationship is put to the test and british-born peter strickland 's " katalin varga . " set in transylvania , strickland 's first feature film tells the story of a woman who embarks on a journey of revenge as she travels through the carpathian mountains in search of her son 's real father .
once again , a major focus of the berlinale was stories about women . another film that could stand a chance of going home with a prize is british-born richard loncraine 's 1950 's comedy " my one and only , " which was a last-minute entry in the berlinale 's main competition . it stars hollywood actress renee zellweger as a mother who takes her two teenage sons on a road trip across america in search of a husband . stars out in force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clive owen stars in tom tykwer 's " the international " certainly the main focus of the world 's leading film festivals is about star power and this year 's berlinale has again managed to attract some of the biggest names in the business , including clive owen , kate winslet , michelle pfeiffer , demi moore , steve martin , keanu reeves and gael garcia bernal . but overhanging this year 's berlinale was the deepening sense of gloom in the global movie business as it braces itself for what is expected to be a tough 12 months of cost-cutting , layoffs and projects being put on hold . many of those attending the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- - the business side of the berlinale - appear somewhat relieved that the numbers of deals arranged over the last ten days meant that the efm was not quite as bad as many had expected . unusually for the world 's top film festivals , the berlinale opens up its screenings to the general public .
there appears to be no shortage of enthusiasm for the festival among ordinary moviegoers . by its midway point , the berlinale had sold a record 270,000 tickets .
last year ticket sales totaled 240,000 .
after saturday 's awards , berlinale movie screenings will continue for a final day on sunday as the festival draws to a close . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it 's incomprehensible that banks which the state is propping up are in many cases paying out enormous bonuses , " merkel told the news weekly der spiegel in an article published on saturday , feb .
14 , adding that the subject would be up for discussion at a summit of the g20 nations in london in april . the g20 group comprises the world 's largest economies . merkel , head of the conservative christian democrats , called for bonus systems to be " internationally more explicitly linked to the genuinely sustainable business success of banks . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , member of the center-left social democrats , expressed a similar sentiment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " outrageous " was how us president obama described wall street 's billion-dollar bonuses in 2008 " the detachment from reality and the cynicism of executives continues to shock me .
executives are role models - in both good and bad ways , " he said . the german politicians join other leaders , such as us president barack obama , who said the billions in bonuses that wall street bankers had awarded themselves for 2008 was " outrageous . " growing anger resentment in germany toward bankers , who are largely perceived as having caused the global financial crisis , is growing .
even in late 2007 , before the full extent of the financial crisis was realized , germany was debating whether compensation for executives had gotten out of control . then , merkel did not argue with executives being " well paid , " as long as they " did a lot for their companies . " but in the wake of the global economic meltdown , attitudes have hardened . berlin has already agreed on a package of reforms aimed at curbing executive pay .
one would hold supervisory boards as a whole , rather than sub-committees , liable for pay packages for high-ranking managers that were " inappropriate . " the german government has already pushed through a 500-billion-euro -lrb- $ 630-billion -rrb- rescue package for german banks . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the awi experiment has met bitter opposition in germany from some environmentalists who fear that using algae to sequester carbon dioxide in the ocean might wreck the ecosystem .
awi says the debate requires facts , which the scientists are obtaining now . bathmann added it was still not certain if algae could capture vast amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and keep it out of circulation long term . project lohafex the experiment , codenamed lohafex , is continuing aboard a german ship , the polarstern , until mid-march .
the ship mixed 10 tons of ferrous sulphate -lrb- feso4 -rrb- with seawater and pumped it out into the south atlantic . " after just four days , the team observed a significant increase in algae , " said bathmann .
" it was a surprise that they reproduced so quickly . " in the previous experiments , it took 10 to 14 days for this to happen .
the haptophytes had responded to fertilization most . " other algae types barely increased or did not increase at all , " he said . haptophytes are common in coastal waters and blooms sometimes lead to them washing up on beaches as a foam .
tiny animals , the zooplankton , feed on them . " those organisms will eat a large part of the algae , " said the scientist , explaining that the zooplankton would breathe the carbon dioxide back into the surface water , instead of the gas sinking as dead algae to the ocean bottom . " at the moment , the algae are reproducing faster that than the zooplankton can eat them , " he said .

" the awi experiment has met bitter opposition in germany from some environmentalists who fear that using algae to sequester carbon dioxide in the ocean might wreck the ecosystem .
awi says the debate requires facts , which the scientists are obtaining now . bathmann added it was still not certain if algae could capture vast amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and keep it out of circulation long term . project lohafex the experiment , codenamed lohafex , is continuing aboard a german ship , the polarstern , until mid-march .
the ship mixed 10 tons of ferrous sulphate -lrb- feso4 -rrb- with seawater and pumped it out into the south atlantic . " after just four days , the team observed a significant increase in algae , " said bathmann .
" it was a surprise that they reproduced so quickly . " in the previous experiments , it took 10 to 14 days for this to happen .
the haptophytes had responded to fertilization most . " other algae types barely increased or did not increase at all , " he said . haptophytes are common in coastal waters and blooms sometimes lead to them washing up on beaches as a foam .
tiny animals , the zooplankton , feed on them . " those organisms will eat a large part of the algae , " said the scientist , explaining that the zooplankton would breathe the carbon dioxide back into the surface water , instead of the gas sinking as dead algae to the ocean bottom . " at the moment , the algae are reproducing faster that than the zooplankton can eat them , " he said .
" the exciting question in the next few weeks will be how much of the algae will be left over .

" the awi experiment has met bitter opposition in germany from some environmentalists who fear that using algae to sequester carbon dioxide in the ocean might wreck the ecosystem .
awi says the debate requires facts , which the scientists are obtaining now . bathmann added it was still not certain if algae could capture vast amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and keep it out of circulation long term . project lohafex the experiment , codenamed lohafex , is continuing aboard a german ship , the polarstern , until mid-march .
the ship mixed 10 tons of ferrous sulphate -lrb- feso4 -rrb- with seawater and pumped it out into the south atlantic . " after just four days , the team observed a significant increase in algae , " said bathmann .
" it was a surprise that they reproduced so quickly . " in the previous experiments , it took 10 to 14 days for this to happen .
the haptophytes had responded to fertilization most . " other algae types barely increased or did not increase at all , " he said . haptophytes are common in coastal waters and blooms sometimes lead to them washing up on beaches as a foam .
tiny animals , the zooplankton , feed on them . " those organisms will eat a large part of the algae , " said the scientist , explaining that the zooplankton would breathe the carbon dioxide back into the surface water , instead of the gas sinking as dead algae to the ocean bottom . " at the moment , the algae are reproducing faster that than the zooplankton can eat them , " he said .
" the exciting question in the next few weeks will be how much of the algae will be left over . " that is why we can not make any predictions about how much carbon dioxide the algae are able to capture .

" it 's incomprehensible that banks which the state is propping up are in many cases paying out enormous bonuses , " merkel told the news weekly der spiegel in an article published on saturday , feb .
14 , adding that the subject would be up for discussion at a summit of the g20 nations in london in april . the g20 group comprises the world 's largest economies . merkel , head of the conservative christian democrats , called for bonus systems to be " internationally more explicitly linked to the genuinely sustainable business success of banks . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , member of the center-left social democrats , expressed a similar sentiment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " outrageous " was how us president obama described wall street 's billion-dollar bonuses in 2008 " the detachment from reality and the cynicism of executives continues to shock me .
executives are role models - in both good and bad ways , " he said . the german politicians join other leaders , such as us president barack obama , who said the billions in bonuses that wall street bankers had awarded themselves for 2008 was " outrageous . " growing anger resentment in germany toward bankers , who are largely perceived as having caused the global financial crisis , is growing .
even in late 2007 , before the full extent of the financial crisis was realized , germany was debating whether compensation for executives had gotten out of control . then , merkel did not argue with executives being " well paid , " as long as they " did a lot for their companies . " but in the wake of the global economic meltdown , attitudes have hardened . berlin has already agreed on a package of reforms aimed at curbing executive pay .
one would hold supervisory boards as a whole , rather than sub-committees , liable for pay packages for high-ranking managers that were " inappropriate .

" it 's incomprehensible that banks which the state is propping up are in many cases paying out enormous bonuses , " merkel told the news weekly der spiegel in an article published on saturday , feb .
14 , adding that the subject would be up for discussion at a summit of the g20 nations in london in april . the g20 group comprises the world 's largest economies . merkel , head of the conservative christian democrats , called for bonus systems to be " internationally more explicitly linked to the genuinely sustainable business success of banks . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , member of the center-left social democrats , expressed a similar sentiment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " outrageous " was how us president obama described wall street 's billion-dollar bonuses in 2008 " the detachment from reality and the cynicism of executives continues to shock me .
executives are role models - in both good and bad ways , " he said . the german politicians join other leaders , such as us president barack obama , who said the billions in bonuses that wall street bankers had awarded themselves for 2008 was " outrageous . " growing anger resentment in germany toward bankers , who are largely perceived as having caused the global financial crisis , is growing .
even in late 2007 , before the full extent of the financial crisis was realized , germany was debating whether compensation for executives had gotten out of control . then , merkel did not argue with executives being " well paid , " as long as they " did a lot for their companies . " but in the wake of the global economic meltdown , attitudes have hardened . berlin has already agreed on a package of reforms aimed at curbing executive pay .
one would hold supervisory boards as a whole , rather than sub-committees , liable for pay packages for high-ranking managers that were " inappropriate . " the german government has already pushed through a 500-billion-euro -lrb- $ 630-billion -rrb- rescue package for german banks . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 14.02.2009 geneva motor show to highlight greener , smaller cars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greener and smaller cars will be all the rage at the geneva show next month 's geneva motor show is expected to be a little more upbeat than the gloomy detroit event in january , where manufacturers displayed their cars on poorly-lit stands or stayed away altogether . analysts expect car makers to showcase " green " concepts during the show march 5-15 that will hopefully lift them out of the worst crisis in the industry for decades .
the trend is toward electric cars , hybrid models , downsized combustion engines and smaller cars .
" geneva will be especially interesting for the small car segment , " according to german car analyst professor ferdinand dudenhoeffer , " giving a preview of what 's to come after the crisis - sometime after the year 2010 . "
the geneva show comes at a time when several european governments are providing stimulus packages and tax incentives to kick-start their domestic car industries as many workers are being made redundant or are working on short time .
first hopeful signs of a recovery can be seen in germany where the government is offering buyers of new cars a 2,500-euro -lrb- $ 3,222 -rrb- cashback scheme , if they scrap their old car - which must be at least nine years old .
some dealers are reporting up to ten times more business although official figures are not yet available .
a deep crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french government wants to help french auto producers amid the global economic crisis but the crisis is far from over yet .
the french government is injecting an additional 6 billion euros into the country 's car industry after renault ceo carlos ghosn warned that up to 20 percent of jobs in the car industry could be lost in europe this year as producers , suppliers and dealers have been badly hit by the global economic crisis .
even sports car manufacturer porsche , which long appeared to be riding out the storm , is feeling the pinch .
sales have plunged 18 percent since august 2008 .
nevertheless , all major car makers are expected to showcase their new vehicles in geneva with exhibitors making a special green pavilion available in which at least a dozen manufacturers are set to present clean technology vehicles .
the swiss specialist firm rinspeed is unveiling its ichange futuristic concept , designed to encourage innovative thinking among car makers .
it is not only fitted with a zero-emission 130 kw electric engine , but raises the rear end to add two additional seats behind the driver at the press of button .
" we have developed an extremely flexible vehicle , not only illustrating the theme of variability but also reflecting continuously changing energy needs , " says chief executive frank m. rinderknecht .
sporty and energy-efficient bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the geneva motor show is expected to be more upbeat that the event in detroit volkswagen will launch its new polo , which has a sportier look and energy-efficient engine .
the polo is expected to come out in a special , fuel-saving diesel version with start-stop technology reducing fuel consumption to 3.5 litres per 100km .

the movie screened in the berlinales 's panorama section , which showcases independent and art-house cinema . " the yes men fix the world , " which was directed by mike bonanno , andy bichlbaum and kurt engfehr followed the yes men 's 2003 movie in which they impersonated employees of the world trade organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the storm " won a special prize awarded by the amnesty international movie-goers attending the berlin film festival were asked to cast their votes for the films screened in the panorama section , which screened a total of 48 movies films .
about 21,000 votes were cast . also on saturday as part of the berlinale , israeli-born director oren moverman won the peace prize for " the messenger , " a movie about two traumatized us soldiers back from iraq and on a new assignment to tell families their loved ones have been killed in combat . valued at 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 6,432 -rrb- , the first peace prize was awarded in 1986 . at the same time , german director hans-christian schmid won the amnesty international film prize for his thriller sturm -lrb- storm -rrb- , which is based around the war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia . starring ben foster and woody harrelson , " the messenger " along with sturm are favorites in the battle for the berlinale 's coveted golden bear , which is to be awarded on saturday . films in the age of war and terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brenda blethyn stars in rachid bouchareb 's " london river " a total of 18 films competed for the berlinale 's top honors with the field wide open in the race for the festival 's main prizes . among the leading contenders are paris-born rachid bouchareb 's " london river " and israeli-born oren moverman 's post-iraq-war film " the messenger . "
both helped to raise hopes about the berlinale 's main competition after a slow and uninspiring start to what is one of world 's top three festivals . with the berlinale never prepared to shy away from hard-edged political stories , " london river " is a compelling story of a muslim father and a christian mother searching for their children in the aftermath of london 's july 7 terrorist attacks .
it stars brenda blethyn and sotigui kouyate . iranian director asghar farhadi 's " about elly , " has also emerged as a possible favorite for the golden bear .
farhadi 's film explores the fine line between truth and lies in middle-class iranian society after a young woman suddenly vanishes . outcome impossible to predict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jury is out on who 'll win the top prizes this year but film festival juries are notoriously difficult to predict .
the berlinale 's seven-member international jury , headed up by academy award-winning british actress tilda swinton , also has to hand out festival prizes for best director , as well as awards for best actor and actress . indeed , top chinese actress zhang ziyi could also be recognized by the jury for her role as the lover of famed 20th-century peking opera star mei lan-fang , in beijing director chen kaige 's lavishly filmed " forever enthralled . " other possible contenders include german director maren ade 's " alle anderen " -lrb- everyone else -rrb- about a young couple that find their relationship is put to the test and british-born peter strickland 's " katalin varga . " set in transylvania , strickland 's first feature film tells the story of a woman who embarks on a journey of revenge as she travels through the carpathian mountains in search of her son 's real father .
once again , a major focus of the berlinale was stories about women . another film that could stand a chance of going home with a prize is british-born richard loncraine 's 1950 's comedy " my one and only , " which was a last-minute entry in the berlinale 's main competition . it stars hollywood actress renee zellweger as a mother who takes her two teenage sons on a road trip across america in search of a husband . stars out in force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clive owen stars in tom tykwer 's " the international " certainly the main focus of the world 's leading film festivals is about star power and this year 's berlinale has again managed to attract some of the biggest names in the business , including clive owen , kate winslet , michelle pfeiffer , demi moore , steve martin , keanu reeves and gael garcia bernal . but overhanging this year 's berlinale was the deepening sense of gloom in the global movie business as it braces itself for what is expected to be a tough 12 months of cost-cutting , layoffs and projects being put on hold . many of those attending the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- - the business side of the berlinale - appear somewhat relieved that the numbers of deals arranged over the last ten days meant that the efm was not quite as bad as many had expected . unusually for the world 's top film festivals , the berlinale opens up its screenings to the general public .
there appears to be no shortage of enthusiasm for the festival among ordinary moviegoers . by its midway point , the berlinale had sold a record 270,000 tickets .
last year ticket sales totaled 240,000 .
after saturday 's awards , berlinale movie screenings will continue for a final day on sunday as the festival draws to a close . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the awi experiment has met bitter opposition in germany from some environmentalists who fear that using algae to sequester carbon dioxide in the ocean might wreck the ecosystem .
awi says the debate requires facts , which the scientists are obtaining now . bathmann added it was still not certain if algae could capture vast amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and keep it out of circulation long term . project lohafex the experiment , codenamed lohafex , is continuing aboard a german ship , the polarstern , until mid-march .
the ship mixed 10 tons of ferrous sulphate -lrb- feso4 -rrb- with seawater and pumped it out into the south atlantic . " after just four days , the team observed a significant increase in algae , " said bathmann .
" it was a surprise that they reproduced so quickly . " in the previous experiments , it took 10 to 14 days for this to happen .
the haptophytes had responded to fertilization most . " other algae types barely increased or did not increase at all , " he said . haptophytes are common in coastal waters and blooms sometimes lead to them washing up on beaches as a foam .
tiny animals , the zooplankton , feed on them . " those organisms will eat a large part of the algae , " said the scientist , explaining that the zooplankton would breathe the carbon dioxide back into the surface water , instead of the gas sinking as dead algae to the ocean bottom . " at the moment , the algae are reproducing faster that than the zooplankton can eat them , " he said .
" the exciting question in the next few weeks will be how much of the algae will be left over . " that is why we can not make any predictions about how much carbon dioxide the algae are able to capture .

the president could sign it into law as early as monday , the white house said . but the victory did not come with the bipartisan support his administration had originally hoped for .
obama instead relied on the democratic party 's majorities in both chambers . the house of representatives approved the plan 246-183 on friday afternoon .
not one member of the house 's republicans supported the measure and seven democratic congressmen also voted against the bill . the senate followed suit friday evening by 60-38 , garnering the support of only three republicans and just barely meeting the 60-vote threshold .

obama instead relied on the democratic party 's majorities in both chambers . the house of representatives approved the plan 246-183 on friday afternoon .
not one member of the house 's republicans supported the measure and seven democratic congressmen also voted against the bill . most republicans have vociferously opposed the plan as too large and focused on government spending rather than tax cuts that would better revive the economy .

about 3.6 million jobs have been lost since the us entered a recession in december 2007 .
obama , who could sign the bill as early as monday , warned that the economic crisis was far from over despite the new injection of government funds into the world 's largest economy .
" passing this plan is a critical step , " he said .
" but it is only the beginning . "
obama has warned congress that any delay could cost thousands more jobs .
but republicans and some democrats complained the process was being unnecessarily rushed through the legislature in order to meet a self-imposed deadline of this weekend .

the trend is toward electric cars , hybrid models , downsized combustion engines and smaller cars .
" geneva will be especially interesting for the small car segment , " according to german car analyst professor ferdinand dudenhoeffer , " giving a preview of what 's to come after the crisis - sometime after the year 2010 . "
the geneva show comes at a time when several european governments are providing stimulus packages and tax incentives to kick-start their domestic car industries as many workers are being made redundant or are working on short time .
first hopeful signs of a recovery can be seen in germany where the government is offering buyers of new cars a 2,500-euro -lrb- $ 3,222 -rrb- cashback scheme , if they scrap their old car - which must be at least nine years old .
some dealers are reporting up to ten times more business although official figures are not yet available .
a deep crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french government wants to help french auto producers amid the global economic crisis but the crisis is far from over yet .
the french government is injecting an additional 6 billion euros into the country 's car industry after renault ceo carlos ghosn warned that up to 20 percent of jobs in the car industry could be lost in europe this year as producers , suppliers and dealers have been badly hit by the global economic crisis .
even sports car manufacturer porsche , which long appeared to be riding out the storm , is feeling the pinch .
sales have plunged 18 percent since august 2008 .
nevertheless , all major car makers are expected to showcase their new vehicles in geneva with exhibitors making a special green pavilion available in which at least a dozen manufacturers are set to present clean technology vehicles .
the swiss specialist firm rinspeed is unveiling its ichange futuristic concept , designed to encourage innovative thinking among car makers .
it is not only fitted with a zero-emission 130 kw electric engine , but raises the rear end to add two additional seats behind the driver at the press of button .
" we have developed an extremely flexible vehicle , not only illustrating the theme of variability but also reflecting continuously changing energy needs , " says chief executive frank m. rinderknecht .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 14.02.2009 german primary schoolers get textbook on islam großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religion is a standard part of the school curriculum in germany .
" my book about islam " is the first schoolbook on the muslim faith to be approved for young children in germany .
the authors hope it will help foster understanding by dispelling myths about the followers of the koran . " my book about islam " is intended for muslim children , who come from different ethnic backgrounds and offers different interpretations of the islamic faith , according to evelin lubig-fohsel , one of the textbook 's authors .
" we 're going on the assumption that there is no such thing as the absolute correct islam and believe that this book can be the basis for various strands of the faith , " she said .
the book made its appearance this past week at the opening of the annual " didacta " educational book fair in the northern city of hanover .
it has also been introduced to primary schools in two german states , bavaria and north rhine-westphalia , which has a large muslim minority .
in an educational system where religious instruction about christianity is a standard part of the state-run school curriculum , the move is intended to promote greater tolerance and understanding of other faiths , according to the munich publishers of the textbook , oldenbourg . " young children can learn about and respect other world religions , " the publishers said in a statement .
fostering religious identity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the textbook has just been approved in two german states .
" the point of the book is to foster the religious identity of muslim children in a country that is predominantly christian so they do n't wind up being manipulated by the media , and not just the media , but perhaps even by their own mosque or community , " said one of the book 's authors , primary school teacher gül solgun-kaps .
since the majority of muslims in europe practice the sunni as opposed to the shiite faith , which differ in their beliefs as to the rightful heirs of the prophet muhammad , the textbook emphasizes sunni islam and discusses differences in national practices , but looks for common ground between the two branches . an appreciation of the different strains within a religion also helps to further dialogue with other faiths , such as christianity and judaism , according to solgun-kaps .
" it 's important for kids to know the core message of other religious faiths , " she said , adding that an understanding of such growing diversity in germany fosters peaceful co-existence not just in school , but in life too .
a bosnian child for instance would have the chance to talk about how ramadan is celebrated in his country , which is different from the fasting rituals of a pakistani or turkish family .
gender roles discussed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book also depicts muslim women without a headscarf .
the role of religion in daily life is a thread that runs through the book .
gender roles are also addressed and here the book is modern in its outlook .
a young boy is just as likely to set the dinner table as his sister , muslim women are depicted without head coverings and even men are laboring over the stove preparing family meals .
one of the book 's aims is to show children the compatibility of islam with democratic and egalitarian values , since muslim pupils and their parents , as well as christians or secular germans , often perceive the religion as being the antithesis of modernity .
" we want to reduce the fear factor about islam with this book , and show that muslims and non-muslims can live peacefully side by side , " said lubig fohsel . zoran arbutina -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the movie screened in the berlinales 's panorama section , which showcases independent and art-house cinema . " the yes men fix the world , " which was directed by mike bonanno , andy bichlbaum and kurt engfehr followed the yes men 's 2003 movie in which they impersonated employees of the world trade organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the storm " won a special prize awarded by the amnesty international movie-goers attending the berlin film festival were asked to cast their votes for the films screened in the panorama section , which screened a total of 48 movies films .
about 21,000 votes were cast . also on saturday as part of the berlinale , israeli-born director oren moverman won the peace prize for " the messenger , " a movie about two traumatized us soldiers back from iraq and on a new assignment to tell families their loved ones have been killed in combat . valued at 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 6,432 -rrb- , the first peace prize was awarded in 1986 . at the same time , german director hans-christian schmid won the amnesty international film prize for his thriller sturm -lrb- storm -rrb- , which is based around the war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia . starring ben foster and woody harrelson , " the messenger " along with sturm are favorites in the battle for the berlinale 's coveted golden bear , which is to be awarded on saturday . films in the age of war and terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brenda blethyn stars in rachid bouchareb 's " london river " a total of 18 films competed for the berlinale 's top honors with the field wide open in the race for the festival 's main prizes . among the leading contenders are paris-born rachid bouchareb 's " london river " and israeli-born oren moverman 's post-iraq-war film " the messenger . "
both helped to raise hopes about the berlinale 's main competition after a slow and uninspiring start to what is one of world 's top three festivals . with the berlinale never prepared to shy away from hard-edged political stories , " london river " is a compelling story of a muslim father and a christian mother searching for their children in the aftermath of london 's july 7 terrorist attacks .
it stars brenda blethyn and sotigui kouyate . iranian director asghar farhadi 's " about elly , " has also emerged as a possible favorite for the golden bear .
farhadi 's film explores the fine line between truth and lies in middle-class iranian society after a young woman suddenly vanishes . outcome impossible to predict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jury is out on who 'll win the top prizes this year but film festival juries are notoriously difficult to predict .
the berlinale 's seven-member international jury , headed up by academy award-winning british actress tilda swinton , also has to hand out festival prizes for best director , as well as awards for best actor and actress . indeed , top chinese actress zhang ziyi could also be recognized by the jury for her role as the lover of famed 20th-century peking opera star mei lan-fang , in beijing director chen kaige 's lavishly filmed " forever enthralled . " other possible contenders include german director maren ade 's " alle anderen " -lrb- everyone else -rrb- about a young couple that find their relationship is put to the test and british-born peter strickland 's " katalin varga . " set in transylvania , strickland 's first feature film tells the story of a woman who embarks on a journey of revenge as she travels through the carpathian mountains in search of her son 's real father .
once again , a major focus of the berlinale was stories about women . another film that could stand a chance of going home with a prize is british-born richard loncraine 's 1950 's comedy " my one and only , " which was a last-minute entry in the berlinale 's main competition . it stars hollywood actress renee zellweger as a mother who takes her two teenage sons on a road trip across america in search of a husband . stars out in force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clive owen stars in tom tykwer 's " the international " certainly the main focus of the world 's leading film festivals is about star power and this year 's berlinale has again managed to attract some of the biggest names in the business , including clive owen , kate winslet , michelle pfeiffer , demi moore , steve martin , keanu reeves and gael garcia bernal . but overhanging this year 's berlinale was the deepening sense of gloom in the global movie business as it braces itself for what is expected to be a tough 12 months of cost-cutting , layoffs and projects being put on hold . many of those attending the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- - the business side of the berlinale - appear somewhat relieved that the numbers of deals arranged over the last ten days meant that the efm was not quite as bad as many had expected . unusually for the world 's top film festivals , the berlinale opens up its screenings to the general public .
there appears to be no shortage of enthusiasm for the festival among ordinary moviegoers . by its midway point , the berlinale had sold a record 270,000 tickets .
last year ticket sales totaled 240,000 .
after saturday 's awards , berlinale movie screenings will continue for a final day on sunday as the festival draws to a close . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" my book about islam " is the first schoolbook on the muslim faith to be approved for young children in germany .
the authors hope it will help foster understanding by dispelling myths about the followers of the koran . " my book about islam " is intended for muslim children , who come from different ethnic backgrounds and offers different interpretations of the islamic faith , according to evelin lubig-fohsel , one of the textbook 's authors .
" we 're going on the assumption that there is no such thing as the absolute correct islam and believe that this book can be the basis for various strands of the faith , " she said .
the book made its appearance this past week at the opening of the annual " didacta " educational book fair in the northern city of hanover .
it has also been introduced to primary schools in two german states , bavaria and north rhine-westphalia , which has a large muslim minority .
in an educational system where religious instruction about christianity is a standard part of the state-run school curriculum , the move is intended to promote greater tolerance and understanding of other faiths , according to the munich publishers of the textbook , oldenbourg . " young children can learn about and respect other world religions , " the publishers said in a statement .
fostering religious identity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the textbook has just been approved in two german states .
" the point of the book is to foster the religious identity of muslim children in a country that is predominantly christian so they do n't wind up being manipulated by the media , and not just the media , but perhaps even by their own mosque or community , " said one of the book 's authors , primary school teacher gül solgun-kaps .
since the majority of muslims in europe practice the sunni as opposed to the shiite faith , which differ in their beliefs as to the rightful heirs of the prophet muhammad , the textbook emphasizes sunni islam and discusses differences in national practices , but looks for common ground between the two branches . an appreciation of the different strains within a religion also helps to further dialogue with other faiths , such as christianity and judaism , according to solgun-kaps .
" it 's important for kids to know the core message of other religious faiths , " she said , adding that an understanding of such growing diversity in germany fosters peaceful co-existence not just in school , but in life too .
a bosnian child for instance would have the chance to talk about how ramadan is celebrated in his country , which is different from the fasting rituals of a pakistani or turkish family .
gender roles discussed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book also depicts muslim women without a headscarf .
the role of religion in daily life is a thread that runs through the book .
gender roles are also addressed and here the book is modern in its outlook .
a young boy is just as likely to set the dinner table as his sister , muslim women are depicted without head coverings and even men are laboring over the stove preparing family meals .
one of the book 's aims is to show children the compatibility of islam with democratic and egalitarian values , since muslim pupils and their parents , as well as christians or secular germans , often perceive the religion as being the antithesis of modernity .

" my book about islam " is the first schoolbook on the muslim faith to be approved for young children in germany .
the authors hope it will help foster understanding by dispelling myths about the followers of the koran . " my book about islam " is intended for muslim children , who come from different ethnic backgrounds and offers different interpretations of the islamic faith , according to evelin lubig-fohsel , one of the textbook 's authors .
" we 're going on the assumption that there is no such thing as the absolute correct islam and believe that this book can be the basis for various strands of the faith , " she said .
the book made its appearance this past week at the opening of the annual " didacta " educational book fair in the northern city of hanover .
it has also been introduced to primary schools in two german states , bavaria and north rhine-westphalia , which has a large muslim minority .
in an educational system where religious instruction about christianity is a standard part of the state-run school curriculum , the move is intended to promote greater tolerance and understanding of other faiths , according to the munich publishers of the textbook , oldenbourg . " young children can learn about and respect other world religions , " the publishers said in a statement .
fostering religious identity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the textbook has just been approved in two german states .
" the point of the book is to foster the religious identity of muslim children in a country that is predominantly christian so they do n't wind up being manipulated by the media , and not just the media , but perhaps even by their own mosque or community , " said one of the book 's authors , primary school teacher gül solgun-kaps .
since the majority of muslims in europe practice the sunni as opposed to the shiite faith , which differ in their beliefs as to the rightful heirs of the prophet muhammad , the textbook emphasizes sunni islam and discusses differences in national practices , but looks for common ground between the two branches . an appreciation of the different strains within a religion also helps to further dialogue with other faiths , such as christianity and judaism , according to solgun-kaps .
" it 's important for kids to know the core message of other religious faiths , " she said , adding that an understanding of such growing diversity in germany fosters peaceful co-existence not just in school , but in life too .
a bosnian child for instance would have the chance to talk about how ramadan is celebrated in his country , which is different from the fasting rituals of a pakistani or turkish family .
gender roles discussed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book also depicts muslim women without a headscarf .
the role of religion in daily life is a thread that runs through the book .
gender roles are also addressed and here the book is modern in its outlook .
a young boy is just as likely to set the dinner table as his sister , muslim women are depicted without head coverings and even men are laboring over the stove preparing family meals .
one of the book 's aims is to show children the compatibility of islam with democratic and egalitarian values , since muslim pupils and their parents , as well as christians or secular germans , often perceive the religion as being the antithesis of modernity .

" my book about islam " is the first schoolbook on the muslim faith to be approved for young children in germany .
the authors hope it will help foster understanding by dispelling myths about the followers of the koran . " my book about islam " is intended for muslim children , who come from different ethnic backgrounds and offers different interpretations of the islamic faith , according to evelin lubig-fohsel , one of the textbook 's authors .
" we 're going on the assumption that there is no such thing as the absolute correct islam and believe that this book can be the basis for various strands of the faith , " she said .
the book made its appearance this past week at the opening of the annual " didacta " educational book fair in the northern city of hanover .
it has also been introduced to primary schools in two german states , bavaria and north rhine-westphalia , which has a large muslim minority .
in an educational system where religious instruction about christianity is a standard part of the state-run school curriculum , the move is intended to promote greater tolerance and understanding of other faiths , according to the munich publishers of the textbook , oldenbourg . " young children can learn about and respect other world religions , " the publishers said in a statement .
fostering religious identity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the textbook has just been approved in two german states .
" the point of the book is to foster the religious identity of muslim children in a country that is predominantly christian so they do n't wind up being manipulated by the media , and not just the media , but perhaps even by their own mosque or community , " said one of the book 's authors , primary school teacher gül solgun-kaps .
since the majority of muslims in europe practice the sunni as opposed to the shiite faith , which differ in their beliefs as to the rightful heirs of the prophet muhammad , the textbook emphasizes sunni islam and discusses differences in national practices , but looks for common ground between the two branches . an appreciation of the different strains within a religion also helps to further dialogue with other faiths , such as christianity and judaism , according to solgun-kaps .
" it 's important for kids to know the core message of other religious faiths , " she said , adding that an understanding of such growing diversity in germany fosters peaceful co-existence not just in school , but in life too .
a bosnian child for instance would have the chance to talk about how ramadan is celebrated in his country , which is different from the fasting rituals of a pakistani or turkish family .
gender roles discussed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book also depicts muslim women without a headscarf .
the role of religion in daily life is a thread that runs through the book .
gender roles are also addressed and here the book is modern in its outlook .
a young boy is just as likely to set the dinner table as his sister , muslim women are depicted without head coverings and even men are laboring over the stove preparing family meals .
one of the book 's aims is to show children the compatibility of islam with democratic and egalitarian values , since muslim pupils and their parents , as well as christians or secular germans , often perceive the religion as being the antithesis of modernity .
" we want to reduce the fear factor about islam with this book , and show that muslims and non-muslims can live peacefully side by side , " said lubig fohsel . zoran arbutina -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the awi experiment has met bitter opposition in germany from some environmentalists who fear that using algae to sequester carbon dioxide in the ocean might wreck the ecosystem .
awi says the debate requires facts , which the scientists are obtaining now . bathmann added it was still not certain if algae could capture vast amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and keep it out of circulation long term . project lohafex the experiment , codenamed lohafex , is continuing aboard a german ship , the polarstern , until mid-march .
the ship mixed 10 tons of ferrous sulphate -lrb- feso4 -rrb- with seawater and pumped it out into the south atlantic . " after just four days , the team observed a significant increase in algae , " said bathmann .
" it was a surprise that they reproduced so quickly . " in the previous experiments , it took 10 to 14 days for this to happen .
the haptophytes had responded to fertilization most . " other algae types barely increased or did not increase at all , " he said . haptophytes are common in coastal waters and blooms sometimes lead to them washing up on beaches as a foam .
tiny animals , the zooplankton , feed on them . " those organisms will eat a large part of the algae , " said the scientist , explaining that the zooplankton would breathe the carbon dioxide back into the surface water , instead of the gas sinking as dead algae to the ocean bottom . " at the moment , the algae are reproducing faster that than the zooplankton can eat them , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 14.02.2009 german primary schoolers get textbook on islam großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religion is a standard part of the school curriculum in germany .
" my book about islam " is the first schoolbook on the muslim faith to be approved for young children in germany .
the authors hope it will help foster understanding by dispelling myths about the followers of the koran . " my book about islam " is intended for muslim children , who come from different ethnic backgrounds and offers different interpretations of the islamic faith , according to evelin lubig-fohsel , one of the textbook 's authors .
" we 're going on the assumption that there is no such thing as the absolute correct islam and believe that this book can be the basis for various strands of the faith , " she said .
the book made its appearance this past week at the opening of the annual " didacta " educational book fair in the northern city of hanover .
it has also been introduced to primary schools in two german states , bavaria and north rhine-westphalia , which has a large muslim minority .
in an educational system where religious instruction about christianity is a standard part of the state-run school curriculum , the move is intended to promote greater tolerance and understanding of other faiths , according to the munich publishers of the textbook , oldenbourg . " young children can learn about and respect other world religions , " the publishers said in a statement .
fostering religious identity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the textbook has just been approved in two german states .
" the point of the book is to foster the religious identity of muslim children in a country that is predominantly christian so they do n't wind up being manipulated by the media , and not just the media , but perhaps even by their own mosque or community , " said one of the book 's authors , primary school teacher gül solgun-kaps .
since the majority of muslims in europe practice the sunni as opposed to the shiite faith , which differ in their beliefs as to the rightful heirs of the prophet muhammad , the textbook emphasizes sunni islam and discusses differences in national practices , but looks for common ground between the two branches . an appreciation of the different strains within a religion also helps to further dialogue with other faiths , such as christianity and judaism , according to solgun-kaps .
" it 's important for kids to know the core message of other religious faiths , " she said , adding that an understanding of such growing diversity in germany fosters peaceful co-existence not just in school , but in life too .
a bosnian child for instance would have the chance to talk about how ramadan is celebrated in his country , which is different from the fasting rituals of a pakistani or turkish family .
gender roles discussed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book also depicts muslim women without a headscarf .
the role of religion in daily life is a thread that runs through the book .
gender roles are also addressed and here the book is modern in its outlook .
a young boy is just as likely to set the dinner table as his sister , muslim women are depicted without head coverings and even men are laboring over the stove preparing family meals .
one of the book 's aims is to show children the compatibility of islam with democratic and egalitarian values , since muslim pupils and their parents , as well as christians or secular germans , often perceive the religion as being the antithesis of modernity .
" we want to reduce the fear factor about islam with this book , and show that muslims and non-muslims can live peacefully side by side , " said lubig fohsel . zoran arbutina -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

awi says the debate requires facts , which the scientists are obtaining now . bathmann added it was still not certain if algae could capture vast amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and keep it out of circulation long term . project lohafex the experiment , codenamed lohafex , is continuing aboard a german ship , the polarstern , until mid-march .
the ship mixed 10 tons of ferrous sulphate -lrb- feso4 -rrb- with seawater and pumped it out into the south atlantic . " after just four days , the team observed a significant increase in algae , " said bathmann .
" it was a surprise that they reproduced so quickly . " in the previous experiments , it took 10 to 14 days for this to happen .
the haptophytes had responded to fertilization most . " other algae types barely increased or did not increase at all , " he said . haptophytes are common in coastal waters and blooms sometimes lead to them washing up on beaches as a foam .
tiny animals , the zooplankton , feed on them . " those organisms will eat a large part of the algae , " said the scientist , explaining that the zooplankton would breathe the carbon dioxide back into the surface water , instead of the gas sinking as dead algae to the ocean bottom . " at the moment , the algae are reproducing faster that than the zooplankton can eat them , " he said .
" the exciting question in the next few weeks will be how much of the algae will be left over . " that is why we can not make any predictions about how much carbon dioxide the algae are able to capture .

the trend is toward electric cars , hybrid models , downsized combustion engines and smaller cars .
" geneva will be especially interesting for the small car segment , " according to german car analyst professor ferdinand dudenhoeffer , " giving a preview of what 's to come after the crisis - sometime after the year 2010 . "
the geneva show comes at a time when several european governments are providing stimulus packages and tax incentives to kick-start their domestic car industries as many workers are being made redundant or are working on short time .
first hopeful signs of a recovery can be seen in germany where the government is offering buyers of new cars a 2,500-euro -lrb- $ 3,222 -rrb- cashback scheme , if they scrap their old car - which must be at least nine years old .
some dealers are reporting up to ten times more business although official figures are not yet available .
a deep crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french government wants to help french auto producers amid the global economic crisis but the crisis is far from over yet .
the french government is injecting an additional 6 billion euros into the country 's car industry after renault ceo carlos ghosn warned that up to 20 percent of jobs in the car industry could be lost in europe this year as producers , suppliers and dealers have been badly hit by the global economic crisis .
even sports car manufacturer porsche , which long appeared to be riding out the storm , is feeling the pinch .
sales have plunged 18 percent since august 2008 .
nevertheless , all major car makers are expected to showcase their new vehicles in geneva with exhibitors making a special green pavilion available in which at least a dozen manufacturers are set to present clean technology vehicles .
the swiss specialist firm rinspeed is unveiling its ichange futuristic concept , designed to encourage innovative thinking among car makers .
it is not only fitted with a zero-emission 130 kw electric engine , but raises the rear end to add two additional seats behind the driver at the press of button .
" we have developed an extremely flexible vehicle , not only illustrating the theme of variability but also reflecting continuously changing energy needs , " says chief executive frank m. rinderknecht .
sporty and energy-efficient bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the geneva motor show is expected to be more upbeat that the event in detroit volkswagen will launch its new polo , which has a sportier look and energy-efficient engine .
the polo is expected to come out in a special , fuel-saving diesel version with start-stop technology reducing fuel consumption to 3.5 litres per 100km .
carbon dioxide emissions are expected to come to just 89 grams per kilometre .
peugeot is presenting a revised version of the 206 in the small car segment .
further up the model line-up , the peugeot 3008 is a mixture of station wagon and suv -lrb- sport utility vehicle -rrb- .
like the 308 , it features a large glass roof with a modular boot system .
the most efficient engine of the 3008 has a consumption of 4.9 litres .
a hybrid version is being planned for the first time in the peugeot citroen psa concern for 2011 .
bmw is presenting a new entry model for the mini one .
consumption is listed at 5.3 litres which translates to a c02 emission figure of 128 g / km .
brake regeneration energy , start-stop technology and six-gear transmission are standard .
japanese car maker mazda will debut its fuel-efficient mazda3 fitted with start-stop that promises 12 percent more fuel efficiency .
the high-performance mazda3mps flagship will feature a 2.3-litre engine with an output of 260 horsepower .
" the show will not be all gloom and doom , " says car market expert nick margetts .
many customers will by then be looking at new cars afresh , since many european governments will by march have finalized their plans to stimulate the industry . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" my book about islam " is the first schoolbook on the muslim faith to be approved for young children in germany .
the authors hope it will help foster understanding by dispelling myths about the followers of the koran . " my book about islam " is intended for muslim children , who come from different ethnic backgrounds and offers different interpretations of the islamic faith , according to evelin lubig-fohsel , one of the textbook 's authors .
" we 're going on the assumption that there is no such thing as the absolute correct islam and believe that this book can be the basis for various strands of the faith , " she said .
the book made its appearance this past week at the opening of the annual " didacta " educational book fair in the northern city of hanover .
it has also been introduced to primary schools in two german states , bavaria and north rhine-westphalia , which has a large muslim minority .
in an educational system where religious instruction about christianity is a standard part of the state-run school curriculum , the move is intended to promote greater tolerance and understanding of other faiths , according to the munich publishers of the textbook , oldenbourg . " young children can learn about and respect other world religions , " the publishers said in a statement .
fostering religious identity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the textbook has just been approved in two german states .
" the point of the book is to foster the religious identity of muslim children in a country that is predominantly christian so they do n't wind up being manipulated by the media , and not just the media , but perhaps even by their own mosque or community , " said one of the book 's authors , primary school teacher gül solgun-kaps .
since the majority of muslims in europe practice the sunni as opposed to the shiite faith , which differ in their beliefs as to the rightful heirs of the prophet muhammad , the textbook emphasizes sunni islam and discusses differences in national practices , but looks for common ground between the two branches . an appreciation of the different strains within a religion also helps to further dialogue with other faiths , such as christianity and judaism , according to solgun-kaps .
" it 's important for kids to know the core message of other religious faiths , " she said , adding that an understanding of such growing diversity in germany fosters peaceful co-existence not just in school , but in life too .
a bosnian child for instance would have the chance to talk about how ramadan is celebrated in his country , which is different from the fasting rituals of a pakistani or turkish family .
gender roles discussed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book also depicts muslim women without a headscarf .
the role of religion in daily life is a thread that runs through the book .
gender roles are also addressed and here the book is modern in its outlook .
a young boy is just as likely to set the dinner table as his sister , muslim women are depicted without head coverings and even men are laboring over the stove preparing family meals .
one of the book 's aims is to show children the compatibility of islam with democratic and egalitarian values , since muslim pupils and their parents , as well as christians or secular germans , often perceive the religion as being the antithesis of modernity .
" we want to reduce the fear factor about islam with this book , and show that muslims and non-muslims can live peacefully side by side , " said lubig fohsel . zoran arbutina -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the movie screened in the berlinales 's panorama section , which showcases independent and art-house cinema . " the yes men fix the world , " which was directed by mike bonanno , andy bichlbaum and kurt engfehr followed the yes men 's 2003 movie in which they impersonated employees of the world trade organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the storm " won a special prize awarded by the amnesty international movie-goers attending the berlin film festival were asked to cast their votes for the films screened in the panorama section , which screened a total of 48 movies films .
about 21,000 votes were cast . also on saturday as part of the berlinale , israeli-born director oren moverman won the peace prize for " the messenger , " a movie about two traumatized us soldiers back from iraq and on a new assignment to tell families their loved ones have been killed in combat . valued at 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 6,432 -rrb- , the first peace prize was awarded in 1986 . at the same time , german director hans-christian schmid won the amnesty international film prize for his thriller sturm -lrb- storm -rrb- , which is based around the war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia . starring ben foster and woody harrelson , " the messenger " along with sturm are favorites in the battle for the berlinale 's coveted golden bear , which is to be awarded on saturday . films in the age of war and terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brenda blethyn stars in rachid bouchareb 's " london river " a total of 18 films competed for the berlinale 's top honors with the field wide open in the race for the festival 's main prizes . among the leading contenders are paris-born rachid bouchareb 's " london river " and israeli-born oren moverman 's post-iraq-war film " the messenger . "
both helped to raise hopes about the berlinale 's main competition after a slow and uninspiring start to what is one of world 's top three festivals . with the berlinale never prepared to shy away from hard-edged political stories , " london river " is a compelling story of a muslim father and a christian mother searching for their children in the aftermath of london 's july 7 terrorist attacks .
it stars brenda blethyn and sotigui kouyate . iranian director asghar farhadi 's " about elly , " has also emerged as a possible favorite for the golden bear .
farhadi 's film explores the fine line between truth and lies in middle-class iranian society after a young woman suddenly vanishes . outcome impossible to predict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jury is out on who 'll win the top prizes this year but film festival juries are notoriously difficult to predict .
the berlinale 's seven-member international jury , headed up by academy award-winning british actress tilda swinton , also has to hand out festival prizes for best director , as well as awards for best actor and actress . indeed , top chinese actress zhang ziyi could also be recognized by the jury for her role as the lover of famed 20th-century peking opera star mei lan-fang , in beijing director chen kaige 's lavishly filmed " forever enthralled . " other possible contenders include german director maren ade 's " alle anderen " -lrb- everyone else -rrb- about a young couple that find their relationship is put to the test and british-born peter strickland 's " katalin varga . " set in transylvania , strickland 's first feature film tells the story of a woman who embarks on a journey of revenge as she travels through the carpathian mountains in search of her son 's real father .
once again , a major focus of the berlinale was stories about women . another film that could stand a chance of going home with a prize is british-born richard loncraine 's 1950 's comedy " my one and only , " which was a last-minute entry in the berlinale 's main competition . it stars hollywood actress renee zellweger as a mother who takes her two teenage sons on a road trip across america in search of a husband . stars out in force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clive owen stars in tom tykwer 's " the international " certainly the main focus of the world 's leading film festivals is about star power and this year 's berlinale has again managed to attract some of the biggest names in the business , including clive owen , kate winslet , michelle pfeiffer , demi moore , steve martin , keanu reeves and gael garcia bernal . but overhanging this year 's berlinale was the deepening sense of gloom in the global movie business as it braces itself for what is expected to be a tough 12 months of cost-cutting , layoffs and projects being put on hold . many of those attending the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- - the business side of the berlinale - appear somewhat relieved that the numbers of deals arranged over the last ten days meant that the efm was not quite as bad as many had expected . unusually for the world 's top film festivals , the berlinale opens up its screenings to the general public .
there appears to be no shortage of enthusiasm for the festival among ordinary moviegoers . by its midway point , the berlinale had sold a record 270,000 tickets .
last year ticket sales totaled 240,000 .
after saturday 's awards , berlinale movie screenings will continue for a final day on sunday as the festival draws to a close . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" my book about islam " is the first schoolbook on the muslim faith to be approved for young children in germany .
the authors hope it will help foster understanding by dispelling myths about the followers of the koran . " my book about islam " is intended for muslim children , who come from different ethnic backgrounds and offers different interpretations of the islamic faith , according to evelin lubig-fohsel , one of the textbook 's authors .
" we 're going on the assumption that there is no such thing as the absolute correct islam and believe that this book can be the basis for various strands of the faith , " she said .
the book made its appearance this past week at the opening of the annual " didacta " educational book fair in the northern city of hanover .
it has also been introduced to primary schools in two german states , bavaria and north rhine-westphalia , which has a large muslim minority .
in an educational system where religious instruction about christianity is a standard part of the state-run school curriculum , the move is intended to promote greater tolerance and understanding of other faiths , according to the munich publishers of the textbook , oldenbourg . " young children can learn about and respect other world religions , " the publishers said in a statement .
fostering religious identity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the textbook has just been approved in two german states .
" the point of the book is to foster the religious identity of muslim children in a country that is predominantly christian so they do n't wind up being manipulated by the media , and not just the media , but perhaps even by their own mosque or community , " said one of the book 's authors , primary school teacher gül solgun-kaps .
since the majority of muslims in europe practice the sunni as opposed to the shiite faith , which differ in their beliefs as to the rightful heirs of the prophet muhammad , the textbook emphasizes sunni islam and discusses differences in national practices , but looks for common ground between the two branches . an appreciation of the different strains within a religion also helps to further dialogue with other faiths , such as christianity and judaism , according to solgun-kaps .
" it 's important for kids to know the core message of other religious faiths , " she said , adding that an understanding of such growing diversity in germany fosters peaceful co-existence not just in school , but in life too .
a bosnian child for instance would have the chance to talk about how ramadan is celebrated in his country , which is different from the fasting rituals of a pakistani or turkish family .
gender roles discussed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book also depicts muslim women without a headscarf .
the role of religion in daily life is a thread that runs through the book .
gender roles are also addressed and here the book is modern in its outlook .
a young boy is just as likely to set the dinner table as his sister , muslim women are depicted without head coverings and even men are laboring over the stove preparing family meals .
one of the book 's aims is to show children the compatibility of islam with democratic and egalitarian values , since muslim pupils and their parents , as well as christians or secular germans , often perceive the religion as being the antithesis of modernity .
" we want to reduce the fear factor about islam with this book , and show that muslims and non-muslims can live peacefully side by side , " said lubig fohsel . zoran arbutina -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the movie screened in the berlinales 's panorama section , which showcases independent and art-house cinema . " the yes men fix the world , " which was directed by mike bonanno , andy bichlbaum and kurt engfehr followed the yes men 's 2003 movie in which they impersonated employees of the world trade organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the storm " won a special prize awarded by the amnesty international movie-goers attending the berlin film festival were asked to cast their votes for the films screened in the panorama section , which screened a total of 48 movies films .
about 21,000 votes were cast . also on saturday as part of the berlinale , israeli-born director oren moverman won the peace prize for " the messenger , " a movie about two traumatized us soldiers back from iraq and on a new assignment to tell families their loved ones have been killed in combat . valued at 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 6,432 -rrb- , the first peace prize was awarded in 1986 . at the same time , german director hans-christian schmid won the amnesty international film prize for his thriller sturm -lrb- storm -rrb- , which is based around the war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia . starring ben foster and woody harrelson , " the messenger " along with sturm are favorites in the battle for the berlinale 's coveted golden bear , which is to be awarded on saturday . films in the age of war and terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brenda blethyn stars in rachid bouchareb 's " london river " a total of 18 films competed for the berlinale 's top honors with the field wide open in the race for the festival 's main prizes . among the leading contenders are paris-born rachid bouchareb 's " london river " and israeli-born oren moverman 's post-iraq-war film " the messenger . "
both helped to raise hopes about the berlinale 's main competition after a slow and uninspiring start to what is one of world 's top three festivals . with the berlinale never prepared to shy away from hard-edged political stories , " london river " is a compelling story of a muslim father and a christian mother searching for their children in the aftermath of london 's july 7 terrorist attacks .
it stars brenda blethyn and sotigui kouyate . iranian director asghar farhadi 's " about elly , " has also emerged as a possible favorite for the golden bear .
farhadi 's film explores the fine line between truth and lies in middle-class iranian society after a young woman suddenly vanishes . outcome impossible to predict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jury is out on who 'll win the top prizes this year but film festival juries are notoriously difficult to predict .
the berlinale 's seven-member international jury , headed up by academy award-winning british actress tilda swinton , also has to hand out festival prizes for best director , as well as awards for best actor and actress . indeed , top chinese actress zhang ziyi could also be recognized by the jury for her role as the lover of famed 20th-century peking opera star mei lan-fang , in beijing director chen kaige 's lavishly filmed " forever enthralled . " other possible contenders include german director maren ade 's " alle anderen " -lrb- everyone else -rrb- about a young couple that find their relationship is put to the test and british-born peter strickland 's " katalin varga . " set in transylvania , strickland 's first feature film tells the story of a woman who embarks on a journey of revenge as she travels through the carpathian mountains in search of her son 's real father .
once again , a major focus of the berlinale was stories about women . another film that could stand a chance of going home with a prize is british-born richard loncraine 's 1950 's comedy " my one and only , " which was a last-minute entry in the berlinale 's main competition . it stars hollywood actress renee zellweger as a mother who takes her two teenage sons on a road trip across america in search of a husband . stars out in force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clive owen stars in tom tykwer 's " the international " certainly the main focus of the world 's leading film festivals is about star power and this year 's berlinale has again managed to attract some of the biggest names in the business , including clive owen , kate winslet , michelle pfeiffer , demi moore , steve martin , keanu reeves and gael garcia bernal . but overhanging this year 's berlinale was the deepening sense of gloom in the global movie business as it braces itself for what is expected to be a tough 12 months of cost-cutting , layoffs and projects being put on hold . many of those attending the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- - the business side of the berlinale - appear somewhat relieved that the numbers of deals arranged over the last ten days meant that the efm was not quite as bad as many had expected . unusually for the world 's top film festivals , the berlinale opens up its screenings to the general public .
there appears to be no shortage of enthusiasm for the festival among ordinary moviegoers . by its midway point , the berlinale had sold a record 270,000 tickets .

" my book about islam " is the first schoolbook on the muslim faith to be approved for young children in germany .
the authors hope it will help foster understanding by dispelling myths about the followers of the koran . " my book about islam " is intended for muslim children , who come from different ethnic backgrounds and offers different interpretations of the islamic faith , according to evelin lubig-fohsel , one of the textbook 's authors .
" we 're going on the assumption that there is no such thing as the absolute correct islam and believe that this book can be the basis for various strands of the faith , " she said .
the book made its appearance this past week at the opening of the annual " didacta " educational book fair in the northern city of hanover .
it has also been introduced to primary schools in two german states , bavaria and north rhine-westphalia , which has a large muslim minority .
in an educational system where religious instruction about christianity is a standard part of the state-run school curriculum , the move is intended to promote greater tolerance and understanding of other faiths , according to the munich publishers of the textbook , oldenbourg . " young children can learn about and respect other world religions , " the publishers said in a statement .
fostering religious identity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the textbook has just been approved in two german states .
" the point of the book is to foster the religious identity of muslim children in a country that is predominantly christian so they do n't wind up being manipulated by the media , and not just the media , but perhaps even by their own mosque or community , " said one of the book 's authors , primary school teacher gül solgun-kaps .
since the majority of muslims in europe practice the sunni as opposed to the shiite faith , which differ in their beliefs as to the rightful heirs of the prophet muhammad , the textbook emphasizes sunni islam and discusses differences in national practices , but looks for common ground between the two branches . an appreciation of the different strains within a religion also helps to further dialogue with other faiths , such as christianity and judaism , according to solgun-kaps .
" it 's important for kids to know the core message of other religious faiths , " she said , adding that an understanding of such growing diversity in germany fosters peaceful co-existence not just in school , but in life too .
a bosnian child for instance would have the chance to talk about how ramadan is celebrated in his country , which is different from the fasting rituals of a pakistani or turkish family .
gender roles discussed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book also depicts muslim women without a headscarf .
the role of religion in daily life is a thread that runs through the book .
gender roles are also addressed and here the book is modern in its outlook .
a young boy is just as likely to set the dinner table as his sister , muslim women are depicted without head coverings and even men are laboring over the stove preparing family meals .
one of the book 's aims is to show children the compatibility of islam with democratic and egalitarian values , since muslim pupils and their parents , as well as christians or secular germans , often perceive the religion as being the antithesis of modernity .

the movie screened in the berlinales 's panorama section , which showcases independent and art-house cinema . " the yes men fix the world , " which was directed by mike bonanno , andy bichlbaum and kurt engfehr followed the yes men 's 2003 movie in which they impersonated employees of the world trade organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the storm " won a special prize awarded by the amnesty international movie-goers attending the berlin film festival were asked to cast their votes for the films screened in the panorama section , which screened a total of 48 movies films .
about 21,000 votes were cast . also on saturday as part of the berlinale , israeli-born director oren moverman won the peace prize for " the messenger , " a movie about two traumatized us soldiers back from iraq and on a new assignment to tell families their loved ones have been killed in combat . valued at 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 6,432 -rrb- , the first peace prize was awarded in 1986 . at the same time , german director hans-christian schmid won the amnesty international film prize for his thriller sturm -lrb- storm -rrb- , which is based around the war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia . starring ben foster and woody harrelson , " the messenger " along with sturm are favorites in the battle for the berlinale 's coveted golden bear , which is to be awarded on saturday . films in the age of war and terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brenda blethyn stars in rachid bouchareb 's " london river " a total of 18 films competed for the berlinale 's top honors with the field wide open in the race for the festival 's main prizes . among the leading contenders are paris-born rachid bouchareb 's " london river " and israeli-born oren moverman 's post-iraq-war film " the messenger . "
both helped to raise hopes about the berlinale 's main competition after a slow and uninspiring start to what is one of world 's top three festivals . with the berlinale never prepared to shy away from hard-edged political stories , " london river " is a compelling story of a muslim father and a christian mother searching for their children in the aftermath of london 's july 7 terrorist attacks .
it stars brenda blethyn and sotigui kouyate . iranian director asghar farhadi 's " about elly , " has also emerged as a possible favorite for the golden bear .
farhadi 's film explores the fine line between truth and lies in middle-class iranian society after a young woman suddenly vanishes . outcome impossible to predict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jury is out on who 'll win the top prizes this year but film festival juries are notoriously difficult to predict .
the berlinale 's seven-member international jury , headed up by academy award-winning british actress tilda swinton , also has to hand out festival prizes for best director , as well as awards for best actor and actress . indeed , top chinese actress zhang ziyi could also be recognized by the jury for her role as the lover of famed 20th-century peking opera star mei lan-fang , in beijing director chen kaige 's lavishly filmed " forever enthralled .

about 21,000 votes were cast . also on saturday as part of the berlinale , israeli-born director oren moverman won the peace prize for " the messenger , " a movie about two traumatized us soldiers back from iraq and on a new assignment to tell families their loved ones have been killed in combat . valued at 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 6,432 -rrb- , the first peace prize was awarded in 1986 . at the same time , german director hans-christian schmid won the amnesty international film prize for his thriller sturm -lrb- storm -rrb- , which is based around the war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia . starring ben foster and woody harrelson , " the messenger " along with sturm are favorites in the battle for the berlinale 's coveted golden bear , which is to be awarded on saturday . films in the age of war and terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brenda blethyn stars in rachid bouchareb 's " london river " a total of 18 films competed for the berlinale 's top honors with the field wide open in the race for the festival 's main prizes . among the leading contenders are paris-born rachid bouchareb 's " london river " and israeli-born oren moverman 's post-iraq-war film " the messenger . "
both helped to raise hopes about the berlinale 's main competition after a slow and uninspiring start to what is one of world 's top three festivals . with the berlinale never prepared to shy away from hard-edged political stories , " london river " is a compelling story of a muslim father and a christian mother searching for their children in the aftermath of london 's july 7 terrorist attacks .
it stars brenda blethyn and sotigui kouyate . iranian director asghar farhadi 's " about elly , " has also emerged as a possible favorite for the golden bear .
farhadi 's film explores the fine line between truth and lies in middle-class iranian society after a young woman suddenly vanishes . outcome impossible to predict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jury is out on who 'll win the top prizes this year but film festival juries are notoriously difficult to predict .
the berlinale 's seven-member international jury , headed up by academy award-winning british actress tilda swinton , also has to hand out festival prizes for best director , as well as awards for best actor and actress . indeed , top chinese actress zhang ziyi could also be recognized by the jury for her role as the lover of famed 20th-century peking opera star mei lan-fang , in beijing director chen kaige 's lavishly filmed " forever enthralled . " other possible contenders include german director maren ade 's " alle anderen " -lrb- everyone else -rrb- about a young couple that find their relationship is put to the test and british-born peter strickland 's " katalin varga . " set in transylvania , strickland 's first feature film tells the story of a woman who embarks on a journey of revenge as she travels through the carpathian mountains in search of her son 's real father .
once again , a major focus of the berlinale was stories about women . another film that could stand a chance of going home with a prize is british-born richard loncraine 's 1950 's comedy " my one and only , " which was a last-minute entry in the berlinale 's main competition . it stars hollywood actress renee zellweger as a mother who takes her two teenage sons on a road trip across america in search of a husband . stars out in force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clive owen stars in tom tykwer 's " the international " certainly the main focus of the world 's leading film festivals is about star power and this year 's berlinale has again managed to attract some of the biggest names in the business , including clive owen , kate winslet , michelle pfeiffer , demi moore , steve martin , keanu reeves and gael garcia bernal . but overhanging this year 's berlinale was the deepening sense of gloom in the global movie business as it braces itself for what is expected to be a tough 12 months of cost-cutting , layoffs and projects being put on hold . many of those attending the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- - the business side of the berlinale - appear somewhat relieved that the numbers of deals arranged over the last ten days meant that the efm was not quite as bad as many had expected . unusually for the world 's top film festivals , the berlinale opens up its screenings to the general public .

the movie screened in the berlinales 's panorama section , which showcases independent and art-house cinema . " the yes men fix the world , " which was directed by mike bonanno , andy bichlbaum and kurt engfehr followed the yes men 's 2003 movie in which they impersonated employees of the world trade organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the storm " won a special prize awarded by the amnesty international movie-goers attending the berlin film festival were asked to cast their votes for the films screened in the panorama section , which screened a total of 48 movies films .
about 21,000 votes were cast . also on saturday as part of the berlinale , israeli-born director oren moverman won the peace prize for " the messenger , " a movie about two traumatized us soldiers back from iraq and on a new assignment to tell families their loved ones have been killed in combat . valued at 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 6,432 -rrb- , the first peace prize was awarded in 1986 . at the same time , german director hans-christian schmid won the amnesty international film prize for his thriller sturm -lrb- storm -rrb- , which is based around the war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia . starring ben foster and woody harrelson , " the messenger " along with sturm are favorites in the battle for the berlinale 's coveted golden bear , which is to be awarded on saturday . films in the age of war and terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brenda blethyn stars in rachid bouchareb 's " london river " a total of 18 films competed for the berlinale 's top honors with the field wide open in the race for the festival 's main prizes . among the leading contenders are paris-born rachid bouchareb 's " london river " and israeli-born oren moverman 's post-iraq-war film " the messenger . "
both helped to raise hopes about the berlinale 's main competition after a slow and uninspiring start to what is one of world 's top three festivals . with the berlinale never prepared to shy away from hard-edged political stories , " london river " is a compelling story of a muslim father and a christian mother searching for their children in the aftermath of london 's july 7 terrorist attacks .
it stars brenda blethyn and sotigui kouyate . iranian director asghar farhadi 's " about elly , " has also emerged as a possible favorite for the golden bear .
farhadi 's film explores the fine line between truth and lies in middle-class iranian society after a young woman suddenly vanishes . outcome impossible to predict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jury is out on who 'll win the top prizes this year but film festival juries are notoriously difficult to predict .
the berlinale 's seven-member international jury , headed up by academy award-winning british actress tilda swinton , also has to hand out festival prizes for best director , as well as awards for best actor and actress . indeed , top chinese actress zhang ziyi could also be recognized by the jury for her role as the lover of famed 20th-century peking opera star mei lan-fang , in beijing director chen kaige 's lavishly filmed " forever enthralled . " other possible contenders include german director maren ade 's " alle anderen " -lrb- everyone else -rrb- about a young couple that find their relationship is put to the test and british-born peter strickland 's " katalin varga . " set in transylvania , strickland 's first feature film tells the story of a woman who embarks on a journey of revenge as she travels through the carpathian mountains in search of her son 's real father .
once again , a major focus of the berlinale was stories about women . another film that could stand a chance of going home with a prize is british-born richard loncraine 's 1950 's comedy " my one and only , " which was a last-minute entry in the berlinale 's main competition . it stars hollywood actress renee zellweger as a mother who takes her two teenage sons on a road trip across america in search of a husband . stars out in force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clive owen stars in tom tykwer 's " the international " certainly the main focus of the world 's leading film festivals is about star power and this year 's berlinale has again managed to attract some of the biggest names in the business , including clive owen , kate winslet , michelle pfeiffer , demi moore , steve martin , keanu reeves and gael garcia bernal . but overhanging this year 's berlinale was the deepening sense of gloom in the global movie business as it braces itself for what is expected to be a tough 12 months of cost-cutting , layoffs and projects being put on hold . many of those attending the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- - the business side of the berlinale - appear somewhat relieved that the numbers of deals arranged over the last ten days meant that the efm was not quite as bad as many had expected . unusually for the world 's top film festivals , the berlinale opens up its screenings to the general public .
there appears to be no shortage of enthusiasm for the festival among ordinary moviegoers . by its midway point , the berlinale had sold a record 270,000 tickets .
last year ticket sales totaled 240,000 .
after saturday 's awards , berlinale movie screenings will continue for a final day on sunday as the festival draws to a close . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the awi experiment has met bitter opposition in germany from some environmentalists who fear that using algae to sequester carbon dioxide in the ocean might wreck the ecosystem .
awi says the debate requires facts , which the scientists are obtaining now . bathmann added it was still not certain if algae could capture vast amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and keep it out of circulation long term . project lohafex the experiment , codenamed lohafex , is continuing aboard a german ship , the polarstern , until mid-march .
the ship mixed 10 tons of ferrous sulphate -lrb- feso4 -rrb- with seawater and pumped it out into the south atlantic . " after just four days , the team observed a significant increase in algae , " said bathmann .
" it was a surprise that they reproduced so quickly . " in the previous experiments , it took 10 to 14 days for this to happen .
the haptophytes had responded to fertilization most . " other algae types barely increased or did not increase at all , " he said . haptophytes are common in coastal waters and blooms sometimes lead to them washing up on beaches as a foam .
tiny animals , the zooplankton , feed on them . " those organisms will eat a large part of the algae , " said the scientist , explaining that the zooplankton would breathe the carbon dioxide back into the surface water , instead of the gas sinking as dead algae to the ocean bottom . " at the moment , the algae are reproducing faster that than the zooplankton can eat them , " he said .
" the exciting question in the next few weeks will be how much of the algae will be left over .

" it 's incomprehensible that banks which the state is propping up are in many cases paying out enormous bonuses , " merkel told the news weekly der spiegel in an article published on saturday , feb .
14 , adding that the subject would be up for discussion at a summit of the g20 nations in london in april . the g20 group comprises the world 's largest economies . merkel , head of the conservative christian democrats , called for bonus systems to be " internationally more explicitly linked to the genuinely sustainable business success of banks . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , member of the center-left social democrats , expressed a similar sentiment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " outrageous " was how us president obama described wall street 's billion-dollar bonuses in 2008 " the detachment from reality and the cynicism of executives continues to shock me .
executives are role models - in both good and bad ways , " he said . the german politicians join other leaders , such as us president barack obama , who said the billions in bonuses that wall street bankers had awarded themselves for 2008 was " outrageous . " growing anger resentment in germany toward bankers , who are largely perceived as having caused the global financial crisis , is growing .
even in late 2007 , before the full extent of the financial crisis was realized , germany was debating whether compensation for executives had gotten out of control . then , merkel did not argue with executives being " well paid , " as long as they " did a lot for their companies . " but in the wake of the global economic meltdown , attitudes have hardened . berlin has already agreed on a package of reforms aimed at curbing executive pay .
one would hold supervisory boards as a whole , rather than sub-committees , liable for pay packages for high-ranking managers that were " inappropriate .

" my book about islam " is the first schoolbook on the muslim faith to be approved for young children in germany .
the authors hope it will help foster understanding by dispelling myths about the followers of the koran . " my book about islam " is intended for muslim children , who come from different ethnic backgrounds and offers different interpretations of the islamic faith , according to evelin lubig-fohsel , one of the textbook 's authors .
" we 're going on the assumption that there is no such thing as the absolute correct islam and believe that this book can be the basis for various strands of the faith , " she said .
the book made its appearance this past week at the opening of the annual " didacta " educational book fair in the northern city of hanover .
it has also been introduced to primary schools in two german states , bavaria and north rhine-westphalia , which has a large muslim minority .
in an educational system where religious instruction about christianity is a standard part of the state-run school curriculum , the move is intended to promote greater tolerance and understanding of other faiths , according to the munich publishers of the textbook , oldenbourg . " young children can learn about and respect other world religions , " the publishers said in a statement .
fostering religious identity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the textbook has just been approved in two german states .
" the point of the book is to foster the religious identity of muslim children in a country that is predominantly christian so they do n't wind up being manipulated by the media , and not just the media , but perhaps even by their own mosque or community , " said one of the book 's authors , primary school teacher gül solgun-kaps .
since the majority of muslims in europe practice the sunni as opposed to the shiite faith , which differ in their beliefs as to the rightful heirs of the prophet muhammad , the textbook emphasizes sunni islam and discusses differences in national practices , but looks for common ground between the two branches . an appreciation of the different strains within a religion also helps to further dialogue with other faiths , such as christianity and judaism , according to solgun-kaps .
" it 's important for kids to know the core message of other religious faiths , " she said , adding that an understanding of such growing diversity in germany fosters peaceful co-existence not just in school , but in life too .
a bosnian child for instance would have the chance to talk about how ramadan is celebrated in his country , which is different from the fasting rituals of a pakistani or turkish family .
gender roles discussed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book also depicts muslim women without a headscarf .
the role of religion in daily life is a thread that runs through the book .
gender roles are also addressed and here the book is modern in its outlook .
a young boy is just as likely to set the dinner table as his sister , muslim women are depicted without head coverings and even men are laboring over the stove preparing family meals .
one of the book 's aims is to show children the compatibility of islam with democratic and egalitarian values , since muslim pupils and their parents , as well as christians or secular germans , often perceive the religion as being the antithesis of modernity .

" my book about islam " is the first schoolbook on the muslim faith to be approved for young children in germany .
the authors hope it will help foster understanding by dispelling myths about the followers of the koran . " my book about islam " is intended for muslim children , who come from different ethnic backgrounds and offers different interpretations of the islamic faith , according to evelin lubig-fohsel , one of the textbook 's authors .
" we 're going on the assumption that there is no such thing as the absolute correct islam and believe that this book can be the basis for various strands of the faith , " she said .
the book made its appearance this past week at the opening of the annual " didacta " educational book fair in the northern city of hanover .
it has also been introduced to primary schools in two german states , bavaria and north rhine-westphalia , which has a large muslim minority .
in an educational system where religious instruction about christianity is a standard part of the state-run school curriculum , the move is intended to promote greater tolerance and understanding of other faiths , according to the munich publishers of the textbook , oldenbourg . " young children can learn about and respect other world religions , " the publishers said in a statement .
fostering religious identity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the textbook has just been approved in two german states .
" the point of the book is to foster the religious identity of muslim children in a country that is predominantly christian so they do n't wind up being manipulated by the media , and not just the media , but perhaps even by their own mosque or community , " said one of the book 's authors , primary school teacher gül solgun-kaps .
since the majority of muslims in europe practice the sunni as opposed to the shiite faith , which differ in their beliefs as to the rightful heirs of the prophet muhammad , the textbook emphasizes sunni islam and discusses differences in national practices , but looks for common ground between the two branches . an appreciation of the different strains within a religion also helps to further dialogue with other faiths , such as christianity and judaism , according to solgun-kaps .
" it 's important for kids to know the core message of other religious faiths , " she said , adding that an understanding of such growing diversity in germany fosters peaceful co-existence not just in school , but in life too .
a bosnian child for instance would have the chance to talk about how ramadan is celebrated in his country , which is different from the fasting rituals of a pakistani or turkish family .
gender roles discussed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book also depicts muslim women without a headscarf .
the role of religion in daily life is a thread that runs through the book .
gender roles are also addressed and here the book is modern in its outlook .
a young boy is just as likely to set the dinner table as his sister , muslim women are depicted without head coverings and even men are laboring over the stove preparing family meals .
one of the book 's aims is to show children the compatibility of islam with democratic and egalitarian values , since muslim pupils and their parents , as well as christians or secular germans , often perceive the religion as being the antithesis of modernity .
" we want to reduce the fear factor about islam with this book , and show that muslims and non-muslims can live peacefully side by side , " said lubig fohsel . zoran arbutina -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" my book about islam " is the first schoolbook on the muslim faith to be approved for young children in germany .
the authors hope it will help foster understanding by dispelling myths about the followers of the koran . " my book about islam " is intended for muslim children , who come from different ethnic backgrounds and offers different interpretations of the islamic faith , according to evelin lubig-fohsel , one of the textbook 's authors .
" we 're going on the assumption that there is no such thing as the absolute correct islam and believe that this book can be the basis for various strands of the faith , " she said .
the book made its appearance this past week at the opening of the annual " didacta " educational book fair in the northern city of hanover .
it has also been introduced to primary schools in two german states , bavaria and north rhine-westphalia , which has a large muslim minority .
in an educational system where religious instruction about christianity is a standard part of the state-run school curriculum , the move is intended to promote greater tolerance and understanding of other faiths , according to the munich publishers of the textbook , oldenbourg . " young children can learn about and respect other world religions , " the publishers said in a statement .
fostering religious identity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the textbook has just been approved in two german states .
" the point of the book is to foster the religious identity of muslim children in a country that is predominantly christian so they do n't wind up being manipulated by the media , and not just the media , but perhaps even by their own mosque or community , " said one of the book 's authors , primary school teacher gül solgun-kaps .
since the majority of muslims in europe practice the sunni as opposed to the shiite faith , which differ in their beliefs as to the rightful heirs of the prophet muhammad , the textbook emphasizes sunni islam and discusses differences in national practices , but looks for common ground between the two branches . an appreciation of the different strains within a religion also helps to further dialogue with other faiths , such as christianity and judaism , according to solgun-kaps .
" it 's important for kids to know the core message of other religious faiths , " she said , adding that an understanding of such growing diversity in germany fosters peaceful co-existence not just in school , but in life too .
a bosnian child for instance would have the chance to talk about how ramadan is celebrated in his country , which is different from the fasting rituals of a pakistani or turkish family .
gender roles discussed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book also depicts muslim women without a headscarf .
the role of religion in daily life is a thread that runs through the book .
gender roles are also addressed and here the book is modern in its outlook .
a young boy is just as likely to set the dinner table as his sister , muslim women are depicted without head coverings and even men are laboring over the stove preparing family meals .
one of the book 's aims is to show children the compatibility of islam with democratic and egalitarian values , since muslim pupils and their parents , as well as christians or secular germans , often perceive the religion as being the antithesis of modernity .

" my book about islam " is the first schoolbook on the muslim faith to be approved for young children in germany .
the authors hope it will help foster understanding by dispelling myths about the followers of the koran . " my book about islam " is intended for muslim children , who come from different ethnic backgrounds and offers different interpretations of the islamic faith , according to evelin lubig-fohsel , one of the textbook 's authors .
" we 're going on the assumption that there is no such thing as the absolute correct islam and believe that this book can be the basis for various strands of the faith , " she said .
the book made its appearance this past week at the opening of the annual " didacta " educational book fair in the northern city of hanover .
it has also been introduced to primary schools in two german states , bavaria and north rhine-westphalia , which has a large muslim minority .
in an educational system where religious instruction about christianity is a standard part of the state-run school curriculum , the move is intended to promote greater tolerance and understanding of other faiths , according to the munich publishers of the textbook , oldenbourg . " young children can learn about and respect other world religions , " the publishers said in a statement .
fostering religious identity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the textbook has just been approved in two german states .
" the point of the book is to foster the religious identity of muslim children in a country that is predominantly christian so they do n't wind up being manipulated by the media , and not just the media , but perhaps even by their own mosque or community , " said one of the book 's authors , primary school teacher gül solgun-kaps .
since the majority of muslims in europe practice the sunni as opposed to the shiite faith , which differ in their beliefs as to the rightful heirs of the prophet muhammad , the textbook emphasizes sunni islam and discusses differences in national practices , but looks for common ground between the two branches . an appreciation of the different strains within a religion also helps to further dialogue with other faiths , such as christianity and judaism , according to solgun-kaps .
" it 's important for kids to know the core message of other religious faiths , " she said , adding that an understanding of such growing diversity in germany fosters peaceful co-existence not just in school , but in life too .
a bosnian child for instance would have the chance to talk about how ramadan is celebrated in his country , which is different from the fasting rituals of a pakistani or turkish family .
gender roles discussed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book also depicts muslim women without a headscarf .
the role of religion in daily life is a thread that runs through the book .
gender roles are also addressed and here the book is modern in its outlook .
a young boy is just as likely to set the dinner table as his sister , muslim women are depicted without head coverings and even men are laboring over the stove preparing family meals .
one of the book 's aims is to show children the compatibility of islam with democratic and egalitarian values , since muslim pupils and their parents , as well as christians or secular germans , often perceive the religion as being the antithesis of modernity .
" we want to reduce the fear factor about islam with this book , and show that muslims and non-muslims can live peacefully side by side , " said lubig fohsel . zoran arbutina -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the movie screened in the berlinales 's panorama section , which showcases independent and art-house cinema . " the yes men fix the world , " which was directed by mike bonanno , andy bichlbaum and kurt engfehr followed the yes men 's 2003 movie in which they impersonated employees of the world trade organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the storm " won a special prize awarded by the amnesty international movie-goers attending the berlin film festival were asked to cast their votes for the films screened in the panorama section , which screened a total of 48 movies films .
about 21,000 votes were cast . also on saturday as part of the berlinale , israeli-born director oren moverman won the peace prize for " the messenger , " a movie about two traumatized us soldiers back from iraq and on a new assignment to tell families their loved ones have been killed in combat . valued at 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 6,432 -rrb- , the first peace prize was awarded in 1986 . at the same time , german director hans-christian schmid won the amnesty international film prize for his thriller sturm -lrb- storm -rrb- , which is based around the war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia . starring ben foster and woody harrelson , " the messenger " along with sturm are favorites in the battle for the berlinale 's coveted golden bear , which is to be awarded on saturday . films in the age of war and terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brenda blethyn stars in rachid bouchareb 's " london river " a total of 18 films competed for the berlinale 's top honors with the field wide open in the race for the festival 's main prizes . among the leading contenders are paris-born rachid bouchareb 's " london river " and israeli-born oren moverman 's post-iraq-war film " the messenger . "
both helped to raise hopes about the berlinale 's main competition after a slow and uninspiring start to what is one of world 's top three festivals . with the berlinale never prepared to shy away from hard-edged political stories , " london river " is a compelling story of a muslim father and a christian mother searching for their children in the aftermath of london 's july 7 terrorist attacks .
it stars brenda blethyn and sotigui kouyate . iranian director asghar farhadi 's " about elly , " has also emerged as a possible favorite for the golden bear .
farhadi 's film explores the fine line between truth and lies in middle-class iranian society after a young woman suddenly vanishes . outcome impossible to predict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jury is out on who 'll win the top prizes this year but film festival juries are notoriously difficult to predict .
the berlinale 's seven-member international jury , headed up by academy award-winning british actress tilda swinton , also has to hand out festival prizes for best director , as well as awards for best actor and actress . indeed , top chinese actress zhang ziyi could also be recognized by the jury for her role as the lover of famed 20th-century peking opera star mei lan-fang , in beijing director chen kaige 's lavishly filmed " forever enthralled . " other possible contenders include german director maren ade 's " alle anderen " -lrb- everyone else -rrb- about a young couple that find their relationship is put to the test and british-born peter strickland 's " katalin varga . " set in transylvania , strickland 's first feature film tells the story of a woman who embarks on a journey of revenge as she travels through the carpathian mountains in search of her son 's real father .
once again , a major focus of the berlinale was stories about women . another film that could stand a chance of going home with a prize is british-born richard loncraine 's 1950 's comedy " my one and only , " which was a last-minute entry in the berlinale 's main competition . it stars hollywood actress renee zellweger as a mother who takes her two teenage sons on a road trip across america in search of a husband . stars out in force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clive owen stars in tom tykwer 's " the international " certainly the main focus of the world 's leading film festivals is about star power and this year 's berlinale has again managed to attract some of the biggest names in the business , including clive owen , kate winslet , michelle pfeiffer , demi moore , steve martin , keanu reeves and gael garcia bernal . but overhanging this year 's berlinale was the deepening sense of gloom in the global movie business as it braces itself for what is expected to be a tough 12 months of cost-cutting , layoffs and projects being put on hold . many of those attending the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- - the business side of the berlinale - appear somewhat relieved that the numbers of deals arranged over the last ten days meant that the efm was not quite as bad as many had expected . unusually for the world 's top film festivals , the berlinale opens up its screenings to the general public .
there appears to be no shortage of enthusiasm for the festival among ordinary moviegoers . by its midway point , the berlinale had sold a record 270,000 tickets .
last year ticket sales totaled 240,000 .
after saturday 's awards , berlinale movie screenings will continue for a final day on sunday as the festival draws to a close . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

about 21,000 votes were cast . also on saturday as part of the berlinale , israeli-born director oren moverman won the peace prize for " the messenger , " a movie about two traumatized us soldiers back from iraq and on a new assignment to tell families their loved ones have been killed in combat . valued at 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 6,432 -rrb- , the first peace prize was awarded in 1986 . at the same time , german director hans-christian schmid won the amnesty international film prize for his thriller sturm -lrb- storm -rrb- , which is based around the war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia . starring ben foster and woody harrelson , " the messenger " along with sturm are favorites in the battle for the berlinale 's coveted golden bear , which is to be awarded on saturday . films in the age of war and terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brenda blethyn stars in rachid bouchareb 's " london river " a total of 18 films competed for the berlinale 's top honors with the field wide open in the race for the festival 's main prizes . among the leading contenders are paris-born rachid bouchareb 's " london river " and israeli-born oren moverman 's post-iraq-war film " the messenger . "
both helped to raise hopes about the berlinale 's main competition after a slow and uninspiring start to what is one of world 's top three festivals . with the berlinale never prepared to shy away from hard-edged political stories , " london river " is a compelling story of a muslim father and a christian mother searching for their children in the aftermath of london 's july 7 terrorist attacks .
it stars brenda blethyn and sotigui kouyate . iranian director asghar farhadi 's " about elly , " has also emerged as a possible favorite for the golden bear .
farhadi 's film explores the fine line between truth and lies in middle-class iranian society after a young woman suddenly vanishes . outcome impossible to predict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jury is out on who 'll win the top prizes this year but film festival juries are notoriously difficult to predict .
the berlinale 's seven-member international jury , headed up by academy award-winning british actress tilda swinton , also has to hand out festival prizes for best director , as well as awards for best actor and actress . indeed , top chinese actress zhang ziyi could also be recognized by the jury for her role as the lover of famed 20th-century peking opera star mei lan-fang , in beijing director chen kaige 's lavishly filmed " forever enthralled . " other possible contenders include german director maren ade 's " alle anderen " -lrb- everyone else -rrb- about a young couple that find their relationship is put to the test and british-born peter strickland 's " katalin varga . " set in transylvania , strickland 's first feature film tells the story of a woman who embarks on a journey of revenge as she travels through the carpathian mountains in search of her son 's real father .
once again , a major focus of the berlinale was stories about women . another film that could stand a chance of going home with a prize is british-born richard loncraine 's 1950 's comedy " my one and only , " which was a last-minute entry in the berlinale 's main competition . it stars hollywood actress renee zellweger as a mother who takes her two teenage sons on a road trip across america in search of a husband . stars out in force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clive owen stars in tom tykwer 's " the international " certainly the main focus of the world 's leading film festivals is about star power and this year 's berlinale has again managed to attract some of the biggest names in the business , including clive owen , kate winslet , michelle pfeiffer , demi moore , steve martin , keanu reeves and gael garcia bernal . but overhanging this year 's berlinale was the deepening sense of gloom in the global movie business as it braces itself for what is expected to be a tough 12 months of cost-cutting , layoffs and projects being put on hold . many of those attending the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- - the business side of the berlinale - appear somewhat relieved that the numbers of deals arranged over the last ten days meant that the efm was not quite as bad as many had expected . unusually for the world 's top film festivals , the berlinale opens up its screenings to the general public .
there appears to be no shortage of enthusiasm for the festival among ordinary moviegoers . by its midway point , the berlinale had sold a record 270,000 tickets .

there appears to be no shortage of enthusiasm for the festival among ordinary moviegoers . by its midway point , the berlinale had sold a record 270,000 tickets .
last year ticket sales totaled 240,000 .

" it 's incomprehensible that banks which the state is propping up are in many cases paying out enormous bonuses , " merkel told the news weekly der spiegel in an article published on saturday , feb .
14 , adding that the subject would be up for discussion at a summit of the g20 nations in london in april . the g20 group comprises the world 's largest economies . merkel , head of the conservative christian democrats , called for bonus systems to be " internationally more explicitly linked to the genuinely sustainable business success of banks . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , member of the center-left social democrats , expressed a similar sentiment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " outrageous " was how us president obama described wall street 's billion-dollar bonuses in 2008 " the detachment from reality and the cynicism of executives continues to shock me .
executives are role models - in both good and bad ways , " he said . the german politicians join other leaders , such as us president barack obama , who said the billions in bonuses that wall street bankers had awarded themselves for 2008 was " outrageous . " growing anger resentment in germany toward bankers , who are largely perceived as having caused the global financial crisis , is growing .
even in late 2007 , before the full extent of the financial crisis was realized , germany was debating whether compensation for executives had gotten out of control . then , merkel did not argue with executives being " well paid , " as long as they " did a lot for their companies . " but in the wake of the global economic meltdown , attitudes have hardened . berlin has already agreed on a package of reforms aimed at curbing executive pay .
one would hold supervisory boards as a whole , rather than sub-committees , liable for pay packages for high-ranking managers that were " inappropriate . " the german government has already pushed through a 500-billion-euro -lrb- $ 630-billion -rrb- rescue package for german banks . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both helped to raise hopes about the berlinale 's main competition after a slow and uninspiring start to what is one of world 's top three festivals . with the berlinale never prepared to shy away from hard-edged political stories , " london river " is a compelling story of a muslim father and a christian mother searching for their children in the aftermath of london 's july 7 terrorist attacks .
it stars brenda blethyn and sotigui kouyate . iranian director asghar farhadi 's " about elly , " has also emerged as a possible favorite for the golden bear .

once again , a major focus of the berlinale was stories about women . another film that could stand a chance of going home with a prize is british-born richard loncraine 's 1950 's comedy " my one and only , " which was a last-minute entry in the berlinale 's main competition . it stars hollywood actress renee zellweger as a mother who takes her two teenage sons on a road trip across america in search of a husband . stars out in force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clive owen stars in tom tykwer 's " the international " certainly the main focus of the world 's leading film festivals is about star power and this year 's berlinale has again managed to attract some of the biggest names in the business , including clive owen , kate winslet , michelle pfeiffer , demi moore , steve martin , keanu reeves and gael garcia bernal . but overhanging this year 's berlinale was the deepening sense of gloom in the global movie business as it braces itself for what is expected to be a tough 12 months of cost-cutting , layoffs and projects being put on hold . many of those attending the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- - the business side of the berlinale - appear somewhat relieved that the numbers of deals arranged over the last ten days meant that the efm was not quite as bad as many had expected . unusually for the world 's top film festivals , the berlinale opens up its screenings to the general public .

" the awi experiment has met bitter opposition in germany from some environmentalists who fear that using algae to sequester carbon dioxide in the ocean might wreck the ecosystem .
awi says the debate requires facts , which the scientists are obtaining now . bathmann added it was still not certain if algae could capture vast amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and keep it out of circulation long term . project lohafex the experiment , codenamed lohafex , is continuing aboard a german ship , the polarstern , until mid-march .
the ship mixed 10 tons of ferrous sulphate -lrb- feso4 -rrb- with seawater and pumped it out into the south atlantic . " after just four days , the team observed a significant increase in algae , " said bathmann .
" it was a surprise that they reproduced so quickly . " in the previous experiments , it took 10 to 14 days for this to happen .
the haptophytes had responded to fertilization most . " other algae types barely increased or did not increase at all , " he said . haptophytes are common in coastal waters and blooms sometimes lead to them washing up on beaches as a foam .
tiny animals , the zooplankton , feed on them . " those organisms will eat a large part of the algae , " said the scientist , explaining that the zooplankton would breathe the carbon dioxide back into the surface water , instead of the gas sinking as dead algae to the ocean bottom . " at the moment , the algae are reproducing faster that than the zooplankton can eat them , " he said .
" the exciting question in the next few weeks will be how much of the algae will be left over . " that is why we can not make any predictions about how much carbon dioxide the algae are able to capture .

" the awi experiment has met bitter opposition in germany from some environmentalists who fear that using algae to sequester carbon dioxide in the ocean might wreck the ecosystem .
awi says the debate requires facts , which the scientists are obtaining now . bathmann added it was still not certain if algae could capture vast amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and keep it out of circulation long term . project lohafex the experiment , codenamed lohafex , is continuing aboard a german ship , the polarstern , until mid-march .
the ship mixed 10 tons of ferrous sulphate -lrb- feso4 -rrb- with seawater and pumped it out into the south atlantic . " after just four days , the team observed a significant increase in algae , " said bathmann .
" it was a surprise that they reproduced so quickly . " in the previous experiments , it took 10 to 14 days for this to happen .
the haptophytes had responded to fertilization most . " other algae types barely increased or did not increase at all , " he said . haptophytes are common in coastal waters and blooms sometimes lead to them washing up on beaches as a foam .
tiny animals , the zooplankton , feed on them . " those organisms will eat a large part of the algae , " said the scientist , explaining that the zooplankton would breathe the carbon dioxide back into the surface water , instead of the gas sinking as dead algae to the ocean bottom . " at the moment , the algae are reproducing faster that than the zooplankton can eat them , " he said .
" the exciting question in the next few weeks will be how much of the algae will be left over .

" it 's incomprehensible that banks which the state is propping up are in many cases paying out enormous bonuses , " merkel told the news weekly der spiegel in an article published on saturday , feb .
14 , adding that the subject would be up for discussion at a summit of the g20 nations in london in april . the g20 group comprises the world 's largest economies . merkel , head of the conservative christian democrats , called for bonus systems to be " internationally more explicitly linked to the genuinely sustainable business success of banks . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , member of the center-left social democrats , expressed a similar sentiment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " outrageous " was how us president obama described wall street 's billion-dollar bonuses in 2008 " the detachment from reality and the cynicism of executives continues to shock me .
executives are role models - in both good and bad ways , " he said . the german politicians join other leaders , such as us president barack obama , who said the billions in bonuses that wall street bankers had awarded themselves for 2008 was " outrageous . " growing anger resentment in germany toward bankers , who are largely perceived as having caused the global financial crisis , is growing .
even in late 2007 , before the full extent of the financial crisis was realized , germany was debating whether compensation for executives had gotten out of control . then , merkel did not argue with executives being " well paid , " as long as they " did a lot for their companies . " but in the wake of the global economic meltdown , attitudes have hardened . berlin has already agreed on a package of reforms aimed at curbing executive pay .
one would hold supervisory boards as a whole , rather than sub-committees , liable for pay packages for high-ranking managers that were " inappropriate . " the german government has already pushed through a 500-billion-euro -lrb- $ 630-billion -rrb- rescue package for german banks . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the awi experiment has met bitter opposition in germany from some environmentalists who fear that using algae to sequester carbon dioxide in the ocean might wreck the ecosystem .
awi says the debate requires facts , which the scientists are obtaining now . bathmann added it was still not certain if algae could capture vast amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and keep it out of circulation long term . project lohafex the experiment , codenamed lohafex , is continuing aboard a german ship , the polarstern , until mid-march .
the ship mixed 10 tons of ferrous sulphate -lrb- feso4 -rrb- with seawater and pumped it out into the south atlantic . " after just four days , the team observed a significant increase in algae , " said bathmann .
" it was a surprise that they reproduced so quickly . " in the previous experiments , it took 10 to 14 days for this to happen .
the haptophytes had responded to fertilization most . " other algae types barely increased or did not increase at all , " he said . haptophytes are common in coastal waters and blooms sometimes lead to them washing up on beaches as a foam .
tiny animals , the zooplankton , feed on them . " those organisms will eat a large part of the algae , " said the scientist , explaining that the zooplankton would breathe the carbon dioxide back into the surface water , instead of the gas sinking as dead algae to the ocean bottom . " at the moment , the algae are reproducing faster that than the zooplankton can eat them , " he said .
" the exciting question in the next few weeks will be how much of the algae will be left over . " that is why we can not make any predictions about how much carbon dioxide the algae are able to capture .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the return of the bear : berlinale 2009 peruvian survivors ' tale takes home berlinale 's golden bear berlinale juror schlingensief wants films to touch the soul german cinema in good condition , says berlinale director kosslick german filmmakers cast critical eye on their country at berlinale film -pipe- 14.02.2009 berlin film festival starts rolling out prizes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bear necessity : everybody wants one american anti-globalization pranksters the yes men won the audience prize for one of the berlin film festival 's main sections as part of the buildup to the presentation of the top honors at a hollywood-style gala . the yes men 's latest film " the yes men fix the world " once again seeks to expose and poke fun at the corporate world .
the movie screened in the berlinales 's panorama section , which showcases independent and art-house cinema . " the yes men fix the world , " which was directed by mike bonanno , andy bichlbaum and kurt engfehr followed the yes men 's 2003 movie in which they impersonated employees of the world trade organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the storm " won a special prize awarded by the amnesty international movie-goers attending the berlin film festival were asked to cast their votes for the films screened in the panorama section , which screened a total of 48 movies films .
about 21,000 votes were cast . also on saturday as part of the berlinale , israeli-born director oren moverman won the peace prize for " the messenger , " a movie about two traumatized us soldiers back from iraq and on a new assignment to tell families their loved ones have been killed in combat . valued at 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 6,432 -rrb- , the first peace prize was awarded in 1986 . at the same time , german director hans-christian schmid won the amnesty international film prize for his thriller sturm -lrb- storm -rrb- , which is based around the war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia . starring ben foster and woody harrelson , " the messenger " along with sturm are favorites in the battle for the berlinale 's coveted golden bear , which is to be awarded on saturday . films in the age of war and terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brenda blethyn stars in rachid bouchareb 's " london river " a total of 18 films competed for the berlinale 's top honors with the field wide open in the race for the festival 's main prizes . among the leading contenders are paris-born rachid bouchareb 's " london river " and israeli-born oren moverman 's post-iraq-war film " the messenger . "
both helped to raise hopes about the berlinale 's main competition after a slow and uninspiring start to what is one of world 's top three festivals . with the berlinale never prepared to shy away from hard-edged political stories , " london river " is a compelling story of a muslim father and a christian mother searching for their children in the aftermath of london 's july 7 terrorist attacks .
it stars brenda blethyn and sotigui kouyate . iranian director asghar farhadi 's " about elly , " has also emerged as a possible favorite for the golden bear .
farhadi 's film explores the fine line between truth and lies in middle-class iranian society after a young woman suddenly vanishes . outcome impossible to predict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jury is out on who 'll win the top prizes this year but film festival juries are notoriously difficult to predict .
the berlinale 's seven-member international jury , headed up by academy award-winning british actress tilda swinton , also has to hand out festival prizes for best director , as well as awards for best actor and actress . indeed , top chinese actress zhang ziyi could also be recognized by the jury for her role as the lover of famed 20th-century peking opera star mei lan-fang , in beijing director chen kaige 's lavishly filmed " forever enthralled . " other possible contenders include german director maren ade 's " alle anderen " -lrb- everyone else -rrb- about a young couple that find their relationship is put to the test and british-born peter strickland 's " katalin varga . " set in transylvania , strickland 's first feature film tells the story of a woman who embarks on a journey of revenge as she travels through the carpathian mountains in search of her son 's real father .
once again , a major focus of the berlinale was stories about women . another film that could stand a chance of going home with a prize is british-born richard loncraine 's 1950 's comedy " my one and only , " which was a last-minute entry in the berlinale 's main competition . it stars hollywood actress renee zellweger as a mother who takes her two teenage sons on a road trip across america in search of a husband . stars out in force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clive owen stars in tom tykwer 's " the international " certainly the main focus of the world 's leading film festivals is about star power and this year 's berlinale has again managed to attract some of the biggest names in the business , including clive owen , kate winslet , michelle pfeiffer , demi moore , steve martin , keanu reeves and gael garcia bernal . but overhanging this year 's berlinale was the deepening sense of gloom in the global movie business as it braces itself for what is expected to be a tough 12 months of cost-cutting , layoffs and projects being put on hold . many of those attending the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- - the business side of the berlinale - appear somewhat relieved that the numbers of deals arranged over the last ten days meant that the efm was not quite as bad as many had expected . unusually for the world 's top film festivals , the berlinale opens up its screenings to the general public .
there appears to be no shortage of enthusiasm for the festival among ordinary moviegoers . by its midway point , the berlinale had sold a record 270,000 tickets .
last year ticket sales totaled 240,000 .
after saturday 's awards , berlinale movie screenings will continue for a final day on sunday as the festival draws to a close . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" set in transylvania , strickland 's first feature film tells the story of a woman who embarks on a journey of revenge as she travels through the carpathian mountains in search of her son 's real father .
once again , a major focus of the berlinale was stories about women . another film that could stand a chance of going home with a prize is british-born richard loncraine 's 1950 's comedy " my one and only , " which was a last-minute entry in the berlinale 's main competition . it stars hollywood actress renee zellweger as a mother who takes her two teenage sons on a road trip across america in search of a husband . stars out in force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clive owen stars in tom tykwer 's " the international " certainly the main focus of the world 's leading film festivals is about star power and this year 's berlinale has again managed to attract some of the biggest names in the business , including clive owen , kate winslet , michelle pfeiffer , demi moore , steve martin , keanu reeves and gael garcia bernal . but overhanging this year 's berlinale was the deepening sense of gloom in the global movie business as it braces itself for what is expected to be a tough 12 months of cost-cutting , layoffs and projects being put on hold . many of those attending the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- - the business side of the berlinale - appear somewhat relieved that the numbers of deals arranged over the last ten days meant that the efm was not quite as bad as many had expected . unusually for the world 's top film festivals , the berlinale opens up its screenings to the general public .
there appears to be no shortage of enthusiasm for the festival among ordinary moviegoers . by its midway point , the berlinale had sold a record 270,000 tickets .
last year ticket sales totaled 240,000 .
after saturday 's awards , berlinale movie screenings will continue for a final day on sunday as the festival draws to a close . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the movie screened in the berlinales 's panorama section , which showcases independent and art-house cinema . " the yes men fix the world , " which was directed by mike bonanno , andy bichlbaum and kurt engfehr followed the yes men 's 2003 movie in which they impersonated employees of the world trade organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the storm " won a special prize awarded by the amnesty international movie-goers attending the berlin film festival were asked to cast their votes for the films screened in the panorama section , which screened a total of 48 movies films .
about 21,000 votes were cast . also on saturday as part of the berlinale , israeli-born director oren moverman won the peace prize for " the messenger , " a movie about two traumatized us soldiers back from iraq and on a new assignment to tell families their loved ones have been killed in combat . valued at 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 6,432 -rrb- , the first peace prize was awarded in 1986 . at the same time , german director hans-christian schmid won the amnesty international film prize for his thriller sturm -lrb- storm -rrb- , which is based around the war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia . starring ben foster and woody harrelson , " the messenger " along with sturm are favorites in the battle for the berlinale 's coveted golden bear , which is to be awarded on saturday . films in the age of war and terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brenda blethyn stars in rachid bouchareb 's " london river " a total of 18 films competed for the berlinale 's top honors with the field wide open in the race for the festival 's main prizes . among the leading contenders are paris-born rachid bouchareb 's " london river " and israeli-born oren moverman 's post-iraq-war film " the messenger . "
both helped to raise hopes about the berlinale 's main competition after a slow and uninspiring start to what is one of world 's top three festivals . with the berlinale never prepared to shy away from hard-edged political stories , " london river " is a compelling story of a muslim father and a christian mother searching for their children in the aftermath of london 's july 7 terrorist attacks .
it stars brenda blethyn and sotigui kouyate . iranian director asghar farhadi 's " about elly , " has also emerged as a possible favorite for the golden bear .
farhadi 's film explores the fine line between truth and lies in middle-class iranian society after a young woman suddenly vanishes . outcome impossible to predict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jury is out on who 'll win the top prizes this year but film festival juries are notoriously difficult to predict .
the berlinale 's seven-member international jury , headed up by academy award-winning british actress tilda swinton , also has to hand out festival prizes for best director , as well as awards for best actor and actress . indeed , top chinese actress zhang ziyi could also be recognized by the jury for her role as the lover of famed 20th-century peking opera star mei lan-fang , in beijing director chen kaige 's lavishly filmed " forever enthralled . " other possible contenders include german director maren ade 's " alle anderen " -lrb- everyone else -rrb- about a young couple that find their relationship is put to the test and british-born peter strickland 's " katalin varga . " set in transylvania , strickland 's first feature film tells the story of a woman who embarks on a journey of revenge as she travels through the carpathian mountains in search of her son 's real father .
once again , a major focus of the berlinale was stories about women . another film that could stand a chance of going home with a prize is british-born richard loncraine 's 1950 's comedy " my one and only , " which was a last-minute entry in the berlinale 's main competition . it stars hollywood actress renee zellweger as a mother who takes her two teenage sons on a road trip across america in search of a husband . stars out in force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clive owen stars in tom tykwer 's " the international " certainly the main focus of the world 's leading film festivals is about star power and this year 's berlinale has again managed to attract some of the biggest names in the business , including clive owen , kate winslet , michelle pfeiffer , demi moore , steve martin , keanu reeves and gael garcia bernal . but overhanging this year 's berlinale was the deepening sense of gloom in the global movie business as it braces itself for what is expected to be a tough 12 months of cost-cutting , layoffs and projects being put on hold . many of those attending the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- - the business side of the berlinale - appear somewhat relieved that the numbers of deals arranged over the last ten days meant that the efm was not quite as bad as many had expected . unusually for the world 's top film festivals , the berlinale opens up its screenings to the general public .

the movie screened in the berlinales 's panorama section , which showcases independent and art-house cinema . " the yes men fix the world , " which was directed by mike bonanno , andy bichlbaum and kurt engfehr followed the yes men 's 2003 movie in which they impersonated employees of the world trade organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the storm " won a special prize awarded by the amnesty international movie-goers attending the berlin film festival were asked to cast their votes for the films screened in the panorama section , which screened a total of 48 movies films .
about 21,000 votes were cast . also on saturday as part of the berlinale , israeli-born director oren moverman won the peace prize for " the messenger , " a movie about two traumatized us soldiers back from iraq and on a new assignment to tell families their loved ones have been killed in combat . valued at 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 6,432 -rrb- , the first peace prize was awarded in 1986 . at the same time , german director hans-christian schmid won the amnesty international film prize for his thriller sturm -lrb- storm -rrb- , which is based around the war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia . starring ben foster and woody harrelson , " the messenger " along with sturm are favorites in the battle for the berlinale 's coveted golden bear , which is to be awarded on saturday . films in the age of war and terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brenda blethyn stars in rachid bouchareb 's " london river " a total of 18 films competed for the berlinale 's top honors with the field wide open in the race for the festival 's main prizes . among the leading contenders are paris-born rachid bouchareb 's " london river " and israeli-born oren moverman 's post-iraq-war film " the messenger . "
both helped to raise hopes about the berlinale 's main competition after a slow and uninspiring start to what is one of world 's top three festivals . with the berlinale never prepared to shy away from hard-edged political stories , " london river " is a compelling story of a muslim father and a christian mother searching for their children in the aftermath of london 's july 7 terrorist attacks .
it stars brenda blethyn and sotigui kouyate . iranian director asghar farhadi 's " about elly , " has also emerged as a possible favorite for the golden bear .
farhadi 's film explores the fine line between truth and lies in middle-class iranian society after a young woman suddenly vanishes . outcome impossible to predict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jury is out on who 'll win the top prizes this year but film festival juries are notoriously difficult to predict .
the berlinale 's seven-member international jury , headed up by academy award-winning british actress tilda swinton , also has to hand out festival prizes for best director , as well as awards for best actor and actress . indeed , top chinese actress zhang ziyi could also be recognized by the jury for her role as the lover of famed 20th-century peking opera star mei lan-fang , in beijing director chen kaige 's lavishly filmed " forever enthralled . " other possible contenders include german director maren ade 's " alle anderen " -lrb- everyone else -rrb- about a young couple that find their relationship is put to the test and british-born peter strickland 's " katalin varga . " set in transylvania , strickland 's first feature film tells the story of a woman who embarks on a journey of revenge as she travels through the carpathian mountains in search of her son 's real father .
once again , a major focus of the berlinale was stories about women . another film that could stand a chance of going home with a prize is british-born richard loncraine 's 1950 's comedy " my one and only , " which was a last-minute entry in the berlinale 's main competition . it stars hollywood actress renee zellweger as a mother who takes her two teenage sons on a road trip across america in search of a husband . stars out in force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clive owen stars in tom tykwer 's " the international " certainly the main focus of the world 's leading film festivals is about star power and this year 's berlinale has again managed to attract some of the biggest names in the business , including clive owen , kate winslet , michelle pfeiffer , demi moore , steve martin , keanu reeves and gael garcia bernal . but overhanging this year 's berlinale was the deepening sense of gloom in the global movie business as it braces itself for what is expected to be a tough 12 months of cost-cutting , layoffs and projects being put on hold . many of those attending the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- - the business side of the berlinale - appear somewhat relieved that the numbers of deals arranged over the last ten days meant that the efm was not quite as bad as many had expected . unusually for the world 's top film festivals , the berlinale opens up its screenings to the general public .
there appears to be no shortage of enthusiasm for the festival among ordinary moviegoers . by its midway point , the berlinale had sold a record 270,000 tickets .

not one member of the house 's republicans supported the measure and seven democratic congressmen also voted against the bill . the senate followed suit friday evening by 60-38 , garnering the support of only three republicans and just barely meeting the 60-vote threshold .

obama instead relied on the democratic party 's majorities in both chambers . the house of representatives approved the plan 246-183 on friday afternoon .
not one member of the house 's republicans supported the measure and seven democratic congressmen also voted against the bill . most republicans have vociferously opposed the plan as too large and focused on government spending rather than tax cuts that would better revive the economy .
" we owe it to the american people to get this bill right , " said john boehner , the top republican in the house of representatives .
" i do n't believe this is the way to do it . "
warnings come with cash injection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the president warned that there were no quick fixes democrats say the compromise version will create or save 3.5 million new jobs over the next two years , and some have complained it is too small to address the country 's worst economic crisis since the great depression .
about 3.6 million jobs have been lost since the us entered a recession in december 2007 .
obama , who could sign the bill as early as monday , warned that the economic crisis was far from over despite the new injection of government funds into the world 's largest economy .
" passing this plan is a critical step , " he said .
" but it is only the beginning . "
obama has warned congress that any delay could cost thousands more jobs .
but republicans and some democrats complained the process was being unnecessarily rushed through the legislature in order to meet a self-imposed deadline of this weekend .

" it 's incomprehensible that banks which the state is propping up are in many cases paying out enormous bonuses , " merkel told the news weekly der spiegel in an article published on saturday , feb .
14 , adding that the subject would be up for discussion at a summit of the g20 nations in london in april . the g20 group comprises the world 's largest economies . merkel , head of the conservative christian democrats , called for bonus systems to be " internationally more explicitly linked to the genuinely sustainable business success of banks . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , member of the center-left social democrats , expressed a similar sentiment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " outrageous " was how us president obama described wall street 's billion-dollar bonuses in 2008 " the detachment from reality and the cynicism of executives continues to shock me .
executives are role models - in both good and bad ways , " he said . the german politicians join other leaders , such as us president barack obama , who said the billions in bonuses that wall street bankers had awarded themselves for 2008 was " outrageous . " growing anger resentment in germany toward bankers , who are largely perceived as having caused the global financial crisis , is growing .
even in late 2007 , before the full extent of the financial crisis was realized , germany was debating whether compensation for executives had gotten out of control . then , merkel did not argue with executives being " well paid , " as long as they " did a lot for their companies . " but in the wake of the global economic meltdown , attitudes have hardened . berlin has already agreed on a package of reforms aimed at curbing executive pay .
one would hold supervisory boards as a whole , rather than sub-committees , liable for pay packages for high-ranking managers that were " inappropriate . " the german government has already pushed through a 500-billion-euro -lrb- $ 630-billion -rrb- rescue package for german banks . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the movie screened in the berlinales 's panorama section , which showcases independent and art-house cinema . " the yes men fix the world , " which was directed by mike bonanno , andy bichlbaum and kurt engfehr followed the yes men 's 2003 movie in which they impersonated employees of the world trade organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the storm " won a special prize awarded by the amnesty international movie-goers attending the berlin film festival were asked to cast their votes for the films screened in the panorama section , which screened a total of 48 movies films .
about 21,000 votes were cast . also on saturday as part of the berlinale , israeli-born director oren moverman won the peace prize for " the messenger , " a movie about two traumatized us soldiers back from iraq and on a new assignment to tell families their loved ones have been killed in combat . valued at 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 6,432 -rrb- , the first peace prize was awarded in 1986 . at the same time , german director hans-christian schmid won the amnesty international film prize for his thriller sturm -lrb- storm -rrb- , which is based around the war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia . starring ben foster and woody harrelson , " the messenger " along with sturm are favorites in the battle for the berlinale 's coveted golden bear , which is to be awarded on saturday . films in the age of war and terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brenda blethyn stars in rachid bouchareb 's " london river " a total of 18 films competed for the berlinale 's top honors with the field wide open in the race for the festival 's main prizes . among the leading contenders are paris-born rachid bouchareb 's " london river " and israeli-born oren moverman 's post-iraq-war film " the messenger . "
both helped to raise hopes about the berlinale 's main competition after a slow and uninspiring start to what is one of world 's top three festivals . with the berlinale never prepared to shy away from hard-edged political stories , " london river " is a compelling story of a muslim father and a christian mother searching for their children in the aftermath of london 's july 7 terrorist attacks .
it stars brenda blethyn and sotigui kouyate . iranian director asghar farhadi 's " about elly , " has also emerged as a possible favorite for the golden bear .
farhadi 's film explores the fine line between truth and lies in middle-class iranian society after a young woman suddenly vanishes . outcome impossible to predict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jury is out on who 'll win the top prizes this year but film festival juries are notoriously difficult to predict .
the berlinale 's seven-member international jury , headed up by academy award-winning british actress tilda swinton , also has to hand out festival prizes for best director , as well as awards for best actor and actress . indeed , top chinese actress zhang ziyi could also be recognized by the jury for her role as the lover of famed 20th-century peking opera star mei lan-fang , in beijing director chen kaige 's lavishly filmed " forever enthralled . " other possible contenders include german director maren ade 's " alle anderen " -lrb- everyone else -rrb- about a young couple that find their relationship is put to the test and british-born peter strickland 's " katalin varga . " set in transylvania , strickland 's first feature film tells the story of a woman who embarks on a journey of revenge as she travels through the carpathian mountains in search of her son 's real father .
once again , a major focus of the berlinale was stories about women . another film that could stand a chance of going home with a prize is british-born richard loncraine 's 1950 's comedy " my one and only , " which was a last-minute entry in the berlinale 's main competition . it stars hollywood actress renee zellweger as a mother who takes her two teenage sons on a road trip across america in search of a husband . stars out in force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clive owen stars in tom tykwer 's " the international " certainly the main focus of the world 's leading film festivals is about star power and this year 's berlinale has again managed to attract some of the biggest names in the business , including clive owen , kate winslet , michelle pfeiffer , demi moore , steve martin , keanu reeves and gael garcia bernal . but overhanging this year 's berlinale was the deepening sense of gloom in the global movie business as it braces itself for what is expected to be a tough 12 months of cost-cutting , layoffs and projects being put on hold . many of those attending the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- - the business side of the berlinale - appear somewhat relieved that the numbers of deals arranged over the last ten days meant that the efm was not quite as bad as many had expected . unusually for the world 's top film festivals , the berlinale opens up its screenings to the general public .

14 , also renewed a commitment to avoid protectionist measures . " an open system of global trade and investment is indispensable for global prosperity , " the statement said . ahead of the talks - which marked the first international appearance of new us treasury secretary timothy geithner - european leaders had voiced concern over protectionism . the economic stimulus package us president barack obama 's administration includes a controversial " buy american " clause . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was us treasury secretary timothy geithner 's first international appearance geithner said he had briefed his g7 counterparts from japan , germany , france , britain , italy and canada , on washington 's plans to get the us economy back on track . the measures " must be implemented in a way consistent with our international obligations , " geithner told a news conference after the meeting . he was referring to commitments made by the united states and other world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- member nations to refrain from raising new trade barriers . still a danger italian economy minister giulio tremonti , whose country holds the current g7 / g8 presidency , said he thought protectionism remains a danger " not only for those nations like italy whose economies are based on exports .

" my book about islam " is the first schoolbook on the muslim faith to be approved for young children in germany .
the authors hope it will help foster understanding by dispelling myths about the followers of the koran . " my book about islam " is intended for muslim children , who come from different ethnic backgrounds and offers different interpretations of the islamic faith , according to evelin lubig-fohsel , one of the textbook 's authors .
" we 're going on the assumption that there is no such thing as the absolute correct islam and believe that this book can be the basis for various strands of the faith , " she said .
the book made its appearance this past week at the opening of the annual " didacta " educational book fair in the northern city of hanover .
it has also been introduced to primary schools in two german states , bavaria and north rhine-westphalia , which has a large muslim minority .
in an educational system where religious instruction about christianity is a standard part of the state-run school curriculum , the move is intended to promote greater tolerance and understanding of other faiths , according to the munich publishers of the textbook , oldenbourg . " young children can learn about and respect other world religions , " the publishers said in a statement .
fostering religious identity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the textbook has just been approved in two german states .
" the point of the book is to foster the religious identity of muslim children in a country that is predominantly christian so they do n't wind up being manipulated by the media , and not just the media , but perhaps even by their own mosque or community , " said one of the book 's authors , primary school teacher gül solgun-kaps .
since the majority of muslims in europe practice the sunni as opposed to the shiite faith , which differ in their beliefs as to the rightful heirs of the prophet muhammad , the textbook emphasizes sunni islam and discusses differences in national practices , but looks for common ground between the two branches . an appreciation of the different strains within a religion also helps to further dialogue with other faiths , such as christianity and judaism , according to solgun-kaps .
" it 's important for kids to know the core message of other religious faiths , " she said , adding that an understanding of such growing diversity in germany fosters peaceful co-existence not just in school , but in life too .
a bosnian child for instance would have the chance to talk about how ramadan is celebrated in his country , which is different from the fasting rituals of a pakistani or turkish family .
gender roles discussed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book also depicts muslim women without a headscarf .
the role of religion in daily life is a thread that runs through the book .
gender roles are also addressed and here the book is modern in its outlook .
a young boy is just as likely to set the dinner table as his sister , muslim women are depicted without head coverings and even men are laboring over the stove preparing family meals .
one of the book 's aims is to show children the compatibility of islam with democratic and egalitarian values , since muslim pupils and their parents , as well as christians or secular germans , often perceive the religion as being the antithesis of modernity .
" we want to reduce the fear factor about islam with this book , and show that muslims and non-muslims can live peacefully side by side , " said lubig fohsel . zoran arbutina -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

obama instead relied on the democratic party 's majorities in both chambers . the house of representatives approved the plan 246-183 on friday afternoon .
not one member of the house 's republicans supported the measure and seven democratic congressmen also voted against the bill . most republicans have vociferously opposed the plan as too large and focused on government spending rather than tax cuts that would better revive the economy .
" we owe it to the american people to get this bill right , " said john boehner , the top republican in the house of representatives .
" i do n't believe this is the way to do it . "

about 3.6 million jobs have been lost since the us entered a recession in december 2007 .
obama , who could sign the bill as early as monday , warned that the economic crisis was far from over despite the new injection of government funds into the world 's largest economy .
" passing this plan is a critical step , " he said .
" but it is only the beginning . "
obama has warned congress that any delay could cost thousands more jobs .
but republicans and some democrats complained the process was being unnecessarily rushed through the legislature in order to meet a self-imposed deadline of this weekend .

" it 's incomprehensible that banks which the state is propping up are in many cases paying out enormous bonuses , " merkel told the news weekly der spiegel in an article published on saturday , feb .
14 , adding that the subject would be up for discussion at a summit of the g20 nations in london in april . the g20 group comprises the world 's largest economies . merkel , head of the conservative christian democrats , called for bonus systems to be " internationally more explicitly linked to the genuinely sustainable business success of banks . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , member of the center-left social democrats , expressed a similar sentiment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " outrageous " was how us president obama described wall street 's billion-dollar bonuses in 2008 " the detachment from reality and the cynicism of executives continues to shock me .
executives are role models - in both good and bad ways , " he said . the german politicians join other leaders , such as us president barack obama , who said the billions in bonuses that wall street bankers had awarded themselves for 2008 was " outrageous . " growing anger resentment in germany toward bankers , who are largely perceived as having caused the global financial crisis , is growing .
even in late 2007 , before the full extent of the financial crisis was realized , germany was debating whether compensation for executives had gotten out of control . then , merkel did not argue with executives being " well paid , " as long as they " did a lot for their companies . " but in the wake of the global economic meltdown , attitudes have hardened . berlin has already agreed on a package of reforms aimed at curbing executive pay .
one would hold supervisory boards as a whole , rather than sub-committees , liable for pay packages for high-ranking managers that were " inappropriate .

" the awi experiment has met bitter opposition in germany from some environmentalists who fear that using algae to sequester carbon dioxide in the ocean might wreck the ecosystem .
awi says the debate requires facts , which the scientists are obtaining now . bathmann added it was still not certain if algae could capture vast amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and keep it out of circulation long term . project lohafex the experiment , codenamed lohafex , is continuing aboard a german ship , the polarstern , until mid-march .
the ship mixed 10 tons of ferrous sulphate -lrb- feso4 -rrb- with seawater and pumped it out into the south atlantic . " after just four days , the team observed a significant increase in algae , " said bathmann .
" it was a surprise that they reproduced so quickly . " in the previous experiments , it took 10 to 14 days for this to happen .
the haptophytes had responded to fertilization most . " other algae types barely increased or did not increase at all , " he said . haptophytes are common in coastal waters and blooms sometimes lead to them washing up on beaches as a foam .
tiny animals , the zooplankton , feed on them . " those organisms will eat a large part of the algae , " said the scientist , explaining that the zooplankton would breathe the carbon dioxide back into the surface water , instead of the gas sinking as dead algae to the ocean bottom . " at the moment , the algae are reproducing faster that than the zooplankton can eat them , " he said .
" the exciting question in the next few weeks will be how much of the algae will be left over .

" it 's incomprehensible that banks which the state is propping up are in many cases paying out enormous bonuses , " merkel told the news weekly der spiegel in an article published on saturday , feb .
14 , adding that the subject would be up for discussion at a summit of the g20 nations in london in april . the g20 group comprises the world 's largest economies . merkel , head of the conservative christian democrats , called for bonus systems to be " internationally more explicitly linked to the genuinely sustainable business success of banks . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , member of the center-left social democrats , expressed a similar sentiment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " outrageous " was how us president obama described wall street 's billion-dollar bonuses in 2008 " the detachment from reality and the cynicism of executives continues to shock me .
executives are role models - in both good and bad ways , " he said . the german politicians join other leaders , such as us president barack obama , who said the billions in bonuses that wall street bankers had awarded themselves for 2008 was " outrageous . " growing anger resentment in germany toward bankers , who are largely perceived as having caused the global financial crisis , is growing .
even in late 2007 , before the full extent of the financial crisis was realized , germany was debating whether compensation for executives had gotten out of control . then , merkel did not argue with executives being " well paid , " as long as they " did a lot for their companies . " but in the wake of the global economic meltdown , attitudes have hardened . berlin has already agreed on a package of reforms aimed at curbing executive pay .
one would hold supervisory boards as a whole , rather than sub-committees , liable for pay packages for high-ranking managers that were " inappropriate . " the german government has already pushed through a 500-billion-euro -lrb- $ 630-billion -rrb- rescue package for german banks . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it 's incomprehensible that banks which the state is propping up are in many cases paying out enormous bonuses , " merkel told the news weekly der spiegel in an article published on saturday , feb .
14 , adding that the subject would be up for discussion at a summit of the g20 nations in london in april . the g20 group comprises the world 's largest economies . merkel , head of the conservative christian democrats , called for bonus systems to be " internationally more explicitly linked to the genuinely sustainable business success of banks . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , member of the center-left social democrats , expressed a similar sentiment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " outrageous " was how us president obama described wall street 's billion-dollar bonuses in 2008 " the detachment from reality and the cynicism of executives continues to shock me .
executives are role models - in both good and bad ways , " he said . the german politicians join other leaders , such as us president barack obama , who said the billions in bonuses that wall street bankers had awarded themselves for 2008 was " outrageous . " growing anger resentment in germany toward bankers , who are largely perceived as having caused the global financial crisis , is growing .
even in late 2007 , before the full extent of the financial crisis was realized , germany was debating whether compensation for executives had gotten out of control . then , merkel did not argue with executives being " well paid , " as long as they " did a lot for their companies . " but in the wake of the global economic meltdown , attitudes have hardened . berlin has already agreed on a package of reforms aimed at curbing executive pay .
one would hold supervisory boards as a whole , rather than sub-committees , liable for pay packages for high-ranking managers that were " inappropriate . " the german government has already pushed through a 500-billion-euro -lrb- $ 630-billion -rrb- rescue package for german banks . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the trend is toward electric cars , hybrid models , downsized combustion engines and smaller cars .
" geneva will be especially interesting for the small car segment , " according to german car analyst professor ferdinand dudenhoeffer , " giving a preview of what 's to come after the crisis - sometime after the year 2010 . "
the geneva show comes at a time when several european governments are providing stimulus packages and tax incentives to kick-start their domestic car industries as many workers are being made redundant or are working on short time .
first hopeful signs of a recovery can be seen in germany where the government is offering buyers of new cars a 2,500-euro -lrb- $ 3,222 -rrb- cashback scheme , if they scrap their old car - which must be at least nine years old .
some dealers are reporting up to ten times more business although official figures are not yet available .
a deep crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french government wants to help french auto producers amid the global economic crisis but the crisis is far from over yet .
the french government is injecting an additional 6 billion euros into the country 's car industry after renault ceo carlos ghosn warned that up to 20 percent of jobs in the car industry could be lost in europe this year as producers , suppliers and dealers have been badly hit by the global economic crisis .
even sports car manufacturer porsche , which long appeared to be riding out the storm , is feeling the pinch .
sales have plunged 18 percent since august 2008 .
nevertheless , all major car makers are expected to showcase their new vehicles in geneva with exhibitors making a special green pavilion available in which at least a dozen manufacturers are set to present clean technology vehicles .
the swiss specialist firm rinspeed is unveiling its ichange futuristic concept , designed to encourage innovative thinking among car makers .
it is not only fitted with a zero-emission 130 kw electric engine , but raises the rear end to add two additional seats behind the driver at the press of button .
" we have developed an extremely flexible vehicle , not only illustrating the theme of variability but also reflecting continuously changing energy needs , " says chief executive frank m. rinderknecht .
sporty and energy-efficient bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the geneva motor show is expected to be more upbeat that the event in detroit volkswagen will launch its new polo , which has a sportier look and energy-efficient engine .
the polo is expected to come out in a special , fuel-saving diesel version with start-stop technology reducing fuel consumption to 3.5 litres per 100km .
carbon dioxide emissions are expected to come to just 89 grams per kilometre .
peugeot is presenting a revised version of the 206 in the small car segment .
further up the model line-up , the peugeot 3008 is a mixture of station wagon and suv -lrb- sport utility vehicle -rrb- .
like the 308 , it features a large glass roof with a modular boot system .
the most efficient engine of the 3008 has a consumption of 4.9 litres .
a hybrid version is being planned for the first time in the peugeot citroen psa concern for 2011 .
bmw is presenting a new entry model for the mini one .
consumption is listed at 5.3 litres which translates to a c02 emission figure of 128 g / km .
brake regeneration energy , start-stop technology and six-gear transmission are standard .
japanese car maker mazda will debut its fuel-efficient mazda3 fitted with start-stop that promises 12 percent more fuel efficiency .
the high-performance mazda3mps flagship will feature a 2.3-litre engine with an output of 260 horsepower .
" the show will not be all gloom and doom , " says car market expert nick margetts .
many customers will by then be looking at new cars afresh , since many european governments will by march have finalized their plans to stimulate the industry . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" my book about islam " is the first schoolbook on the muslim faith to be approved for young children in germany .
the authors hope it will help foster understanding by dispelling myths about the followers of the koran . " my book about islam " is intended for muslim children , who come from different ethnic backgrounds and offers different interpretations of the islamic faith , according to evelin lubig-fohsel , one of the textbook 's authors .
" we 're going on the assumption that there is no such thing as the absolute correct islam and believe that this book can be the basis for various strands of the faith , " she said .
the book made its appearance this past week at the opening of the annual " didacta " educational book fair in the northern city of hanover .
it has also been introduced to primary schools in two german states , bavaria and north rhine-westphalia , which has a large muslim minority .
in an educational system where religious instruction about christianity is a standard part of the state-run school curriculum , the move is intended to promote greater tolerance and understanding of other faiths , according to the munich publishers of the textbook , oldenbourg . " young children can learn about and respect other world religions , " the publishers said in a statement .
fostering religious identity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the textbook has just been approved in two german states .
" the point of the book is to foster the religious identity of muslim children in a country that is predominantly christian so they do n't wind up being manipulated by the media , and not just the media , but perhaps even by their own mosque or community , " said one of the book 's authors , primary school teacher gül solgun-kaps .
since the majority of muslims in europe practice the sunni as opposed to the shiite faith , which differ in their beliefs as to the rightful heirs of the prophet muhammad , the textbook emphasizes sunni islam and discusses differences in national practices , but looks for common ground between the two branches . an appreciation of the different strains within a religion also helps to further dialogue with other faiths , such as christianity and judaism , according to solgun-kaps .
" it 's important for kids to know the core message of other religious faiths , " she said , adding that an understanding of such growing diversity in germany fosters peaceful co-existence not just in school , but in life too .
a bosnian child for instance would have the chance to talk about how ramadan is celebrated in his country , which is different from the fasting rituals of a pakistani or turkish family .
gender roles discussed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book also depicts muslim women without a headscarf .
the role of religion in daily life is a thread that runs through the book .
gender roles are also addressed and here the book is modern in its outlook .
a young boy is just as likely to set the dinner table as his sister , muslim women are depicted without head coverings and even men are laboring over the stove preparing family meals .
one of the book 's aims is to show children the compatibility of islam with democratic and egalitarian values , since muslim pupils and their parents , as well as christians or secular germans , often perceive the religion as being the antithesis of modernity .

obama instead relied on the democratic party 's majorities in both chambers . the house of representatives approved the plan 246-183 on friday afternoon .
not one member of the house 's republicans supported the measure and seven democratic congressmen also voted against the bill . most republicans have vociferously opposed the plan as too large and focused on government spending rather than tax cuts that would better revive the economy .

about 3.6 million jobs have been lost since the us entered a recession in december 2007 .
obama , who could sign the bill as early as monday , warned that the economic crisis was far from over despite the new injection of government funds into the world 's largest economy .
" passing this plan is a critical step , " he said .
" but it is only the beginning . "
obama has warned congress that any delay could cost thousands more jobs .
but republicans and some democrats complained the process was being unnecessarily rushed through the legislature in order to meet a self-imposed deadline of this weekend .

the movie screened in the berlinales 's panorama section , which showcases independent and art-house cinema . " the yes men fix the world , " which was directed by mike bonanno , andy bichlbaum and kurt engfehr followed the yes men 's 2003 movie in which they impersonated employees of the world trade organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the storm " won a special prize awarded by the amnesty international movie-goers attending the berlin film festival were asked to cast their votes for the films screened in the panorama section , which screened a total of 48 movies films .
about 21,000 votes were cast . also on saturday as part of the berlinale , israeli-born director oren moverman won the peace prize for " the messenger , " a movie about two traumatized us soldiers back from iraq and on a new assignment to tell families their loved ones have been killed in combat . valued at 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 6,432 -rrb- , the first peace prize was awarded in 1986 . at the same time , german director hans-christian schmid won the amnesty international film prize for his thriller sturm -lrb- storm -rrb- , which is based around the war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia . starring ben foster and woody harrelson , " the messenger " along with sturm are favorites in the battle for the berlinale 's coveted golden bear , which is to be awarded on saturday . films in the age of war and terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brenda blethyn stars in rachid bouchareb 's " london river " a total of 18 films competed for the berlinale 's top honors with the field wide open in the race for the festival 's main prizes . among the leading contenders are paris-born rachid bouchareb 's " london river " and israeli-born oren moverman 's post-iraq-war film " the messenger . "
both helped to raise hopes about the berlinale 's main competition after a slow and uninspiring start to what is one of world 's top three festivals . with the berlinale never prepared to shy away from hard-edged political stories , " london river " is a compelling story of a muslim father and a christian mother searching for their children in the aftermath of london 's july 7 terrorist attacks .
it stars brenda blethyn and sotigui kouyate . iranian director asghar farhadi 's " about elly , " has also emerged as a possible favorite for the golden bear .
farhadi 's film explores the fine line between truth and lies in middle-class iranian society after a young woman suddenly vanishes . outcome impossible to predict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jury is out on who 'll win the top prizes this year but film festival juries are notoriously difficult to predict .
the berlinale 's seven-member international jury , headed up by academy award-winning british actress tilda swinton , also has to hand out festival prizes for best director , as well as awards for best actor and actress . indeed , top chinese actress zhang ziyi could also be recognized by the jury for her role as the lover of famed 20th-century peking opera star mei lan-fang , in beijing director chen kaige 's lavishly filmed " forever enthralled . " other possible contenders include german director maren ade 's " alle anderen " -lrb- everyone else -rrb- about a young couple that find their relationship is put to the test and british-born peter strickland 's " katalin varga . " set in transylvania , strickland 's first feature film tells the story of a woman who embarks on a journey of revenge as she travels through the carpathian mountains in search of her son 's real father .
once again , a major focus of the berlinale was stories about women . another film that could stand a chance of going home with a prize is british-born richard loncraine 's 1950 's comedy " my one and only , " which was a last-minute entry in the berlinale 's main competition . it stars hollywood actress renee zellweger as a mother who takes her two teenage sons on a road trip across america in search of a husband . stars out in force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clive owen stars in tom tykwer 's " the international " certainly the main focus of the world 's leading film festivals is about star power and this year 's berlinale has again managed to attract some of the biggest names in the business , including clive owen , kate winslet , michelle pfeiffer , demi moore , steve martin , keanu reeves and gael garcia bernal . but overhanging this year 's berlinale was the deepening sense of gloom in the global movie business as it braces itself for what is expected to be a tough 12 months of cost-cutting , layoffs and projects being put on hold . many of those attending the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- - the business side of the berlinale - appear somewhat relieved that the numbers of deals arranged over the last ten days meant that the efm was not quite as bad as many had expected . unusually for the world 's top film festivals , the berlinale opens up its screenings to the general public .
there appears to be no shortage of enthusiasm for the festival among ordinary moviegoers . by its midway point , the berlinale had sold a record 270,000 tickets .
last year ticket sales totaled 240,000 .
after saturday 's awards , berlinale movie screenings will continue for a final day on sunday as the festival draws to a close . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the awi experiment has met bitter opposition in germany from some environmentalists who fear that using algae to sequester carbon dioxide in the ocean might wreck the ecosystem .
awi says the debate requires facts , which the scientists are obtaining now . bathmann added it was still not certain if algae could capture vast amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and keep it out of circulation long term . project lohafex the experiment , codenamed lohafex , is continuing aboard a german ship , the polarstern , until mid-march .
the ship mixed 10 tons of ferrous sulphate -lrb- feso4 -rrb- with seawater and pumped it out into the south atlantic . " after just four days , the team observed a significant increase in algae , " said bathmann .
" it was a surprise that they reproduced so quickly . " in the previous experiments , it took 10 to 14 days for this to happen .
the haptophytes had responded to fertilization most . " other algae types barely increased or did not increase at all , " he said . haptophytes are common in coastal waters and blooms sometimes lead to them washing up on beaches as a foam .
tiny animals , the zooplankton , feed on them . " those organisms will eat a large part of the algae , " said the scientist , explaining that the zooplankton would breathe the carbon dioxide back into the surface water , instead of the gas sinking as dead algae to the ocean bottom . " at the moment , the algae are reproducing faster that than the zooplankton can eat them , " he said .
" the exciting question in the next few weeks will be how much of the algae will be left over . " that is why we can not make any predictions about how much carbon dioxide the algae are able to capture .

the movie screened in the berlinales 's panorama section , which showcases independent and art-house cinema . " the yes men fix the world , " which was directed by mike bonanno , andy bichlbaum and kurt engfehr followed the yes men 's 2003 movie in which they impersonated employees of the world trade organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the storm " won a special prize awarded by the amnesty international movie-goers attending the berlin film festival were asked to cast their votes for the films screened in the panorama section , which screened a total of 48 movies films .
about 21,000 votes were cast . also on saturday as part of the berlinale , israeli-born director oren moverman won the peace prize for " the messenger , " a movie about two traumatized us soldiers back from iraq and on a new assignment to tell families their loved ones have been killed in combat . valued at 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 6,432 -rrb- , the first peace prize was awarded in 1986 . at the same time , german director hans-christian schmid won the amnesty international film prize for his thriller sturm -lrb- storm -rrb- , which is based around the war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia . starring ben foster and woody harrelson , " the messenger " along with sturm are favorites in the battle for the berlinale 's coveted golden bear , which is to be awarded on saturday . films in the age of war and terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brenda blethyn stars in rachid bouchareb 's " london river " a total of 18 films competed for the berlinale 's top honors with the field wide open in the race for the festival 's main prizes . among the leading contenders are paris-born rachid bouchareb 's " london river " and israeli-born oren moverman 's post-iraq-war film " the messenger . "
both helped to raise hopes about the berlinale 's main competition after a slow and uninspiring start to what is one of world 's top three festivals . with the berlinale never prepared to shy away from hard-edged political stories , " london river " is a compelling story of a muslim father and a christian mother searching for their children in the aftermath of london 's july 7 terrorist attacks .
it stars brenda blethyn and sotigui kouyate . iranian director asghar farhadi 's " about elly , " has also emerged as a possible favorite for the golden bear .
farhadi 's film explores the fine line between truth and lies in middle-class iranian society after a young woman suddenly vanishes . outcome impossible to predict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jury is out on who 'll win the top prizes this year but film festival juries are notoriously difficult to predict .
the berlinale 's seven-member international jury , headed up by academy award-winning british actress tilda swinton , also has to hand out festival prizes for best director , as well as awards for best actor and actress . indeed , top chinese actress zhang ziyi could also be recognized by the jury for her role as the lover of famed 20th-century peking opera star mei lan-fang , in beijing director chen kaige 's lavishly filmed " forever enthralled . " other possible contenders include german director maren ade 's " alle anderen " -lrb- everyone else -rrb- about a young couple that find their relationship is put to the test and british-born peter strickland 's " katalin varga . " set in transylvania , strickland 's first feature film tells the story of a woman who embarks on a journey of revenge as she travels through the carpathian mountains in search of her son 's real father .
once again , a major focus of the berlinale was stories about women . another film that could stand a chance of going home with a prize is british-born richard loncraine 's 1950 's comedy " my one and only , " which was a last-minute entry in the berlinale 's main competition . it stars hollywood actress renee zellweger as a mother who takes her two teenage sons on a road trip across america in search of a husband . stars out in force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clive owen stars in tom tykwer 's " the international " certainly the main focus of the world 's leading film festivals is about star power and this year 's berlinale has again managed to attract some of the biggest names in the business , including clive owen , kate winslet , michelle pfeiffer , demi moore , steve martin , keanu reeves and gael garcia bernal . but overhanging this year 's berlinale was the deepening sense of gloom in the global movie business as it braces itself for what is expected to be a tough 12 months of cost-cutting , layoffs and projects being put on hold . many of those attending the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- - the business side of the berlinale - appear somewhat relieved that the numbers of deals arranged over the last ten days meant that the efm was not quite as bad as many had expected . unusually for the world 's top film festivals , the berlinale opens up its screenings to the general public .
there appears to be no shortage of enthusiasm for the festival among ordinary moviegoers . by its midway point , the berlinale had sold a record 270,000 tickets .
last year ticket sales totaled 240,000 .
after saturday 's awards , berlinale movie screenings will continue for a final day on sunday as the festival draws to a close . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the president could sign it into law as early as monday , the white house said . but the victory did not come with the bipartisan support his administration had originally hoped for .
obama instead relied on the democratic party 's majorities in both chambers . the house of representatives approved the plan 246-183 on friday afternoon .
not one member of the house 's republicans supported the measure and seven democratic congressmen also voted against the bill . the senate followed suit friday evening by 60-38 , garnering the support of only three republicans and just barely meeting the 60-vote threshold .
democrats were forced to extend the voting process by five hours , allowing democrat sherrod brown to fly into washington from his mother 's wake in ohio and cast the tie-breaking vote . no bipartisan victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's hope for a bipartisan agreement fell apart the long-awaited passage of the stimulus bill - the largest single spending proposal in us history - marked obama 's first major legislative victory since he took office on jan .

obama instead relied on the democratic party 's majorities in both chambers . the house of representatives approved the plan 246-183 on friday afternoon .
not one member of the house 's republicans supported the measure and seven democratic congressmen also voted against the bill . most republicans have vociferously opposed the plan as too large and focused on government spending rather than tax cuts that would better revive the economy .
" we owe it to the american people to get this bill right , " said john boehner , the top republican in the house of representatives .
" i do n't believe this is the way to do it . "
warnings come with cash injection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the president warned that there were no quick fixes democrats say the compromise version will create or save 3.5 million new jobs over the next two years , and some have complained it is too small to address the country 's worst economic crisis since the great depression .
about 3.6 million jobs have been lost since the us entered a recession in december 2007 .
obama , who could sign the bill as early as monday , warned that the economic crisis was far from over despite the new injection of government funds into the world 's largest economy .
" passing this plan is a critical step , " he said .
" but it is only the beginning . "
obama has warned congress that any delay could cost thousands more jobs .
but republicans and some democrats complained the process was being unnecessarily rushed through the legislature in order to meet a self-imposed deadline of this weekend .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 14.02.2009 german primary schoolers get textbook on islam großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religion is a standard part of the school curriculum in germany .
" my book about islam " is the first schoolbook on the muslim faith to be approved for young children in germany .
the authors hope it will help foster understanding by dispelling myths about the followers of the koran . " my book about islam " is intended for muslim children , who come from different ethnic backgrounds and offers different interpretations of the islamic faith , according to evelin lubig-fohsel , one of the textbook 's authors .
" we 're going on the assumption that there is no such thing as the absolute correct islam and believe that this book can be the basis for various strands of the faith , " she said .
the book made its appearance this past week at the opening of the annual " didacta " educational book fair in the northern city of hanover .
it has also been introduced to primary schools in two german states , bavaria and north rhine-westphalia , which has a large muslim minority .
in an educational system where religious instruction about christianity is a standard part of the state-run school curriculum , the move is intended to promote greater tolerance and understanding of other faiths , according to the munich publishers of the textbook , oldenbourg . " young children can learn about and respect other world religions , " the publishers said in a statement .
fostering religious identity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the textbook has just been approved in two german states .
" the point of the book is to foster the religious identity of muslim children in a country that is predominantly christian so they do n't wind up being manipulated by the media , and not just the media , but perhaps even by their own mosque or community , " said one of the book 's authors , primary school teacher gül solgun-kaps .
since the majority of muslims in europe practice the sunni as opposed to the shiite faith , which differ in their beliefs as to the rightful heirs of the prophet mohammed , the textbook emphasizes sunni islam and discusses differences in national practices , but looks for common ground between the two branches . an appreciation of the different strains within a religion also helps to further dialogue with other faiths , such as christianity and judaism , according to solgun-kaps .
" it 's important for kids to know the core message of other religious faiths , " she said , adding that an understanding of such growing diversity in germany fosters peaceful co-existence not just in school , but in life too .
a bosnian child for instance would have the chance to talk about how ramadan is celebrated in his country , which is different from the fasting rituals of a pakistani or turkish family .
gender roles discussed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book also depicts muslim women without a headscarf .
the role of religion in daily life is a thread that runs through the book .
gender roles are also addressed and here the book is modern in its outlook .
a young boy is just as likely to set the dinner table as his sister , muslim women are depicted without head coverings and even men are laboring over the stove preparing family meals .
one of the book 's aims is to show children the compatibility of islam with democratic and egalitarian values , since muslim pupils and their parents , as well as christians or secular germans , often perceive the religion as being the antithesis of modernity .
" we want to reduce the fear factor about islam with this book , and show that muslims and non-muslims can live peacefully side by side , " said lubig fohsel . zoran arbutina -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

advertisement a passenger explains what happened during the landing a british airways -lrb- ba -rrb- flight from amsterdam with 71 people on board lost its front wheels in a " hard landing " at london city airport .
the plane skidded to a halt on the runway and passengers were taken off using the emergency chutes .
one person was taken to hospital with minor injuries .
all 67 passengers and four crew were safely evacuated .
ba said : " the nosewheel of a british airways aircraft suffered a failure on landing at london city airport . "
the airport was closed after the crash landing which happened at about 1945 gmt on friday .
it reopened in the early hours of saturday but passengers have been advised to expect some delays .
a spokeswoman from london city airport said a total of 11 flights were diverted - eight to stansted airport , one to heathrow , one to luton and one to southend airport in essex .
as a precaution the emergency slides were deployed and the passengers were evacuated down the slides onto the runway british airways statement justin fletcher , a passenger on the plane , a bae systems-manufactured avro rj100 , said : " there was quite a loud bang as the plane scratched in .
" the stewards and stewardesses were quick to evacuate everyone off .
" there was a few scrapes and cuts due to hitting the asphalt , all in all everyone seems to be doing quite well now . "
another passenger , ray hamblin , said people tried to stay calm .
" people were pretty calm at first but when the plane started to fill up with smoke people were not moving fast enough and they got pretty fractious . "
a statement from ba said : " as a precaution the emergency slides were deployed and the passengers were evacuated down the slides onto the runway .
" unfortunately one passenger sustained a minor injury and is currently on the way to hospital .
there was one other minor injury .
" we do n't know the nature of the injury or how it was caused yet . "
nose wheel problem passengers and crew members were being cared for by ground staff at the airport .
a spokesman for the london ambulance service said : " we sent six ambulance crews , two single responders in cars , two duty officers and we treated four patients for minor injuries . "
a spokesman for the air accidents investigation branch -lrb- aaib -rrb- said : " the aaib has started a field investigation following the incident at london city airport and three of our investigators have been sent to the scene . "
five red cross emergency response vehicles were sent to the incident .
jonathan edmondson , red cross emergency response manager for london , said : " our staff and volunteers were on the scene soon after the incident to provide medical support and also to attend to the emotional well-being of the people involved .
" our staff have also provided practical support , such as distributing some basic hygiene items to passengers while they waited for bags to be unloaded from the aircraft . "
on 5 february the runway had to be closed because of a problem with the nose wheel on another aircraft of the same type .
an airport spokesman said the wheel was bent on a plane arriving from glasgow which caused the runway to be closed for about an hour although there was no emergency evacuation .
london city airport handled 3.3m passengers last year and is home to 10 airlines which serve more than 30 destinations in the uk and europe .

it has a reputation for carrying out an exhaustive search for compromise even if that means fudging difficult issues .
that 's what made the synod 's substantial vote last summer to press ahead with the ordination of women bishops seem all the more decisive .
traditionalists were left disappointed and angry when they were denied the legal right they had wanted to opt out of the control of women bishops .
the synod clearly felt that ordaining women to the most senior posts was too important a principle to allow the pain of a minority of traditionalists to send it off course .
but when the synod met this week for a passionate debate about the exact circumstances under which women were to be made bishops , determination seemed to have given way once again to an anxious search for the middle ground - and pessimism about the likelihood of finding it .
' everything is reviewable ' a committee chaired by the bishop of manchester nigel mcculloch presented draft laws for discussion , but he suggested that there was still scope for significant back-tracking .
bishop mcculloch said it was not too late for anglicans to put forward substantial amendments and said " it is open season once again , and everything is reviewable " .
he predicted that there would be searching and unwelcome dilemmas in the coming months .
central to those dilemmas is that one side in the debate - mostly anglo-catholics and evangelicals - does not want women bishops at all .
the other , led by liberals and the growing ranks of women clergy - is determined that they should not be reduced to " second class " bishops by having their status or authority compromised .
the draft laws discussed by the synod this week would allow parishes unwilling to accept a woman being in charge of them to ask to be looked after by a male " alternative " bishop .
but if those parishes were in a diocese headed by a woman bishop , any male alternative could operate only at her discretion .
typically of anglican compromises it left neither side happy .
the bishop of norwich spoke for many when he said the proposals would undermine what it was to be a bishop , without satisfying traditionalists who might abandon the church of england , leaving it " pressed into deeper schism " .
own motion success the draft laws were approved , with about the two-thirds majority which will be needed for a final vote clearing the way for women to become bishops - probably around 2014 .
but the greatest unanimity seemed to be achieved by ordinary synod members who had managed to get their own motions onto the synod agenda .
they included a ban on anglican clergy or any staff speaking for the church from membership of the british national party , and other organisations with similar policies .
some worried that the proposal would infringe the rights of clergy to freedom of conscience , but the proposal got a big majority .
another motion from a lay member of the synod resulted in a chorus of complaint to the government and water watchdog ofwat over the decision by some water companies to charge churches for draining water as if they were businesses .
many churches have big " foot-prints " and among a catalogue of huge water bill increases , one yorkshire parish registered a rise from £ 70 a year to £ 910 , and another from £ 520 to £ 3500 .
there was also success for a traditionalist lay member , paul eddy , whose motion urged the church , in effect , to make explicit its aim of converting people of other religions to christianity .
mr eddy is among those conservative anglicans resisting what they regard as a liberal trend in the leadership of the church .
it is a battle that in the past has focussed largely on disputes about what the bible teaches about homosexuality .
the duty to evangelise non-christians is universally accepted in the church , and is as old as christianity itself .
the big majority mr eddy achieved for his motion showed he had chosen favourable territory to open this new front against liberalism .

it has a reputation for carrying out an exhaustive search for compromise even if that means fudging difficult issues .
that 's what made the synod 's substantial vote last summer to press ahead with the ordination of women bishops seem all the more decisive .
traditionalists were left disappointed and angry when they were denied the legal right they had wanted to opt out of the control of women bishops .
the synod clearly felt that ordaining women to the most senior posts was too important a principle to allow the pain of a minority of traditionalists to send it off course .
but when the synod met this week for a passionate debate about the exact circumstances under which women were to be made bishops , determination seemed to have given way once again to an anxious search for the middle ground - and pessimism about the likelihood of finding it .
' everything is reviewable ' a committee chaired by the bishop of manchester nigel mcculloch presented draft laws for discussion , but he suggested that there was still scope for significant back-tracking .
bishop mcculloch said it was not too late for anglicans to put forward substantial amendments and said " it is open season once again , and everything is reviewable " .
he predicted that there would be searching and unwelcome dilemmas in the coming months .
central to those dilemmas is that one side in the debate - mostly anglo-catholics and evangelicals - does not want women bishops at all .
the other , led by liberals and the growing ranks of women clergy - is determined that they should not be reduced to " second class " bishops by having their status or authority compromised .
the draft laws discussed by the synod this week would allow parishes unwilling to accept a woman being in charge of them to ask to be looked after by a male " alternative " bishop .
but if those parishes were in a diocese headed by a woman bishop , any male alternative could operate only at her discretion .
typically of anglican compromises it left neither side happy .
the bishop of norwich spoke for many when he said the proposals would undermine what it was to be a bishop , without satisfying traditionalists who might abandon the church of england , leaving it " pressed into deeper schism " .
own motion success the draft laws were approved , with about the two-thirds majority which will be needed for a final vote clearing the way for women to become bishops - probably around 2014 .
the synod has been meeting in london all week but the greatest unanimity seemed to be achieved by ordinary synod members who had managed to get their own motions onto the synod agenda .
they included a ban on anglican clergy or any staff speaking for the church from membership of the british national party , and other organisations with similar policies .
some worried that the proposal would infringe the rights of clergy to freedom of conscience , but the proposal got a big majority .
another motion from a lay member of the synod resulted in a chorus of complaint to the government and water watchdog ofwat over the decision by some water companies to charge churches for draining water as if they were businesses .
many churches have big " foot-prints " and among a catalogue of huge water bill increases , one yorkshire parish registered a rise from £ 70 a year to £ 910 , and another from £ 520 to £ 3500 .
there was also success for a traditionalist lay member , paul eddy , whose motion urged the church , in effect , to make explicit its aim of converting people of other religions to christianity .

' everything is reviewable ' a committee chaired by the bishop of manchester nigel mcculloch presented draft laws for discussion , but he suggested that there was still scope for significant back-tracking .
bishop mcculloch said it was not too late for anglicans to put forward substantial amendments and said " it is open season once again , and everything is reviewable " .
he predicted that there would be searching and unwelcome dilemmas in the coming months .
central to those dilemmas is that one side in the debate - mostly anglo-catholics and evangelicals - does not want women bishops at all .
the other , led by liberals and the growing ranks of women clergy - is determined that they should not be reduced to " second class " bishops by having their status or authority compromised .
the draft laws discussed by the synod this week would allow parishes unwilling to accept a woman being in charge of them to ask to be looked after by a male " alternative " bishop .
but if those parishes were in a diocese headed by a woman bishop , any male alternative could operate only at her discretion .
typically of anglican compromises it left neither side happy .
the bishop of norwich spoke for many when he said the proposals would undermine what it was to be a bishop , without satisfying traditionalists who might abandon the church of england , leaving it " pressed into deeper schism " .
own motion success the draft laws were approved , with about the two-thirds majority which will be needed for a final vote clearing the way for women to become bishops - probably around 2014 .
the synod has been meeting in london all week but the greatest unanimity seemed to be achieved by ordinary synod members who had managed to get their own motions onto the synod agenda .
they included a ban on anglican clergy or any staff speaking for the church from membership of the british national party , and other organisations with similar policies .
some worried that the proposal would infringe the rights of clergy to freedom of conscience , but the proposal got a big majority .
another motion from a lay member of the synod resulted in a chorus of complaint to the government and water watchdog ofwat over the decision by some water companies to charge churches for draining water as if they were businesses .
many churches have big " foot-prints " and among a catalogue of huge water bill increases , one yorkshire parish registered a rise from £ 70 a year to £ 910 , and another from £ 520 to £ 3500 .
there was also success for a traditionalist lay member , paul eddy , whose motion urged the church , in effect , to make explicit its aim of converting people of other religions to christianity .
mr eddy is among those conservative anglicans resisting what they regard as a liberal trend in the leadership of the church .
it is a battle that in the past has focussed largely on disputes about what the bible teaches about homosexuality .
the duty to evangelise non-christians is universally accepted in the church , and is as old as christianity itself .
the big majority mr eddy achieved for his motion showed he had chosen favourable territory to open this new front against liberalism .

major phil packer , a 36-year-old paraplegic , is raising money for the help for heroes charity .
he left folkestone at midnight on friday with adventurer alastair humphreys .
maj packer , who lives in westminster , london , said : " i 've had a second chance at life and now want to support other people with disabilities . "
maj packer , who served with the royal military police , was injured on 19 february last year in basra .
he was hit by a vehicle and dragged underneath it during an incident that followed a rocket attack .
he suffered a bruised heart and damage to his ribs and chest and became a complete paraplegic , losing the motor and sensory use of his legs .
as a result of his injuries he was told he would never walk again .
however , almost a year later , maj packer has regained some feeling in his legs and is determined to walk once more .
we 're both going to battle on through till we get to the other side maj phil packer , fundraiser he remains a serving army officer and has also set himself the challenge of raising £ 1m for the help for heroes charity , which helps those who have been wounded in britain 's current conflicts .
maj packer said : " i wanted to do my bit .
when i was in hospital i needed something to get me through .
when i learned about help for heroes i decided that i wanted to raise £ 1m for them .
" there 's a triple edge to what i 've been doing .
i want to raise money and i want to provide the opportunity for injured servicemen to learn about sports that they might not have considered before they were injured .
" i also want to enthuse people to keep providing me with challenges , through which i can keep raising money . "
maj packer is aiming to do so by completing a series of different challenges , and has already taken part in a skydive with the red devils .
training difficulties so far his appeal , run through his website , has raised £ 155,000 , with a further £ 35,000 due to be added from an event organised last christmas .
" this amount of rowing will be a challenge both physically and mentally .
it 's dangerous to be over-confident and neither alastair or myself want to get out that boat before we 've reached france .
" we 're both going to battle on through till we get to the other side .
" it 's very , very cold here but the seas and tides are on our side , " he added on friday night .
after rowing the channel , he plans to complete the london marathon in two weeks on crutches , and also climb el capitan , a 3,000ft rock formation in the united states .
major packer is raising money for injured soldiers maj packer , who has also served in bosnia , kosovo and northern ireland , is hoping to return to work later in the year .
his rowing companion mr humphreys , 32 , from clapham , london , previously spent four years cycling round the world , has written two books and run the marathon des sables , a six-day endurance race across the sahara desert .
the pair only began training together for their rowing challenge at the start of this month .
mr humphreys said : " i did n't really know phil but i came across his website and i was really impressed with his attitude and positivity .
" i 'm really looking forward to the trip .
we 've had some difficulties , in that there was a hole in the boat and i snapped an oar in training .
" i 'm also pleased to be a part of phil 's rehabilitation , and to be helping him get close to his fundraising target , because that money will do some real good for people .
" but from a selfish point of view i 'll enjoy the feeling of being out in the sea in the middle of the night and then getting out of the boat in france , having rowed across . "
the rowers ' aim to reach calais by midnight on saturday .
