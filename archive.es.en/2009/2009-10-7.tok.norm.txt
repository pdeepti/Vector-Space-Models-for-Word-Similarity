he is an outspoken man who likes to use direct and colorful language , especially when comparing the cost of bank bailouts with the amount of aid paid to help the world 's poorest nations weather the economic storm .
" in one night we passed $ 700 billion to the banks , " stiglitz says .
" global foreign aid has really been $ 60-70 billion a year .
so in one hour we passed all the foreign aid of all the developed countries to all the developing countries for a decade . "
" and you ask : who is more needy ?
the american banker or developing countries ?
it 's hard not to come up with the conclusion that our values got destroyed . "
new philosophy for imf lending although the columbia university professor says the international monetary fund has done a good job of managing the crisis so far .
he still urges the imf to rethink its lending policies .
in the past , stiglitz says , imf-credits often had damaging side-effects for the recipients .
the loans were usually tied to drastic reform programs that sent the economies of many borrowers into a downward spiral .
stiglitz warns that if the imf wants to become a global insurer against economic disruption , as the funds 's director dominique strauss-kahn claims , then it needs to take a new approach to dealing with the needs of poor countries .
" when you have a crisis and the doctor comes in and says : ' by the way , if you want the medicine you have to do a , b , c and d ' and you say ' i do n't want to do a , b , c and d ' - you are not getting medicine , then it does n't serve the function of insurance , " stiglitz points out .
global finance sector needs taxation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the imf is working hard to prevent another financial crisis financial markets should also be subject of new taxes designed to discourage ' dysfunctional ' trading and help pay for the damage the global crisis has inflicted on poorer countries , stiglitz says .
imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn recently announced that the washington-based organization is already studying ways to tax the financial industry at the request of group of 20 leaders .
such a global financial-transaction tax would only be fair , the stiglitz argues , and it would not be without precedent .
" in environmental economics we have a principle called ' polluter pay ' .
if you cause pollution you have to pay for the clean-up .
the financial sector polluted the global economy with toxic assets and now they ought to clean up that , " the nobel prize-winning economist says .
excessive risk-taking by the banking sector has imposed huge costs on the rest of the society , including workers , developing nations , house-holders and tax-payers , he explains .
a global tax on financial market transactions is therefore not just a question of equity , but a question of efficiency .
stiglitz stresses that such a tax would also help shrink a ' bloated ' financial industry in the united states , arguing that statistics showing that the finance sector accounted for 40 percent of us corporate profits before the crisis were a clear signal that “ something 's wrong . ”
tax revenues could be used for poor countries stiglitz says the money raised by the proposed tax could be used to help poor countries , which were by no means responsible for the financial crisis , but are nevertheless suffering its worst consequences .
according to estimates by the development committee of the world bank and the international monetary fund , another 90 million people around the world are at risk of being driven into extreme poverty by the end of 2010 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 07.10.2009 czech republic plagued by doubts about future path großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague is a jewel , its politics are complex with the fate of the eu resting in the hands of the czech republic , the country has become the focus of media attention .
but as it parades in the limelight , the young democracy can not hide its many troubles . for years , the czech republic was hailed as the wunderkind of the former east bloc countries , the shining economic example and leader of the pack .
in record time , it appeared to have shed its past to become a fully-fledged member of the western world .
but now , 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall , much of the glitter has fallen off europe 's brightest new star , and it has become tangled up in a mess of domestic political infighting and an apparent inability to decide what it wants and where it wants to stand on the international stage .
so what went wrong ?
petr kratochvil , deputy director of the prague institute of international relations , said it all started after the country had secured the two things it knew it wanted : nato and eu membership .
" there were two phases after 1989 , " kratochvil told deutsche welle .
" the first was the transition from the communist past to the establishment of a democratic system . "
behind that clear aim , he says , the nation and its politicians did willingly unite .
but once it had been achieved , the new democracy did n't know what to do next .
struggling for unity and , kratochvil says , the czech republic has not yet come up with an answer .
" there has been no unity across the political spectrum ever since , " he said , adding that on the whole politicians are more concerned with petty arguments and scoring points than with the country itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan fischer earlier this year , the animosity led to a vote of no confidence for the government .
since then the country has been in the hands of a caretaker government under the leadership of a bureaucrat , jan fischer , the former head of the national statistics office .
he took on the interim post promising that his would not be a government of vision , but one of hard work .
" i really hope that we 'll be able to do something for our country , " fischer said at the time of his appointment .
" we will lead the czech republic into new elections and we 'll do this quietly and with respect for all of our international obligations . "
however , that is not the way things have gone .
a snap election was planned for november .
but in what may have been classic czech political style , the social democrats , whose backing was necessary for the vote to take place , suddenly backed out , leaving the poll scheduled for june 2010 .
a history of change political scientist jiri pehe , director of new york university in prague , says such instability is partially a consequence of having been subjected to an ever-changing political elite .
" we have never had time to develop a robust political culture based on self-confidence , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have an institutional democracy which was built at tremendous speed , " he said , adding that democratic values such as respect for minorities and tolerance of other people have developed at a much slower pace .
" we do n't have democracy as a culture . "
and that , he says , is the trouble with people like president vaclav klaus and the 17 senators who are holding both their country and europe hostage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of czechs want to be part of europe , but klaus does n't " deep down , they are not democrats , " pehe said .
" they feel they have the absolute truth and do n't care whether or not 500 million people agree with it . "
motivated by self-importance pehe believes the president 's reluctance to add his name to the controversial lisbon treaty is rooted in the national conviction " that the czechs have something intellectually unique to offer europe , something so unique it is worth fighting for . "
but it is that notion of national self-importance - coupled with a worry that no matter what the czech republic does , big international decisions will ultimately be made by major powers - which is getting in the way of the country 's future .
" the idea that the country can not contribute so it is not worth trying to , limits the capacity of politicians to act , " pehe said .
some commentators have said vaclav klaus is thoroughly enjoying the attention he is getting from holding out on europe , but pehe says it has swayed public opinion against him .
so perhaps it is , as jan fischer told eu leaders in brussels on wednesday , really just a matter of time before the czech republic ratifies the treaty and thereby makes a clear statement on at least one outstanding issue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 07.10.2009 stiglitz urges financial powers to rethink their values großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph stiglitz says the international monetary fund needs a new philosophy a tax on financial institutions is needed to improve the efficiency of the global economy and provide aid to developing countries , says joseph stiglitz , a former world bank chief economist and nobel prize winner . joseph stiglitz is one of the harshest critics of the banking industry 's rush to return to " business as usual " in the wake of the financial crisis .
he is an outspoken man who likes to use direct and colorful language , especially when comparing the cost of bank bailouts with the amount of aid paid to help the world 's poorest nations weather the economic storm .
" in one night we passed $ 700 billion to the banks , " stiglitz says .
" global foreign aid has really been $ 60-70 billion a year .
so in one hour we passed all the foreign aid of all the developed countries to all the developing countries for a decade . "
" and you ask : who is more needy ?
the american banker or developing countries ?
it 's hard not to come up with the conclusion that our values got destroyed . "
new philosophy for imf lending although the columbia university professor says the international monetary fund has done a good job of managing the crisis so far .
he still urges the imf to rethink its lending policies .
in the past , stiglitz says , imf-credits often had damaging side-effects for the recipients .
the loans were usually tied to drastic reform programs that sent the economies of many borrowers into a downward spiral .
stiglitz warns that if the imf wants to become a global insurer against economic disruption , as the funds 's director dominique strauss-kahn claims , then it needs to take a new approach to dealing with the needs of poor countries .
" when you have a crisis and the doctor comes in and says : ' by the way , if you want the medicine you have to do a , b , c and d ' and you say ' i do n't want to do a , b , c and d ' - you are not getting medicine , then it does n't serve the function of insurance , " stiglitz points out .
global finance sector needs taxation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the imf is working hard to prevent another financial crisis financial markets should also be subject of new taxes designed to discourage ' dysfunctional ' trading and help pay for the damage the global crisis has inflicted on poorer countries , stiglitz says .
imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn recently announced that the washington-based organization is already studying ways to tax the financial industry at the request of group of 20 leaders .
such a global financial-transaction tax would only be fair , the stiglitz argues , and it would not be without precedent .
" in environmental economics we have a principle called ' polluter pay ' .
if you cause pollution you have to pay for the clean-up .
the financial sector polluted the global economy with toxic assets and now they ought to clean up that , " the nobel prize-winning economist says .
excessive risk-taking by the banking sector has imposed huge costs on the rest of the society , including workers , developing nations , house-holders and tax-payers , he explains .
a global tax on financial market transactions is therefore not just a question of equity , but a question of efficiency .
stiglitz stresses that such a tax would also help shrink a ' bloated ' financial industry in the united states , arguing that statistics showing that the finance sector accounted for 40 percent of us corporate profits before the crisis were a clear signal that “ something 's wrong . ”
tax revenues could be used for poor countries stiglitz says the money raised by the proposed tax could be used to help poor countries , which were by no means responsible for the financial crisis , but are nevertheless suffering its worst consequences .
according to estimates by the development committee of the world bank and the international monetary fund , another 90 million people around the world are at risk of being driven into extreme poverty by the end of 2010 .

global finance sector needs taxation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the imf is working hard to prevent another financial crisis financial markets should also be subject of new taxes designed to discourage ' dysfunctional ' trading and help pay for the damage the global crisis has inflicted on poorer countries , stiglitz says .
imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn recently announced that the washington-based organization is already studying ways to tax the financial industry at the request of group of 20 leaders .
such a global financial-transaction tax would only be fair , the stiglitz argues , and it would not be without precedent .
" in environmental economics we have a principle called ' polluter pay ' .
if you cause pollution you have to pay for the clean-up .
the financial sector polluted the global economy with toxic assets and now they ought to clean up that , " the nobel prize-winning economist says .
excessive risk-taking by the banking sector has imposed huge costs on the rest of the society , including workers , developing nations , house-holders and tax-payers , he explains .
a global tax on financial market transactions is therefore not just a question of equity , but a question of efficiency .
stiglitz stresses that such a tax would also help shrink a ' bloated ' financial industry in the united states , arguing that statistics showing that the finance sector accounted for 40 percent of us corporate profits before the crisis were a clear signal that “ something 's wrong . ”
tax revenues could be used for poor countries stiglitz says the money raised by the proposed tax could be used to help poor countries , which were by no means responsible for the financial crisis , but are nevertheless suffering its worst consequences .
according to estimates by the development committee of the world bank and the international monetary fund , another 90 million people around the world are at risk of being driven into extreme poverty by the end of 2010 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 07.10.2009 czech republic plagued by doubts about future path großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague is a jewel , its politics are complex with the fate of the eu resting in the hands of the czech republic , the country has become the focus of media attention .
but as it parades in the limelight , the young democracy can not hide its many troubles . for years , the czech republic was hailed as the wunderkind of the former east bloc countries , the shining economic example and leader of the pack .
in record time , it appeared to have shed its past to become a fully-fledged member of the western world .
but now , 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall , much of the glitter has fallen off europe 's brightest new star , and it has become tangled up in a mess of domestic political infighting and an apparent inability to decide what it wants and where it wants to stand on the international stage .
so what went wrong ?
petr kratochvil , deputy director of the prague institute of international relations , said it all started after the country had secured the two things it knew it wanted : nato and eu membership .
" there were two phases after 1989 , " kratochvil told deutsche welle .
" the first was the transition from the communist past to the establishment of a democratic system . "
behind that clear aim , he says , the nation and its politicians did willingly unite .
but once it had been achieved , the new democracy did n't know what to do next .
struggling for unity and , kratochvil says , the czech republic has not yet come up with an answer .
" there has been no unity across the political spectrum ever since , " he said , adding that on the whole politicians are more concerned with petty arguments and scoring points than with the country itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan fischer earlier this year , the animosity led to a vote of no confidence for the government .
since then the country has been in the hands of a caretaker government under the leadership of a bureaucrat , jan fischer , the former head of the national statistics office .
he took on the interim post promising that his would not be a government of vision , but one of hard work .
" i really hope that we 'll be able to do something for our country , " fischer said at the time of his appointment .
" we will lead the czech republic into new elections and we 'll do this quietly and with respect for all of our international obligations . "
however , that is not the way things have gone .
a snap election was planned for november .
but in what may have been classic czech political style , the social democrats , whose backing was necessary for the vote to take place , suddenly backed out , leaving the poll scheduled for june 2010 .
a history of change political scientist jiri pehe , director of new york university in prague , says such instability is partially a consequence of having been subjected to an ever-changing political elite .
" we have never had time to develop a robust political culture based on self-confidence , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have an institutional democracy which was built at tremendous speed , " he said , adding that democratic values such as respect for minorities and tolerance of other people have developed at a much slower pace .
" we do n't have democracy as a culture . "
and that , he says , is the trouble with people like president vaclav klaus and the 17 senators who are holding both their country and europe hostage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of czechs want to be part of europe , but klaus does n't " deep down , they are not democrats , " pehe said .
" they feel they have the absolute truth and do n't care whether or not 500 million people agree with it . "
motivated by self-importance pehe believes the president 's reluctance to add his name to the controversial lisbon treaty is rooted in the national conviction " that the czechs have something intellectually unique to offer europe , something so unique it is worth fighting for . "
but it is that notion of national self-importance - coupled with a worry that no matter what the czech republic does , big international decisions will ultimately be made by major powers - which is getting in the way of the country 's future .

but as it parades in the limelight , the young democracy can not hide its many troubles . for years , the czech republic was hailed as the wunderkind of the former east bloc countries , the shining economic example and leader of the pack .
in record time , it appeared to have shed its past to become a fully-fledged member of the western world .
but now , 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall , much of the glitter has fallen off europe 's brightest new star , and it has become tangled up in a mess of domestic political infighting and an apparent inability to decide what it wants and where it wants to stand on the international stage .
so what went wrong ?
petr kratochvil , deputy director of the prague institute of international relations , said it all started after the country had secured the two things it knew it wanted : nato and eu membership .
" there were two phases after 1989 , " kratochvil told deutsche welle .
" the first was the transition from the communist past to the establishment of a democratic system . "
behind that clear aim , he says , the nation and its politicians did willingly unite .
but once it had been achieved , the new democracy did n't know what to do next .
struggling for unity and , kratochvil says , the czech republic has not yet come up with an answer .
" there has been no unity across the political spectrum ever since , " he said , adding that on the whole politicians are more concerned with petty arguments and scoring points than with the country itself .

since then the country has been in the hands of a caretaker government under the leadership of a bureaucrat , jan fischer , the former head of the national statistics office .
he took on the interim post promising that his would not be a government of vision , but one of hard work .
" i really hope that we 'll be able to do something for our country , " fischer said at the time of his appointment .
" we will lead the czech republic into new elections and we 'll do this quietly and with respect for all of our international obligations . "
however , that is not the way things have gone .
a snap election was planned for november .
but in what may have been classic czech political style , the social democrats , whose backing was necessary for the vote to take place , suddenly backed out , leaving the poll scheduled for june 2010 .
a history of change political scientist jiri pehe , director of new york university in prague , says such instability is partially a consequence of having been subjected to an ever-changing political elite .
" we have never had time to develop a robust political culture based on self-confidence , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have an institutional democracy which was built at tremendous speed , " he said , adding that democratic values such as respect for minorities and tolerance of other people have developed at a much slower pace .
" we do n't have democracy as a culture . "
and that , he says , is the trouble with people like president vaclav klaus and the 17 senators who are holding both their country and europe hostage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of czechs want to be part of europe , but klaus does n't " deep down , they are not democrats , " pehe said .
" they feel they have the absolute truth and do n't care whether or not 500 million people agree with it . "
motivated by self-importance pehe believes the president 's reluctance to add his name to the controversial lisbon treaty is rooted in the national conviction " that the czechs have something intellectually unique to offer europe , something so unique it is worth fighting for . "
but it is that notion of national self-importance - coupled with a worry that no matter what the czech republic does , big international decisions will ultimately be made by major powers - which is getting in the way of the country 's future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 07.10.2009 czech republic plagued by doubts about future path großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague is a jewel , its politics are complex with the fate of the eu resting in the hands of the czech republic , the country has become the focus of media attention .
but as it parades in the limelight , the young democracy can not hide its many troubles . for years , the czech republic was hailed as the wunderkind of the former east bloc countries , the shining economic example and leader of the pack .
in record time , it appeared to have shed its past to become a fully-fledged member of the western world .
but now , 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall , much of the glitter has fallen off europe 's brightest new star , and it has become tangled up in a mess of domestic political infighting and an apparent inability to decide what it wants and where it wants to stand on the international stage .
so what went wrong ?
petr kratochvil , deputy director of the prague institute of international relations , said it all started after the country had secured the two things it knew it wanted : nato and eu membership .
" there were two phases after 1989 , " kratochvil told deutsche welle .
" the first was the transition from the communist past to the establishment of a democratic system . "
behind that clear aim , he says , the nation and its politicians did willingly unite .
but once it had been achieved , the new democracy did n't know what to do next .
struggling for unity and , kratochvil says , the czech republic has not yet come up with an answer .
" there has been no unity across the political spectrum ever since , " he said , adding that on the whole politicians are more concerned with petty arguments and scoring points than with the country itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan fischer earlier this year , the animosity led to a vote of no confidence for the government .
since then the country has been in the hands of a caretaker government under the leadership of a bureaucrat , jan fischer , the former head of the national statistics office .
he took on the interim post promising that his would not be a government of vision , but one of hard work .
" i really hope that we 'll be able to do something for our country , " fischer said at the time of his appointment .
" we will lead the czech republic into new elections and we 'll do this quietly and with respect for all of our international obligations . "
however , that is not the way things have gone .
a snap election was planned for november .
but in what may have been classic czech political style , the social democrats , whose backing was necessary for the vote to take place , suddenly backed out , leaving the poll scheduled for june 2010 .
a history of change political scientist jiri pehe , director of new york university in prague , says such instability is partially a consequence of having been subjected to an ever-changing political elite .
" we have never had time to develop a robust political culture based on self-confidence , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have an institutional democracy which was built at tremendous speed , " he said , adding that democratic values such as respect for minorities and tolerance of other people have developed at a much slower pace .
" we do n't have democracy as a culture . "
and that , he says , is the trouble with people like president vaclav klaus and the 17 senators who are holding both their country and europe hostage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of czechs want to be part of europe , but klaus does n't " deep down , they are not democrats , " pehe said .
" they feel they have the absolute truth and do n't care whether or not 500 million people agree with it . "
motivated by self-importance pehe believes the president 's reluctance to add his name to the controversial lisbon treaty is rooted in the national conviction " that the czechs have something intellectually unique to offer europe , something so unique it is worth fighting for . "
but it is that notion of national self-importance - coupled with a worry that no matter what the czech republic does , big international decisions will ultimately be made by major powers - which is getting in the way of the country 's future .
" the idea that the country can not contribute so it is not worth trying to , limits the capacity of politicians to act , " pehe said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 07.10.2009 stiglitz urges financial powers to rethink their values großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph stiglitz says the international monetary fund needs a new philosophy a tax on financial institutions is needed to improve the efficiency of the global economy and provide aid to developing countries , says joseph stiglitz , a former world bank chief economist and nobel prize winner . joseph stiglitz is one of the harshest critics of the banking industry 's rush to return to " business as usual " in the wake of the financial crisis .
he is an outspoken man who likes to use direct and colorful language , especially when comparing the cost of bank bailouts with the amount of aid paid to help the world 's poorest nations weather the economic storm .
" in one night we passed $ 700 billion to the banks , " stiglitz says .
" global foreign aid has really been $ 60-70 billion a year .
so in one hour we passed all the foreign aid of all the developed countries to all the developing countries for a decade . "
" and you ask : who is more needy ?
the american banker or developing countries ?
it 's hard not to come up with the conclusion that our values got destroyed . "
new philosophy for imf lending although the columbia university professor says the international monetary fund has done a good job of managing the crisis so far .
he still urges the imf to rethink its lending policies .
in the past , stiglitz says , imf-credits often had damaging side-effects for the recipients .
the loans were usually tied to drastic reform programs that sent the economies of many borrowers into a downward spiral .
stiglitz warns that if the imf wants to become a global insurer against economic disruption , as the funds 's director dominique strauss-kahn claims , then it needs to take a new approach to dealing with the needs of poor countries .
" when you have a crisis and the doctor comes in and says : ' by the way , if you want the medicine you have to do a , b , c and d ' and you say ' i do n't want to do a , b , c and d ' - you are not getting medicine , then it does n't serve the function of insurance , " stiglitz points out .
global finance sector needs taxation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the imf is working hard to prevent another financial crisis financial markets should also be subject of new taxes designed to discourage ' dysfunctional ' trading and help pay for the damage the global crisis has inflicted on poorer countries , stiglitz says .
imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn recently announced that the washington-based organization is already studying ways to tax the financial industry at the request of group of 20 leaders .
such a global financial-transaction tax would only be fair , the stiglitz argues , and it would not be without precedent .
" in environmental economics we have a principle called ' polluter pay ' .
if you cause pollution you have to pay for the clean-up .
the financial sector polluted the global economy with toxic assets and now they ought to clean up that , " the nobel prize-winning economist says .
excessive risk-taking by the banking sector has imposed huge costs on the rest of the society , including workers , developing nations , house-holders and tax-payers , he explains .
a global tax on financial market transactions is therefore not just a question of equity , but a question of efficiency .
stiglitz stresses that such a tax would also help shrink a ' bloated ' financial industry in the united states , arguing that statistics showing that the finance sector accounted for 40 percent of us corporate profits before the crisis were a clear signal that “ something 's wrong . ”
tax revenues could be used for poor countries stiglitz says the money raised by the proposed tax could be used to help poor countries , which were by no means responsible for the financial crisis , but are nevertheless suffering its worst consequences .
according to estimates by the development committee of the world bank and the international monetary fund , another 90 million people around the world are at risk of being driven into extreme poverty by the end of 2010 .

she was fired for helping herself to a meatball from a conference buffet at her workplace .
the case is to be heard in january . the 57-year-old secretary , identified in the german media as magdalene h , worked for the builders ' association in the state of north-rhine westphalia for more than three decades .
the incident took place last july when she organized a conference buffet for her boss and his guests and helped herself to two rolls and a frikadelle , a german meatball specialty , during the preparations .
boss insists firing was right thing german mass-selling newspaper bild reported on wednesday that magdalene h was confronted by her boss after a colleague noticed some food was missing .
but once she admitted to consuming the meatball , she was fired .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frikadellen are popular in germany " she believed her behavior was acceptable , " her lawyer , wolfgang pinkepank , told bild .
" bread and meatballs that are left over after conferences are allowed to be eaten by workers .
if she had been reprimanded , she would not have done it again . "
the newspaper reported that a judge in the courtroom where the secretary and her employer , hermann schulte-hiltrop , met on tuesday urged schulte-hiltrop to issue a warning instead of a firing , saying the incident was not a classic case of theft .
but schulte-hiltrop , the head of the builders ' association , insisted he had done the right thing in firing her .
" from the outside it naturally looks like a minor offence , " he said .
" but we work on highly sensitive information here .
and if you do n't trust someone any longer , it 's not a good feeling . "
" inhumane and immoral " the case , which is to be officially heard in january 2010 , has sparked anger among labor unions and politicians .
michael groschek , the secretary general of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in north-rhine westphalia called the incident " inhumane and immoral . "
" we should n't tolerate managers getting hefty bonuses despite squandering millions on speculative trading and ordinary people being turned out on the streets on account of eating a meatball , " groschek told news agency ap .
juergen czech of the labor union ig construction , agriculture and environment said the employer needed to ask himself what the firing meant for the secretary , warning that at her age , magdalene h , would have difficulties finding a new job .

according to the commission , the eu 's executive arm , 20 of the bloc 's 27 member countries are on track to break that limit this year .
in july , brussels launched action against latvia , lithuania , malta , poland and romania following earlier procedures against france , greece , ireland and spain .
eu blames recession for budget woes the commission blamed the ballooning budget deficits on the global recession , admitting that several eu governments had increased their public spending to limit the impact of the economic crisis .
several eu countries are grappling with falling tax revenues and rising unemployment and many have initiated economic stimulus measures and bail-outs for banks and leading companies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia says the offenders will not be forced to radically rein in spending in light of the recession " a large majority of eu member states are set to have budget deficits above 3 percent of gdp in 2009 as a result of the economic crisis .
we need to continue supporting the economy until the recovery takes hold , in line with the european economic recovery plan , " economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said .
but the commissioner also warned that eu governments need to rein in public spending and bring their public finances back in order .
" now is also the moment to design coordinated exit strategies so that , when the moment is right , we can begin to roll back the soaring debt levels , " he said .
almunia said the stability and growth pact under which the action was taken " is sufficiently flexible to combine the fiscal stimulus in the short term with consolidation of the public finances in the medium term . "
germany grapples with soaring deficit germany 's budget deficit will be 3.9 percent of gdp this year and 5.9 percent next year , the commission said .
the recession in europe 's largest economy has slashed tax revenues and increased government spending on subsidies .
leaked government documents in germany this week said that public deficits need to be cut by 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 56 billion -rrb- between 2011 and 2013 .
bildunterschrift : the soaring deficit is a political issue in germany - merkel here with the fdp 's guido westerwelle germany 's soaring deficit is also a bone of contention for the country 's next center-right government .
the pro-business fdp party , which is set to form a coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives , won the election largely on the back of promised tax cuts .
but merkel has warned that the spiraling budget deficit reduces the scope for immediate tax relief , and that there wo n't be any cuts before 2011 .
the commission has estimated a deficit of 4.5 percent for italy , 3.4 percent in the netherlands and 6.5 percent in portugal .
europe still suffering from downturn europe hit a recovery setback on wednesday with the euro-zone economy shrinking more than expected .
finance ministers from the 16 nations that use the euro agreed last week at a meeting in sweden that their countries would have to take action in 2011 against debt and public deficits .
the pact " must not be interpreted as offering one-way flexibility , " euro-group head and luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker warned .
the stability and growth pact was established in the 1990s to boost confidence in the euro .
in 2005 , the pact was loosened , making it easier for countries breaching the 3 percent limit to avoid sanctions .
nations that overshoot the eu deficit limit can be subject to economic sanctions , though none have so far been fined. sp / afp / reuters / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

usually they consisted of a helmet , or a flag , or maybe a knife .
but in the case of robert thomas , an 18-year-old soldier in george patton 's third army , his souvenirs turned out to be two legal manuscripts more than 400 years old .
as the tide of the war turned and allied bombing began to take its toll on german buildings and institutions , rare books and artworks were moved underground to caves or abandoned mines .
it was in an abandoned salt mine in the small town of merkers outside of frankfurt that the young infantryman stumbled on a room filled from floor to ceiling with thousands of books .
a different kind of souvenir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert thomas , left , handed the books over to the german ambassador thomas grabbed two of the books and took them home with him to the united states .
" i kept them in two boxes in the darkest coolest place at my house in order to preserve them .
they are pretty much in the same condition as i found them , " said the 83-year-old veteran .
it was the officials at the national archives who urged thomas to return them to the rightful owner .
" the books will go home now .
that 's the right thing to do , " said thomas as he handed over the manuscripts .
the oldest of the two books , one written in german and the other latin , was published in 1573 and deals with prussian statutes .
the other was published in 1593 and is a treatise on roman law .
the books were originally from the diocesan museum of paderborn and will be returned to the university of bonn library where they were before the war .
at a ceremony at the national archives in washington dc where thomas handed the books over to german ambassador klaus scharioth , the ambassador said that getting the books back was a stroke of luck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the books are legal treatises " we 're really lucky to get these books back , " said scharioth .
" the fact that these books are returned tells you a lot about our relationship today - it 's a sign of friendship and trust . "
other manuscripts found it is not the first time that german manuscripts have been returned .
in 1992 , a woman who had lived through auschwitz turned over seven medieval manuscripts that had been taken by an american soldier who drove a tank in patton 's army .
the manuscripts were dated from the 15th and 16th centuries and were traced back to st. anthony 's church in the town of hambach near aachen .
one of the most famous hoards of german antiquities and manuscripts are known as the quedlinburg treasure .
the church treasures were hidden in a mine during the waning weeks of world war ii and disappeared soon after us troops occupied the area .
in the 1980s objets d 'art started surfacing in a small texas town in the united states , stolen by an american soldier .
when he died , his relatives tried to sell the art work and the ensuing court case made headlines .
in the end , the german cultural foundation bought most of the works for $ 3 million .
in 2008 , german cultural institutions published a catalog of over 180,000 works of art that disappeared after the war. av / afp / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to the commission , the eu 's executive arm , 20 of the bloc 's 27 member countries are on track to break that limit this year .
in july , brussels launched action against latvia , lithuania , malta , poland and romania following earlier procedures against france , greece , ireland and spain .
eu blames recession for budget woes the commission blamed the ballooning budget deficits on the global recession , admitting that several eu governments had increased their public spending to limit the impact of the economic crisis .
several eu countries are grappling with falling tax revenues and rising unemployment and many have initiated economic stimulus measures and bail-outs for banks and leading companies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia says the offenders will not be forced to radically rein in spending in light of the recession " a large majority of eu member states are set to have budget deficits above 3 percent of gdp in 2009 as a result of the economic crisis .
we need to continue supporting the economy until the recovery takes hold , in line with the european economic recovery plan , " economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said .
but the commissioner also warned that eu governments need to rein in public spending and bring their public finances back in order .
" now is also the moment to design coordinated exit strategies so that , when the moment is right , we can begin to roll back the soaring debt levels , " he said .
almunia said the stability and growth pact under which the action was taken " is sufficiently flexible to combine the fiscal stimulus in the short term with consolidation of the public finances in the medium term . "
germany grapples with soaring deficit germany 's budget deficit will be 3.9 percent of gdp this year and 5.9 percent next year , the commission said .
the recession in europe 's largest economy has slashed tax revenues and increased government spending on subsidies .

the pro-business fdp party , which is set to form a coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives , won the election largely on the back of promised tax cuts .
but merkel has warned that the spiraling budget deficit reduces the scope for immediate tax relief , and that there wo n't be any cuts before 2011 .
the commission has estimated a deficit of 4.5 percent for italy , 3.4 percent in the netherlands and 6.5 percent in portugal .
europe still suffering from downturn europe hit a recovery setback on wednesday with the euro-zone economy shrinking more than expected .
finance ministers from the 16 nations that use the euro agreed last week at a meeting in sweden that their countries would have to take action in 2011 against debt and public deficits .

the case is to be heard in january . the 57-year-old secretary , identified in the german media as magdalene h , worked for the builders ' association in the state of north-rhine westphalia for more than three decades .
the incident took place last july when she organized a conference buffet for her boss and his guests and helped herself to two rolls and a frikadelle , a german meatball specialty , during the preparations .
boss insists firing was right thing german mass-selling newspaper bild reported on wednesday that magdalene h was confronted by her boss after a colleague noticed some food was missing .
but once she admitted to consuming the meatball , she was fired .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frikadellen are popular in germany " she believed her behavior was acceptable , " her lawyer , wolfgang pinkepank , told bild .
" bread and meatballs that are left over after conferences are allowed to be eaten by workers .
if she had been reprimanded , she would not have done it again . "
the newspaper reported that a judge in the courtroom where the secretary and her employer , hermann schulte-hiltrop , met on tuesday urged schulte-hiltrop to issue a warning instead of a firing , saying the incident was not a classic case of theft .
but schulte-hiltrop , the head of the builders ' association , insisted he had done the right thing in firing her .
" from the outside it naturally looks like a minor offence , " he said .
" but we work on highly sensitive information here .
and if you do n't trust someone any longer , it 's not a good feeling . "
" inhumane and immoral " the case , which is to be officially heard in january 2010 , has sparked anger among labor unions and politicians .
michael groschek , the secretary general of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in north-rhine westphalia called the incident " inhumane and immoral . "
" we should n't tolerate managers getting hefty bonuses despite squandering millions on speculative trading and ordinary people being turned out on the streets on account of eating a meatball , " groschek told news agency ap .
juergen czech of the labor union ig construction , agriculture and environment said the employer needed to ask himself what the firing meant for the secretary , warning that at her age , magdalene h , would have difficulties finding a new job .

annual spending should be raised to eight billion euros if europe is to meet its goal of cutting carbon emissions 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
" today we have a unique opportunity to change an energy model based on polluting , scarce and risky fossil fuels , into a clean , sustainable and less dependent one , " said andris piebalgs , the eu 's energy commissioner , at a press conference in brussels wednesday .
a roadmap for future energy research spending dubbed the strategic energy technology plan -lrb- set -rrb- , the commission 's report emphasized that additional investment to promote technologies such as solar and wind power was urgently needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind power could produce 20 percent of europe 's electricity by 2020 " locked-in investments , vested interests , as well as the high risks and need for significant investments in less profitable alternatives , mean that change will be slow without a major push , " the study said .
the commission report is a roadmap that will help set funding priorities within the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , and the member states .
coordinating research and development among the eu 's 27 member governments will be difficult , said energy economist claudia kemfert of berlin 's diw research institute .
" individual member countries have to decide how much they want to spend and what they spend it on , " kemfert told deutsche welle .
" there will be pressure for them to spend the money in their own countries . "
the bulk of the new funding would come from the private sector and member states . the eu 's european trading system for co2 credits and the european investment bank will also provide some financing .
solar and carbon capture the big winners solar power projects receive the most attention in the set study , with 16 billion euros of funding proposed for the next decade with the goal of producing 15 percent of the eu 's electricity from solar power by 2020 .
some of the solar research projects supported by the set roadmap include new ways to build photovoltaic cells more cheaply and quickly than today and for further research in the field of concentrated solar power , which uses the sun 's energy to create heat that powers turbines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report proposes 13 billion euros of funding for carbon storage technology " solar power has the greatest potential but also has the highest costs at the moment , " said kemfert .
" those costs will decline but it will take investment to do that . "
a german consortium known as desertec has proposed using concentrated solar power to build a network of power plants across the deserts of north africa and the middle east which would export much of their electricity to europe at a cost of approximately 400 billion euros by 2050 .
carbon capture and storage technologies , which inject carbon dioxide emitted by coal power plants into the ground rather than releasing the emissions into the atmosphere , would receive 13 billion euros in funding according to the eu roadmap , the second-highest sum in the report .
wind energy gets less additional research funds would also flow into research for biofuels , nuclear power , improving energy efficiency and building ' smart grid ' technology which will create a unified european electricity grid that can accommodate renewable forms of energy .
wind energy , which already provides a significant amount of electricity in germany and spain , would receive six billion euros of additional funding under the plan , which would enable wind power to supply 20 percent of the eu 's electricity needs by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing ' smart grid ' technology to ease power transmission is a key goal calling the funding proposal " a step in the right direction , " hermann albers , head of germany 's wind power federation was also critical of the commissions funding suggestions , noting that wind power already produced seven percent of germany 's electricity .
" the foreseen investments in wind energy are clearly too small in comparison to ccs and nuclear technology , " albers told deutsche welle .
" some rethinking on the eu level is urgently needed . "
new jobs and energy security in addition to helping europe meet its carbon reduction goals , the report emphasized that targeted investments in the renewable energy sector could stimulate the development of new industries and jobs and provide europe with an economic advantage in the decades ahead .
the additional 50 billion euros worth of spending could create as many as 600,000 new jobs , with the european renewable energy sector employing as many as 2.8 million people by 2020 , the study said .
europe 's energy security would also be improved by increasing the use of renewable fuels , the report said .
currently , 80 percent of european electricity production is derived from fossil fuels , much of which is imported from outside of the eu .

usually they consisted of a helmet , or a flag , or maybe a knife .
but in the case of robert thomas , an 18-year-old soldier in george patton 's third army , his souvenirs turned out to be two legal manuscripts more than 400 years old .
as the tide of the war turned and allied bombing began to take its toll on german buildings and institutions , rare books and artworks were moved underground to caves or abandoned mines .
it was in an abandoned salt mine in the small town of merkers outside of frankfurt that the young infantryman stumbled on a room filled from floor to ceiling with thousands of books .
a different kind of souvenir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert thomas , left , handed the books over to the german ambassador thomas grabbed two of the books and took them home with him to the united states .
" i kept them in two boxes in the darkest coolest place at my house in order to preserve them .
they are pretty much in the same condition as i found them , " said the 83-year-old veteran .
it was the officials at the national archives who urged thomas to return them to the rightful owner .
" the books will go home now .
that 's the right thing to do , " said thomas as he handed over the manuscripts .
the oldest of the two books , one written in german and the other latin , was published in 1573 and deals with prussian statutes .
the other was published in 1593 and is a treatise on roman law .
the books were originally from the diocesan museum of paderborn and will be returned to the university of bonn library where they were before the war .
at a ceremony at the national archives in washington dc where thomas handed the books over to german ambassador klaus scharioth , the ambassador said that getting the books back was a stroke of luck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the books are legal treatises " we 're really lucky to get these books back , " said scharioth .
" the fact that these books are returned tells you a lot about our relationship today - it 's a sign of friendship and trust . "
other manuscripts found it is not the first time that german manuscripts have been returned .
in 1992 , a woman who had lived through auschwitz turned over seven medieval manuscripts that had been taken by an american soldier who drove a tank in patton 's army .
the manuscripts were dated from the 15th and 16th centuries and were traced back to st. anthony 's church in the town of hambach near aachen .
one of the most famous hoards of german antiquities and manuscripts are known as the quedlinburg treasure .
the church treasures were hidden in a mine during the waning weeks of world war ii and disappeared soon after us troops occupied the area .
in the 1980s objets d 'art started surfacing in a small texas town in the united states , stolen by an american soldier .
when he died , his relatives tried to sell the art work and the ensuing court case made headlines .
in the end , the german cultural foundation bought most of the works for $ 3 million .
in 2008 , german cultural institutions published a catalog of over 180,000 works of art that disappeared after the war. av / afp / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

usually they consisted of a helmet , or a flag , or maybe a knife .
but in the case of robert thomas , an 18-year-old soldier in george patton 's third army , his souvenirs turned out to be two legal manuscripts more than 400 years old .
as the tide of the war turned and allied bombing began to take its toll on german buildings and institutions , rare books and artworks were moved underground to caves or abandoned mines .
it was in an abandoned salt mine in the small town of merkers outside of frankfurt that the young infantryman stumbled on a room filled from floor to ceiling with thousands of books .
a different kind of souvenir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert thomas , left , handed the books over to the german ambassador thomas grabbed two of the books and took them home with him to the united states .
" i kept them in two boxes in the darkest coolest place at my house in order to preserve them .
they are pretty much in the same condition as i found them , " said the 83-year-old veteran .
it was the officials at the national archives who urged thomas to return them to the rightful owner .
" the books will go home now .
that 's the right thing to do , " said thomas as he handed over the manuscripts .
the oldest of the two books , one written in german and the other latin , was published in 1573 and deals with prussian statutes .
the other was published in 1593 and is a treatise on roman law .
the books were originally from the diocesan museum of paderborn and will be returned to the university of bonn library where they were before the war .
at a ceremony at the national archives in washington dc where thomas handed the books over to german ambassador klaus scharioth , the ambassador said that getting the books back was a stroke of luck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the books are legal treatises " we 're really lucky to get these books back , " said scharioth .
" the fact that these books are returned tells you a lot about our relationship today - it 's a sign of friendship and trust . "
other manuscripts found it is not the first time that german manuscripts have been returned .
in 1992 , a woman who had lived through auschwitz turned over seven medieval manuscripts that had been taken by an american soldier who drove a tank in patton 's army .
the manuscripts were dated from the 15th and 16th centuries and were traced back to st. anthony 's church in the town of hambach near aachen .
one of the most famous hoards of german antiquities and manuscripts are known as the quedlinburg treasure .
the church treasures were hidden in a mine during the waning weeks of world war ii and disappeared soon after us troops occupied the area .
in the 1980s objets d 'art started surfacing in a small texas town in the united states , stolen by an american soldier .
when he died , his relatives tried to sell the art work and the ensuing court case made headlines .
in the end , the german cultural foundation bought most of the works for $ 3 million .
in 2008 , german cultural institutions published a catalog of over 180,000 works of art that disappeared after the war. av / afp / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the manuscripts were dated from the 15th and 16th centuries and were traced back to st. anthony 's church in the town of hambach near aachen .
one of the most famous hoards of german antiquities and manuscripts are known as the quedlinburg treasure .
the church treasures were hidden in a mine during the waning weeks of world war ii and disappeared soon after us troops occupied the area .
in the 1980s objets d 'art started surfacing in a small texas town in the united states , stolen by an american soldier .
when he died , his relatives tried to sell the art work and the ensuing court case made headlines .
in the end , the german cultural foundation bought most of the works for $ 3 million .

usually they consisted of a helmet , or a flag , or maybe a knife .
but in the case of robert thomas , an 18-year-old soldier in george patton 's third army , his souvenirs turned out to be two legal manuscripts more than 400 years old .
as the tide of the war turned and allied bombing began to take its toll on german buildings and institutions , rare books and artworks were moved underground to caves or abandoned mines .
it was in an abandoned salt mine in the small town of merkers outside of frankfurt that the young infantryman stumbled on a room filled from floor to ceiling with thousands of books .
a different kind of souvenir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert thomas , left , handed the books over to the german ambassador thomas grabbed two of the books and took them home with him to the united states .
" i kept them in two boxes in the darkest coolest place at my house in order to preserve them .
they are pretty much in the same condition as i found them , " said the 83-year-old veteran .
it was the officials at the national archives who urged thomas to return them to the rightful owner .
" the books will go home now .
that 's the right thing to do , " said thomas as he handed over the manuscripts .
the oldest of the two books , one written in german and the other latin , was published in 1573 and deals with prussian statutes .
the other was published in 1593 and is a treatise on roman law .
the books were originally from the diocesan museum of paderborn and will be returned to the university of bonn library where they were before the war .
at a ceremony at the national archives in washington dc where thomas handed the books over to german ambassador klaus scharioth , the ambassador said that getting the books back was a stroke of luck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the books are legal treatises " we 're really lucky to get these books back , " said scharioth .
" the fact that these books are returned tells you a lot about our relationship today - it 's a sign of friendship and trust . "

annual spending should be raised to eight billion euros if europe is to meet its goal of cutting carbon emissions 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
" today we have a unique opportunity to change an energy model based on polluting , scarce and risky fossil fuels , into a clean , sustainable and less dependent one , " said andris piebalgs , the eu 's energy commissioner , at a press conference in brussels wednesday .
a roadmap for future energy research spending dubbed the strategic energy technology plan -lrb- set -rrb- , the commission 's report emphasized that additional investment to promote technologies such as solar and wind power was urgently needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind power could produce 20 percent of europe 's electricity by 2020 " locked-in investments , vested interests , as well as the high risks and need for significant investments in less profitable alternatives , mean that change will be slow without a major push , " the study said .
the commission report is a roadmap that will help set funding priorities within the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , and the member states .
coordinating research and development among the eu 's 27 member governments will be difficult , said energy economist claudia kemfert of berlin 's diw research institute .
" individual member countries have to decide how much they want to spend and what they spend it on , " kemfert told deutsche welle .
" there will be pressure for them to spend the money in their own countries . "
the bulk of the new funding would come from the private sector and member states . the eu 's european trading system for co2 credits and the european investment bank will also provide some financing .
solar and carbon capture the big winners solar power projects receive the most attention in the set study , with 16 billion euros of funding proposed for the next decade with the goal of producing 15 percent of the eu 's electricity from solar power by 2020 .
some of the solar research projects supported by the set roadmap include new ways to build photovoltaic cells more cheaply and quickly than today and for further research in the field of concentrated solar power , which uses the sun 's energy to create heat that powers turbines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report proposes 13 billion euros of funding for carbon storage technology " solar power has the greatest potential but also has the highest costs at the moment , " said kemfert .
" those costs will decline but it will take investment to do that . "
a german consortium known as desertec has proposed using concentrated solar power to build a network of power plants across the deserts of north africa and the middle east which would export much of their electricity to europe at a cost of approximately 400 billion euros by 2050 .
carbon capture and storage technologies , which inject carbon dioxide emitted by coal power plants into the ground rather than releasing the emissions into the atmosphere , would receive 13 billion euros in funding according to the eu roadmap , the second-highest sum in the report .
wind energy gets less additional research funds would also flow into research for biofuels , nuclear power , improving energy efficiency and building ' smart grid ' technology which will create a unified european electricity grid that can accommodate renewable forms of energy .
wind energy , which already provides a significant amount of electricity in germany and spain , would receive six billion euros of additional funding under the plan , which would enable wind power to supply 20 percent of the eu 's electricity needs by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing ' smart grid ' technology to ease power transmission is a key goal calling the funding proposal " a step in the right direction , " hermann albers , head of germany 's wind power federation was also critical of the commissions funding suggestions , noting that wind power already produced seven percent of germany 's electricity .
" the foreseen investments in wind energy are clearly too small in comparison to ccs and nuclear technology , " albers told deutsche welle .
" some rethinking on the eu level is urgently needed . "
new jobs and energy security in addition to helping europe meet its carbon reduction goals , the report emphasized that targeted investments in the renewable energy sector could stimulate the development of new industries and jobs and provide europe with an economic advantage in the decades ahead .
the additional 50 billion euros worth of spending could create as many as 600,000 new jobs , with the european renewable energy sector employing as many as 2.8 million people by 2020 , the study said .
europe 's energy security would also be improved by increasing the use of renewable fuels , the report said .
currently , 80 percent of european electricity production is derived from fossil fuels , much of which is imported from outside of the eu .

annual spending should be raised to eight billion euros if europe is to meet its goal of cutting carbon emissions 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
" today we have a unique opportunity to change an energy model based on polluting , scarce and risky fossil fuels , into a clean , sustainable and less dependent one , " said andris piebalgs , the eu 's energy commissioner , at a press conference in brussels wednesday .
a roadmap for future energy research spending dubbed the strategic energy technology plan -lrb- set -rrb- , the commission 's report emphasized that additional investment to promote technologies such as solar and wind power was urgently needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind power could produce 20 percent of europe 's electricity by 2020 " locked-in investments , vested interests , as well as the high risks and need for significant investments in less profitable alternatives , mean that change will be slow without a major push , " the study said .
the commission report is a roadmap that will help set funding priorities within the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , and the member states .
coordinating research and development among the eu 's 27 member governments will be difficult , said energy economist claudia kemfert of berlin 's diw research institute .
" individual member countries have to decide how much they want to spend and what they spend it on , " kemfert told deutsche welle .
" there will be pressure for them to spend the money in their own countries . "
the bulk of the new funding would come from the private sector and member states . the eu 's european trading system for co2 credits and the european investment bank will also provide some financing .
solar and carbon capture the big winners solar power projects receive the most attention in the set study , with 16 billion euros of funding proposed for the next decade with the goal of producing 15 percent of the eu 's electricity from solar power by 2020 .
some of the solar research projects supported by the set roadmap include new ways to build photovoltaic cells more cheaply and quickly than today and for further research in the field of concentrated solar power , which uses the sun 's energy to create heat that powers turbines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report proposes 13 billion euros of funding for carbon storage technology " solar power has the greatest potential but also has the highest costs at the moment , " said kemfert .
" those costs will decline but it will take investment to do that . "
a german consortium known as desertec has proposed using concentrated solar power to build a network of power plants across the deserts of north africa and the middle east which would export much of their electricity to europe at a cost of approximately 400 billion euros by 2050 .
carbon capture and storage technologies , which inject carbon dioxide emitted by coal power plants into the ground rather than releasing the emissions into the atmosphere , would receive 13 billion euros in funding according to the eu roadmap , the second-highest sum in the report .
wind energy gets less additional research funds would also flow into research for biofuels , nuclear power , improving energy efficiency and building ' smart grid ' technology which will create a unified european electricity grid that can accommodate renewable forms of energy .
wind energy , which already provides a significant amount of electricity in germany and spain , would receive six billion euros of additional funding under the plan , which would enable wind power to supply 20 percent of the eu 's electricity needs by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing ' smart grid ' technology to ease power transmission is a key goal calling the funding proposal " a step in the right direction , " hermann albers , head of germany 's wind power federation was also critical of the commissions funding suggestions , noting that wind power already produced seven percent of germany 's electricity .
" the foreseen investments in wind energy are clearly too small in comparison to ccs and nuclear technology , " albers told deutsche welle .
" some rethinking on the eu level is urgently needed . "
new jobs and energy security in addition to helping europe meet its carbon reduction goals , the report emphasized that targeted investments in the renewable energy sector could stimulate the development of new industries and jobs and provide europe with an economic advantage in the decades ahead .
the additional 50 billion euros worth of spending could create as many as 600,000 new jobs , with the european renewable energy sector employing as many as 2.8 million people by 2020 , the study said .
europe 's energy security would also be improved by increasing the use of renewable fuels , the report said .
currently , 80 percent of european electricity production is derived from fossil fuels , much of which is imported from outside of the eu .

she was fired for helping herself to a meatball from a conference buffet at her workplace .
the case is to be heard in january . the 57-year-old secretary , identified in the german media as magdalene h , worked for the builders ' association in the state of north-rhine westphalia for more than three decades .
the incident took place last july when she organized a conference buffet for her boss and his guests and helped herself to two rolls and a frikadelle , a german meatball specialty , during the preparations .
boss insists firing was right thing german mass-selling newspaper bild reported on wednesday that magdalene h was confronted by her boss after a colleague noticed some food was missing .
but once she admitted to consuming the meatball , she was fired .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frikadellen are popular in germany " she believed her behavior was acceptable , " her lawyer , wolfgang pinkepank , told bild .
" bread and meatballs that are left over after conferences are allowed to be eaten by workers .
if she had been reprimanded , she would not have done it again . "
the newspaper reported that a judge in the courtroom where the secretary and her employer , hermann schulte-hiltrop , met on tuesday urged schulte-hiltrop to issue a warning instead of a firing , saying the incident was not a classic case of theft .
but schulte-hiltrop , the head of the builders ' association , insisted he had done the right thing in firing her .
" from the outside it naturally looks like a minor offence , " he said .
" but we work on highly sensitive information here .
and if you do n't trust someone any longer , it 's not a good feeling . "
" inhumane and immoral " the case , which is to be officially heard in january 2010 , has sparked anger among labor unions and politicians .
michael groschek , the secretary general of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in north-rhine westphalia called the incident " inhumane and immoral . "
" we should n't tolerate managers getting hefty bonuses despite squandering millions on speculative trading and ordinary people being turned out on the streets on account of eating a meatball , " groschek told news agency ap .
juergen czech of the labor union ig construction , agriculture and environment said the employer needed to ask himself what the firing meant for the secretary , warning that at her age , magdalene h , would have difficulties finding a new job .

she was fired for helping herself to a meatball from a conference buffet at her workplace .
the case is to be heard in january . the 57-year-old secretary , identified in the german media as magdalene h , worked for the builders ' association in the state of north-rhine westphalia for more than three decades .
the incident took place last july when she organized a conference buffet for her boss and his guests and helped herself to two rolls and a frikadelle , a german meatball specialty , during the preparations .
boss insists firing was right thing german mass-selling newspaper bild reported on wednesday that magdalene h was confronted by her boss after a colleague noticed some food was missing .
but once she admitted to consuming the meatball , she was fired .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frikadellen are popular in germany " she believed her behavior was acceptable , " her lawyer , wolfgang pinkepank , told bild .
" bread and meatballs that are left over after conferences are allowed to be eaten by workers .
if she had been reprimanded , she would not have done it again . "
the newspaper reported that a judge in the courtroom where the secretary and her employer , hermann schulte-hiltrop , met on tuesday urged schulte-hiltrop to issue a warning instead of a firing , saying the incident was not a classic case of theft .
but schulte-hiltrop , the head of the builders ' association , insisted he had done the right thing in firing her .
" from the outside it naturally looks like a minor offence , " he said .
" but we work on highly sensitive information here .
and if you do n't trust someone any longer , it 's not a good feeling . "
" inhumane and immoral " the case , which is to be officially heard in january 2010 , has sparked anger among labor unions and politicians .
michael groschek , the secretary general of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in north-rhine westphalia called the incident " inhumane and immoral . "
" we should n't tolerate managers getting hefty bonuses despite squandering millions on speculative trading and ordinary people being turned out on the streets on account of eating a meatball , " groschek told news agency ap .
juergen czech of the labor union ig construction , agriculture and environment said the employer needed to ask himself what the firing meant for the secretary , warning that at her age , magdalene h , would have difficulties finding a new job .

he is an outspoken man who likes to use direct and colorful language , especially when comparing the cost of bank bailouts with the amount of aid paid to help the world 's poorest nations weather the economic storm .
" in one night we passed $ 700 billion to the banks , " stiglitz says .
" global foreign aid has really been $ 60-70 billion a year .
so in one hour we passed all the foreign aid of all the developed countries to all the developing countries for a decade . "
" and you ask : who is more needy ?
the american banker or developing countries ?
it 's hard not to come up with the conclusion that our values got destroyed . "
new philosophy for imf lending although the columbia university professor says the international monetary fund has done a good job of managing the crisis so far .
he still urges the imf to rethink its lending policies .
in the past , stiglitz says , imf-credits often had damaging side-effects for the recipients .
the loans were usually tied to drastic reform programs that sent the economies of many borrowers into a downward spiral .
stiglitz warns that if the imf wants to become a global insurer against economic disruption , as the funds 's director dominique strauss-kahn claims , then it needs to take a new approach to dealing with the needs of poor countries .
" when you have a crisis and the doctor comes in and says : ' by the way , if you want the medicine you have to do a , b , c and d ' and you say ' i do n't want to do a , b , c and d ' - you are not getting medicine , then it does n't serve the function of insurance , " stiglitz points out .
global finance sector needs taxation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the imf is working hard to prevent another financial crisis financial markets should also be subject of new taxes designed to discourage ' dysfunctional ' trading and help pay for the damage the global crisis has inflicted on poorer countries , stiglitz says .
imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn recently announced that the washington-based organization is already studying ways to tax the financial industry at the request of group of 20 leaders .
such a global financial-transaction tax would only be fair , the stiglitz argues , and it would not be without precedent .
" in environmental economics we have a principle called ' polluter pay ' .
if you cause pollution you have to pay for the clean-up .
the financial sector polluted the global economy with toxic assets and now they ought to clean up that , " the nobel prize-winning economist says .
excessive risk-taking by the banking sector has imposed huge costs on the rest of the society , including workers , developing nations , house-holders and tax-payers , he explains .
a global tax on financial market transactions is therefore not just a question of equity , but a question of efficiency .
stiglitz stresses that such a tax would also help shrink a ' bloated ' financial industry in the united states , arguing that statistics showing that the finance sector accounted for 40 percent of us corporate profits before the crisis were a clear signal that “ something 's wrong . ”
tax revenues could be used for poor countries stiglitz says the money raised by the proposed tax could be used to help poor countries , which were by no means responsible for the financial crisis , but are nevertheless suffering its worst consequences .
according to estimates by the development committee of the world bank and the international monetary fund , another 90 million people around the world are at risk of being driven into extreme poverty by the end of 2010 .

they are small , they strike at night and they can be deadly : mosquitos carrying malaria .
it 's one of the deadliest diseases in africa .
yet it ’ s quite easily preventable . malaria is one of africa 's biggest plagues .
it kills almost a million people a year around the world .
90 % of those who die are in africa .
pregnant women and small children are particularly vulnerable .
it 's mostly the poor who die , because they often ca n't afford any treatment once the first symptoms break out .
in any case , prevention is better than cure .
some forms of malaria do n't react to many available drugs anyhow .
but prevention tends to be simple .
for instance , sleeping under a mosquito net or by wearing long-sleeved clothes after sun set .
for other useful hints , tune in to our new series about malaria .
we follow one african family in its quest to eradicate malaria .
and , on the way , they teach us what we can do against it .

they are small , they strike at night and they can be deadly : mosquitos carrying malaria .
it 's one of the deadliest diseases in africa .
yet it ’ s quite easily preventable . malaria is one of africa 's biggest plagues .
it kills almost a million people a year around the world .
90 % of those who die are in africa .
pregnant women and small children are particularly vulnerable .
it 's mostly the poor who die , because they often ca n't afford any treatment once the first symptoms break out .
in any case , prevention is better than cure .
some forms of malaria do n't react to many available drugs anyhow .
but prevention tends to be simple .
for instance , sleeping under a mosquito net or by wearing long-sleeved clothes after sun set .
for other useful hints , tune in to our new series about malaria .

currently there are more than 100,000 soldiers in the country .
president obama is currently mulling over whether to send in more troops . during the war in afghanistan in 2001 that followed the attacks of sept .
11 , the us military tried to destroy taliban positions through massive air bombardments .
the war on the ground was conducted mainly by the so called northern alliance , a loose union of warlords with combat experience from the afghan civil war .
the northern alliance received american and british military support .
the military conflict with the taliban ended officially - at least for a while - with the takeover of afghanistan 's capital kabul by northern alliance troops on nov .
12 .
on dec .
5 , 2001 the petersberg agreement on afghanistan was signed in bonn , germany and hamid karzai was named head of the interim government .
in addition , the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- was established by the un security council with a mandate to establish peace and security in afghanistan .
all 28 nato member states participated in the isaf mission .
more than 1,000 soldiers killed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign troops have come under increasing attack from the taliban nato took over the isaf mission with its 5,500 troops in august 2003 .
by october 2009 the troop size had surged more than tenfold to 66,000 soldier from 42 countries .
since 2001 more than 1,000 nato soldiers have been killed in afghanistan , more than half of them americans .
35 german troops have been killed .
in addition to isaf there are 35,000 foreign troops in afghanistan , who participate in the us-lead anti-terror mission operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- .
that brings the number of the combined foreign troops to over 100,000 , with two thirds of them being us forces .
the afghan army currently consists of 90,000 soldiers , the number of taliban fighters is estimated at around 20,000 .
since the newly elected us president barack obama announced a troop increase in early 2009 , the number of us soldiers has gone up once more by 15,000 .
by the end of the year there are scheduled to be 68,000 us soldiers in afghanistan .
britain has contributed the second-largest military contingent , germany comes in third place .

however , parliament subsequently approved additional deployments increasing troop levels in afghanistan to 3,500 in 2007 .
last october , germany 's parliament signed off on additional deployment of up to 1,000 soldiers by dec .
13 , 2009 , however that level has yet to be reached .
in addition to the permanent deployments to afghanistan , germany and many other countries increased their contingents temporarily for the afghan presidential elections in august .
including those troops , there are currently 4,200 german soldiers on the ground in afghanistan .

he is an outspoken man who likes to use direct and colorful language , especially when comparing the cost of bank bailouts with the amount of aid paid to help the world 's poorest nations weather the economic storm .
" in one night we passed $ 700 billion to the banks , " stiglitz says .
" global foreign aid has really been $ 60-70 billion a year .
so in one hour we passed all the foreign aid of all the developed countries to all the developing countries for a decade . "
" and you ask : who is more needy ?
the american banker or developing countries ?
it 's hard not to come up with the conclusion that our values got destroyed . "
new philosophy for imf lending although the columbia university professor says the international monetary fund has done a good job of managing the crisis so far .
he still urges the imf to rethink its lending policies .
in the past , stiglitz says , imf-credits often had damaging side-effects for the recipients .
the loans were usually tied to drastic reform programs that sent the economies of many borrowers into a downward spiral .
stiglitz warns that if the imf wants to become a global insurer against economic disruption , as the funds 's director dominique strauss-kahn claims , then it needs to take a new approach to dealing with the needs of poor countries .
" when you have a crisis and the doctor comes in and says : ' by the way , if you want the medicine you have to do a , b , c and d ' and you say ' i do n't want to do a , b , c and d ' - you are not getting medicine , then it does n't serve the function of insurance , " stiglitz points out .
global finance sector needs taxation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the imf is working hard to prevent another financial crisis financial markets should also be subject of new taxes designed to discourage ' dysfunctional ' trading and help pay for the damage the global crisis has inflicted on poorer countries , stiglitz says .
imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn recently announced that the washington-based organization is already studying ways to tax the financial industry at the request of group of 20 leaders .
such a global financial-transaction tax would only be fair , the stiglitz argues , and it would not be without precedent .
" in environmental economics we have a principle called ' polluter pay ' .
if you cause pollution you have to pay for the clean-up .
the financial sector polluted the global economy with toxic assets and now they ought to clean up that , " the nobel prize-winning economist says .
excessive risk-taking by the banking sector has imposed huge costs on the rest of the society , including workers , developing nations , house-holders and tax-payers , he explains .
a global tax on financial market transactions is therefore not just a question of equity , but a question of efficiency .
stiglitz stresses that such a tax would also help shrink a ' bloated ' financial industry in the united states , arguing that statistics showing that the finance sector accounted for 40 percent of us corporate profits before the crisis were a clear signal that “ something 's wrong . ”
tax revenues could be used for poor countries stiglitz says the money raised by the proposed tax could be used to help poor countries , which were by no means responsible for the financial crisis , but are nevertheless suffering its worst consequences .
according to estimates by the development committee of the world bank and the international monetary fund , another 90 million people around the world are at risk of being driven into extreme poverty by the end of 2010 .

it took 40 years before the berlin wall fell and germany was reunited . sixty years ago , delegates gathered in the grand hall of the former aviation ministry in berlin as germans across the soviet occupied zone followed the events on the radio .
the reporter announced the events as " a piece of german history unfolding . "
a short time later wilhelm pieck declared the birth of the first " workers and peasants state on german soil . "
pieck became the first president of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , as east germany was officially known .
" based on the new constitution , the german democratic republic has been founded unanimously by all parties and organizations present in the german people 's council , " pieck said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilhelm pieck became the first president of east germany less than one month earlier , on september 15 , 1949 , konrad adenauer had been elected as first chancellor of west germany .
in the eyes of the communists in east germany and moscow , adenauer was the " chancellor of western imperialism , " portrayed as the enemy of the people .
one day later , the soviet leadership in moscow sent a delegation of german communist exiles to berlin to implement a socialist alternative to the west .
a division of europe unfolds the creation of two separate german states confirmed what many had expected in the aftermath of world war ii .
the border between east and west germany was not yet fortified with barbed wire – but already it marked the division not only of germany but of europe as a whole .
the two states on both sides of the new border became satellites of their respective allied occupiers .
the soviet dictator josef stalin had a clear agenda in mind .
with the creation of east germany , he pushed the political and military influence of the soviet union well into the heart of europe .
stalin described the new communist state as " the creation of a peace loving , democratic germany alongside the peaceful soviet union . "
according to stalin , the new state would prevent both new wars and the " enslavement of european countries by the western imperialists . "
the " better " german state in west germany , economic progress and political stability soon helped people to get over the woes of the post-war hardship .
but east german leaders wanted more than just material prosperity .
they wanted a fresh ideological start after the catastrophe of nazi germany .
bildunterschrift : the birth of east germany was celebrated with parades in berlin many of the citizens ' of the new eastern state agreed with that concept .
for them , socialism seemed like the proper answer to fascism , war and the holocaust .
walter ulbricht , who became a top communist party official , said the crucial issue was " the struggle against fascist ideology and against other reactionary ideologies that work against the interests of the working class and against progress and development in germany . "
ulbricht later said that " there will be a day when the sed -lrb- east germany 's communist party -rrb- will be the leading party of all of germany – because the majority of germans will want it that way . "
but as enthusiastic as the first reactions were – the dramatic loss of faith in the political leadership installed by moscow came very soon .
an experiment gone wrong the gdr seemed doomed from the very beginning .
the vision that one day its party would lead all of germany was soon turned to be on its head .
in 1989 , peaceful revolution toppled the communist regime .
in the end it was the people of the gdr that wanted the political system of the west and not vice versa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the 40th anniversary was celebrated in 1989 , the end of the regime was only weeks away yet in october 1989 the communist leadership seemed to be in denial that the end was near .
they staged an elaborate celebration to mark the then 40th anniversary of east germany .
yet at that time east germans were already out on the streets demonstrating for change – and thousands had already fled the " workers ' and peasants ' paradise " via hungary to west germany .
in a few weeks from then , on november 9 , 1989 , the berlin wall came down to dramatically mark the collapse of east germany .
after 40 years of gdr , the dream of the allegedly " better " version of germany burst with a momentum so powerful that the citizens of the communist east had lost all faith and interest to change their state and have it survive into a new era .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 07.10.2009 czech republic plagued by doubts about future path großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague is a jewel , its politics are complex with the fate of the eu resting in the hands of the czech republic , the country has become the focus of media attention .
but as it parades in the limelight , the young democracy can not hide its many troubles . for years , the czech republic was hailed as the wunderkind of the former east bloc countries , the shining economic example and leader of the pack .
in record time , it appeared to have shed its past to become a fully-fledged member of the western world .
but now , 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall , much of the glitter has fallen off europe 's brightest new star , and it has become tangled up in a mess of domestic political infighting and an apparent inability to decide what it wants and where it wants to stand on the international stage .
so what went wrong ?
petr kratochvil , deputy director of the prague institute of international relations , said it all started after the country had secured the two things it knew it wanted : nato and eu membership .
" there were two phases after 1989 , " kratochvil told deutsche welle .
" the first was the transition from the communist past to the establishment of a democratic system . "
behind that clear aim , he says , the nation and its politicians did willingly unite .
but once it had been achieved , the new democracy did n't know what to do next .
struggling for unity and , kratochvil says , the czech republic has not yet come up with an answer .
" there has been no unity across the political spectrum ever since , " he said , adding that on the whole politicians are more concerned with petty arguments and scoring points than with the country itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan fischer earlier this year , the animosity led to a vote of no confidence for the government .
since then the country has been in the hands of a caretaker government under the leadership of a bureaucrat , jan fischer , the former head of the national statistics office .
he took on the interim post promising that his would not be a government of vision , but one of hard work .
" i really hope that we 'll be able to do something for our country , " fischer said at the time of his appointment .
" we will lead the czech republic into new elections and we 'll do this quietly and with respect for all of our international obligations . "
however , that is not the way things have gone .
a snap election was planned for november .
but in what may have been classic czech political style , the social democrats , whose backing was necessary for the vote to take place , suddenly backed out , leaving the poll scheduled for june 2010 .
a history of change political scientist jiri pehe , director of new york university in prague , says such instability is partially a consequence of having been subjected to an ever-changing political elite .
" we have never had time to develop a robust political culture based on self-confidence , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have an institutional democracy which was built at tremendous speed , " he said , adding that democratic values such as respect for minorities and tolerance of other people have developed at a much slower pace .
" we do n't have democracy as a culture . "
and that , he says , is the trouble with people like president vaclav klaus and the 17 senators who are holding both their country and europe hostage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of czechs want to be part of europe , but klaus does n't " deep down , they are not democrats , " pehe said .
" they feel they have the absolute truth and do n't care whether or not 500 million people agree with it . "
motivated by self-importance pehe believes the president 's reluctance to add his name to the controversial lisbon treaty is rooted in the national conviction " that the czechs have something intellectually unique to offer europe , something so unique it is worth fighting for . "
but it is that notion of national self-importance - coupled with a worry that no matter what the czech republic does , big international decisions will ultimately be made by major powers - which is getting in the way of the country 's future .
" the idea that the country can not contribute so it is not worth trying to , limits the capacity of politicians to act , " pehe said .
some commentators have said vaclav klaus is thoroughly enjoying the attention he is getting from holding out on europe , but pehe says it has swayed public opinion against him .
so perhaps it is , as jan fischer told eu leaders in brussels on wednesday , really just a matter of time before the czech republic ratifies the treaty and thereby makes a clear statement on at least one outstanding issue .

according to the commission , the eu 's executive arm , 20 of the bloc 's 27 member countries are on track to break that limit this year .
in july , brussels launched action against latvia , lithuania , malta , poland and romania following earlier procedures against france , greece , ireland and spain .
eu blames recession for budget woes the commission blamed the ballooning budget deficits on the global recession , admitting that several eu governments had increased their public spending to limit the impact of the economic crisis .
several eu countries are grappling with falling tax revenues and rising unemployment and many have initiated economic stimulus measures and bail-outs for banks and leading companies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia says the offenders will not be forced to radically rein in spending in light of the recession " a large majority of eu member states are set to have budget deficits above 3 percent of gdp in 2009 as a result of the economic crisis .
we need to continue supporting the economy until the recovery takes hold , in line with the european economic recovery plan , " economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said .
but the commissioner also warned that eu governments need to rein in public spending and bring their public finances back in order .
" now is also the moment to design coordinated exit strategies so that , when the moment is right , we can begin to roll back the soaring debt levels , " he said .
almunia said the stability and growth pact under which the action was taken " is sufficiently flexible to combine the fiscal stimulus in the short term with consolidation of the public finances in the medium term . "
germany grapples with soaring deficit germany 's budget deficit will be 3.9 percent of gdp this year and 5.9 percent next year , the commission said .
the recession in europe 's largest economy has slashed tax revenues and increased government spending on subsidies .
leaked government documents in germany this week said that public deficits need to be cut by 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 56 billion -rrb- between 2011 and 2013 .
bildunterschrift : the soaring deficit is a political issue in germany - merkel here with the fdp 's guido westerwelle germany 's soaring deficit is also a bone of contention for the country 's next center-right government .
the pro-business fdp party , which is set to form a coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives , won the election largely on the back of promised tax cuts .
but merkel has warned that the spiraling budget deficit reduces the scope for immediate tax relief , and that there wo n't be any cuts before 2011 .
the commission has estimated a deficit of 4.5 percent for italy , 3.4 percent in the netherlands and 6.5 percent in portugal .
europe still suffering from downturn europe hit a recovery setback on wednesday with the euro-zone economy shrinking more than expected .
finance ministers from the 16 nations that use the euro agreed last week at a meeting in sweden that their countries would have to take action in 2011 against debt and public deficits .
the pact " must not be interpreted as offering one-way flexibility , " euro-group head and luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker warned .
the stability and growth pact was established in the 1990s to boost confidence in the euro .
in 2005 , the pact was loosened , making it easier for countries breaching the 3 percent limit to avoid sanctions .
nations that overshoot the eu deficit limit can be subject to economic sanctions , though none have so far been fined. sp / afp / reuters / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she was fired for helping herself to a meatball from a conference buffet at her workplace .
the case is to be heard in january . the 57-year-old secretary , identified in the german media as magdalene h , worked for the builders ' association in the state of north-rhine westphalia for more than three decades .
the incident took place last july when she organized a conference buffet for her boss and his guests and helped herself to two rolls and a frikadelle , a german meatball specialty , during the preparations .
boss insists firing was right thing german mass-selling newspaper bild reported on wednesday that magdalene h was confronted by her boss after a colleague noticed some food was missing .
but once she admitted to consuming the meatball , she was fired .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frikadellen are popular in germany " she believed her behavior was acceptable , " her lawyer , wolfgang pinkepank , told bild .
" bread and meatballs that are left over after conferences are allowed to be eaten by workers .
if she had been reprimanded , she would not have done it again . "
the newspaper reported that a judge in the courtroom where the secretary and her employer , hermann schulte-hiltrop , met on tuesday urged schulte-hiltrop to issue a warning instead of a firing , saying the incident was not a classic case of theft .
but schulte-hiltrop , the head of the builders ' association , insisted he had done the right thing in firing her .
" from the outside it naturally looks like a minor offence , " he said .
" but we work on highly sensitive information here .
and if you do n't trust someone any longer , it 's not a good feeling . "
" inhumane and immoral " the case , which is to be officially heard in january 2010 , has sparked anger among labor unions and politicians .
michael groschek , the secretary general of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in north-rhine westphalia called the incident " inhumane and immoral . "
" we should n't tolerate managers getting hefty bonuses despite squandering millions on speculative trading and ordinary people being turned out on the streets on account of eating a meatball , " groschek told news agency ap .
juergen czech of the labor union ig construction , agriculture and environment said the employer needed to ask himself what the firing meant for the secretary , warning that at her age , magdalene h , would have difficulties finding a new job .

the war on the ground was conducted mainly by the so called northern alliance , a loose union of warlords with combat experience from the afghan civil war .
the northern alliance received american and british military support .
the military conflict with the taliban ended officially - at least for a while - with the takeover of afghanistan 's capital kabul by northern alliance troops on nov .

the nobel jury said they were honored for their studies on how ribosomes function , a breakthrough that has been vital in the development of new antibiotics .
the nobel committee cited the work of the trio as " directly assisting the saving of lives and decreasing humanity 's suffering . "
" many of today 's antibiotics cure various diseases by blocking the function of bacterial ribosomes .
without functional ribosomes , bacteria can not survive .
this is why ribosomes are such an important target for new antibiotics . "
research crucial to developing new drugs the three scientists have generated three-dimensional models to illustrating the ribosomes ' individual atomic structure .
these models are now used in the quest for new antibiotics .
about half the current antibiotics in use block the function of bacterial ribosomes , but there is a growing problem of bacterial strains that are resistant to drugs , the committee said on wednesday .
the three will share the 10 million swedish crowns -lrb- 1 million euros , $ 1.42 million -rrb- prize .
steitz , a professor for molecular biophysics at yale university , told reporters he was about to go to the gym when he received the phone call from stockholm .
" my caller from stockholm said i should n't go to the gym .
there would be phone calls , " the scientist told swedish radio .
ramakrishnan works at the mrc laboratory of molecular biology at cambridge university .
yonath , who works at the department of structural biology at the weizmann institute of science in israel , said she did not expect the prize about a discovery made almost a decade ago .
the nobel prizes are handed out annually for achievements in science , literature , economics and peace .
the prize in chemistry was this year 's third , following awards for medicine on monday and physics on tuesday. ai / reuters / dpa / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

usually they consisted of a helmet , or a flag , or maybe a knife .
but in the case of robert thomas , an 18-year-old soldier in george patton 's third army , his souvenirs turned out to be two legal manuscripts more than 400 years old .
as the tide of the war turned and allied bombing began to take its toll on german buildings and institutions , rare books and artworks were moved underground to caves or abandoned mines .
it was in an abandoned salt mine in the small town of merkers outside of frankfurt that the young infantryman stumbled on a room filled from floor to ceiling with thousands of books .
a different kind of souvenir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert thomas , left , handed the books over to the german ambassador thomas grabbed two of the books and took them home with him to the united states .
" i kept them in two boxes in the darkest coolest place at my house in order to preserve them .
they are pretty much in the same condition as i found them , " said the 83-year-old veteran .
it was the officials at the national archives who urged thomas to return them to the rightful owner .
" the books will go home now .
that 's the right thing to do , " said thomas as he handed over the manuscripts .
the oldest of the two books , one written in german and the other latin , was published in 1573 and deals with prussian statutes .
the other was published in 1593 and is a treatise on roman law .
the books were originally from the diocesan museum of paderborn and will be returned to the university of bonn library where they were before the war .
at a ceremony at the national archives in washington dc where thomas handed the books over to german ambassador klaus scharioth , the ambassador said that getting the books back was a stroke of luck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the books are legal treatises " we 're really lucky to get these books back , " said scharioth .
" the fact that these books are returned tells you a lot about our relationship today - it 's a sign of friendship and trust . "
other manuscripts found it is not the first time that german manuscripts have been returned .
in 1992 , a woman who had lived through auschwitz turned over seven medieval manuscripts that had been taken by an american soldier who drove a tank in patton 's army .
the manuscripts were dated from the 15th and 16th centuries and were traced back to st. anthony 's church in the town of hambach near aachen .
one of the most famous hoards of german antiquities and manuscripts are known as the quedlinburg treasure .
the church treasures were hidden in a mine during the waning weeks of world war ii and disappeared soon after us troops occupied the area .
in the 1980s objets d 'art started surfacing in a small texas town in the united states , stolen by an american soldier .
when he died , his relatives tried to sell the art work and the ensuing court case made headlines .
in the end , the german cultural foundation bought most of the works for $ 3 million .
in 2008 , german cultural institutions published a catalog of over 180,000 works of art that disappeared after the war. av / afp / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

president obama is currently mulling over whether to send in more troops . during the war in afghanistan in 2001 that followed the attacks of sept .
11 , the us military tried to destroy taliban positions through massive air bombardments .
the war on the ground was conducted mainly by the so called northern alliance , a loose union of warlords with combat experience from the afghan civil war .
the northern alliance received american and british military support .
the military conflict with the taliban ended officially - at least for a while - with the takeover of afghanistan 's capital kabul by northern alliance troops on nov .
12 .
on dec .
5 , 2001 the petersberg agreement on afghanistan was signed in bonn , germany and hamid karzai was named head of the interim government .
in addition , the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- was established by the un security council with a mandate to establish peace and security in afghanistan .
all 28 nato member states participated in the isaf mission .
more than 1,000 soldiers killed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign troops have come under increasing attack from the taliban nato took over the isaf mission with its 5,500 troops in august 2003 .
by october 2009 the troop size had surged more than tenfold to 66,000 soldier from 42 countries .
since 2001 more than 1,000 nato soldiers have been killed in afghanistan , more than half of them americans .
35 german troops have been killed .
in addition to isaf there are 35,000 foreign troops in afghanistan , who participate in the us-lead anti-terror mission operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- .
that brings the number of the combined foreign troops to over 100,000 , with two thirds of them being us forces .
the afghan army currently consists of 90,000 soldiers , the number of taliban fighters is estimated at around 20,000 .
since the newly elected us president barack obama announced a troop increase in early 2009 , the number of us soldiers has gone up once more by 15,000 .
by the end of the year there are scheduled to be 68,000 us soldiers in afghanistan .
britain has contributed the second-largest military contingent , germany comes in third place .
bildunterschrift : more than 4000 german troops originally the german parliament allowed only 1,200 soldiers to be sent to afghanistan .
however , parliament subsequently approved additional deployments increasing troop levels in afghanistan to 3,500 in 2007 .
last october , germany 's parliament signed off on additional deployment of up to 1,000 soldiers by dec .
13 , 2009 , however that level has yet to be reached .
in addition to the permanent deployments to afghanistan , germany and many other countries increased their contingents temporarily for the afghan presidential elections in august .
including those troops , there are currently 4,200 german soldiers on the ground in afghanistan .
since july 2009 there is also an additional contingent of 300 german soldiers who have been deployed to monitor afghan air space aboard the tornado-awacs surveillance planes .
however , the german government has emphasized that awacs surveillance would not be used to support us-led oef-operations , in which germany no longer participates .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de alternative energy -pipe- 07.10.2009 eu wants to boost green energy spending by 50 billion euros großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar power would receive the most money under the eu plan investment in clean energy technology should be boosted by 50 billion euros through 2020 in order for europe to meet its climate goals , according to a new report issued by the european commission on wednesday . currently , the european union and its member states spend about three billion euros a year on various forms of alternative and renewable energy but this sum is not sufficient , the report said .
annual spending should be raised to eight billion euros if europe is to meet its goal of cutting carbon emissions 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
" today we have a unique opportunity to change an energy model based on polluting , scarce and risky fossil fuels , into a clean , sustainable and less dependent one , " said andris piebalgs , the eu 's energy commissioner , at a press conference in brussels wednesday .
a roadmap for future energy research spending dubbed the strategic energy technology plan -lrb- set -rrb- , the commission 's report emphasized that additional investment to promote technologies such as solar and wind power was urgently needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind power could produce 20 percent of europe 's electricity by 2020 " locked-in investments , vested interests , as well as the high risks and need for significant investments in less profitable alternatives , mean that change will be slow without a major push , " the study said .
the commission report is a roadmap that will help set funding priorities within the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , and the member states .
coordinating research and development among the eu 's 27 member governments will be difficult , said energy economist claudia kemfert of berlin 's diw research institute .
" individual member countries have to decide how much they want to spend and what they spend it on , " kemfert told deutsche welle .
" there will be pressure for them to spend the money in their own countries . "
the bulk of the new funding would come from the private sector and member states . the eu 's european trading system for co2 credits and the european investment bank will also provide some financing .
solar and carbon capture the big winners solar power projects receive the most attention in the set study , with 16 billion euros of funding proposed for the next decade with the goal of producing 15 percent of the eu 's electricity from solar power by 2020 .
some of the solar research projects supported by the set roadmap include new ways to build photovoltaic cells more cheaply and quickly than today and for further research in the field of concentrated solar power , which uses the sun 's energy to create heat that powers turbines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report proposes 13 billion euros of funding for carbon storage technology " solar power has the greatest potential but also has the highest costs at the moment , " said kemfert .
" those costs will decline but it will take investment to do that . "
a german consortium known as desertec has proposed using concentrated solar power to build a network of power plants across the deserts of north africa and the middle east which would export much of their electricity to europe at a cost of approximately 400 billion euros by 2050 .
carbon capture and storage technologies , which inject carbon dioxide emitted by coal power plants into the ground rather than releasing the emissions into the atmosphere , would receive 13 billion euros in funding according to the eu roadmap , the second-highest sum in the report .
wind energy gets less additional research funds would also flow into research for biofuels , nuclear power , improving energy efficiency and building ' smart grid ' technology which will create a unified european electricity grid that can accommodate renewable forms of energy .
wind energy , which already provides a significant amount of electricity in germany and spain , would receive six billion euros of additional funding under the plan , which would enable wind power to supply 20 percent of the eu 's electricity needs by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing ' smart grid ' technology to ease power transmission is a key goal calling the funding proposal " a step in the right direction , " hermann albers , head of germany 's wind power federation was also critical of the commissions funding suggestions , noting that wind power already produced seven percent of germany 's electricity .
" the foreseen investments in wind energy are clearly too small in comparison to ccs and nuclear technology , " albers told deutsche welle .
" some rethinking on the eu level is urgently needed . "
new jobs and energy security in addition to helping europe meet its carbon reduction goals , the report emphasized that targeted investments in the renewable energy sector could stimulate the development of new industries and jobs and provide europe with an economic advantage in the decades ahead .
the additional 50 billion euros worth of spending could create as many as 600,000 new jobs , with the european renewable energy sector employing as many as 2.8 million people by 2020 , the study said .
europe 's energy security would also be improved by increasing the use of renewable fuels , the report said .
currently , 80 percent of european electricity production is derived from fossil fuels , much of which is imported from outside of the eu .

the additional 50 billion euros worth of spending could create as many as 600,000 new jobs , with the european renewable energy sector employing as many as 2.8 million people by 2020 , the study said .
europe 's energy security would also be improved by increasing the use of renewable fuels , the report said .
currently , 80 percent of european electricity production is derived from fossil fuels , much of which is imported from outside of the eu .

annual spending should be raised to eight billion euros if europe is to meet its goal of cutting carbon emissions 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
" today we have a unique opportunity to change an energy model based on polluting , scarce and risky fossil fuels , into a clean , sustainable and less dependent one , " said andris piebalgs , the eu 's energy commissioner , at a press conference in brussels wednesday .
a roadmap for future energy research spending dubbed the strategic energy technology plan -lrb- set -rrb- , the commission 's report emphasized that additional investment to promote technologies such as solar and wind power was urgently needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind power could produce 20 percent of europe 's electricity by 2020 " locked-in investments , vested interests , as well as the high risks and need for significant investments in less profitable alternatives , mean that change will be slow without a major push , " the study said .
the commission report is a roadmap that will help set funding priorities within the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , and the member states .
coordinating research and development among the eu 's 27 member governments will be difficult , said energy economist claudia kemfert of berlin 's diw research institute .
" individual member countries have to decide how much they want to spend and what they spend it on , " kemfert told deutsche welle .
" there will be pressure for them to spend the money in their own countries . "
the bulk of the new funding would come from the private sector and member states . the eu 's european trading system for co2 credits and the european investment bank will also provide some financing .
solar and carbon capture the big winners solar power projects receive the most attention in the set study , with 16 billion euros of funding proposed for the next decade with the goal of producing 15 percent of the eu 's electricity from solar power by 2020 .
some of the solar research projects supported by the set roadmap include new ways to build photovoltaic cells more cheaply and quickly than today and for further research in the field of concentrated solar power , which uses the sun 's energy to create heat that powers turbines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report proposes 13 billion euros of funding for carbon storage technology " solar power has the greatest potential but also has the highest costs at the moment , " said kemfert .
" those costs will decline but it will take investment to do that . "
a german consortium known as desertec has proposed using concentrated solar power to build a network of power plants across the deserts of north africa and the middle east which would export much of their electricity to europe at a cost of approximately 400 billion euros by 2050 .
carbon capture and storage technologies , which inject carbon dioxide emitted by coal power plants into the ground rather than releasing the emissions into the atmosphere , would receive 13 billion euros in funding according to the eu roadmap , the second-highest sum in the report .
wind energy gets less additional research funds would also flow into research for biofuels , nuclear power , improving energy efficiency and building ' smart grid ' technology which will create a unified european electricity grid that can accommodate renewable forms of energy .
wind energy , which already provides a significant amount of electricity in germany and spain , would receive six billion euros of additional funding under the plan , which would enable wind power to supply 20 percent of the eu 's electricity needs by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing ' smart grid ' technology to ease power transmission is a key goal calling the funding proposal " a step in the right direction , " hermann albers , head of germany 's wind power federation was also critical of the commissions funding suggestions , noting that wind power already produced seven percent of germany 's electricity .
" the foreseen investments in wind energy are clearly too small in comparison to ccs and nuclear technology , " albers told deutsche welle .
" some rethinking on the eu level is urgently needed . "
new jobs and energy security in addition to helping europe meet its carbon reduction goals , the report emphasized that targeted investments in the renewable energy sector could stimulate the development of new industries and jobs and provide europe with an economic advantage in the decades ahead .
the additional 50 billion euros worth of spending could create as many as 600,000 new jobs , with the european renewable energy sector employing as many as 2.8 million people by 2020 , the study said .

the nobel jury said they were honored for their studies on how ribosomes function , a breakthrough that has been vital in the development of new antibiotics .
the nobel committee cited the work of the trio as " directly assisting the saving of lives and decreasing humanity 's suffering . "
" many of today 's antibiotics cure various diseases by blocking the function of bacterial ribosomes .
without functional ribosomes , bacteria can not survive .
this is why ribosomes are such an important target for new antibiotics . "
research crucial to developing new drugs the three scientists have generated three-dimensional models to illustrating the ribosomes ' individual atomic structure .
these models are now used in the quest for new antibiotics .
about half the current antibiotics in use block the function of bacterial ribosomes , but there is a growing problem of bacterial strains that are resistant to drugs , the committee said on wednesday .
the three will share the 10 million swedish crowns -lrb- 1 million euros , $ 1.42 million -rrb- prize .
steitz , a professor for molecular biophysics at yale university , told reporters he was about to go to the gym when he received the phone call from stockholm .
" my caller from stockholm said i should n't go to the gym .
there would be phone calls , " the scientist told swedish radio .
ramakrishnan works at the mrc laboratory of molecular biology at cambridge university .
yonath , who works at the department of structural biology at the weizmann institute of science in israel , said she did not expect the prize about a discovery made almost a decade ago .
the nobel prizes are handed out annually for achievements in science , literature , economics and peace .
the prize in chemistry was this year 's third , following awards for medicine on monday and physics on tuesday. ai / reuters / dpa / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

usually they consisted of a helmet , or a flag , or maybe a knife .
but in the case of robert thomas , an 18-year-old soldier in george patton 's third army , his souvenirs turned out to be two legal manuscripts more than 400 years old .
as the tide of the war turned and allied bombing began to take its toll on german buildings and institutions , rare books and artworks were moved underground to caves or abandoned mines .
it was in an abandoned salt mine in the small town of merkers outside of frankfurt that the young infantryman stumbled on a room filled from floor to ceiling with thousands of books .
a different kind of souvenir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert thomas , left , handed the books over to the german ambassador thomas grabbed two of the books and took them home with him to the united states .
" i kept them in two boxes in the darkest coolest place at my house in order to preserve them .
they are pretty much in the same condition as i found them , " said the 83-year-old veteran .
it was the officials at the national archives who urged thomas to return them to the rightful owner .
" the books will go home now .
that 's the right thing to do , " said thomas as he handed over the manuscripts .
the oldest of the two books , one written in german and the other latin , was published in 1573 and deals with prussian statutes .
the other was published in 1593 and is a treatise on roman law .
the books were originally from the diocesan museum of paderborn and will be returned to the university of bonn library where they were before the war .
at a ceremony at the national archives in washington dc where thomas handed the books over to german ambassador klaus scharioth , the ambassador said that getting the books back was a stroke of luck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the books are legal treatises " we 're really lucky to get these books back , " said scharioth .
" the fact that these books are returned tells you a lot about our relationship today - it 's a sign of friendship and trust . "
other manuscripts found it is not the first time that german manuscripts have been returned .
in 1992 , a woman who had lived through auschwitz turned over seven medieval manuscripts that had been taken by an american soldier who drove a tank in patton 's army .
the manuscripts were dated from the 15th and 16th centuries and were traced back to st. anthony 's church in the town of hambach near aachen .
one of the most famous hoards of german antiquities and manuscripts are known as the quedlinburg treasure .
the church treasures were hidden in a mine during the waning weeks of world war ii and disappeared soon after us troops occupied the area .
in the 1980s objets d 'art started surfacing in a small texas town in the united states , stolen by an american soldier .
when he died , his relatives tried to sell the art work and the ensuing court case made headlines .

he is an outspoken man who likes to use direct and colorful language , especially when comparing the cost of bank bailouts with the amount of aid paid to help the world 's poorest nations weather the economic storm .
" in one night we passed $ 700 billion to the banks , " stiglitz says .
" global foreign aid has really been $ 60-70 billion a year .
so in one hour we passed all the foreign aid of all the developed countries to all the developing countries for a decade . "
" and you ask : who is more needy ?
the american banker or developing countries ?
it 's hard not to come up with the conclusion that our values got destroyed . "
new philosophy for imf lending although the columbia university professor says the international monetary fund has done a good job of managing the crisis so far .
he still urges the imf to rethink its lending policies .
in the past , stiglitz says , imf-credits often had damaging side-effects for the recipients .
the loans were usually tied to drastic reform programs that sent the economies of many borrowers into a downward spiral .
stiglitz warns that if the imf wants to become a global insurer against economic disruption , as the funds 's director dominique strauss-kahn claims , then it needs to take a new approach to dealing with the needs of poor countries .
" when you have a crisis and the doctor comes in and says : ' by the way , if you want the medicine you have to do a , b , c and d ' and you say ' i do n't want to do a , b , c and d ' - you are not getting medicine , then it does n't serve the function of insurance , " stiglitz points out .
global finance sector needs taxation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the imf is working hard to prevent another financial crisis financial markets should also be subject of new taxes designed to discourage ' dysfunctional ' trading and help pay for the damage the global crisis has inflicted on poorer countries , stiglitz says .
imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn recently announced that the washington-based organization is already studying ways to tax the financial industry at the request of group of 20 leaders .
such a global financial-transaction tax would only be fair , the stiglitz argues , and it would not be without precedent .
" in environmental economics we have a principle called ' polluter pay ' .
if you cause pollution you have to pay for the clean-up .
the financial sector polluted the global economy with toxic assets and now they ought to clean up that , " the nobel prize-winning economist says .
excessive risk-taking by the banking sector has imposed huge costs on the rest of the society , including workers , developing nations , house-holders and tax-payers , he explains .
a global tax on financial market transactions is therefore not just a question of equity , but a question of efficiency .
stiglitz stresses that such a tax would also help shrink a ' bloated ' financial industry in the united states , arguing that statistics showing that the finance sector accounted for 40 percent of us corporate profits before the crisis were a clear signal that “ something 's wrong . ”
tax revenues could be used for poor countries stiglitz says the money raised by the proposed tax could be used to help poor countries , which were by no means responsible for the financial crisis , but are nevertheless suffering its worst consequences .

annual spending should be raised to eight billion euros if europe is to meet its goal of cutting carbon emissions 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
" today we have a unique opportunity to change an energy model based on polluting , scarce and risky fossil fuels , into a clean , sustainable and less dependent one , " said andris piebalgs , the eu 's energy commissioner , at a press conference in brussels wednesday .
a roadmap for future energy research spending dubbed the strategic energy technology plan -lrb- set -rrb- , the commission 's report emphasized that additional investment to promote technologies such as solar and wind power was urgently needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind power could produce 20 percent of europe 's electricity by 2020 " locked-in investments , vested interests , as well as the high risks and need for significant investments in less profitable alternatives , mean that change will be slow without a major push , " the study said .
the commission report is a roadmap that will help set funding priorities within the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , and the member states .
coordinating research and development among the eu 's 27 member governments will be difficult , said energy economist claudia kemfert of berlin 's diw research institute .
" individual member countries have to decide how much they want to spend and what they spend it on , " kemfert told deutsche welle .
" there will be pressure for them to spend the money in their own countries . "
the bulk of the new funding would come from the private sector and member states . the eu 's european trading system for co2 credits and the european investment bank will also provide some financing .
solar and carbon capture the big winners solar power projects receive the most attention in the set study , with 16 billion euros of funding proposed for the next decade with the goal of producing 15 percent of the eu 's electricity from solar power by 2020 .
some of the solar research projects supported by the set roadmap include new ways to build photovoltaic cells more cheaply and quickly than today and for further research in the field of concentrated solar power , which uses the sun 's energy to create heat that powers turbines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report proposes 13 billion euros of funding for carbon storage technology " solar power has the greatest potential but also has the highest costs at the moment , " said kemfert .
" those costs will decline but it will take investment to do that . "
a german consortium known as desertec has proposed using concentrated solar power to build a network of power plants across the deserts of north africa and the middle east which would export much of their electricity to europe at a cost of approximately 400 billion euros by 2050 .
carbon capture and storage technologies , which inject carbon dioxide emitted by coal power plants into the ground rather than releasing the emissions into the atmosphere , would receive 13 billion euros in funding according to the eu roadmap , the second-highest sum in the report .
wind energy gets less additional research funds would also flow into research for biofuels , nuclear power , improving energy efficiency and building ' smart grid ' technology which will create a unified european electricity grid that can accommodate renewable forms of energy .
wind energy , which already provides a significant amount of electricity in germany and spain , would receive six billion euros of additional funding under the plan , which would enable wind power to supply 20 percent of the eu 's electricity needs by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing ' smart grid ' technology to ease power transmission is a key goal calling the funding proposal " a step in the right direction , " hermann albers , head of germany 's wind power federation was also critical of the commissions funding suggestions , noting that wind power already produced seven percent of germany 's electricity .
" the foreseen investments in wind energy are clearly too small in comparison to ccs and nuclear technology , " albers told deutsche welle .
" some rethinking on the eu level is urgently needed . "
new jobs and energy security in addition to helping europe meet its carbon reduction goals , the report emphasized that targeted investments in the renewable energy sector could stimulate the development of new industries and jobs and provide europe with an economic advantage in the decades ahead .
the additional 50 billion euros worth of spending could create as many as 600,000 new jobs , with the european renewable energy sector employing as many as 2.8 million people by 2020 , the study said .
europe 's energy security would also be improved by increasing the use of renewable fuels , the report said .
currently , 80 percent of european electricity production is derived from fossil fuels , much of which is imported from outside of the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 07.10.2009 czech republic plagued by doubts about future path großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague is a jewel , its politics are complex with the fate of the eu resting in the hands of the czech republic , the country has become the focus of media attention .
but as it parades in the limelight , the young democracy can not hide its many troubles . for years , the czech republic was hailed as the wunderkind of the former east bloc countries , the shining economic example and leader of the pack .
in record time , it appeared to have shed its past to become a fully-fledged member of the western world .
but now , 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall , much of the glitter has fallen off europe 's brightest new star , and it has become tangled up in a mess of domestic political infighting and an apparent inability to decide what it wants and where it wants to stand on the international stage .
so what went wrong ?
petr kratochvil , deputy director of the prague institute of international relations , said it all started after the country had secured the two things it knew it wanted : nato and eu membership .
" there were two phases after 1989 , " kratochvil told deutsche welle .
" the first was the transition from the communist past to the establishment of a democratic system . "
behind that clear aim , he says , the nation and its politicians did willingly unite .
but once it had been achieved , the new democracy did n't know what to do next .
struggling for unity and , kratochvil says , the czech republic has not yet come up with an answer .
" there has been no unity across the political spectrum ever since , " he said , adding that on the whole politicians are more concerned with petty arguments and scoring points than with the country itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan fischer earlier this year , the animosity led to a vote of no confidence for the government .
since then the country has been in the hands of a caretaker government under the leadership of a bureaucrat , jan fischer , the former head of the national statistics office .
he took on the interim post promising that his would not be a government of vision , but one of hard work .
" i really hope that we 'll be able to do something for our country , " fischer said at the time of his appointment .
" we will lead the czech republic into new elections and we 'll do this quietly and with respect for all of our international obligations . "
however , that is not the way things have gone .
a snap election was planned for november .
but in what may have been classic czech political style , the social democrats , whose backing was necessary for the vote to take place , suddenly backed out , leaving the poll scheduled for june 2010 .
a history of change political scientist jiri pehe , director of new york university in prague , says such instability is partially a consequence of having been subjected to an ever-changing political elite .
" we have never had time to develop a robust political culture based on self-confidence , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have an institutional democracy which was built at tremendous speed , " he said , adding that democratic values such as respect for minorities and tolerance of other people have developed at a much slower pace .
" we do n't have democracy as a culture . "
and that , he says , is the trouble with people like president vaclav klaus and the 17 senators who are holding both their country and europe hostage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of czechs want to be part of europe , but klaus does n't " deep down , they are not democrats , " pehe said .
" they feel they have the absolute truth and do n't care whether or not 500 million people agree with it . "
motivated by self-importance pehe believes the president 's reluctance to add his name to the controversial lisbon treaty is rooted in the national conviction " that the czechs have something intellectually unique to offer europe , something so unique it is worth fighting for . "
but it is that notion of national self-importance - coupled with a worry that no matter what the czech republic does , big international decisions will ultimately be made by major powers - which is getting in the way of the country 's future .
" the idea that the country can not contribute so it is not worth trying to , limits the capacity of politicians to act , " pehe said .
some commentators have said vaclav klaus is thoroughly enjoying the attention he is getting from holding out on europe , but pehe says it has swayed public opinion against him .
so perhaps it is , as jan fischer told eu leaders in brussels on wednesday , really just a matter of time before the czech republic ratifies the treaty and thereby makes a clear statement on at least one outstanding issue .

but as it parades in the limelight , the young democracy can not hide its many troubles . for years , the czech republic was hailed as the wunderkind of the former east bloc countries , the shining economic example and leader of the pack .
in record time , it appeared to have shed its past to become a fully-fledged member of the western world .
but now , 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall , much of the glitter has fallen off europe 's brightest new star , and it has become tangled up in a mess of domestic political infighting and an apparent inability to decide what it wants and where it wants to stand on the international stage .
so what went wrong ?
petr kratochvil , deputy director of the prague institute of international relations , said it all started after the country had secured the two things it knew it wanted : nato and eu membership .
" there were two phases after 1989 , " kratochvil told deutsche welle .
" the first was the transition from the communist past to the establishment of a democratic system . "
behind that clear aim , he says , the nation and its politicians did willingly unite .
but once it had been achieved , the new democracy did n't know what to do next .
struggling for unity and , kratochvil says , the czech republic has not yet come up with an answer .
" there has been no unity across the political spectrum ever since , " he said , adding that on the whole politicians are more concerned with petty arguments and scoring points than with the country itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan fischer earlier this year , the animosity led to a vote of no confidence for the government .
since then the country has been in the hands of a caretaker government under the leadership of a bureaucrat , jan fischer , the former head of the national statistics office .
he took on the interim post promising that his would not be a government of vision , but one of hard work .
" i really hope that we 'll be able to do something for our country , " fischer said at the time of his appointment .
" we will lead the czech republic into new elections and we 'll do this quietly and with respect for all of our international obligations . "
however , that is not the way things have gone .
a snap election was planned for november .
but in what may have been classic czech political style , the social democrats , whose backing was necessary for the vote to take place , suddenly backed out , leaving the poll scheduled for june 2010 .
a history of change political scientist jiri pehe , director of new york university in prague , says such instability is partially a consequence of having been subjected to an ever-changing political elite .
" we have never had time to develop a robust political culture based on self-confidence , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have an institutional democracy which was built at tremendous speed , " he said , adding that democratic values such as respect for minorities and tolerance of other people have developed at a much slower pace .
" we do n't have democracy as a culture . "
and that , he says , is the trouble with people like president vaclav klaus and the 17 senators who are holding both their country and europe hostage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of czechs want to be part of europe , but klaus does n't " deep down , they are not democrats , " pehe said .
" they feel they have the absolute truth and do n't care whether or not 500 million people agree with it . "
motivated by self-importance pehe believes the president 's reluctance to add his name to the controversial lisbon treaty is rooted in the national conviction " that the czechs have something intellectually unique to offer europe , something so unique it is worth fighting for . "
but it is that notion of national self-importance - coupled with a worry that no matter what the czech republic does , big international decisions will ultimately be made by major powers - which is getting in the way of the country 's future .
" the idea that the country can not contribute so it is not worth trying to , limits the capacity of politicians to act , " pehe said .
some commentators have said vaclav klaus is thoroughly enjoying the attention he is getting from holding out on europe , but pehe says it has swayed public opinion against him .
so perhaps it is , as jan fischer told eu leaders in brussels on wednesday , really just a matter of time before the czech republic ratifies the treaty and thereby makes a clear statement on at least one outstanding issue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 07.10.2009 stiglitz urges financial powers to rethink their values großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph stiglitz says the international monetary fund needs a new philosophy a tax on financial institutions is needed to improve the efficiency of the global economy and provide aid to developing countries , says joseph stiglitz , a former world bank chief economist and nobel prize winner . joseph stiglitz is one of the harshest critics of the banking industry 's rush to return to " business as usual " in the wake of the financial crisis .
he is an outspoken man who likes to use direct and colorful language , especially when comparing the cost of bank bailouts with the amount of aid paid to help the world 's poorest nations weather the economic storm .
" in one night we passed $ 700 billion to the banks , " stiglitz says .
" global foreign aid has really been $ 60-70 billion a year .
so in one hour we passed all the foreign aid of all the developed countries to all the developing countries for a decade . "
" and you ask : who is more needy ?
the american banker or developing countries ?
it 's hard not to come up with the conclusion that our values got destroyed . "
new philosophy for imf lending although the columbia university professor says the international monetary fund has done a good job of managing the crisis so far .
he still urges the imf to rethink its lending policies .
in the past , stiglitz says , imf-credits often had damaging side-effects for the recipients .
the loans were usually tied to drastic reform programs that sent the economies of many borrowers into a downward spiral .
stiglitz warns that if the imf wants to become a global insurer against economic disruption , as the funds 's director dominique strauss-kahn claims , then it needs to take a new approach to dealing with the needs of poor countries .
" when you have a crisis and the doctor comes in and says : ' by the way , if you want the medicine you have to do a , b , c and d ' and you say ' i do n't want to do a , b , c and d ' - you are not getting medicine , then it does n't serve the function of insurance , " stiglitz points out .
global finance sector needs taxation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the imf is working hard to prevent another financial crisis financial markets should also be subject of new taxes designed to discourage ' dysfunctional ' trading and help pay for the damage the global crisis has inflicted on poorer countries , stiglitz says .
imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn recently announced that the washington-based organization is already studying ways to tax the financial industry at the request of group of 20 leaders .
such a global financial-transaction tax would only be fair , the stiglitz argues , and it would not be without precedent .
" in environmental economics we have a principle called ' polluter pay ' .
if you cause pollution you have to pay for the clean-up .
the financial sector polluted the global economy with toxic assets and now they ought to clean up that , " the nobel prize-winning economist says .
excessive risk-taking by the banking sector has imposed huge costs on the rest of the society , including workers , developing nations , house-holders and tax-payers , he explains .
a global tax on financial market transactions is therefore not just a question of equity , but a question of efficiency .
stiglitz stresses that such a tax would also help shrink a ' bloated ' financial industry in the united states , arguing that statistics showing that the finance sector accounted for 40 percent of us corporate profits before the crisis were a clear signal that “ something 's wrong . ”
tax revenues could be used for poor countries stiglitz says the money raised by the proposed tax could be used to help poor countries , which were by no means responsible for the financial crisis , but are nevertheless suffering its worst consequences .
according to estimates by the development committee of the world bank and the international monetary fund , another 90 million people around the world are at risk of being driven into extreme poverty by the end of 2010 .

the nobel jury said they were honored for their studies on how ribosomes function , a breakthrough that has been vital in the development of new antibiotics .
the nobel committee cited the work of the trio as " directly assisting the saving of lives and decreasing humanity 's suffering . "
" many of today 's antibiotics cure various diseases by blocking the function of bacterial ribosomes .
without functional ribosomes , bacteria can not survive .
this is why ribosomes are such an important target for new antibiotics . "
research crucial to developing new drugs the three scientists have generated three-dimensional models to illustrating the ribosomes ' individual atomic structure .
these models are now used in the quest for new antibiotics .
about half the current antibiotics in use block the function of bacterial ribosomes , but there is a growing problem of bacterial strains that are resistant to drugs , the committee said on wednesday .
the three will share the 10 million swedish crowns -lrb- 1 million euros , $ 1.42 million -rrb- prize .
steitz , a professor for molecular biophysics at yale university , told reporters he was about to go to the gym when he received the phone call from stockholm .
" my caller from stockholm said i should n't go to the gym .
there would be phone calls , " the scientist told swedish radio .
ramakrishnan works at the mrc laboratory of molecular biology at cambridge university .
yonath , who works at the department of structural biology at the weizmann institute of science in israel , said she did not expect the prize about a discovery made almost a decade ago .
the nobel prizes are handed out annually for achievements in science , literature , economics and peace .
the prize in chemistry was this year 's third , following awards for medicine on monday and physics on tuesday. ai / reuters / dpa / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 07.10.2009 stiglitz urges financial powers to rethink their values großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph stiglitz says the international monetary fund needs a new philosophy a tax on financial institutions is needed to improve the efficiency of the global economy and provide aid to developing countries , says joseph stiglitz , a former world bank chief economist and nobel prize winner . joseph stiglitz is one of the harshest critics of the banking industry 's rush to return to " business as usual " in the wake of the financial crisis .
he is an outspoken man who likes to use direct and colorful language , especially when comparing the cost of bank bailouts with the amount of aid paid to help the world 's poorest nations weather the economic storm .
" in one night we passed $ 700 billion to the banks , " stiglitz says .
" global foreign aid has really been $ 60-70 billion a year .
so in one hour we passed all the foreign aid of all the developed countries to all the developing countries for a decade . "
" and you ask : who is more needy ?
the american banker or developing countries ?
it 's hard not to come up with the conclusion that our values got destroyed . "
new philosophy for imf lending although the columbia university professor says the international monetary fund has done a good job of managing the crisis so far .
he still urges the imf to rethink its lending policies .
in the past , stiglitz says , imf-credits often had damaging side-effects for the recipients .
the loans were usually tied to drastic reform programs that sent the economies of many borrowers into a downward spiral .
stiglitz warns that if the imf wants to become a global insurer against economic disruption , as the funds 's director dominique strauss-kahn claims , then it needs to take a new approach to dealing with the needs of poor countries .
" when you have a crisis and the doctor comes in and says : ' by the way , if you want the medicine you have to do a , b , c and d ' and you say ' i do n't want to do a , b , c and d ' - you are not getting medicine , then it does n't serve the function of insurance , " stiglitz points out .
global finance sector needs taxation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the imf is working hard to prevent another financial crisis financial markets should also be subject of new taxes designed to discourage ' dysfunctional ' trading and help pay for the damage the global crisis has inflicted on poorer countries , stiglitz says .
imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn recently announced that the washington-based organization is already studying ways to tax the financial industry at the request of group of 20 leaders .
such a global financial-transaction tax would only be fair , the stiglitz argues , and it would not be without precedent .
" in environmental economics we have a principle called ' polluter pay ' .
if you cause pollution you have to pay for the clean-up .
the financial sector polluted the global economy with toxic assets and now they ought to clean up that , " the nobel prize-winning economist says .
excessive risk-taking by the banking sector has imposed huge costs on the rest of the society , including workers , developing nations , house-holders and tax-payers , he explains .
a global tax on financial market transactions is therefore not just a question of equity , but a question of efficiency .
stiglitz stresses that such a tax would also help shrink a ' bloated ' financial industry in the united states , arguing that statistics showing that the finance sector accounted for 40 percent of us corporate profits before the crisis were a clear signal that “ something 's wrong . ”
tax revenues could be used for poor countries stiglitz says the money raised by the proposed tax could be used to help poor countries , which were by no means responsible for the financial crisis , but are nevertheless suffering its worst consequences .
according to estimates by the development committee of the world bank and the international monetary fund , another 90 million people around the world are at risk of being driven into extreme poverty by the end of 2010 .

currently there are more than 100,000 soldiers in the country .
president obama is currently mulling over whether to send in more troops . during the war in afghanistan in 2001 that followed the attacks of sept .
11 , the us military tried to destroy taliban positions through massive air bombardments .
the war on the ground was conducted mainly by the so called northern alliance , a loose union of warlords with combat experience from the afghan civil war .
the northern alliance received american and british military support .
the military conflict with the taliban ended officially - at least for a while - with the takeover of afghanistan 's capital kabul by northern alliance troops on nov .
12 .
on dec .
5 , 2001 the petersberg agreement on afghanistan was signed in bonn , germany and hamid karzai was named head of the interim government .
in addition , the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- was established by the un security council with a mandate to establish peace and security in afghanistan .
all 28 nato member states participated in the isaf mission .
more than 1,000 soldiers killed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign troops have come under increasing attack from the taliban nato took over the isaf mission with its 5,500 troops in august 2003 .
by october 2009 the troop size had surged more than tenfold to 66,000 soldier from 42 countries .
since 2001 more than 1,000 nato soldiers have been killed in afghanistan , more than half of them americans .
35 german troops have been killed .
in addition to isaf there are 35,000 foreign troops in afghanistan , who participate in the us-lead anti-terror mission operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- .
that brings the number of the combined foreign troops to over 100,000 , with two thirds of them being us forces .
the afghan army currently consists of 90,000 soldiers , the number of taliban fighters is estimated at around 20,000 .
since the newly elected us president barack obama announced a troop increase in early 2009 , the number of us soldiers has gone up once more by 15,000 .
by the end of the year there are scheduled to be 68,000 us soldiers in afghanistan .
britain has contributed the second-largest military contingent , germany comes in third place .
bildunterschrift : more than 4000 german troops originally the german parliament allowed only 1,200 soldiers to be sent to afghanistan .
however , parliament subsequently approved additional deployments increasing troop levels in afghanistan to 3,500 in 2007 .
last october , germany 's parliament signed off on additional deployment of up to 1,000 soldiers by dec .
13 , 2009 , however that level has yet to be reached .
in addition to the permanent deployments to afghanistan , germany and many other countries increased their contingents temporarily for the afghan presidential elections in august .
including those troops , there are currently 4,200 german soldiers on the ground in afghanistan .
since july 2009 there is also an additional contingent of 300 german soldiers who have been deployed to monitor afghan air space aboard the tornado-awacs surveillance planes .
however , the german government has emphasized that awacs surveillance would not be used to support us-led oef-operations , in which germany no longer participates .

president obama is currently mulling over whether to send in more troops . during the war in afghanistan in 2001 that followed the attacks of sept .
11 , the us military tried to destroy taliban positions through massive air bombardments .
the war on the ground was conducted mainly by the so called northern alliance , a loose union of warlords with combat experience from the afghan civil war .
the northern alliance received american and british military support .
the military conflict with the taliban ended officially - at least for a while - with the takeover of afghanistan 's capital kabul by northern alliance troops on nov .

since 2001 more than 1,000 nato soldiers have been killed in afghanistan , more than half of them americans .
35 german troops have been killed .

13 , 2009 , however that level has yet to be reached .
in addition to the permanent deployments to afghanistan , germany and many other countries increased their contingents temporarily for the afghan presidential elections in august .

they are small , they strike at night and they can be deadly : mosquitos carrying malaria .
it 's one of the deadliest diseases in africa .
yet it ’ s quite easily preventable . malaria is one of africa 's biggest plagues .
it kills almost a million people a year around the world .
90 % of those who die are in africa .
pregnant women and small children are particularly vulnerable .
it 's mostly the poor who die , because they often ca n't afford any treatment once the first symptoms break out .
in any case , prevention is better than cure .
some forms of malaria do n't react to many available drugs anyhow .
but prevention tends to be simple .
for instance , sleeping under a mosquito net or by wearing long-sleeved clothes after sun set .
for other useful hints , tune in to our new series about malaria .
we follow one african family in its quest to eradicate malaria .

they are small , they strike at night and they can be deadly : mosquitos carrying malaria .
it 's one of the deadliest diseases in africa .
yet it ’ s quite easily preventable . malaria is one of africa 's biggest plagues .
it kills almost a million people a year around the world .
90 % of those who die are in africa .
pregnant women and small children are particularly vulnerable .
it 's mostly the poor who die , because they often ca n't afford any treatment once the first symptoms break out .
in any case , prevention is better than cure .
some forms of malaria do n't react to many available drugs anyhow .
but prevention tends to be simple .
for instance , sleeping under a mosquito net or by wearing long-sleeved clothes after sun set .
for other useful hints , tune in to our new series about malaria .
we follow one african family in its quest to eradicate malaria .
and , on the way , they teach us what we can do against it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 07.10.2009 eu warns germany , eight other nations for excessive budget deficits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's economy has been hit hard by the global recession the eu commission on wednesday warned germany , italy and seven other eu nations for flouting the bloc 's stability and growth pact which requires them to keep budget deficits under three percent of gross domestic product . in addition to germany and italy , the commission on wednesday also began a budget scrutiny process against austria , belgium , the czech republic , the netherlands , portugal , slovakia and slovenia about their budget deficits .
according to the commission , the eu 's executive arm , 20 of the bloc 's 27 member countries are on track to break that limit this year .
in july , brussels launched action against latvia , lithuania , malta , poland and romania following earlier procedures against france , greece , ireland and spain .
eu blames recession for budget woes the commission blamed the ballooning budget deficits on the global recession , admitting that several eu governments had increased their public spending to limit the impact of the economic crisis .
several eu countries are grappling with falling tax revenues and rising unemployment and many have initiated economic stimulus measures and bail-outs for banks and leading companies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia says the offenders will not be forced to radically rein in spending in light of the recession " a large majority of eu member states are set to have budget deficits above 3 percent of gdp in 2009 as a result of the economic crisis .
we need to continue supporting the economy until the recovery takes hold , in line with the european economic recovery plan , " economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said .
but the commissioner also warned that eu governments need to rein in public spending and bring their public finances back in order .
" now is also the moment to design coordinated exit strategies so that , when the moment is right , we can begin to roll back the soaring debt levels , " he said .
almunia said the stability and growth pact under which the action was taken " is sufficiently flexible to combine the fiscal stimulus in the short term with consolidation of the public finances in the medium term . "
germany grapples with soaring deficit germany 's budget deficit will be 3.9 percent of gdp this year and 5.9 percent next year , the commission said .
the recession in europe 's largest economy has slashed tax revenues and increased government spending on subsidies .
leaked government documents in germany this week said that public deficits need to be cut by 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 56 billion -rrb- between 2011 and 2013 .
bildunterschrift : the soaring deficit is a political issue in germany - merkel here with the fdp 's guido westerwelle germany 's soaring deficit is also a bone of contention for the country 's next center-right government .
the pro-business fdp party , which is set to form a coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives , won the election largely on the back of promised tax cuts .
but merkel has warned that the spiraling budget deficit reduces the scope for immediate tax relief , and that there wo n't be any cuts before 2011 .
the commission has estimated a deficit of 4.5 percent for italy , 3.4 percent in the netherlands and 6.5 percent in portugal .
europe still suffering from downturn europe hit a recovery setback on wednesday with the euro-zone economy shrinking more than expected .
finance ministers from the 16 nations that use the euro agreed last week at a meeting in sweden that their countries would have to take action in 2011 against debt and public deficits .
the pact " must not be interpreted as offering one-way flexibility , " euro-group head and luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker warned .
the stability and growth pact was established in the 1990s to boost confidence in the euro .
in 2005 , the pact was loosened , making it easier for countries breaching the 3 percent limit to avoid sanctions .
nations that overshoot the eu deficit limit can be subject to economic sanctions , though none have so far been fined. sp / afp / reuters / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it took 40 years before the berlin wall fell and germany was reunited . sixty years ago , delegates gathered in the grand hall of the former aviation ministry in berlin as germans across the soviet occupied zone followed the events on the radio .
the reporter announced the events as " a piece of german history unfolding . "
a short time later wilhelm pieck declared the birth of the first " workers and peasants state on german soil . "
pieck became the first president of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , as east germany was officially known .
" based on the new constitution , the german democratic republic has been founded unanimously by all parties and organizations present in the german people 's council , " pieck said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilhelm pieck became the first president of east germany less than one month earlier , on september 15 , 1949 , konrad adenauer had been elected as first chancellor of west germany .
in the eyes of the communists in east germany and moscow , adenauer was the " chancellor of western imperialism , " portrayed as the enemy of the people .
one day later , the soviet leadership in moscow sent a delegation of german communist exiles to berlin to implement a socialist alternative to the west .
a division of europe unfolds the creation of two separate german states confirmed what many had expected in the aftermath of world war ii .
the border between east and west germany was not yet fortified with barbed wire – but already it marked the division not only of germany but of europe as a whole .
the two states on both sides of the new border became satellites of their respective allied occupiers .
the soviet dictator josef stalin had a clear agenda in mind .
with the creation of east germany , he pushed the political and military influence of the soviet union well into the heart of europe .
stalin described the new communist state as " the creation of a peace loving , democratic germany alongside the peaceful soviet union . "
according to stalin , the new state would prevent both new wars and the " enslavement of european countries by the western imperialists . "
the " better " german state in west germany , economic progress and political stability soon helped people to get over the woes of the post-war hardship .
but east german leaders wanted more than just material prosperity .
they wanted a fresh ideological start after the catastrophe of nazi germany .
bildunterschrift : the birth of east germany was celebrated with parades in berlin many of the citizens ' of the new eastern state agreed with that concept .
for them , socialism seemed like the proper answer to fascism , war and the holocaust .
walter ulbricht , who became a top communist party official , said the crucial issue was " the struggle against fascist ideology and against other reactionary ideologies that work against the interests of the working class and against progress and development in germany . "
ulbricht later said that " there will be a day when the sed -lrb- east germany 's communist party -rrb- will be the leading party of all of germany – because the majority of germans will want it that way . "
but as enthusiastic as the first reactions were – the dramatic loss of faith in the political leadership installed by moscow came very soon .
an experiment gone wrong the gdr seemed doomed from the very beginning .
the vision that one day its party would lead all of germany was soon turned to be on its head .
in 1989 , peaceful revolution toppled the communist regime .
in the end it was the people of the gdr that wanted the political system of the west and not vice versa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the 40th anniversary was celebrated in 1989 , the end of the regime was only weeks away yet in october 1989 the communist leadership seemed to be in denial that the end was near .
they staged an elaborate celebration to mark the then 40th anniversary of east germany .
yet at that time east germans were already out on the streets demonstrating for change – and thousands had already fled the " workers ' and peasants ' paradise " via hungary to west germany .
in a few weeks from then , on november 9 , 1989 , the berlin wall came down to dramatically mark the collapse of east germany .
after 40 years of gdr , the dream of the allegedly " better " version of germany burst with a momentum so powerful that the citizens of the communist east had lost all faith and interest to change their state and have it survive into a new era .

it took 40 years before the berlin wall fell and germany was reunited . sixty years ago , delegates gathered in the grand hall of the former aviation ministry in berlin as germans across the soviet occupied zone followed the events on the radio .
the reporter announced the events as " a piece of german history unfolding . "
a short time later wilhelm pieck declared the birth of the first " workers and peasants state on german soil . "
pieck became the first president of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , as east germany was officially known .
" based on the new constitution , the german democratic republic has been founded unanimously by all parties and organizations present in the german people 's council , " pieck said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilhelm pieck became the first president of east germany less than one month earlier , on september 15 , 1949 , konrad adenauer had been elected as first chancellor of west germany .
in the eyes of the communists in east germany and moscow , adenauer was the " chancellor of western imperialism , " portrayed as the enemy of the people .
one day later , the soviet leadership in moscow sent a delegation of german communist exiles to berlin to implement a socialist alternative to the west .
a division of europe unfolds the creation of two separate german states confirmed what many had expected in the aftermath of world war ii .
the border between east and west germany was not yet fortified with barbed wire – but already it marked the division not only of germany but of europe as a whole .
the two states on both sides of the new border became satellites of their respective allied occupiers .
the soviet dictator josef stalin had a clear agenda in mind .
with the creation of east germany , he pushed the political and military influence of the soviet union well into the heart of europe .
stalin described the new communist state as " the creation of a peace loving , democratic germany alongside the peaceful soviet union . "
according to stalin , the new state would prevent both new wars and the " enslavement of european countries by the western imperialists . "
the " better " german state in west germany , economic progress and political stability soon helped people to get over the woes of the post-war hardship .
but east german leaders wanted more than just material prosperity .
they wanted a fresh ideological start after the catastrophe of nazi germany .
bildunterschrift : the birth of east germany was celebrated with parades in berlin many of the citizens ' of the new eastern state agreed with that concept .
for them , socialism seemed like the proper answer to fascism , war and the holocaust .
walter ulbricht , who became a top communist party official , said the crucial issue was " the struggle against fascist ideology and against other reactionary ideologies that work against the interests of the working class and against progress and development in germany . "
ulbricht later said that " there will be a day when the sed -lrb- east germany 's communist party -rrb- will be the leading party of all of germany – because the majority of germans will want it that way . "
but as enthusiastic as the first reactions were – the dramatic loss of faith in the political leadership installed by moscow came very soon .
an experiment gone wrong the gdr seemed doomed from the very beginning .
the vision that one day its party would lead all of germany was soon turned to be on its head .
in 1989 , peaceful revolution toppled the communist regime .
in the end it was the people of the gdr that wanted the political system of the west and not vice versa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the 40th anniversary was celebrated in 1989 , the end of the regime was only weeks away yet in october 1989 the communist leadership seemed to be in denial that the end was near .

usually they consisted of a helmet , or a flag , or maybe a knife .
but in the case of robert thomas , an 18-year-old soldier in george patton 's third army , his souvenirs turned out to be two legal manuscripts more than 400 years old .
as the tide of the war turned and allied bombing began to take its toll on german buildings and institutions , rare books and artworks were moved underground to caves or abandoned mines .
it was in an abandoned salt mine in the small town of merkers outside of frankfurt that the young infantryman stumbled on a room filled from floor to ceiling with thousands of books .
a different kind of souvenir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert thomas , left , handed the books over to the german ambassador thomas grabbed two of the books and took them home with him to the united states .
" i kept them in two boxes in the darkest coolest place at my house in order to preserve them .
they are pretty much in the same condition as i found them , " said the 83-year-old veteran .
it was the officials at the national archives who urged thomas to return them to the rightful owner .
" the books will go home now .
that 's the right thing to do , " said thomas as he handed over the manuscripts .
the oldest of the two books , one written in german and the other latin , was published in 1573 and deals with prussian statutes .
the other was published in 1593 and is a treatise on roman law .
the books were originally from the diocesan museum of paderborn and will be returned to the university of bonn library where they were before the war .
at a ceremony at the national archives in washington dc where thomas handed the books over to german ambassador klaus scharioth , the ambassador said that getting the books back was a stroke of luck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the books are legal treatises " we 're really lucky to get these books back , " said scharioth .
" the fact that these books are returned tells you a lot about our relationship today - it 's a sign of friendship and trust . "
other manuscripts found it is not the first time that german manuscripts have been returned .
in 1992 , a woman who had lived through auschwitz turned over seven medieval manuscripts that had been taken by an american soldier who drove a tank in patton 's army .
the manuscripts were dated from the 15th and 16th centuries and were traced back to st. anthony 's church in the town of hambach near aachen .
one of the most famous hoards of german antiquities and manuscripts are known as the quedlinburg treasure .
the church treasures were hidden in a mine during the waning weeks of world war ii and disappeared soon after us troops occupied the area .
in the 1980s objets d 'art started surfacing in a small texas town in the united states , stolen by an american soldier .
when he died , his relatives tried to sell the art work and the ensuing court case made headlines .
in the end , the german cultural foundation bought most of the works for $ 3 million .
in 2008 , german cultural institutions published a catalog of over 180,000 works of art that disappeared after the war. av / afp / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is an outspoken man who likes to use direct and colorful language , especially when comparing the cost of bank bailouts with the amount of aid paid to help the world 's poorest nations weather the economic storm .
" in one night we passed $ 700 billion to the banks , " stiglitz says .
" global foreign aid has really been $ 60-70 billion a year .
so in one hour we passed all the foreign aid of all the developed countries to all the developing countries for a decade . "
" and you ask : who is more needy ?
the american banker or developing countries ?
it 's hard not to come up with the conclusion that our values got destroyed . "
new philosophy for imf lending although the columbia university professor says the international monetary fund has done a good job of managing the crisis so far .
he still urges the imf to rethink its lending policies .
in the past , stiglitz says , imf-credits often had damaging side-effects for the recipients .
the loans were usually tied to drastic reform programs that sent the economies of many borrowers into a downward spiral .
stiglitz warns that if the imf wants to become a global insurer against economic disruption , as the funds 's director dominique strauss-kahn claims , then it needs to take a new approach to dealing with the needs of poor countries .
" when you have a crisis and the doctor comes in and says : ' by the way , if you want the medicine you have to do a , b , c and d ' and you say ' i do n't want to do a , b , c and d ' - you are not getting medicine , then it does n't serve the function of insurance , " stiglitz points out .
global finance sector needs taxation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the imf is working hard to prevent another financial crisis financial markets should also be subject of new taxes designed to discourage ' dysfunctional ' trading and help pay for the damage the global crisis has inflicted on poorer countries , stiglitz says .
imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn recently announced that the washington-based organization is already studying ways to tax the financial industry at the request of group of 20 leaders .
such a global financial-transaction tax would only be fair , the stiglitz argues , and it would not be without precedent .
" in environmental economics we have a principle called ' polluter pay ' .
if you cause pollution you have to pay for the clean-up .
the financial sector polluted the global economy with toxic assets and now they ought to clean up that , " the nobel prize-winning economist says .
excessive risk-taking by the banking sector has imposed huge costs on the rest of the society , including workers , developing nations , house-holders and tax-payers , he explains .
a global tax on financial market transactions is therefore not just a question of equity , but a question of efficiency .
stiglitz stresses that such a tax would also help shrink a ' bloated ' financial industry in the united states , arguing that statistics showing that the finance sector accounted for 40 percent of us corporate profits before the crisis were a clear signal that “ something 's wrong . ”
tax revenues could be used for poor countries stiglitz says the money raised by the proposed tax could be used to help poor countries , which were by no means responsible for the financial crisis , but are nevertheless suffering its worst consequences .
according to estimates by the development committee of the world bank and the international monetary fund , another 90 million people around the world are at risk of being driven into extreme poverty by the end of 2010 .

she was fired for helping herself to a meatball from a conference buffet at her workplace .
the case is to be heard in january . the 57-year-old secretary , identified in the german media as magdalene h , worked for the builders ' association in the state of north-rhine westphalia for more than three decades .
the incident took place last july when she organized a conference buffet for her boss and his guests and helped herself to two rolls and a frikadelle , a german meatball specialty , during the preparations .
boss insists firing was right thing german mass-selling newspaper bild reported on wednesday that magdalene h was confronted by her boss after a colleague noticed some food was missing .
but once she admitted to consuming the meatball , she was fired .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frikadellen are popular in germany " she believed her behavior was acceptable , " her lawyer , wolfgang pinkepank , told bild .
" bread and meatballs that are left over after conferences are allowed to be eaten by workers .

but as it parades in the limelight , the young democracy can not hide its many troubles . for years , the czech republic was hailed as the wunderkind of the former east bloc countries , the shining economic example and leader of the pack .
in record time , it appeared to have shed its past to become a fully-fledged member of the western world .
but now , 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall , much of the glitter has fallen off europe 's brightest new star , and it has become tangled up in a mess of domestic political infighting and an apparent inability to decide what it wants and where it wants to stand on the international stage .
so what went wrong ?
petr kratochvil , deputy director of the prague institute of international relations , said it all started after the country had secured the two things it knew it wanted : nato and eu membership .
" there were two phases after 1989 , " kratochvil told deutsche welle .
" the first was the transition from the communist past to the establishment of a democratic system . "
behind that clear aim , he says , the nation and its politicians did willingly unite .
but once it had been achieved , the new democracy did n't know what to do next .
struggling for unity and , kratochvil says , the czech republic has not yet come up with an answer .
" there has been no unity across the political spectrum ever since , " he said , adding that on the whole politicians are more concerned with petty arguments and scoring points than with the country itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan fischer earlier this year , the animosity led to a vote of no confidence for the government .
since then the country has been in the hands of a caretaker government under the leadership of a bureaucrat , jan fischer , the former head of the national statistics office .
he took on the interim post promising that his would not be a government of vision , but one of hard work .
" i really hope that we 'll be able to do something for our country , " fischer said at the time of his appointment .
" we will lead the czech republic into new elections and we 'll do this quietly and with respect for all of our international obligations . "
however , that is not the way things have gone .
a snap election was planned for november .
but in what may have been classic czech political style , the social democrats , whose backing was necessary for the vote to take place , suddenly backed out , leaving the poll scheduled for june 2010 .
a history of change political scientist jiri pehe , director of new york university in prague , says such instability is partially a consequence of having been subjected to an ever-changing political elite .
" we have never had time to develop a robust political culture based on self-confidence , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have an institutional democracy which was built at tremendous speed , " he said , adding that democratic values such as respect for minorities and tolerance of other people have developed at a much slower pace .
" we do n't have democracy as a culture . "
and that , he says , is the trouble with people like president vaclav klaus and the 17 senators who are holding both their country and europe hostage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of czechs want to be part of europe , but klaus does n't " deep down , they are not democrats , " pehe said .
" they feel they have the absolute truth and do n't care whether or not 500 million people agree with it . "
motivated by self-importance pehe believes the president 's reluctance to add his name to the controversial lisbon treaty is rooted in the national conviction " that the czechs have something intellectually unique to offer europe , something so unique it is worth fighting for . "
but it is that notion of national self-importance - coupled with a worry that no matter what the czech republic does , big international decisions will ultimately be made by major powers - which is getting in the way of the country 's future .
" the idea that the country can not contribute so it is not worth trying to , limits the capacity of politicians to act , " pehe said .
some commentators have said vaclav klaus is thoroughly enjoying the attention he is getting from holding out on europe , but pehe says it has swayed public opinion against him .
so perhaps it is , as jan fischer told eu leaders in brussels on wednesday , really just a matter of time before the czech republic ratifies the treaty and thereby makes a clear statement on at least one outstanding issue .

usually they consisted of a helmet , or a flag , or maybe a knife .
but in the case of robert thomas , an 18-year-old soldier in george patton 's third army , his souvenirs turned out to be two legal manuscripts more than 400 years old .
as the tide of the war turned and allied bombing began to take its toll on german buildings and institutions , rare books and artworks were moved underground to caves or abandoned mines .
it was in an abandoned salt mine in the small town of merkers outside of frankfurt that the young infantryman stumbled on a room filled from floor to ceiling with thousands of books .
a different kind of souvenir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert thomas , left , handed the books over to the german ambassador thomas grabbed two of the books and took them home with him to the united states .
" i kept them in two boxes in the darkest coolest place at my house in order to preserve them .
they are pretty much in the same condition as i found them , " said the 83-year-old veteran .
it was the officials at the national archives who urged thomas to return them to the rightful owner .
" the books will go home now .
that 's the right thing to do , " said thomas as he handed over the manuscripts .
the oldest of the two books , one written in german and the other latin , was published in 1573 and deals with prussian statutes .
the other was published in 1593 and is a treatise on roman law .
the books were originally from the diocesan museum of paderborn and will be returned to the university of bonn library where they were before the war .
at a ceremony at the national archives in washington dc where thomas handed the books over to german ambassador klaus scharioth , the ambassador said that getting the books back was a stroke of luck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the books are legal treatises " we 're really lucky to get these books back , " said scharioth .
" the fact that these books are returned tells you a lot about our relationship today - it 's a sign of friendship and trust . "
other manuscripts found it is not the first time that german manuscripts have been returned .
in 1992 , a woman who had lived through auschwitz turned over seven medieval manuscripts that had been taken by an american soldier who drove a tank in patton 's army .
the manuscripts were dated from the 15th and 16th centuries and were traced back to st. anthony 's church in the town of hambach near aachen .
one of the most famous hoards of german antiquities and manuscripts are known as the quedlinburg treasure .
the church treasures were hidden in a mine during the waning weeks of world war ii and disappeared soon after us troops occupied the area .
in the 1980s objets d 'art started surfacing in a small texas town in the united states , stolen by an american soldier .
when he died , his relatives tried to sell the art work and the ensuing court case made headlines .
in the end , the german cultural foundation bought most of the works for $ 3 million .
in 2008 , german cultural institutions published a catalog of over 180,000 works of art that disappeared after the war. av / afp / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nobel jury said they were honored for their studies on how ribosomes function , a breakthrough that has been vital in the development of new antibiotics .
the nobel committee cited the work of the trio as " directly assisting the saving of lives and decreasing humanity 's suffering . "
" many of today 's antibiotics cure various diseases by blocking the function of bacterial ribosomes .
without functional ribosomes , bacteria can not survive .
this is why ribosomes are such an important target for new antibiotics . "
research crucial to developing new drugs the three scientists have generated three-dimensional models to illustrating the ribosomes ' individual atomic structure .
these models are now used in the quest for new antibiotics .
about half the current antibiotics in use block the function of bacterial ribosomes , but there is a growing problem of bacterial strains that are resistant to drugs , the committee said on wednesday .
the three will share the 10 million swedish crowns -lrb- 1 million euros , $ 1.42 million -rrb- prize .
steitz , a professor for molecular biophysics at yale university , told reporters he was about to go to the gym when he received the phone call from stockholm .
" my caller from stockholm said i should n't go to the gym .
there would be phone calls , " the scientist told swedish radio .
ramakrishnan works at the mrc laboratory of molecular biology at cambridge university .
yonath , who works at the department of structural biology at the weizmann institute of science in israel , said she did not expect the prize about a discovery made almost a decade ago .
the nobel prizes are handed out annually for achievements in science , literature , economics and peace .
the prize in chemistry was this year 's third , following awards for medicine on monday and physics on tuesday. ai / reuters / dpa / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is an outspoken man who likes to use direct and colorful language , especially when comparing the cost of bank bailouts with the amount of aid paid to help the world 's poorest nations weather the economic storm .
" in one night we passed $ 700 billion to the banks , " stiglitz says .
" global foreign aid has really been $ 60-70 billion a year .
so in one hour we passed all the foreign aid of all the developed countries to all the developing countries for a decade . "
" and you ask : who is more needy ?
the american banker or developing countries ?
it 's hard not to come up with the conclusion that our values got destroyed . "
new philosophy for imf lending although the columbia university professor says the international monetary fund has done a good job of managing the crisis so far .
he still urges the imf to rethink its lending policies .
in the past , stiglitz says , imf-credits often had damaging side-effects for the recipients .
the loans were usually tied to drastic reform programs that sent the economies of many borrowers into a downward spiral .
stiglitz warns that if the imf wants to become a global insurer against economic disruption , as the funds 's director dominique strauss-kahn claims , then it needs to take a new approach to dealing with the needs of poor countries .
" when you have a crisis and the doctor comes in and says : ' by the way , if you want the medicine you have to do a , b , c and d ' and you say ' i do n't want to do a , b , c and d ' - you are not getting medicine , then it does n't serve the function of insurance , " stiglitz points out .
global finance sector needs taxation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the imf is working hard to prevent another financial crisis financial markets should also be subject of new taxes designed to discourage ' dysfunctional ' trading and help pay for the damage the global crisis has inflicted on poorer countries , stiglitz says .
imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn recently announced that the washington-based organization is already studying ways to tax the financial industry at the request of group of 20 leaders .
such a global financial-transaction tax would only be fair , the stiglitz argues , and it would not be without precedent .
" in environmental economics we have a principle called ' polluter pay ' .
if you cause pollution you have to pay for the clean-up .
the financial sector polluted the global economy with toxic assets and now they ought to clean up that , " the nobel prize-winning economist says .
excessive risk-taking by the banking sector has imposed huge costs on the rest of the society , including workers , developing nations , house-holders and tax-payers , he explains .
a global tax on financial market transactions is therefore not just a question of equity , but a question of efficiency .
stiglitz stresses that such a tax would also help shrink a ' bloated ' financial industry in the united states , arguing that statistics showing that the finance sector accounted for 40 percent of us corporate profits before the crisis were a clear signal that “ something 's wrong . ”
tax revenues could be used for poor countries stiglitz says the money raised by the proposed tax could be used to help poor countries , which were by no means responsible for the financial crisis , but are nevertheless suffering its worst consequences .
according to estimates by the development committee of the world bank and the international monetary fund , another 90 million people around the world are at risk of being driven into extreme poverty by the end of 2010 .

but as it parades in the limelight , the young democracy can not hide its many troubles . for years , the czech republic was hailed as the wunderkind of the former east bloc countries , the shining economic example and leader of the pack .
in record time , it appeared to have shed its past to become a fully-fledged member of the western world .
but now , 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall , much of the glitter has fallen off europe 's brightest new star , and it has become tangled up in a mess of domestic political infighting and an apparent inability to decide what it wants and where it wants to stand on the international stage .
so what went wrong ?
petr kratochvil , deputy director of the prague institute of international relations , said it all started after the country had secured the two things it knew it wanted : nato and eu membership .
" there were two phases after 1989 , " kratochvil told deutsche welle .
" the first was the transition from the communist past to the establishment of a democratic system . "
behind that clear aim , he says , the nation and its politicians did willingly unite .
but once it had been achieved , the new democracy did n't know what to do next .
struggling for unity and , kratochvil says , the czech republic has not yet come up with an answer .
" there has been no unity across the political spectrum ever since , " he said , adding that on the whole politicians are more concerned with petty arguments and scoring points than with the country itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan fischer earlier this year , the animosity led to a vote of no confidence for the government .
since then the country has been in the hands of a caretaker government under the leadership of a bureaucrat , jan fischer , the former head of the national statistics office .
he took on the interim post promising that his would not be a government of vision , but one of hard work .
" i really hope that we 'll be able to do something for our country , " fischer said at the time of his appointment .
" we will lead the czech republic into new elections and we 'll do this quietly and with respect for all of our international obligations . "
however , that is not the way things have gone .
a snap election was planned for november .
but in what may have been classic czech political style , the social democrats , whose backing was necessary for the vote to take place , suddenly backed out , leaving the poll scheduled for june 2010 .
a history of change political scientist jiri pehe , director of new york university in prague , says such instability is partially a consequence of having been subjected to an ever-changing political elite .
" we have never had time to develop a robust political culture based on self-confidence , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have an institutional democracy which was built at tremendous speed , " he said , adding that democratic values such as respect for minorities and tolerance of other people have developed at a much slower pace .
" we do n't have democracy as a culture . "
and that , he says , is the trouble with people like president vaclav klaus and the 17 senators who are holding both their country and europe hostage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of czechs want to be part of europe , but klaus does n't " deep down , they are not democrats , " pehe said .
" they feel they have the absolute truth and do n't care whether or not 500 million people agree with it . "
motivated by self-importance pehe believes the president 's reluctance to add his name to the controversial lisbon treaty is rooted in the national conviction " that the czechs have something intellectually unique to offer europe , something so unique it is worth fighting for . "
but it is that notion of national self-importance - coupled with a worry that no matter what the czech republic does , big international decisions will ultimately be made by major powers - which is getting in the way of the country 's future .
" the idea that the country can not contribute so it is not worth trying to , limits the capacity of politicians to act , " pehe said .
some commentators have said vaclav klaus is thoroughly enjoying the attention he is getting from holding out on europe , but pehe says it has swayed public opinion against him .
so perhaps it is , as jan fischer told eu leaders in brussels on wednesday , really just a matter of time before the czech republic ratifies the treaty and thereby makes a clear statement on at least one outstanding issue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 07.10.2009 czech republic plagued by doubts about future path großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague is a jewel , its politics are complex with the fate of the eu resting in the hands of the czech republic , the country has become the focus of media attention .
but as it parades in the limelight , the young democracy can not hide its many troubles . for years , the czech republic was hailed as the wunderkind of the former east bloc countries , the shining economic example and leader of the pack .
in record time , it appeared to have shed its past to become a fully-fledged member of the western world .
but now , 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall , much of the glitter has fallen off europe 's brightest new star , and it has become tangled up in a mess of domestic political infighting and an apparent inability to decide what it wants and where it wants to stand on the international stage .
so what went wrong ?
petr kratochvil , deputy director of the prague institute of international relations , said it all started after the country had secured the two things it knew it wanted : nato and eu membership .
" there were two phases after 1989 , " kratochvil told deutsche welle .
" the first was the transition from the communist past to the establishment of a democratic system . "
behind that clear aim , he says , the nation and its politicians did willingly unite .
but once it had been achieved , the new democracy did n't know what to do next .
struggling for unity and , kratochvil says , the czech republic has not yet come up with an answer .
" there has been no unity across the political spectrum ever since , " he said , adding that on the whole politicians are more concerned with petty arguments and scoring points than with the country itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan fischer earlier this year , the animosity led to a vote of no confidence for the government .
since then the country has been in the hands of a caretaker government under the leadership of a bureaucrat , jan fischer , the former head of the national statistics office .
he took on the interim post promising that his would not be a government of vision , but one of hard work .
" i really hope that we 'll be able to do something for our country , " fischer said at the time of his appointment .
" we will lead the czech republic into new elections and we 'll do this quietly and with respect for all of our international obligations . "
however , that is not the way things have gone .
a snap election was planned for november .
but in what may have been classic czech political style , the social democrats , whose backing was necessary for the vote to take place , suddenly backed out , leaving the poll scheduled for june 2010 .
a history of change political scientist jiri pehe , director of new york university in prague , says such instability is partially a consequence of having been subjected to an ever-changing political elite .
" we have never had time to develop a robust political culture based on self-confidence , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have an institutional democracy which was built at tremendous speed , " he said , adding that democratic values such as respect for minorities and tolerance of other people have developed at a much slower pace .
" we do n't have democracy as a culture . "
and that , he says , is the trouble with people like president vaclav klaus and the 17 senators who are holding both their country and europe hostage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of czechs want to be part of europe , but klaus does n't " deep down , they are not democrats , " pehe said .
" they feel they have the absolute truth and do n't care whether or not 500 million people agree with it . "
motivated by self-importance pehe believes the president 's reluctance to add his name to the controversial lisbon treaty is rooted in the national conviction " that the czechs have something intellectually unique to offer europe , something so unique it is worth fighting for . "
but it is that notion of national self-importance - coupled with a worry that no matter what the czech republic does , big international decisions will ultimately be made by major powers - which is getting in the way of the country 's future .
" the idea that the country can not contribute so it is not worth trying to , limits the capacity of politicians to act , " pehe said .
some commentators have said vaclav klaus is thoroughly enjoying the attention he is getting from holding out on europe , but pehe says it has swayed public opinion against him .
so perhaps it is , as jan fischer told eu leaders in brussels on wednesday , really just a matter of time before the czech republic ratifies the treaty and thereby makes a clear statement on at least one outstanding issue .

the nobel jury said they were honored for their studies on how ribosomes function , a breakthrough that has been vital in the development of new antibiotics .
the nobel committee cited the work of the trio as " directly assisting the saving of lives and decreasing humanity 's suffering . "
" many of today 's antibiotics cure various diseases by blocking the function of bacterial ribosomes .
without functional ribosomes , bacteria can not survive .
this is why ribosomes are such an important target for new antibiotics . "
research crucial to developing new drugs the three scientists have generated three-dimensional models to illustrating the ribosomes ' individual atomic structure .
these models are now used in the quest for new antibiotics .
about half the current antibiotics in use block the function of bacterial ribosomes , but there is a growing problem of bacterial strains that are resistant to drugs , the committee said on wednesday .
the three will share the 10 million swedish crowns -lrb- 1 million euros , $ 1.42 million -rrb- prize .
steitz , a professor for molecular biophysics at yale university , told reporters he was about to go to the gym when he received the phone call from stockholm .
" my caller from stockholm said i should n't go to the gym .
there would be phone calls , " the scientist told swedish radio .
ramakrishnan works at the mrc laboratory of molecular biology at cambridge university .
yonath , who works at the department of structural biology at the weizmann institute of science in israel , said she did not expect the prize about a discovery made almost a decade ago .
the nobel prizes are handed out annually for achievements in science , literature , economics and peace .
the prize in chemistry was this year 's third , following awards for medicine on monday and physics on tuesday. ai / reuters / dpa / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she was fired for helping herself to a meatball from a conference buffet at her workplace .
the case is to be heard in january . the 57-year-old secretary , identified in the german media as magdalene h , worked for the builders ' association in the state of north-rhine westphalia for more than three decades .
the incident took place last july when she organized a conference buffet for her boss and his guests and helped herself to two rolls and a frikadelle , a german meatball specialty , during the preparations .
boss insists firing was right thing german mass-selling newspaper bild reported on wednesday that magdalene h was confronted by her boss after a colleague noticed some food was missing .
but once she admitted to consuming the meatball , she was fired .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frikadellen are popular in germany " she believed her behavior was acceptable , " her lawyer , wolfgang pinkepank , told bild .
" bread and meatballs that are left over after conferences are allowed to be eaten by workers .
if she had been reprimanded , she would not have done it again . "
the newspaper reported that a judge in the courtroom where the secretary and her employer , hermann schulte-hiltrop , met on tuesday urged schulte-hiltrop to issue a warning instead of a firing , saying the incident was not a classic case of theft .
but schulte-hiltrop , the head of the builders ' association , insisted he had done the right thing in firing her .
" from the outside it naturally looks like a minor offence , " he said .
" but we work on highly sensitive information here .
and if you do n't trust someone any longer , it 's not a good feeling . "
" inhumane and immoral " the case , which is to be officially heard in january 2010 , has sparked anger among labor unions and politicians .
michael groschek , the secretary general of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in north-rhine westphalia called the incident " inhumane and immoral . "
" we should n't tolerate managers getting hefty bonuses despite squandering millions on speculative trading and ordinary people being turned out on the streets on account of eating a meatball , " groschek told news agency ap .
juergen czech of the labor union ig construction , agriculture and environment said the employer needed to ask himself what the firing meant for the secretary , warning that at her age , magdalene h , would have difficulties finding a new job .

annual spending should be raised to eight billion euros if europe is to meet its goal of cutting carbon emissions 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
" today we have a unique opportunity to change an energy model based on polluting , scarce and risky fossil fuels , into a clean , sustainable and less dependent one , " said andris piebalgs , the eu 's energy commissioner , at a press conference in brussels wednesday .
a roadmap for future energy research spending dubbed the strategic energy technology plan -lrb- set -rrb- , the commission 's report emphasized that additional investment to promote technologies such as solar and wind power was urgently needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind power could produce 20 percent of europe 's electricity by 2020 " locked-in investments , vested interests , as well as the high risks and need for significant investments in less profitable alternatives , mean that change will be slow without a major push , " the study said .
the commission report is a roadmap that will help set funding priorities within the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , and the member states .
coordinating research and development among the eu 's 27 member governments will be difficult , said energy economist claudia kemfert of berlin 's diw research institute .
" individual member countries have to decide how much they want to spend and what they spend it on , " kemfert told deutsche welle .
" there will be pressure for them to spend the money in their own countries . "
the bulk of the new funding would come from the private sector and member states . the eu 's european trading system for co2 credits and the european investment bank will also provide some financing .
solar and carbon capture the big winners solar power projects receive the most attention in the set study , with 16 billion euros of funding proposed for the next decade with the goal of producing 15 percent of the eu 's electricity from solar power by 2020 .
some of the solar research projects supported by the set roadmap include new ways to build photovoltaic cells more cheaply and quickly than today and for further research in the field of concentrated solar power , which uses the sun 's energy to create heat that powers turbines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report proposes 13 billion euros of funding for carbon storage technology " solar power has the greatest potential but also has the highest costs at the moment , " said kemfert .
" those costs will decline but it will take investment to do that . "
a german consortium known as desertec has proposed using concentrated solar power to build a network of power plants across the deserts of north africa and the middle east which would export much of their electricity to europe at a cost of approximately 400 billion euros by 2050 .
carbon capture and storage technologies , which inject carbon dioxide emitted by coal power plants into the ground rather than releasing the emissions into the atmosphere , would receive 13 billion euros in funding according to the eu roadmap , the second-highest sum in the report .
wind energy gets less additional research funds would also flow into research for biofuels , nuclear power , improving energy efficiency and building ' smart grid ' technology which will create a unified european electricity grid that can accommodate renewable forms of energy .
wind energy , which already provides a significant amount of electricity in germany and spain , would receive six billion euros of additional funding under the plan , which would enable wind power to supply 20 percent of the eu 's electricity needs by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing ' smart grid ' technology to ease power transmission is a key goal calling the funding proposal " a step in the right direction , " hermann albers , head of germany 's wind power federation was also critical of the commissions funding suggestions , noting that wind power already produced seven percent of germany 's electricity .
" the foreseen investments in wind energy are clearly too small in comparison to ccs and nuclear technology , " albers told deutsche welle .
" some rethinking on the eu level is urgently needed . "
new jobs and energy security in addition to helping europe meet its carbon reduction goals , the report emphasized that targeted investments in the renewable energy sector could stimulate the development of new industries and jobs and provide europe with an economic advantage in the decades ahead .
the additional 50 billion euros worth of spending could create as many as 600,000 new jobs , with the european renewable energy sector employing as many as 2.8 million people by 2020 , the study said .
europe 's energy security would also be improved by increasing the use of renewable fuels , the report said .
currently , 80 percent of european electricity production is derived from fossil fuels , much of which is imported from outside of the eu .

annual spending should be raised to eight billion euros if europe is to meet its goal of cutting carbon emissions 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
" today we have a unique opportunity to change an energy model based on polluting , scarce and risky fossil fuels , into a clean , sustainable and less dependent one , " said andris piebalgs , the eu 's energy commissioner , at a press conference in brussels wednesday .
a roadmap for future energy research spending dubbed the strategic energy technology plan -lrb- set -rrb- , the commission 's report emphasized that additional investment to promote technologies such as solar and wind power was urgently needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind power could produce 20 percent of europe 's electricity by 2020 " locked-in investments , vested interests , as well as the high risks and need for significant investments in less profitable alternatives , mean that change will be slow without a major push , " the study said .
the commission report is a roadmap that will help set funding priorities within the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , and the member states .
coordinating research and development among the eu 's 27 member governments will be difficult , said energy economist claudia kemfert of berlin 's diw research institute .
" individual member countries have to decide how much they want to spend and what they spend it on , " kemfert told deutsche welle .
" there will be pressure for them to spend the money in their own countries . "
the bulk of the new funding would come from the private sector and member states . the eu 's european trading system for co2 credits and the european investment bank will also provide some financing .
solar and carbon capture the big winners solar power projects receive the most attention in the set study , with 16 billion euros of funding proposed for the next decade with the goal of producing 15 percent of the eu 's electricity from solar power by 2020 .
some of the solar research projects supported by the set roadmap include new ways to build photovoltaic cells more cheaply and quickly than today and for further research in the field of concentrated solar power , which uses the sun 's energy to create heat that powers turbines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report proposes 13 billion euros of funding for carbon storage technology " solar power has the greatest potential but also has the highest costs at the moment , " said kemfert .
" those costs will decline but it will take investment to do that . "
a german consortium known as desertec has proposed using concentrated solar power to build a network of power plants across the deserts of north africa and the middle east which would export much of their electricity to europe at a cost of approximately 400 billion euros by 2050 .
carbon capture and storage technologies , which inject carbon dioxide emitted by coal power plants into the ground rather than releasing the emissions into the atmosphere , would receive 13 billion euros in funding according to the eu roadmap , the second-highest sum in the report .
wind energy gets less additional research funds would also flow into research for biofuels , nuclear power , improving energy efficiency and building ' smart grid ' technology which will create a unified european electricity grid that can accommodate renewable forms of energy .
wind energy , which already provides a significant amount of electricity in germany and spain , would receive six billion euros of additional funding under the plan , which would enable wind power to supply 20 percent of the eu 's electricity needs by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing ' smart grid ' technology to ease power transmission is a key goal calling the funding proposal " a step in the right direction , " hermann albers , head of germany 's wind power federation was also critical of the commissions funding suggestions , noting that wind power already produced seven percent of germany 's electricity .
" the foreseen investments in wind energy are clearly too small in comparison to ccs and nuclear technology , " albers told deutsche welle .
" some rethinking on the eu level is urgently needed . "
new jobs and energy security in addition to helping europe meet its carbon reduction goals , the report emphasized that targeted investments in the renewable energy sector could stimulate the development of new industries and jobs and provide europe with an economic advantage in the decades ahead .
the additional 50 billion euros worth of spending could create as many as 600,000 new jobs , with the european renewable energy sector employing as many as 2.8 million people by 2020 , the study said .
europe 's energy security would also be improved by increasing the use of renewable fuels , the report said .
currently , 80 percent of european electricity production is derived from fossil fuels , much of which is imported from outside of the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 07.10.2009 priceless manuscripts lost during world war ii returned to germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after six decades the two books are to be returned to germany at a ceremony at the national archives in washington dc , an american world war ii veteran handed over two priceless 400-year-old manuscripts to the german ambassador . in the closing days of world war ii , as the allies marched deeper into germany , it was not unheard of for soldiers to take souvenirs .
usually they consisted of a helmet , or a flag , or maybe a knife .
but in the case of robert thomas , an 18-year-old soldier in george patton 's third army , his souvenirs turned out to be two legal manuscripts more than 400 years old .
as the tide of the war turned and allied bombing began to take its toll on german buildings and institutions , rare books and artworks were moved underground to caves or abandoned mines .
it was in an abandoned salt mine in the small town of merkers outside of frankfurt that the young infantryman stumbled on a room filled from floor to ceiling with thousands of books .
a different kind of souvenir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert thomas , left , handed the books over to the german ambassador thomas grabbed two of the books and took them home with him to the united states .
" i kept them in two boxes in the darkest coolest place at my house in order to preserve them .
they are pretty much in the same condition as i found them , " said the 83-year-old veteran .
it was the officials at the national archives who urged thomas to return them to the rightful owner .
" the books will go home now .
that 's the right thing to do , " said thomas as he handed over the manuscripts .
the oldest of the two books , one written in german and the other latin , was published in 1573 and deals with prussian statutes .
the other was published in 1593 and is a treatise on roman law .
the books were originally from the diocesan museum of paderborn and will be returned to the university of bonn library where they were before the war .
at a ceremony at the national archives in washington dc where thomas handed the books over to german ambassador klaus scharioth , the ambassador said that getting the books back was a stroke of luck .

usually they consisted of a helmet , or a flag , or maybe a knife .
but in the case of robert thomas , an 18-year-old soldier in george patton 's third army , his souvenirs turned out to be two legal manuscripts more than 400 years old .
as the tide of the war turned and allied bombing began to take its toll on german buildings and institutions , rare books and artworks were moved underground to caves or abandoned mines .
it was in an abandoned salt mine in the small town of merkers outside of frankfurt that the young infantryman stumbled on a room filled from floor to ceiling with thousands of books .
a different kind of souvenir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert thomas , left , handed the books over to the german ambassador thomas grabbed two of the books and took them home with him to the united states .
" i kept them in two boxes in the darkest coolest place at my house in order to preserve them .
they are pretty much in the same condition as i found them , " said the 83-year-old veteran .
it was the officials at the national archives who urged thomas to return them to the rightful owner .
" the books will go home now .
that 's the right thing to do , " said thomas as he handed over the manuscripts .
the oldest of the two books , one written in german and the other latin , was published in 1573 and deals with prussian statutes .
the other was published in 1593 and is a treatise on roman law .
the books were originally from the diocesan museum of paderborn and will be returned to the university of bonn library where they were before the war .
at a ceremony at the national archives in washington dc where thomas handed the books over to german ambassador klaus scharioth , the ambassador said that getting the books back was a stroke of luck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the books are legal treatises " we 're really lucky to get these books back , " said scharioth .

the nobel jury said they were honored for their studies on how ribosomes function , a breakthrough that has been vital in the development of new antibiotics .
the nobel committee cited the work of the trio as " directly assisting the saving of lives and decreasing humanity 's suffering . "
" many of today 's antibiotics cure various diseases by blocking the function of bacterial ribosomes .

this is why ribosomes are such an important target for new antibiotics . "

these models are now used in the quest for new antibiotics .
about half the current antibiotics in use block the function of bacterial ribosomes , but there is a growing problem of bacterial strains that are resistant to drugs , the committee said on wednesday .
the three will share the 10 million swedish crowns -lrb- 1 million euros , $ 1.42 million -rrb- prize .
steitz , a professor for molecular biophysics at yale university , told reporters he was about to go to the gym when he received the phone call from stockholm .

there would be phone calls , " the scientist told swedish radio .
ramakrishnan works at the mrc laboratory of molecular biology at cambridge university .
yonath , who works at the department of structural biology at the weizmann institute of science in israel , said she did not expect the prize about a discovery made almost a decade ago .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de east germany -pipe- 07.10.2009 east germany founded 60 years ago großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it would be east germany 's 60th birthday - had the regime not collapsed in 1989 on october 7 , 1949 , delegates of the so-called people 's council enthusiastically created communist east germany .
it took 40 years before the berlin wall fell and germany was reunited . sixty years ago , delegates gathered in the grand hall of the former aviation ministry in berlin as germans across the soviet occupied zone followed the events on the radio .
the reporter announced the events as " a piece of german history unfolding . "
a short time later wilhelm pieck declared the birth of the first " workers and peasants state on german soil . "
pieck became the first president of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , as east germany was officially known .
" based on the new constitution , the german democratic republic has been founded unanimously by all parties and organizations present in the german people 's council , " pieck said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilhelm pieck became the first president of east germany less than one month earlier , on september 15 , 1949 , konrad adenauer had been elected as first chancellor of west germany .
in the eyes of the communists in east germany and moscow , adenauer was the " chancellor of western imperialism , " portrayed as the enemy of the people .
one day later , the soviet leadership in moscow sent a delegation of german communist exiles to berlin to implement a socialist alternative to the west .
a division of europe unfolds the creation of two separate german states confirmed what many had expected in the aftermath of world war ii .
the border between east and west germany was not yet fortified with barbed wire – but already it marked the division not only of germany but of europe as a whole .
the two states on both sides of the new border became satellites of their respective allied occupiers .
the soviet dictator josef stalin had a clear agenda in mind .
with the creation of east germany , he pushed the political and military influence of the soviet union well into the heart of europe .
stalin described the new communist state as " the creation of a peace loving , democratic germany alongside the peaceful soviet union . "
according to stalin , the new state would prevent both new wars and the " enslavement of european countries by the western imperialists . "
the " better " german state in west germany , economic progress and political stability soon helped people to get over the woes of the post-war hardship .
but east german leaders wanted more than just material prosperity .
they wanted a fresh ideological start after the catastrophe of nazi germany .
bildunterschrift : the birth of east germany was celebrated with parades in berlin many of the citizens ' of the new eastern state agreed with that concept .
for them , socialism seemed like the proper answer to fascism , war and the holocaust .
walter ulbricht , who became a top communist party official , said the crucial issue was " the struggle against fascist ideology and against other reactionary ideologies that work against the interests of the working class and against progress and development in germany . "
ulbricht later said that " there will be a day when the sed -lrb- east germany 's communist party -rrb- will be the leading party of all of germany – because the majority of germans will want it that way . "
but as enthusiastic as the first reactions were – the dramatic loss of faith in the political leadership installed by moscow came very soon .
an experiment gone wrong the gdr seemed doomed from the very beginning .
the vision that one day its party would lead all of germany was soon turned to be on its head .
in 1989 , peaceful revolution toppled the communist regime .
in the end it was the people of the gdr that wanted the political system of the west and not vice versa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the 40th anniversary was celebrated in 1989 , the end of the regime was only weeks away yet in october 1989 the communist leadership seemed to be in denial that the end was near .
they staged an elaborate celebration to mark the then 40th anniversary of east germany .
yet at that time east germans were already out on the streets demonstrating for change – and thousands had already fled the " workers ' and peasants ' paradise " via hungary to west germany .
in a few weeks from then , on november 9 , 1989 , the berlin wall came down to dramatically mark the collapse of east germany .
after 40 years of gdr , the dream of the allegedly " better " version of germany burst with a momentum so powerful that the citizens of the communist east had lost all faith and interest to change their state and have it survive into a new era .

it took 40 years before the berlin wall fell and germany was reunited . sixty years ago , delegates gathered in the grand hall of the former aviation ministry in berlin as germans across the soviet occupied zone followed the events on the radio .
the reporter announced the events as " a piece of german history unfolding . "
a short time later wilhelm pieck declared the birth of the first " workers and peasants state on german soil . "
pieck became the first president of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , as east germany was officially known .
" based on the new constitution , the german democratic republic has been founded unanimously by all parties and organizations present in the german people 's council , " pieck said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilhelm pieck became the first president of east germany less than one month earlier , on september 15 , 1949 , konrad adenauer had been elected as first chancellor of west germany .
in the eyes of the communists in east germany and moscow , adenauer was the " chancellor of western imperialism , " portrayed as the enemy of the people .
one day later , the soviet leadership in moscow sent a delegation of german communist exiles to berlin to implement a socialist alternative to the west .
a division of europe unfolds the creation of two separate german states confirmed what many had expected in the aftermath of world war ii .
the border between east and west germany was not yet fortified with barbed wire – but already it marked the division not only of germany but of europe as a whole .
the two states on both sides of the new border became satellites of their respective allied occupiers .
the soviet dictator josef stalin had a clear agenda in mind .
with the creation of east germany , he pushed the political and military influence of the soviet union well into the heart of europe .
stalin described the new communist state as " the creation of a peace loving , democratic germany alongside the peaceful soviet union . "
according to stalin , the new state would prevent both new wars and the " enslavement of european countries by the western imperialists . "
the " better " german state in west germany , economic progress and political stability soon helped people to get over the woes of the post-war hardship .
but east german leaders wanted more than just material prosperity .
they wanted a fresh ideological start after the catastrophe of nazi germany .
bildunterschrift : the birth of east germany was celebrated with parades in berlin many of the citizens ' of the new eastern state agreed with that concept .
for them , socialism seemed like the proper answer to fascism , war and the holocaust .
walter ulbricht , who became a top communist party official , said the crucial issue was " the struggle against fascist ideology and against other reactionary ideologies that work against the interests of the working class and against progress and development in germany . "
ulbricht later said that " there will be a day when the sed -lrb- east germany 's communist party -rrb- will be the leading party of all of germany – because the majority of germans will want it that way . "
but as enthusiastic as the first reactions were – the dramatic loss of faith in the political leadership installed by moscow came very soon .
an experiment gone wrong the gdr seemed doomed from the very beginning .
the vision that one day its party would lead all of germany was soon turned to be on its head .
in 1989 , peaceful revolution toppled the communist regime .
in the end it was the people of the gdr that wanted the political system of the west and not vice versa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the 40th anniversary was celebrated in 1989 , the end of the regime was only weeks away yet in october 1989 the communist leadership seemed to be in denial that the end was near .
they staged an elaborate celebration to mark the then 40th anniversary of east germany .
yet at that time east germans were already out on the streets demonstrating for change – and thousands had already fled the " workers ' and peasants ' paradise " via hungary to west germany .
in a few weeks from then , on november 9 , 1989 , the berlin wall came down to dramatically mark the collapse of east germany .
after 40 years of gdr , the dream of the allegedly " better " version of germany burst with a momentum so powerful that the citizens of the communist east had lost all faith and interest to change their state and have it survive into a new era .

usually they consisted of a helmet , or a flag , or maybe a knife .
but in the case of robert thomas , an 18-year-old soldier in george patton 's third army , his souvenirs turned out to be two legal manuscripts more than 400 years old .
as the tide of the war turned and allied bombing began to take its toll on german buildings and institutions , rare books and artworks were moved underground to caves or abandoned mines .
it was in an abandoned salt mine in the small town of merkers outside of frankfurt that the young infantryman stumbled on a room filled from floor to ceiling with thousands of books .
a different kind of souvenir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert thomas , left , handed the books over to the german ambassador thomas grabbed two of the books and took them home with him to the united states .
" i kept them in two boxes in the darkest coolest place at my house in order to preserve them .
they are pretty much in the same condition as i found them , " said the 83-year-old veteran .
it was the officials at the national archives who urged thomas to return them to the rightful owner .
" the books will go home now .
that 's the right thing to do , " said thomas as he handed over the manuscripts .
the oldest of the two books , one written in german and the other latin , was published in 1573 and deals with prussian statutes .
the other was published in 1593 and is a treatise on roman law .
the books were originally from the diocesan museum of paderborn and will be returned to the university of bonn library where they were before the war .
at a ceremony at the national archives in washington dc where thomas handed the books over to german ambassador klaus scharioth , the ambassador said that getting the books back was a stroke of luck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the books are legal treatises " we 're really lucky to get these books back , " said scharioth .
" the fact that these books are returned tells you a lot about our relationship today - it 's a sign of friendship and trust . "
other manuscripts found it is not the first time that german manuscripts have been returned .
in 1992 , a woman who had lived through auschwitz turned over seven medieval manuscripts that had been taken by an american soldier who drove a tank in patton 's army .
the manuscripts were dated from the 15th and 16th centuries and were traced back to st. anthony 's church in the town of hambach near aachen .
one of the most famous hoards of german antiquities and manuscripts are known as the quedlinburg treasure .
the church treasures were hidden in a mine during the waning weeks of world war ii and disappeared soon after us troops occupied the area .
in the 1980s objets d 'art started surfacing in a small texas town in the united states , stolen by an american soldier .
when he died , his relatives tried to sell the art work and the ensuing court case made headlines .
in the end , the german cultural foundation bought most of the works for $ 3 million .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 07.10.2009 eu warns germany , eight other nations for excessive budget deficits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's economy has been hit hard by the global recession the eu commission on wednesday warned germany , italy and seven other eu nations for flouting the bloc 's stability and growth pact which requires them to keep budget deficits under three percent of gross domestic product . in addition to germany and italy , the commission on wednesday also began a budget scrutiny process against austria , belgium , the czech republic , the netherlands , portugal , slovakia and slovenia about their budget deficits .
according to the commission , the eu 's executive arm , 20 of the bloc 's 27 member countries are on track to break that limit this year .
in july , brussels launched action against latvia , lithuania , malta , poland and romania following earlier procedures against france , greece , ireland and spain .
eu blames recession for budget woes the commission blamed the ballooning budget deficits on the global recession , admitting that several eu governments had increased their public spending to limit the impact of the economic crisis .
several eu countries are grappling with falling tax revenues and rising unemployment and many have initiated economic stimulus measures and bail-outs for banks and leading companies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia says the offenders will not be forced to radically rein in spending in light of the recession " a large majority of eu member states are set to have budget deficits above 3 percent of gdp in 2009 as a result of the economic crisis .
we need to continue supporting the economy until the recovery takes hold , in line with the european economic recovery plan , " economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said .
but the commissioner also warned that eu governments need to rein in public spending and bring their public finances back in order .
" now is also the moment to design coordinated exit strategies so that , when the moment is right , we can begin to roll back the soaring debt levels , " he said .
almunia said the stability and growth pact under which the action was taken " is sufficiently flexible to combine the fiscal stimulus in the short term with consolidation of the public finances in the medium term . "
germany grapples with soaring deficit germany 's budget deficit will be 3.9 percent of gdp this year and 5.9 percent next year , the commission said .
the recession in europe 's largest economy has slashed tax revenues and increased government spending on subsidies .
leaked government documents in germany this week said that public deficits need to be cut by 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 56 billion -rrb- between 2011 and 2013 .
bildunterschrift : the soaring deficit is a political issue in germany - merkel here with the fdp 's guido westerwelle germany 's soaring deficit is also a bone of contention for the country 's next center-right government .
the pro-business fdp party , which is set to form a coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives , won the election largely on the back of promised tax cuts .
but merkel has warned that the spiraling budget deficit reduces the scope for immediate tax relief , and that there wo n't be any cuts before 2011 .
the commission has estimated a deficit of 4.5 percent for italy , 3.4 percent in the netherlands and 6.5 percent in portugal .
europe still suffering from downturn europe hit a recovery setback on wednesday with the euro-zone economy shrinking more than expected .
finance ministers from the 16 nations that use the euro agreed last week at a meeting in sweden that their countries would have to take action in 2011 against debt and public deficits .

the stability and growth pact was established in the 1990s to boost confidence in the euro .

they are small , they strike at night and they can be deadly : mosquitos carrying malaria .
it 's one of the deadliest diseases in africa .
yet it ’ s quite easily preventable . malaria is one of africa 's biggest plagues .
it kills almost a million people a year around the world .
90 % of those who die are in africa .
pregnant women and small children are particularly vulnerable .
it 's mostly the poor who die , because they often ca n't afford any treatment once the first symptoms break out .
in any case , prevention is better than cure .
some forms of malaria do n't react to many available drugs anyhow .
but prevention tends to be simple .
for instance , sleeping under a mosquito net or by wearing long-sleeved clothes after sun set .
for other useful hints , tune in to our new series about malaria .
we follow one african family in its quest to eradicate malaria .
and , on the way , they teach us what we can do against it .

but as it parades in the limelight , the young democracy can not hide its many troubles . for years , the czech republic was hailed as the wunderkind of the former east bloc countries , the shining economic example and leader of the pack .
in record time , it appeared to have shed its past to become a fully-fledged member of the western world .
but now , 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall , much of the glitter has fallen off europe 's brightest new star , and it has become tangled up in a mess of domestic political infighting and an apparent inability to decide what it wants and where it wants to stand on the international stage .
so what went wrong ?
petr kratochvil , deputy director of the prague institute of international relations , said it all started after the country had secured the two things it knew it wanted : nato and eu membership .
" there were two phases after 1989 , " kratochvil told deutsche welle .
" the first was the transition from the communist past to the establishment of a democratic system . "
behind that clear aim , he says , the nation and its politicians did willingly unite .
but once it had been achieved , the new democracy did n't know what to do next .
struggling for unity and , kratochvil says , the czech republic has not yet come up with an answer .
" there has been no unity across the political spectrum ever since , " he said , adding that on the whole politicians are more concerned with petty arguments and scoring points than with the country itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan fischer earlier this year , the animosity led to a vote of no confidence for the government .
since then the country has been in the hands of a caretaker government under the leadership of a bureaucrat , jan fischer , the former head of the national statistics office .
he took on the interim post promising that his would not be a government of vision , but one of hard work .
" i really hope that we 'll be able to do something for our country , " fischer said at the time of his appointment .
" we will lead the czech republic into new elections and we 'll do this quietly and with respect for all of our international obligations . "
however , that is not the way things have gone .
a snap election was planned for november .

in record time , it appeared to have shed its past to become a fully-fledged member of the western world .

the nobel jury said they were honored for their studies on how ribosomes function , a breakthrough that has been vital in the development of new antibiotics .
the nobel committee cited the work of the trio as " directly assisting the saving of lives and decreasing humanity 's suffering . "

the case is to be heard in january . the 57-year-old secretary , identified in the german media as magdalene h , worked for the builders ' association in the state of north-rhine westphalia for more than three decades .

the newspaper reported that a judge in the courtroom where the secretary and her employer , hermann schulte-hiltrop , met on tuesday urged schulte-hiltrop to issue a warning instead of a firing , saying the incident was not a classic case of theft .
but schulte-hiltrop , the head of the builders ' association , insisted he had done the right thing in firing her .
" from the outside it naturally looks like a minor offence , " he said .
" but we work on highly sensitive information here .

" we should n't tolerate managers getting hefty bonuses despite squandering millions on speculative trading and ordinary people being turned out on the streets on account of eating a meatball , " groschek told news agency ap .

annual spending should be raised to eight billion euros if europe is to meet its goal of cutting carbon emissions 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
" today we have a unique opportunity to change an energy model based on polluting , scarce and risky fossil fuels , into a clean , sustainable and less dependent one , " said andris piebalgs , the eu 's energy commissioner , at a press conference in brussels wednesday .
a roadmap for future energy research spending dubbed the strategic energy technology plan -lrb- set -rrb- , the commission 's report emphasized that additional investment to promote technologies such as solar and wind power was urgently needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind power could produce 20 percent of europe 's electricity by 2020 " locked-in investments , vested interests , as well as the high risks and need for significant investments in less profitable alternatives , mean that change will be slow without a major push , " the study said .
the commission report is a roadmap that will help set funding priorities within the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , and the member states .
coordinating research and development among the eu 's 27 member governments will be difficult , said energy economist claudia kemfert of berlin 's diw research institute .
" individual member countries have to decide how much they want to spend and what they spend it on , " kemfert told deutsche welle .
" there will be pressure for them to spend the money in their own countries . "
the bulk of the new funding would come from the private sector and member states . the eu 's european trading system for co2 credits and the european investment bank will also provide some financing .
solar and carbon capture the big winners solar power projects receive the most attention in the set study , with 16 billion euros of funding proposed for the next decade with the goal of producing 15 percent of the eu 's electricity from solar power by 2020 .
some of the solar research projects supported by the set roadmap include new ways to build photovoltaic cells more cheaply and quickly than today and for further research in the field of concentrated solar power , which uses the sun 's energy to create heat that powers turbines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report proposes 13 billion euros of funding for carbon storage technology " solar power has the greatest potential but also has the highest costs at the moment , " said kemfert .
" those costs will decline but it will take investment to do that . "
a german consortium known as desertec has proposed using concentrated solar power to build a network of power plants across the deserts of north africa and the middle east which would export much of their electricity to europe at a cost of approximately 400 billion euros by 2050 .
carbon capture and storage technologies , which inject carbon dioxide emitted by coal power plants into the ground rather than releasing the emissions into the atmosphere , would receive 13 billion euros in funding according to the eu roadmap , the second-highest sum in the report .
wind energy gets less additional research funds would also flow into research for biofuels , nuclear power , improving energy efficiency and building ' smart grid ' technology which will create a unified european electricity grid that can accommodate renewable forms of energy .
wind energy , which already provides a significant amount of electricity in germany and spain , would receive six billion euros of additional funding under the plan , which would enable wind power to supply 20 percent of the eu 's electricity needs by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing ' smart grid ' technology to ease power transmission is a key goal calling the funding proposal " a step in the right direction , " hermann albers , head of germany 's wind power federation was also critical of the commissions funding suggestions , noting that wind power already produced seven percent of germany 's electricity .
" the foreseen investments in wind energy are clearly too small in comparison to ccs and nuclear technology , " albers told deutsche welle .
" some rethinking on the eu level is urgently needed . "
new jobs and energy security in addition to helping europe meet its carbon reduction goals , the report emphasized that targeted investments in the renewable energy sector could stimulate the development of new industries and jobs and provide europe with an economic advantage in the decades ahead .
the additional 50 billion euros worth of spending could create as many as 600,000 new jobs , with the european renewable energy sector employing as many as 2.8 million people by 2020 , the study said .
europe 's energy security would also be improved by increasing the use of renewable fuels , the report said .
currently , 80 percent of european electricity production is derived from fossil fuels , much of which is imported from outside of the eu .

annual spending should be raised to eight billion euros if europe is to meet its goal of cutting carbon emissions 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
" today we have a unique opportunity to change an energy model based on polluting , scarce and risky fossil fuels , into a clean , sustainable and less dependent one , " said andris piebalgs , the eu 's energy commissioner , at a press conference in brussels wednesday .
a roadmap for future energy research spending dubbed the strategic energy technology plan -lrb- set -rrb- , the commission 's report emphasized that additional investment to promote technologies such as solar and wind power was urgently needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind power could produce 20 percent of europe 's electricity by 2020 " locked-in investments , vested interests , as well as the high risks and need for significant investments in less profitable alternatives , mean that change will be slow without a major push , " the study said .
the commission report is a roadmap that will help set funding priorities within the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , and the member states .
coordinating research and development among the eu 's 27 member governments will be difficult , said energy economist claudia kemfert of berlin 's diw research institute .
" individual member countries have to decide how much they want to spend and what they spend it on , " kemfert told deutsche welle .
" there will be pressure for them to spend the money in their own countries . "
the bulk of the new funding would come from the private sector and member states . the eu 's european trading system for co2 credits and the european investment bank will also provide some financing .
solar and carbon capture the big winners solar power projects receive the most attention in the set study , with 16 billion euros of funding proposed for the next decade with the goal of producing 15 percent of the eu 's electricity from solar power by 2020 .
some of the solar research projects supported by the set roadmap include new ways to build photovoltaic cells more cheaply and quickly than today and for further research in the field of concentrated solar power , which uses the sun 's energy to create heat that powers turbines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report proposes 13 billion euros of funding for carbon storage technology " solar power has the greatest potential but also has the highest costs at the moment , " said kemfert .
" those costs will decline but it will take investment to do that . "
a german consortium known as desertec has proposed using concentrated solar power to build a network of power plants across the deserts of north africa and the middle east which would export much of their electricity to europe at a cost of approximately 400 billion euros by 2050 .
carbon capture and storage technologies , which inject carbon dioxide emitted by coal power plants into the ground rather than releasing the emissions into the atmosphere , would receive 13 billion euros in funding according to the eu roadmap , the second-highest sum in the report .
wind energy gets less additional research funds would also flow into research for biofuels , nuclear power , improving energy efficiency and building ' smart grid ' technology which will create a unified european electricity grid that can accommodate renewable forms of energy .
wind energy , which already provides a significant amount of electricity in germany and spain , would receive six billion euros of additional funding under the plan , which would enable wind power to supply 20 percent of the eu 's electricity needs by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing ' smart grid ' technology to ease power transmission is a key goal calling the funding proposal " a step in the right direction , " hermann albers , head of germany 's wind power federation was also critical of the commissions funding suggestions , noting that wind power already produced seven percent of germany 's electricity .
" the foreseen investments in wind energy are clearly too small in comparison to ccs and nuclear technology , " albers told deutsche welle .
" some rethinking on the eu level is urgently needed . "
new jobs and energy security in addition to helping europe meet its carbon reduction goals , the report emphasized that targeted investments in the renewable energy sector could stimulate the development of new industries and jobs and provide europe with an economic advantage in the decades ahead .
the additional 50 billion euros worth of spending could create as many as 600,000 new jobs , with the european renewable energy sector employing as many as 2.8 million people by 2020 , the study said .
europe 's energy security would also be improved by increasing the use of renewable fuels , the report said .
currently , 80 percent of european electricity production is derived from fossil fuels , much of which is imported from outside of the eu .

the nobel jury said they were honored for their studies on how ribosomes function , a breakthrough that has been vital in the development of new antibiotics .
the nobel committee cited the work of the trio as " directly assisting the saving of lives and decreasing humanity 's suffering . "
" many of today 's antibiotics cure various diseases by blocking the function of bacterial ribosomes .
without functional ribosomes , bacteria can not survive .
this is why ribosomes are such an important target for new antibiotics . "
research crucial to developing new drugs the three scientists have generated three-dimensional models to illustrating the ribosomes ' individual atomic structure .
these models are now used in the quest for new antibiotics .
about half the current antibiotics in use block the function of bacterial ribosomes , but there is a growing problem of bacterial strains that are resistant to drugs , the committee said on wednesday .
the three will share the 10 million swedish crowns -lrb- 1 million euros , $ 1.42 million -rrb- prize .
steitz , a professor for molecular biophysics at yale university , told reporters he was about to go to the gym when he received the phone call from stockholm .
" my caller from stockholm said i should n't go to the gym .
there would be phone calls , " the scientist told swedish radio .
ramakrishnan works at the mrc laboratory of molecular biology at cambridge university .
yonath , who works at the department of structural biology at the weizmann institute of science in israel , said she did not expect the prize about a discovery made almost a decade ago .
the nobel prizes are handed out annually for achievements in science , literature , economics and peace .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 07.10.2009 eu warns germany , eight other nations for excessive budget deficits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's economy has been hit hard by the global recession the eu commission on wednesday warned germany , italy and seven other eu nations for flouting the bloc 's stability and growth pact which requires them to keep budget deficits under three percent of gross domestic product . in addition to germany and italy , the commission on wednesday also began a budget scrutiny process against austria , belgium , the czech republic , the netherlands , portugal , slovakia and slovenia about their budget deficits .
according to the commission , the eu 's executive arm , 20 of the bloc 's 27 member countries are on track to break that limit this year .
in july , brussels launched action against latvia , lithuania , malta , poland and romania following earlier procedures against france , greece , ireland and spain .
eu blames recession for budget woes the commission blamed the ballooning budget deficits on the global recession , admitting that several eu governments had increased their public spending to limit the impact of the economic crisis .
several eu countries are grappling with falling tax revenues and rising unemployment and many have initiated economic stimulus measures and bail-outs for banks and leading companies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia says the offenders will not be forced to radically rein in spending in light of the recession " a large majority of eu member states are set to have budget deficits above 3 percent of gdp in 2009 as a result of the economic crisis .
we need to continue supporting the economy until the recovery takes hold , in line with the european economic recovery plan , " economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said .
but the commissioner also warned that eu governments need to rein in public spending and bring their public finances back in order .
" now is also the moment to design coordinated exit strategies so that , when the moment is right , we can begin to roll back the soaring debt levels , " he said .
almunia said the stability and growth pact under which the action was taken " is sufficiently flexible to combine the fiscal stimulus in the short term with consolidation of the public finances in the medium term . "
germany grapples with soaring deficit germany 's budget deficit will be 3.9 percent of gdp this year and 5.9 percent next year , the commission said .
the recession in europe 's largest economy has slashed tax revenues and increased government spending on subsidies .
leaked government documents in germany this week said that public deficits need to be cut by 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 56 billion -rrb- between 2011 and 2013 .
bildunterschrift : the soaring deficit is a political issue in germany - merkel here with the fdp 's guido westerwelle germany 's soaring deficit is also a bone of contention for the country 's next center-right government .
the pro-business fdp party , which is set to form a coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives , won the election largely on the back of promised tax cuts .
but merkel has warned that the spiraling budget deficit reduces the scope for immediate tax relief , and that there wo n't be any cuts before 2011 .
the commission has estimated a deficit of 4.5 percent for italy , 3.4 percent in the netherlands and 6.5 percent in portugal .
europe still suffering from downturn europe hit a recovery setback on wednesday with the euro-zone economy shrinking more than expected .
finance ministers from the 16 nations that use the euro agreed last week at a meeting in sweden that their countries would have to take action in 2011 against debt and public deficits .
the pact " must not be interpreted as offering one-way flexibility , " euro-group head and luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker warned .

according to the commission , the eu 's executive arm , 20 of the bloc 's 27 member countries are on track to break that limit this year .
in july , brussels launched action against latvia , lithuania , malta , poland and romania following earlier procedures against france , greece , ireland and spain .
eu blames recession for budget woes the commission blamed the ballooning budget deficits on the global recession , admitting that several eu governments had increased their public spending to limit the impact of the economic crisis .
several eu countries are grappling with falling tax revenues and rising unemployment and many have initiated economic stimulus measures and bail-outs for banks and leading companies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia says the offenders will not be forced to radically rein in spending in light of the recession " a large majority of eu member states are set to have budget deficits above 3 percent of gdp in 2009 as a result of the economic crisis .
we need to continue supporting the economy until the recovery takes hold , in line with the european economic recovery plan , " economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said .
but the commissioner also warned that eu governments need to rein in public spending and bring their public finances back in order .
" now is also the moment to design coordinated exit strategies so that , when the moment is right , we can begin to roll back the soaring debt levels , " he said .
almunia said the stability and growth pact under which the action was taken " is sufficiently flexible to combine the fiscal stimulus in the short term with consolidation of the public finances in the medium term . "
germany grapples with soaring deficit germany 's budget deficit will be 3.9 percent of gdp this year and 5.9 percent next year , the commission said .
the recession in europe 's largest economy has slashed tax revenues and increased government spending on subsidies .
leaked government documents in germany this week said that public deficits need to be cut by 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 56 billion -rrb- between 2011 and 2013 .
bildunterschrift : the soaring deficit is a political issue in germany - merkel here with the fdp 's guido westerwelle germany 's soaring deficit is also a bone of contention for the country 's next center-right government .
the pro-business fdp party , which is set to form a coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives , won the election largely on the back of promised tax cuts .
but merkel has warned that the spiraling budget deficit reduces the scope for immediate tax relief , and that there wo n't be any cuts before 2011 .
the commission has estimated a deficit of 4.5 percent for italy , 3.4 percent in the netherlands and 6.5 percent in portugal .
europe still suffering from downturn europe hit a recovery setback on wednesday with the euro-zone economy shrinking more than expected .
finance ministers from the 16 nations that use the euro agreed last week at a meeting in sweden that their countries would have to take action in 2011 against debt and public deficits .

according to the commission , the eu 's executive arm , 20 of the bloc 's 27 member countries are on track to break that limit this year .
in july , brussels launched action against latvia , lithuania , malta , poland and romania following earlier procedures against france , greece , ireland and spain .
eu blames recession for budget woes the commission blamed the ballooning budget deficits on the global recession , admitting that several eu governments had increased their public spending to limit the impact of the economic crisis .
several eu countries are grappling with falling tax revenues and rising unemployment and many have initiated economic stimulus measures and bail-outs for banks and leading companies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia says the offenders will not be forced to radically rein in spending in light of the recession " a large majority of eu member states are set to have budget deficits above 3 percent of gdp in 2009 as a result of the economic crisis .
we need to continue supporting the economy until the recovery takes hold , in line with the european economic recovery plan , " economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said .
but the commissioner also warned that eu governments need to rein in public spending and bring their public finances back in order .
" now is also the moment to design coordinated exit strategies so that , when the moment is right , we can begin to roll back the soaring debt levels , " he said .
almunia said the stability and growth pact under which the action was taken " is sufficiently flexible to combine the fiscal stimulus in the short term with consolidation of the public finances in the medium term . "
germany grapples with soaring deficit germany 's budget deficit will be 3.9 percent of gdp this year and 5.9 percent next year , the commission said .
the recession in europe 's largest economy has slashed tax revenues and increased government spending on subsidies .
leaked government documents in germany this week said that public deficits need to be cut by 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 56 billion -rrb- between 2011 and 2013 .
bildunterschrift : the soaring deficit is a political issue in germany - merkel here with the fdp 's guido westerwelle germany 's soaring deficit is also a bone of contention for the country 's next center-right government .
the pro-business fdp party , which is set to form a coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives , won the election largely on the back of promised tax cuts .
but merkel has warned that the spiraling budget deficit reduces the scope for immediate tax relief , and that there wo n't be any cuts before 2011 .
the commission has estimated a deficit of 4.5 percent for italy , 3.4 percent in the netherlands and 6.5 percent in portugal .
europe still suffering from downturn europe hit a recovery setback on wednesday with the euro-zone economy shrinking more than expected .
finance ministers from the 16 nations that use the euro agreed last week at a meeting in sweden that their countries would have to take action in 2011 against debt and public deficits .
the pact " must not be interpreted as offering one-way flexibility , " euro-group head and luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker warned .
the stability and growth pact was established in the 1990s to boost confidence in the euro .
in 2005 , the pact was loosened , making it easier for countries breaching the 3 percent limit to avoid sanctions .
nations that overshoot the eu deficit limit can be subject to economic sanctions , though none have so far been fined. sp / afp / reuters / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nobel jury said they were honored for their studies on how ribosomes function , a breakthrough that has been vital in the development of new antibiotics .
the nobel committee cited the work of the trio as " directly assisting the saving of lives and decreasing humanity 's suffering . "
" many of today 's antibiotics cure various diseases by blocking the function of bacterial ribosomes .
without functional ribosomes , bacteria can not survive .
this is why ribosomes are such an important target for new antibiotics . "
research crucial to developing new drugs the three scientists have generated three-dimensional models to illustrating the ribosomes ' individual atomic structure .
these models are now used in the quest for new antibiotics .
about half the current antibiotics in use block the function of bacterial ribosomes , but there is a growing problem of bacterial strains that are resistant to drugs , the committee said on wednesday .
the three will share the 10 million swedish crowns -lrb- 1 million euros , $ 1.42 million -rrb- prize .
steitz , a professor for molecular biophysics at yale university , told reporters he was about to go to the gym when he received the phone call from stockholm .
" my caller from stockholm said i should n't go to the gym .
there would be phone calls , " the scientist told swedish radio .
ramakrishnan works at the mrc laboratory of molecular biology at cambridge university .
yonath , who works at the department of structural biology at the weizmann institute of science in israel , said she did not expect the prize about a discovery made almost a decade ago .

the bdb is seeking $ 25.7 billion and deutsche bank $ 6.3 billion , according to the report .
meanwhile germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , is also claiming $ 10.4 billion from lehman .
the bdb 's claims derive from institutional investors such as german cities and municipal utilities , the newspaper reported , citing unnamed finance industry sources .
years of litigation ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's deutsche bank is reportedly claiming $ 6.3 billion from lehman 's liquidator sorting out the various claims on lehman 's remaining assets will be a complex process , lawyers told handelsblatt .
" the proceedings will take years , " finance lawyer michael ruetzel from the law firm white & case told the newspaper .
ruetzel 's firm represents several german state-owned savings banks that have claims against lehman .
lehman 's collapse on september 15 , 2008 set off a global financial crisis and imposed severe strains on many creditor banks .
at the time , lehman was carrying $ 613 billion worth of debt and had assets of $ 639 billion . bn / afp / dpa editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is an outspoken man who likes to use direct and colorful language , especially when comparing the cost of bank bailouts with the amount of aid paid to help the world 's poorest nations weather the economic storm .
" in one night we passed $ 700 billion to the banks , " stiglitz says .
" global foreign aid has really been $ 60-70 billion a year .
so in one hour we passed all the foreign aid of all the developed countries to all the developing countries for a decade . "
" and you ask : who is more needy ?
the american banker or developing countries ?
it 's hard not to come up with the conclusion that our values got destroyed . "
new philosophy for imf lending although the columbia university professor says the international monetary fund has done a good job of managing the crisis so far .
he still urges the imf to rethink its lending policies .
in the past , stiglitz says , imf-credits often had damaging side-effects for the recipients .
the loans were usually tied to drastic reform programs that sent the economies of many borrowers into a downward spiral .
stiglitz warns that if the imf wants to become a global insurer against economic disruption , as the funds 's director dominique strauss-kahn claims , then it needs to take a new approach to dealing with the needs of poor countries .
" when you have a crisis and the doctor comes in and says : ' by the way , if you want the medicine you have to do a , b , c and d ' and you say ' i do n't want to do a , b , c and d ' - you are not getting medicine , then it does n't serve the function of insurance , " stiglitz points out .
global finance sector needs taxation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the imf is working hard to prevent another financial crisis financial markets should also be subject of new taxes designed to discourage ' dysfunctional ' trading and help pay for the damage the global crisis has inflicted on poorer countries , stiglitz says .
imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn recently announced that the washington-based organization is already studying ways to tax the financial industry at the request of group of 20 leaders .
such a global financial-transaction tax would only be fair , the stiglitz argues , and it would not be without precedent .
" in environmental economics we have a principle called ' polluter pay ' .
if you cause pollution you have to pay for the clean-up .
the financial sector polluted the global economy with toxic assets and now they ought to clean up that , " the nobel prize-winning economist says .
excessive risk-taking by the banking sector has imposed huge costs on the rest of the society , including workers , developing nations , house-holders and tax-payers , he explains .
a global tax on financial market transactions is therefore not just a question of equity , but a question of efficiency .
stiglitz stresses that such a tax would also help shrink a ' bloated ' financial industry in the united states , arguing that statistics showing that the finance sector accounted for 40 percent of us corporate profits before the crisis were a clear signal that “ something 's wrong . ”
tax revenues could be used for poor countries stiglitz says the money raised by the proposed tax could be used to help poor countries , which were by no means responsible for the financial crisis , but are nevertheless suffering its worst consequences .
according to estimates by the development committee of the world bank and the international monetary fund , another 90 million people around the world are at risk of being driven into extreme poverty by the end of 2010 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 07.10.2009 czech republic plagued by doubts about future path großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague is a jewel , its politics are complex with the fate of the eu resting in the hands of the czech republic , the country has become the focus of media attention .
but as it parades in the limelight , the young democracy can not hide its many troubles . for years , the czech republic was hailed as the wunderkind of the former east bloc countries , the shining economic example and leader of the pack .
in record time , it appeared to have shed its past to become a fully-fledged member of the western world .
but now , 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall , much of the glitter has fallen off europe 's brightest new star , and it has become tangled up in a mess of domestic political infighting and an apparent inability to decide what it wants and where it wants to stand on the international stage .
so what went wrong ?
petr kratochvil , deputy director of the prague institute of international relations , said it all started after the country had secured the two things it knew it wanted : nato and eu membership .
" there were two phases after 1989 , " kratochvil told deutsche welle .
" the first was the transition from the communist past to the establishment of a democratic system . "
behind that clear aim , he says , the nation and its politicians did willingly unite .
but once it had been achieved , the new democracy did n't know what to do next .
struggling for unity and , kratochvil says , the czech republic has not yet come up with an answer .
" there has been no unity across the political spectrum ever since , " he said , adding that on the whole politicians are more concerned with petty arguments and scoring points than with the country itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan fischer earlier this year , the animosity led to a vote of no confidence for the government .
since then the country has been in the hands of a caretaker government under the leadership of a bureaucrat , jan fischer , the former head of the national statistics office .
he took on the interim post promising that his would not be a government of vision , but one of hard work .
" i really hope that we 'll be able to do something for our country , " fischer said at the time of his appointment .
" we will lead the czech republic into new elections and we 'll do this quietly and with respect for all of our international obligations . "
however , that is not the way things have gone .
a snap election was planned for november .
but in what may have been classic czech political style , the social democrats , whose backing was necessary for the vote to take place , suddenly backed out , leaving the poll scheduled for june 2010 .
a history of change political scientist jiri pehe , director of new york university in prague , says such instability is partially a consequence of having been subjected to an ever-changing political elite .
" we have never had time to develop a robust political culture based on self-confidence , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have an institutional democracy which was built at tremendous speed , " he said , adding that democratic values such as respect for minorities and tolerance of other people have developed at a much slower pace .
" we do n't have democracy as a culture . "
and that , he says , is the trouble with people like president vaclav klaus and the 17 senators who are holding both their country and europe hostage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of czechs want to be part of europe , but klaus does n't " deep down , they are not democrats , " pehe said .
" they feel they have the absolute truth and do n't care whether or not 500 million people agree with it . "
motivated by self-importance pehe believes the president 's reluctance to add his name to the controversial lisbon treaty is rooted in the national conviction " that the czechs have something intellectually unique to offer europe , something so unique it is worth fighting for . "
but it is that notion of national self-importance - coupled with a worry that no matter what the czech republic does , big international decisions will ultimately be made by major powers - which is getting in the way of the country 's future .
" the idea that the country can not contribute so it is not worth trying to , limits the capacity of politicians to act , " pehe said .
some commentators have said vaclav klaus is thoroughly enjoying the attention he is getting from holding out on europe , but pehe says it has swayed public opinion against him .
so perhaps it is , as jan fischer told eu leaders in brussels on wednesday , really just a matter of time before the czech republic ratifies the treaty and thereby makes a clear statement on at least one outstanding issue .

according to the commission , the eu 's executive arm , 20 of the bloc 's 27 member countries are on track to break that limit this year .

eu blames recession for budget woes the commission blamed the ballooning budget deficits on the global recession , admitting that several eu governments had increased their public spending to limit the impact of the economic crisis .
several eu countries are grappling with falling tax revenues and rising unemployment and many have initiated economic stimulus measures and bail-outs for banks and leading companies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia says the offenders will not be forced to radically rein in spending in light of the recession " a large majority of eu member states are set to have budget deficits above 3 percent of gdp in 2009 as a result of the economic crisis .
we need to continue supporting the economy until the recovery takes hold , in line with the european economic recovery plan , " economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said .
but the commissioner also warned that eu governments need to rein in public spending and bring their public finances back in order .
" now is also the moment to design coordinated exit strategies so that , when the moment is right , we can begin to roll back the soaring debt levels , " he said .
almunia said the stability and growth pact under which the action was taken " is sufficiently flexible to combine the fiscal stimulus in the short term with consolidation of the public finances in the medium term . "
germany grapples with soaring deficit germany 's budget deficit will be 3.9 percent of gdp this year and 5.9 percent next year , the commission said .
the recession in europe 's largest economy has slashed tax revenues and increased government spending on subsidies .

the pro-business fdp party , which is set to form a coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives , won the election largely on the back of promised tax cuts .
but merkel has warned that the spiraling budget deficit reduces the scope for immediate tax relief , and that there wo n't be any cuts before 2011 .

the pact " must not be interpreted as offering one-way flexibility , " euro-group head and luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker warned .
the stability and growth pact was established in the 1990s to boost confidence in the euro .
in 2005 , the pact was loosened , making it easier for countries breaching the 3 percent limit to avoid sanctions .
nations that overshoot the eu deficit limit can be subject to economic sanctions , though none have so far been fined. sp / afp / reuters / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but as it parades in the limelight , the young democracy can not hide its many troubles . for years , the czech republic was hailed as the wunderkind of the former east bloc countries , the shining economic example and leader of the pack .
in record time , it appeared to have shed its past to become a fully-fledged member of the western world .
but now , 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall , much of the glitter has fallen off europe 's brightest new star , and it has become tangled up in a mess of domestic political infighting and an apparent inability to decide what it wants and where it wants to stand on the international stage .
so what went wrong ?
petr kratochvil , deputy director of the prague institute of international relations , said it all started after the country had secured the two things it knew it wanted : nato and eu membership .
" there were two phases after 1989 , " kratochvil told deutsche welle .
" the first was the transition from the communist past to the establishment of a democratic system . "
behind that clear aim , he says , the nation and its politicians did willingly unite .
but once it had been achieved , the new democracy did n't know what to do next .
struggling for unity and , kratochvil says , the czech republic has not yet come up with an answer .
" there has been no unity across the political spectrum ever since , " he said , adding that on the whole politicians are more concerned with petty arguments and scoring points than with the country itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan fischer earlier this year , the animosity led to a vote of no confidence for the government .
since then the country has been in the hands of a caretaker government under the leadership of a bureaucrat , jan fischer , the former head of the national statistics office .
he took on the interim post promising that his would not be a government of vision , but one of hard work .
" i really hope that we 'll be able to do something for our country , " fischer said at the time of his appointment .
" we will lead the czech republic into new elections and we 'll do this quietly and with respect for all of our international obligations . "
however , that is not the way things have gone .
a snap election was planned for november .
but in what may have been classic czech political style , the social democrats , whose backing was necessary for the vote to take place , suddenly backed out , leaving the poll scheduled for june 2010 .
a history of change political scientist jiri pehe , director of new york university in prague , says such instability is partially a consequence of having been subjected to an ever-changing political elite .
" we have never had time to develop a robust political culture based on self-confidence , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have an institutional democracy which was built at tremendous speed , " he said , adding that democratic values such as respect for minorities and tolerance of other people have developed at a much slower pace .
" we do n't have democracy as a culture . "
and that , he says , is the trouble with people like president vaclav klaus and the 17 senators who are holding both their country and europe hostage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of czechs want to be part of europe , but klaus does n't " deep down , they are not democrats , " pehe said .
" they feel they have the absolute truth and do n't care whether or not 500 million people agree with it . "
motivated by self-importance pehe believes the president 's reluctance to add his name to the controversial lisbon treaty is rooted in the national conviction " that the czechs have something intellectually unique to offer europe , something so unique it is worth fighting for . "
but it is that notion of national self-importance - coupled with a worry that no matter what the czech republic does , big international decisions will ultimately be made by major powers - which is getting in the way of the country 's future .
" the idea that the country can not contribute so it is not worth trying to , limits the capacity of politicians to act , " pehe said .
some commentators have said vaclav klaus is thoroughly enjoying the attention he is getting from holding out on europe , but pehe says it has swayed public opinion against him .
so perhaps it is , as jan fischer told eu leaders in brussels on wednesday , really just a matter of time before the czech republic ratifies the treaty and thereby makes a clear statement on at least one outstanding issue .

she was fired for helping herself to a meatball from a conference buffet at her workplace .
the case is to be heard in january . the 57-year-old secretary , identified in the german media as magdalene h , worked for the builders ' association in the state of north-rhine westphalia for more than three decades .
the incident took place last july when she organized a conference buffet for her boss and his guests and helped herself to two rolls and a frikadelle , a german meatball specialty , during the preparations .
boss insists firing was right thing german mass-selling newspaper bild reported on wednesday that magdalene h was confronted by her boss after a colleague noticed some food was missing .
but once she admitted to consuming the meatball , she was fired .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frikadellen are popular in germany " she believed her behavior was acceptable , " her lawyer , wolfgang pinkepank , told bild .
" bread and meatballs that are left over after conferences are allowed to be eaten by workers .
if she had been reprimanded , she would not have done it again . "
the newspaper reported that a judge in the courtroom where the secretary and her employer , hermann schulte-hiltrop , met on tuesday urged schulte-hiltrop to issue a warning instead of a firing , saying the incident was not a classic case of theft .
but schulte-hiltrop , the head of the builders ' association , insisted he had done the right thing in firing her .
" from the outside it naturally looks like a minor offence , " he said .
" but we work on highly sensitive information here .
and if you do n't trust someone any longer , it 's not a good feeling . "
" inhumane and immoral " the case , which is to be officially heard in january 2010 , has sparked anger among labor unions and politicians .
michael groschek , the secretary general of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in north-rhine westphalia called the incident " inhumane and immoral . "
" we should n't tolerate managers getting hefty bonuses despite squandering millions on speculative trading and ordinary people being turned out on the streets on account of eating a meatball , " groschek told news agency ap .
juergen czech of the labor union ig construction , agriculture and environment said the employer needed to ask himself what the firing meant for the secretary , warning that at her age , magdalene h , would have difficulties finding a new job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara e. was dismissed from her job after pocketing a miniscule amount it 's not the first time that firing employees for seemingly minor infractions has seized headlines in germany .

he is an outspoken man who likes to use direct and colorful language , especially when comparing the cost of bank bailouts with the amount of aid paid to help the world 's poorest nations weather the economic storm .
" in one night we passed $ 700 billion to the banks , " stiglitz says .
" global foreign aid has really been $ 60-70 billion a year .
so in one hour we passed all the foreign aid of all the developed countries to all the developing countries for a decade . "
" and you ask : who is more needy ?
the american banker or developing countries ?
it 's hard not to come up with the conclusion that our values got destroyed . "
new philosophy for imf lending although the columbia university professor says the international monetary fund has done a good job of managing the crisis so far .
he still urges the imf to rethink its lending policies .
in the past , stiglitz says , imf-credits often had damaging side-effects for the recipients .
the loans were usually tied to drastic reform programs that sent the economies of many borrowers into a downward spiral .
stiglitz warns that if the imf wants to become a global insurer against economic disruption , as the funds 's director dominique strauss-kahn claims , then it needs to take a new approach to dealing with the needs of poor countries .
" when you have a crisis and the doctor comes in and says : ' by the way , if you want the medicine you have to do a , b , c and d ' and you say ' i do n't want to do a , b , c and d ' - you are not getting medicine , then it does n't serve the function of insurance , " stiglitz points out .
global finance sector needs taxation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the imf is working hard to prevent another financial crisis financial markets should also be subject of new taxes designed to discourage ' dysfunctional ' trading and help pay for the damage the global crisis has inflicted on poorer countries , stiglitz says .
imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn recently announced that the washington-based organization is already studying ways to tax the financial industry at the request of group of 20 leaders .
such a global financial-transaction tax would only be fair , the stiglitz argues , and it would not be without precedent .
" in environmental economics we have a principle called ' polluter pay ' .
if you cause pollution you have to pay for the clean-up .
the financial sector polluted the global economy with toxic assets and now they ought to clean up that , " the nobel prize-winning economist says .
excessive risk-taking by the banking sector has imposed huge costs on the rest of the society , including workers , developing nations , house-holders and tax-payers , he explains .
a global tax on financial market transactions is therefore not just a question of equity , but a question of efficiency .
stiglitz stresses that such a tax would also help shrink a ' bloated ' financial industry in the united states , arguing that statistics showing that the finance sector accounted for 40 percent of us corporate profits before the crisis were a clear signal that “ something 's wrong . ”
tax revenues could be used for poor countries stiglitz says the money raised by the proposed tax could be used to help poor countries , which were by no means responsible for the financial crisis , but are nevertheless suffering its worst consequences .
according to estimates by the development committee of the world bank and the international monetary fund , another 90 million people around the world are at risk of being driven into extreme poverty by the end of 2010 .

" when you have a crisis and the doctor comes in and says : ' by the way , if you want the medicine you have to do a , b , c and d ' and you say ' i do n't want to do a , b , c and d ' - you are not getting medicine , then it does n't serve the function of insurance , " stiglitz points out .
global finance sector needs taxation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the imf is working hard to prevent another financial crisis financial markets should also be subject of new taxes designed to discourage ' dysfunctional ' trading and help pay for the damage the global crisis has inflicted on poorer countries , stiglitz says .
imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn recently announced that the washington-based organization is already studying ways to tax the financial industry at the request of group of 20 leaders .
such a global financial-transaction tax would only be fair , the stiglitz argues , and it would not be without precedent .
" in environmental economics we have a principle called ' polluter pay ' .
if you cause pollution you have to pay for the clean-up .
the financial sector polluted the global economy with toxic assets and now they ought to clean up that , " the nobel prize-winning economist says .
excessive risk-taking by the banking sector has imposed huge costs on the rest of the society , including workers , developing nations , house-holders and tax-payers , he explains .
a global tax on financial market transactions is therefore not just a question of equity , but a question of efficiency .
stiglitz stresses that such a tax would also help shrink a ' bloated ' financial industry in the united states , arguing that statistics showing that the finance sector accounted for 40 percent of us corporate profits before the crisis were a clear signal that “ something 's wrong . ”
tax revenues could be used for poor countries stiglitz says the money raised by the proposed tax could be used to help poor countries , which were by no means responsible for the financial crisis , but are nevertheless suffering its worst consequences .
according to estimates by the development committee of the world bank and the international monetary fund , another 90 million people around the world are at risk of being driven into extreme poverty by the end of 2010 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 07.10.2009 eu warns germany , eight other nations for excessive budget deficits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's economy has been hit hard by the global recession the eu commission on wednesday warned germany , italy and seven other eu nations for flouting the bloc 's stability and growth pact which requires them to keep budget deficits under three percent of gross domestic product . in addition to germany and italy , the commission on wednesday also began a budget scrutiny process against austria , belgium , the czech republic , the netherlands , portugal , slovakia and slovenia about their budget deficits .
according to the commission , the eu 's executive arm , 20 of the bloc 's 27 member countries are on track to break that limit this year .
in july , brussels launched action against latvia , lithuania , malta , poland and romania following earlier procedures against france , greece , ireland and spain .
eu blames recession for budget woes the commission blamed the ballooning budget deficits on the global recession , admitting that several eu governments had increased their public spending to limit the impact of the economic crisis .
several eu countries are grappling with falling tax revenues and rising unemployment and many have initiated economic stimulus measures and bail-outs for banks and leading companies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia says the offenders will not be forced to radically rein in spending in light of the recession " a large majority of eu member states are set to have budget deficits above 3 percent of gdp in 2009 as a result of the economic crisis .
we need to continue supporting the economy until the recovery takes hold , in line with the european economic recovery plan , " economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said .
but the commissioner also warned that eu governments need to rein in public spending and bring their public finances back in order .
" now is also the moment to design coordinated exit strategies so that , when the moment is right , we can begin to roll back the soaring debt levels , " he said .
almunia said the stability and growth pact under which the action was taken " is sufficiently flexible to combine the fiscal stimulus in the short term with consolidation of the public finances in the medium term . "
germany grapples with soaring deficit germany 's budget deficit will be 3.9 percent of gdp this year and 5.9 percent next year , the commission said .
the recession in europe 's largest economy has slashed tax revenues and increased government spending on subsidies .
leaked government documents in germany this week said that public deficits need to be cut by 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 56 billion -rrb- between 2011 and 2013 .
bildunterschrift : the soaring deficit is a political issue in germany - merkel here with the fdp 's guido westerwelle germany 's soaring deficit is also a bone of contention for the country 's next center-right government .
the pro-business fdp party , which is set to form a coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives , won the election largely on the back of promised tax cuts .
but merkel has warned that the spiraling budget deficit reduces the scope for immediate tax relief , and that there wo n't be any cuts before 2011 .
the commission has estimated a deficit of 4.5 percent for italy , 3.4 percent in the netherlands and 6.5 percent in portugal .
europe still suffering from downturn europe hit a recovery setback on wednesday with the euro-zone economy shrinking more than expected .
finance ministers from the 16 nations that use the euro agreed last week at a meeting in sweden that their countries would have to take action in 2011 against debt and public deficits .
the pact " must not be interpreted as offering one-way flexibility , " euro-group head and luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker warned .
the stability and growth pact was established in the 1990s to boost confidence in the euro .
in 2005 , the pact was loosened , making it easier for countries breaching the 3 percent limit to avoid sanctions .
nations that overshoot the eu deficit limit can be subject to economic sanctions , though none have so far been fined. sp / afp / reuters / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to the commission , the eu 's executive arm , 20 of the bloc 's 27 member countries are on track to break that limit this year .
in july , brussels launched action against latvia , lithuania , malta , poland and romania following earlier procedures against france , greece , ireland and spain .
eu blames recession for budget woes the commission blamed the ballooning budget deficits on the global recession , admitting that several eu governments had increased their public spending to limit the impact of the economic crisis .
several eu countries are grappling with falling tax revenues and rising unemployment and many have initiated economic stimulus measures and bail-outs for banks and leading companies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia says the offenders will not be forced to radically rein in spending in light of the recession " a large majority of eu member states are set to have budget deficits above 3 percent of gdp in 2009 as a result of the economic crisis .
we need to continue supporting the economy until the recovery takes hold , in line with the european economic recovery plan , " economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said .
but the commissioner also warned that eu governments need to rein in public spending and bring their public finances back in order .
" now is also the moment to design coordinated exit strategies so that , when the moment is right , we can begin to roll back the soaring debt levels , " he said .
almunia said the stability and growth pact under which the action was taken " is sufficiently flexible to combine the fiscal stimulus in the short term with consolidation of the public finances in the medium term . "
germany grapples with soaring deficit germany 's budget deficit will be 3.9 percent of gdp this year and 5.9 percent next year , the commission said .
the recession in europe 's largest economy has slashed tax revenues and increased government spending on subsidies .

the pro-business fdp party , which is set to form a coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives , won the election largely on the back of promised tax cuts .
but merkel has warned that the spiraling budget deficit reduces the scope for immediate tax relief , and that there wo n't be any cuts before 2011 .
the commission has estimated a deficit of 4.5 percent for italy , 3.4 percent in the netherlands and 6.5 percent in portugal .

it took 40 years before the berlin wall fell and germany was reunited . sixty years ago , delegates gathered in the grand hall of the former aviation ministry in berlin as germans across the soviet occupied zone followed the events on the radio .
the reporter announced the events as " a piece of german history unfolding . "
a short time later wilhelm pieck declared the birth of the first " workers and peasants state on german soil . "
pieck became the first president of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , as east germany was officially known .
" based on the new constitution , the german democratic republic has been founded unanimously by all parties and organizations present in the german people 's council , " pieck said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilhelm pieck became the first president of east germany less than one month earlier , on september 15 , 1949 , konrad adenauer had been elected as first chancellor of west germany .
in the eyes of the communists in east germany and moscow , adenauer was the " chancellor of western imperialism , " portrayed as the enemy of the people .
one day later , the soviet leadership in moscow sent a delegation of german communist exiles to berlin to implement a socialist alternative to the west .
a division of europe unfolds the creation of two separate german states confirmed what many had expected in the aftermath of world war ii .
the border between east and west germany was not yet fortified with barbed wire – but already it marked the division not only of germany but of europe as a whole .
the two states on both sides of the new border became satellites of their respective allied occupiers .
the soviet dictator josef stalin had a clear agenda in mind .
with the creation of east germany , he pushed the political and military influence of the soviet union well into the heart of europe .
stalin described the new communist state as " the creation of a peace loving , democratic germany alongside the peaceful soviet union . "
according to stalin , the new state would prevent both new wars and the " enslavement of european countries by the western imperialists . "
the " better " german state in west germany , economic progress and political stability soon helped people to get over the woes of the post-war hardship .
but east german leaders wanted more than just material prosperity .
they wanted a fresh ideological start after the catastrophe of nazi germany .
bildunterschrift : the birth of east germany was celebrated with parades in berlin many of the citizens ' of the new eastern state agreed with that concept .
for them , socialism seemed like the proper answer to fascism , war and the holocaust .
walter ulbricht , who became a top communist party official , said the crucial issue was " the struggle against fascist ideology and against other reactionary ideologies that work against the interests of the working class and against progress and development in germany . "
ulbricht later said that " there will be a day when the sed -lrb- east germany 's communist party -rrb- will be the leading party of all of germany – because the majority of germans will want it that way . "
but as enthusiastic as the first reactions were – the dramatic loss of faith in the political leadership installed by moscow came very soon .
an experiment gone wrong the gdr seemed doomed from the very beginning .
the vision that one day its party would lead all of germany was soon turned to be on its head .
in 1989 , peaceful revolution toppled the communist regime .
in the end it was the people of the gdr that wanted the political system of the west and not vice versa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the 40th anniversary was celebrated in 1989 , the end of the regime was only weeks away yet in october 1989 the communist leadership seemed to be in denial that the end was near .
they staged an elaborate celebration to mark the then 40th anniversary of east germany .
yet at that time east germans were already out on the streets demonstrating for change – and thousands had already fled the " workers ' and peasants ' paradise " via hungary to west germany .
in a few weeks from then , on november 9 , 1989 , the berlin wall came down to dramatically mark the collapse of east germany .
after 40 years of gdr , the dream of the allegedly " better " version of germany burst with a momentum so powerful that the citizens of the communist east had lost all faith and interest to change their state and have it survive into a new era .

usually they consisted of a helmet , or a flag , or maybe a knife .
but in the case of robert thomas , an 18-year-old soldier in george patton 's third army , his souvenirs turned out to be two legal manuscripts more than 400 years old .
as the tide of the war turned and allied bombing began to take its toll on german buildings and institutions , rare books and artworks were moved underground to caves or abandoned mines .
it was in an abandoned salt mine in the small town of merkers outside of frankfurt that the young infantryman stumbled on a room filled from floor to ceiling with thousands of books .
a different kind of souvenir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert thomas , left , handed the books over to the german ambassador thomas grabbed two of the books and took them home with him to the united states .
" i kept them in two boxes in the darkest coolest place at my house in order to preserve them .
they are pretty much in the same condition as i found them , " said the 83-year-old veteran .
it was the officials at the national archives who urged thomas to return them to the rightful owner .
" the books will go home now .
that 's the right thing to do , " said thomas as he handed over the manuscripts .
the oldest of the two books , one written in german and the other latin , was published in 1573 and deals with prussian statutes .
the other was published in 1593 and is a treatise on roman law .
the books were originally from the diocesan museum of paderborn and will be returned to the university of bonn library where they were before the war .
at a ceremony at the national archives in washington dc where thomas handed the books over to german ambassador klaus scharioth , the ambassador said that getting the books back was a stroke of luck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the books are legal treatises " we 're really lucky to get these books back , " said scharioth .
" the fact that these books are returned tells you a lot about our relationship today - it 's a sign of friendship and trust . "
other manuscripts found it is not the first time that german manuscripts have been returned .
in 1992 , a woman who had lived through auschwitz turned over seven medieval manuscripts that had been taken by an american soldier who drove a tank in patton 's army .
the manuscripts were dated from the 15th and 16th centuries and were traced back to st. anthony 's church in the town of hambach near aachen .
one of the most famous hoards of german antiquities and manuscripts are known as the quedlinburg treasure .
the church treasures were hidden in a mine during the waning weeks of world war ii and disappeared soon after us troops occupied the area .
in the 1980s objets d 'art started surfacing in a small texas town in the united states , stolen by an american soldier .
when he died , his relatives tried to sell the art work and the ensuing court case made headlines .
in the end , the german cultural foundation bought most of the works for $ 3 million .
in 2008 , german cultural institutions published a catalog of over 180,000 works of art that disappeared after the war. av / afp / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

usually they consisted of a helmet , or a flag , or maybe a knife .
but in the case of robert thomas , an 18-year-old soldier in george patton 's third army , his souvenirs turned out to be two legal manuscripts more than 400 years old .
as the tide of the war turned and allied bombing began to take its toll on german buildings and institutions , rare books and artworks were moved underground to caves or abandoned mines .
it was in an abandoned salt mine in the small town of merkers outside of frankfurt that the young infantryman stumbled on a room filled from floor to ceiling with thousands of books .
a different kind of souvenir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert thomas , left , handed the books over to the german ambassador thomas grabbed two of the books and took them home with him to the united states .
" i kept them in two boxes in the darkest coolest place at my house in order to preserve them .
they are pretty much in the same condition as i found them , " said the 83-year-old veteran .
it was the officials at the national archives who urged thomas to return them to the rightful owner .
" the books will go home now .
that 's the right thing to do , " said thomas as he handed over the manuscripts .
the oldest of the two books , one written in german and the other latin , was published in 1573 and deals with prussian statutes .
the other was published in 1593 and is a treatise on roman law .
the books were originally from the diocesan museum of paderborn and will be returned to the university of bonn library where they were before the war .
at a ceremony at the national archives in washington dc where thomas handed the books over to german ambassador klaus scharioth , the ambassador said that getting the books back was a stroke of luck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the books are legal treatises " we 're really lucky to get these books back , " said scharioth .
" the fact that these books are returned tells you a lot about our relationship today - it 's a sign of friendship and trust . "
other manuscripts found it is not the first time that german manuscripts have been returned .
in 1992 , a woman who had lived through auschwitz turned over seven medieval manuscripts that had been taken by an american soldier who drove a tank in patton 's army .
the manuscripts were dated from the 15th and 16th centuries and were traced back to st. anthony 's church in the town of hambach near aachen .
one of the most famous hoards of german antiquities and manuscripts are known as the quedlinburg treasure .
the church treasures were hidden in a mine during the waning weeks of world war ii and disappeared soon after us troops occupied the area .
in the 1980s objets d 'art started surfacing in a small texas town in the united states , stolen by an american soldier .
when he died , his relatives tried to sell the art work and the ensuing court case made headlines .
in the end , the german cultural foundation bought most of the works for $ 3 million .
in 2008 , german cultural institutions published a catalog of over 180,000 works of art that disappeared after the war. av / afp / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nobel jury said they were honored for their studies on how ribosomes function , a breakthrough that has been vital in the development of new antibiotics .
the nobel committee cited the work of the trio as " directly assisting the saving of lives and decreasing humanity 's suffering . "
" many of today 's antibiotics cure various diseases by blocking the function of bacterial ribosomes .
without functional ribosomes , bacteria can not survive .
this is why ribosomes are such an important target for new antibiotics . "
research crucial to developing new drugs the three scientists have generated three-dimensional models to illustrating the ribosomes ' individual atomic structure .
these models are now used in the quest for new antibiotics .
about half the current antibiotics in use block the function of bacterial ribosomes , but there is a growing problem of bacterial strains that are resistant to drugs , the committee said on wednesday .
the three will share the 10 million swedish crowns -lrb- 1 million euros , $ 1.42 million -rrb- prize .
steitz , a professor for molecular biophysics at yale university , told reporters he was about to go to the gym when he received the phone call from stockholm .
" my caller from stockholm said i should n't go to the gym .
there would be phone calls , " the scientist told swedish radio .
ramakrishnan works at the mrc laboratory of molecular biology at cambridge university .
yonath , who works at the department of structural biology at the weizmann institute of science in israel , said she did not expect the prize about a discovery made almost a decade ago .

annual spending should be raised to eight billion euros if europe is to meet its goal of cutting carbon emissions 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
" today we have a unique opportunity to change an energy model based on polluting , scarce and risky fossil fuels , into a clean , sustainable and less dependent one , " said andris piebalgs , the eu 's energy commissioner , at a press conference in brussels wednesday .
a roadmap for future energy research spending dubbed the strategic energy technology plan -lrb- set -rrb- , the commission 's report emphasized that additional investment to promote technologies such as solar and wind power was urgently needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind power could produce 20 percent of europe 's electricity by 2020 " locked-in investments , vested interests , as well as the high risks and need for significant investments in less profitable alternatives , mean that change will be slow without a major push , " the study said .
the commission report is a roadmap that will help set funding priorities within the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , and the member states .
coordinating research and development among the eu 's 27 member governments will be difficult , said energy economist claudia kemfert of berlin 's diw research institute .
" individual member countries have to decide how much they want to spend and what they spend it on , " kemfert told deutsche welle .
" there will be pressure for them to spend the money in their own countries . "
the bulk of the new funding would come from the private sector and member states . the eu 's european trading system for co2 credits and the european investment bank will also provide some financing .
solar and carbon capture the big winners solar power projects receive the most attention in the set study , with 16 billion euros of funding proposed for the next decade with the goal of producing 15 percent of the eu 's electricity from solar power by 2020 .
some of the solar research projects supported by the set roadmap include new ways to build photovoltaic cells more cheaply and quickly than today and for further research in the field of concentrated solar power , which uses the sun 's energy to create heat that powers turbines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report proposes 13 billion euros of funding for carbon storage technology " solar power has the greatest potential but also has the highest costs at the moment , " said kemfert .
" those costs will decline but it will take investment to do that . "
a german consortium known as desertec has proposed using concentrated solar power to build a network of power plants across the deserts of north africa and the middle east which would export much of their electricity to europe at a cost of approximately 400 billion euros by 2050 .
carbon capture and storage technologies , which inject carbon dioxide emitted by coal power plants into the ground rather than releasing the emissions into the atmosphere , would receive 13 billion euros in funding according to the eu roadmap , the second-highest sum in the report .
wind energy gets less additional research funds would also flow into research for biofuels , nuclear power , improving energy efficiency and building ' smart grid ' technology which will create a unified european electricity grid that can accommodate renewable forms of energy .
wind energy , which already provides a significant amount of electricity in germany and spain , would receive six billion euros of additional funding under the plan , which would enable wind power to supply 20 percent of the eu 's electricity needs by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing ' smart grid ' technology to ease power transmission is a key goal calling the funding proposal " a step in the right direction , " hermann albers , head of germany 's wind power federation was also critical of the commissions funding suggestions , noting that wind power already produced seven percent of germany 's electricity .
" the foreseen investments in wind energy are clearly too small in comparison to ccs and nuclear technology , " albers told deutsche welle .
" some rethinking on the eu level is urgently needed . "
new jobs and energy security in addition to helping europe meet its carbon reduction goals , the report emphasized that targeted investments in the renewable energy sector could stimulate the development of new industries and jobs and provide europe with an economic advantage in the decades ahead .
the additional 50 billion euros worth of spending could create as many as 600,000 new jobs , with the european renewable energy sector employing as many as 2.8 million people by 2020 , the study said .
europe 's energy security would also be improved by increasing the use of renewable fuels , the report said .
currently , 80 percent of european electricity production is derived from fossil fuels , much of which is imported from outside of the eu .

the nobel jury said they were honored for their studies on how ribosomes function , a breakthrough that has been vital in the development of new antibiotics .
the nobel committee cited the work of the trio as " directly assisting the saving of lives and decreasing humanity 's suffering . "
" many of today 's antibiotics cure various diseases by blocking the function of bacterial ribosomes .
without functional ribosomes , bacteria can not survive .
this is why ribosomes are such an important target for new antibiotics . "
research crucial to developing new drugs the three scientists have generated three-dimensional models to illustrating the ribosomes ' individual atomic structure .
these models are now used in the quest for new antibiotics .
about half the current antibiotics in use block the function of bacterial ribosomes , but there is a growing problem of bacterial strains that are resistant to drugs , the committee said on wednesday .
the three will share the 10 million swedish crowns -lrb- 1 million euros , $ 1.42 million -rrb- prize .
steitz , a professor for molecular biophysics at yale university , told reporters he was about to go to the gym when he received the phone call from stockholm .
" my caller from stockholm said i should n't go to the gym .
there would be phone calls , " the scientist told swedish radio .
ramakrishnan works at the mrc laboratory of molecular biology at cambridge university .
yonath , who works at the department of structural biology at the weizmann institute of science in israel , said she did not expect the prize about a discovery made almost a decade ago .

annual spending should be raised to eight billion euros if europe is to meet its goal of cutting carbon emissions 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
" today we have a unique opportunity to change an energy model based on polluting , scarce and risky fossil fuels , into a clean , sustainable and less dependent one , " said andris piebalgs , the eu 's energy commissioner , at a press conference in brussels wednesday .
a roadmap for future energy research spending dubbed the strategic energy technology plan -lrb- set -rrb- , the commission 's report emphasized that additional investment to promote technologies such as solar and wind power was urgently needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind power could produce 20 percent of europe 's electricity by 2020 " locked-in investments , vested interests , as well as the high risks and need for significant investments in less profitable alternatives , mean that change will be slow without a major push , " the study said .
the commission report is a roadmap that will help set funding priorities within the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , and the member states .
coordinating research and development among the eu 's 27 member governments will be difficult , said energy economist claudia kemfert of berlin 's diw research institute .
" individual member countries have to decide how much they want to spend and what they spend it on , " kemfert told deutsche welle .
" there will be pressure for them to spend the money in their own countries . "
the bulk of the new funding would come from the private sector and member states . the eu 's european trading system for co2 credits and the european investment bank will also provide some financing .
solar and carbon capture the big winners solar power projects receive the most attention in the set study , with 16 billion euros of funding proposed for the next decade with the goal of producing 15 percent of the eu 's electricity from solar power by 2020 .
some of the solar research projects supported by the set roadmap include new ways to build photovoltaic cells more cheaply and quickly than today and for further research in the field of concentrated solar power , which uses the sun 's energy to create heat that powers turbines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report proposes 13 billion euros of funding for carbon storage technology " solar power has the greatest potential but also has the highest costs at the moment , " said kemfert .
" those costs will decline but it will take investment to do that . "
a german consortium known as desertec has proposed using concentrated solar power to build a network of power plants across the deserts of north africa and the middle east which would export much of their electricity to europe at a cost of approximately 400 billion euros by 2050 .
carbon capture and storage technologies , which inject carbon dioxide emitted by coal power plants into the ground rather than releasing the emissions into the atmosphere , would receive 13 billion euros in funding according to the eu roadmap , the second-highest sum in the report .
wind energy gets less additional research funds would also flow into research for biofuels , nuclear power , improving energy efficiency and building ' smart grid ' technology which will create a unified european electricity grid that can accommodate renewable forms of energy .
wind energy , which already provides a significant amount of electricity in germany and spain , would receive six billion euros of additional funding under the plan , which would enable wind power to supply 20 percent of the eu 's electricity needs by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing ' smart grid ' technology to ease power transmission is a key goal calling the funding proposal " a step in the right direction , " hermann albers , head of germany 's wind power federation was also critical of the commissions funding suggestions , noting that wind power already produced seven percent of germany 's electricity .
" the foreseen investments in wind energy are clearly too small in comparison to ccs and nuclear technology , " albers told deutsche welle .
" some rethinking on the eu level is urgently needed . "
new jobs and energy security in addition to helping europe meet its carbon reduction goals , the report emphasized that targeted investments in the renewable energy sector could stimulate the development of new industries and jobs and provide europe with an economic advantage in the decades ahead .
the additional 50 billion euros worth of spending could create as many as 600,000 new jobs , with the european renewable energy sector employing as many as 2.8 million people by 2020 , the study said .
europe 's energy security would also be improved by increasing the use of renewable fuels , the report said .
currently , 80 percent of european electricity production is derived from fossil fuels , much of which is imported from outside of the eu .

she was fired for helping herself to a meatball from a conference buffet at her workplace .
the case is to be heard in january . the 57-year-old secretary , identified in the german media as magdalene h , worked for the builders ' association in the state of north-rhine westphalia for more than three decades .
the incident took place last july when she organized a conference buffet for her boss and his guests and helped herself to two rolls and a frikadelle , a german meatball specialty , during the preparations .
boss insists firing was right thing german mass-selling newspaper bild reported on wednesday that magdalene h was confronted by her boss after a colleague noticed some food was missing .
but once she admitted to consuming the meatball , she was fired .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frikadellen are popular in germany " she believed her behavior was acceptable , " her lawyer , wolfgang pinkepank , told bild .
" bread and meatballs that are left over after conferences are allowed to be eaten by workers .
if she had been reprimanded , she would not have done it again . "
the newspaper reported that a judge in the courtroom where the secretary and her employer , hermann schulte-hiltrop , met on tuesday urged schulte-hiltrop to issue a warning instead of a firing , saying the incident was not a classic case of theft .
but schulte-hiltrop , the head of the builders ' association , insisted he had done the right thing in firing her .
" from the outside it naturally looks like a minor offence , " he said .
" but we work on highly sensitive information here .
and if you do n't trust someone any longer , it 's not a good feeling . "
" inhumane and immoral " the case , which is to be officially heard in january 2010 , has sparked anger among labor unions and politicians .
michael groschek , the secretary general of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in north-rhine westphalia called the incident " inhumane and immoral . "
" we should n't tolerate managers getting hefty bonuses despite squandering millions on speculative trading and ordinary people being turned out on the streets on account of eating a meatball , " groschek told news agency ap .
juergen czech of the labor union ig construction , agriculture and environment said the employer needed to ask himself what the firing meant for the secretary , warning that at her age , magdalene h , would have difficulties finding a new job .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 07.10.2009 czech republic plagued by doubts about future path großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague is a jewel , its politics are complex with the fate of the eu resting in the hands of the czech republic , the country has become the focus of media attention .
but as it parades in the limelight , the young democracy can not hide its many troubles . for years , the czech republic was hailed as the wunderkind of the former east bloc countries , the shining economic example and leader of the pack .
in record time , it appeared to have shed its past to become a fully-fledged member of the western world .
but now , 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall , much of the glitter has fallen off europe 's brightest new star , and it has become tangled up in a mess of domestic political infighting and an apparent inability to decide what it wants and where it wants to stand on the international stage .
so what went wrong ?
petr kratochvil , deputy director of the prague institute of international relations , said it all started after the country had secured the two things it knew it wanted : nato and eu membership .
" there were two phases after 1989 , " kratochvil told deutsche welle .
" the first was the transition from the communist past to the establishment of a democratic system . "
behind that clear aim , he says , the nation and its politicians did willingly unite .
but once it had been achieved , the new democracy did n't know what to do next .
struggling for unity and , kratochvil says , the czech republic has not yet come up with an answer .
" there has been no unity across the political spectrum ever since , " he said , adding that on the whole politicians are more concerned with petty arguments and scoring points than with the country itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan fischer earlier this year , the animosity led to a vote of no confidence for the government .
since then the country has been in the hands of a caretaker government under the leadership of a bureaucrat , jan fischer , the former head of the national statistics office .
he took on the interim post promising that his would not be a government of vision , but one of hard work .
" i really hope that we 'll be able to do something for our country , " fischer said at the time of his appointment .
" we will lead the czech republic into new elections and we 'll do this quietly and with respect for all of our international obligations . "
however , that is not the way things have gone .
a snap election was planned for november .
but in what may have been classic czech political style , the social democrats , whose backing was necessary for the vote to take place , suddenly backed out , leaving the poll scheduled for june 2010 .
a history of change political scientist jiri pehe , director of new york university in prague , says such instability is partially a consequence of having been subjected to an ever-changing political elite .
" we have never had time to develop a robust political culture based on self-confidence , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have an institutional democracy which was built at tremendous speed , " he said , adding that democratic values such as respect for minorities and tolerance of other people have developed at a much slower pace .
" we do n't have democracy as a culture . "
and that , he says , is the trouble with people like president vaclav klaus and the 17 senators who are holding both their country and europe hostage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of czechs want to be part of europe , but klaus does n't " deep down , they are not democrats , " pehe said .
" they feel they have the absolute truth and do n't care whether or not 500 million people agree with it . "
motivated by self-importance pehe believes the president 's reluctance to add his name to the controversial lisbon treaty is rooted in the national conviction " that the czechs have something intellectually unique to offer europe , something so unique it is worth fighting for . "
but it is that notion of national self-importance - coupled with a worry that no matter what the czech republic does , big international decisions will ultimately be made by major powers - which is getting in the way of the country 's future .
" the idea that the country can not contribute so it is not worth trying to , limits the capacity of politicians to act , " pehe said .
some commentators have said vaclav klaus is thoroughly enjoying the attention he is getting from holding out on europe , but pehe says it has swayed public opinion against him .
so perhaps it is , as jan fischer told eu leaders in brussels on wednesday , really just a matter of time before the czech republic ratifies the treaty and thereby makes a clear statement on at least one outstanding issue .

usually they consisted of a helmet , or a flag , or maybe a knife .
but in the case of robert thomas , an 18-year-old soldier in george patton 's third army , his souvenirs turned out to be two legal manuscripts more than 400 years old .
as the tide of the war turned and allied bombing began to take its toll on german buildings and institutions , rare books and artworks were moved underground to caves or abandoned mines .
it was in an abandoned salt mine in the small town of merkers outside of frankfurt that the young infantryman stumbled on a room filled from floor to ceiling with thousands of books .

" i kept them in two boxes in the darkest coolest place at my house in order to preserve them .
they are pretty much in the same condition as i found them , " said the 83-year-old veteran .
it was the officials at the national archives who urged thomas to return them to the rightful owner .
" the books will go home now .
that 's the right thing to do , " said thomas as he handed over the manuscripts .
the oldest of the two books , one written in german and the other latin , was published in 1573 and deals with prussian statutes .
the other was published in 1593 and is a treatise on roman law .
the books were originally from the diocesan museum of paderborn and will be returned to the university of bonn library where they were before the war .

" the fact that these books are returned tells you a lot about our relationship today - it 's a sign of friendship and trust . "
other manuscripts found it is not the first time that german manuscripts have been returned .
in 1992 , a woman who had lived through auschwitz turned over seven medieval manuscripts that had been taken by an american soldier who drove a tank in patton 's army .
the manuscripts were dated from the 15th and 16th centuries and were traced back to st. anthony 's church in the town of hambach near aachen .

but as it parades in the limelight , the young democracy can not hide its many troubles . for years , the czech republic was hailed as the wunderkind of the former east bloc countries , the shining economic example and leader of the pack .
in record time , it appeared to have shed its past to become a fully-fledged member of the western world .
but now , 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall , much of the glitter has fallen off europe 's brightest new star , and it has become tangled up in a mess of domestic political infighting and an apparent inability to decide what it wants and where it wants to stand on the international stage .
so what went wrong ?
petr kratochvil , deputy director of the prague institute of international relations , said it all started after the country had secured the two things it knew it wanted : nato and eu membership .
" there were two phases after 1989 , " kratochvil told deutsche welle .
" the first was the transition from the communist past to the establishment of a democratic system . "
behind that clear aim , he says , the nation and its politicians did willingly unite .
but once it had been achieved , the new democracy did n't know what to do next .
struggling for unity and , kratochvil says , the czech republic has not yet come up with an answer .
" there has been no unity across the political spectrum ever since , " he said , adding that on the whole politicians are more concerned with petty arguments and scoring points than with the country itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan fischer earlier this year , the animosity led to a vote of no confidence for the government .
since then the country has been in the hands of a caretaker government under the leadership of a bureaucrat , jan fischer , the former head of the national statistics office .
he took on the interim post promising that his would not be a government of vision , but one of hard work .
" i really hope that we 'll be able to do something for our country , " fischer said at the time of his appointment .
" we will lead the czech republic into new elections and we 'll do this quietly and with respect for all of our international obligations . "
however , that is not the way things have gone .
a snap election was planned for november .
but in what may have been classic czech political style , the social democrats , whose backing was necessary for the vote to take place , suddenly backed out , leaving the poll scheduled for june 2010 .
a history of change political scientist jiri pehe , director of new york university in prague , says such instability is partially a consequence of having been subjected to an ever-changing political elite .
" we have never had time to develop a robust political culture based on self-confidence , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have an institutional democracy which was built at tremendous speed , " he said , adding that democratic values such as respect for minorities and tolerance of other people have developed at a much slower pace .
" we do n't have democracy as a culture . "
and that , he says , is the trouble with people like president vaclav klaus and the 17 senators who are holding both their country and europe hostage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of czechs want to be part of europe , but klaus does n't " deep down , they are not democrats , " pehe said .
" they feel they have the absolute truth and do n't care whether or not 500 million people agree with it . "
motivated by self-importance pehe believes the president 's reluctance to add his name to the controversial lisbon treaty is rooted in the national conviction " that the czechs have something intellectually unique to offer europe , something so unique it is worth fighting for . "
but it is that notion of national self-importance - coupled with a worry that no matter what the czech republic does , big international decisions will ultimately be made by major powers - which is getting in the way of the country 's future .
" the idea that the country can not contribute so it is not worth trying to , limits the capacity of politicians to act , " pehe said .
some commentators have said vaclav klaus is thoroughly enjoying the attention he is getting from holding out on europe , but pehe says it has swayed public opinion against him .
so perhaps it is , as jan fischer told eu leaders in brussels on wednesday , really just a matter of time before the czech republic ratifies the treaty and thereby makes a clear statement on at least one outstanding issue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de east germany -pipe- 07.10.2009 east germany founded 60 years ago großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it would be east germany 's 60th birthday - had the regime not collapsed in 1989 on october 7 , 1949 , delegates of the so-called people 's council enthusiastically created communist east germany .
it took 40 years before the berlin wall fell and germany was reunited . sixty years ago , delegates gathered in the grand hall of the former aviation ministry in berlin as germans across the soviet occupied zone followed the events on the radio .
the reporter announced the events as " a piece of german history unfolding . "
a short time later wilhelm pieck declared the birth of the first " workers and peasants state on german soil . "
pieck became the first president of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , as east germany was officially known .
" based on the new constitution , the german democratic republic has been founded unanimously by all parties and organizations present in the german people 's council , " pieck said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilhelm pieck became the first president of east germany less than one month earlier , on september 15 , 1949 , konrad adenauer had been elected as first chancellor of west germany .
in the eyes of the communists in east germany and moscow , adenauer was the " chancellor of western imperialism , " portrayed as the enemy of the people .
one day later , the soviet leadership in moscow sent a delegation of german communist exiles to berlin to implement a socialist alternative to the west .
a division of europe unfolds the creation of two separate german states confirmed what many had expected in the aftermath of world war ii .
the border between east and west germany was not yet fortified with barbed wire – but already it marked the division not only of germany but of europe as a whole .
the two states on both sides of the new border became satellites of their respective allied occupiers .
the soviet dictator josef stalin had a clear agenda in mind .
with the creation of east germany , he pushed the political and military influence of the soviet union well into the heart of europe .
stalin described the new communist state as " the creation of a peace loving , democratic germany alongside the peaceful soviet union . "
according to stalin , the new state would prevent both new wars and the " enslavement of european countries by the western imperialists . "
the " better " german state in west germany , economic progress and political stability soon helped people to get over the woes of the post-war hardship .
but east german leaders wanted more than just material prosperity .
they wanted a fresh ideological start after the catastrophe of nazi germany .
bildunterschrift : the birth of east germany was celebrated with parades in berlin many of the citizens ' of the new eastern state agreed with that concept .
for them , socialism seemed like the proper answer to fascism , war and the holocaust .
walter ulbricht , who became a top communist party official , said the crucial issue was " the struggle against fascist ideology and against other reactionary ideologies that work against the interests of the working class and against progress and development in germany . "
ulbricht later said that " there will be a day when the sed -lrb- east germany 's communist party -rrb- will be the leading party of all of germany – because the majority of germans will want it that way . "
but as enthusiastic as the first reactions were – the dramatic loss of faith in the political leadership installed by moscow came very soon .
an experiment gone wrong the gdr seemed doomed from the very beginning .
the vision that one day its party would lead all of germany was soon turned to be on its head .
in 1989 , peaceful revolution toppled the communist regime .
in the end it was the people of the gdr that wanted the political system of the west and not vice versa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the 40th anniversary was celebrated in 1989 , the end of the regime was only weeks away yet in october 1989 the communist leadership seemed to be in denial that the end was near .
they staged an elaborate celebration to mark the then 40th anniversary of east germany .
yet at that time east germans were already out on the streets demonstrating for change – and thousands had already fled the " workers ' and peasants ' paradise " via hungary to west germany .
in a few weeks from then , on november 9 , 1989 , the berlin wall came down to dramatically mark the collapse of east germany .
after 40 years of gdr , the dream of the allegedly " better " version of germany burst with a momentum so powerful that the citizens of the communist east had lost all faith and interest to change their state and have it survive into a new era .

it took 40 years before the berlin wall fell and germany was reunited . sixty years ago , delegates gathered in the grand hall of the former aviation ministry in berlin as germans across the soviet occupied zone followed the events on the radio .
the reporter announced the events as " a piece of german history unfolding . "
a short time later wilhelm pieck declared the birth of the first " workers and peasants state on german soil . "
pieck became the first president of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , as east germany was officially known .
" based on the new constitution , the german democratic republic has been founded unanimously by all parties and organizations present in the german people 's council , " pieck said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilhelm pieck became the first president of east germany less than one month earlier , on september 15 , 1949 , konrad adenauer had been elected as first chancellor of west germany .
in the eyes of the communists in east germany and moscow , adenauer was the " chancellor of western imperialism , " portrayed as the enemy of the people .
one day later , the soviet leadership in moscow sent a delegation of german communist exiles to berlin to implement a socialist alternative to the west .
a division of europe unfolds the creation of two separate german states confirmed what many had expected in the aftermath of world war ii .
the border between east and west germany was not yet fortified with barbed wire – but already it marked the division not only of germany but of europe as a whole .
the two states on both sides of the new border became satellites of their respective allied occupiers .
the soviet dictator josef stalin had a clear agenda in mind .
with the creation of east germany , he pushed the political and military influence of the soviet union well into the heart of europe .
stalin described the new communist state as " the creation of a peace loving , democratic germany alongside the peaceful soviet union . "
according to stalin , the new state would prevent both new wars and the " enslavement of european countries by the western imperialists . "
the " better " german state in west germany , economic progress and political stability soon helped people to get over the woes of the post-war hardship .
but east german leaders wanted more than just material prosperity .
they wanted a fresh ideological start after the catastrophe of nazi germany .
bildunterschrift : the birth of east germany was celebrated with parades in berlin many of the citizens ' of the new eastern state agreed with that concept .
for them , socialism seemed like the proper answer to fascism , war and the holocaust .
walter ulbricht , who became a top communist party official , said the crucial issue was " the struggle against fascist ideology and against other reactionary ideologies that work against the interests of the working class and against progress and development in germany . "
ulbricht later said that " there will be a day when the sed -lrb- east germany 's communist party -rrb- will be the leading party of all of germany – because the majority of germans will want it that way . "
but as enthusiastic as the first reactions were – the dramatic loss of faith in the political leadership installed by moscow came very soon .
an experiment gone wrong the gdr seemed doomed from the very beginning .
the vision that one day its party would lead all of germany was soon turned to be on its head .
in 1989 , peaceful revolution toppled the communist regime .
in the end it was the people of the gdr that wanted the political system of the west and not vice versa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the 40th anniversary was celebrated in 1989 , the end of the regime was only weeks away yet in october 1989 the communist leadership seemed to be in denial that the end was near .
they staged an elaborate celebration to mark the then 40th anniversary of east germany .
yet at that time east germans were already out on the streets demonstrating for change – and thousands had already fled the " workers ' and peasants ' paradise " via hungary to west germany .
in a few weeks from then , on november 9 , 1989 , the berlin wall came down to dramatically mark the collapse of east germany .
after 40 years of gdr , the dream of the allegedly " better " version of germany burst with a momentum so powerful that the citizens of the communist east had lost all faith and interest to change their state and have it survive into a new era .

she was fired for helping herself to a meatball from a conference buffet at her workplace .
the case is to be heard in january . the 57-year-old secretary , identified in the german media as magdalene h , worked for the builders ' association in the state of north-rhine westphalia for more than three decades .
the incident took place last july when she organized a conference buffet for her boss and his guests and helped herself to two rolls and a frikadelle , a german meatball specialty , during the preparations .
boss insists firing was right thing german mass-selling newspaper bild reported on wednesday that magdalene h was confronted by her boss after a colleague noticed some food was missing .
but once she admitted to consuming the meatball , she was fired .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frikadellen are popular in germany " she believed her behavior was acceptable , " her lawyer , wolfgang pinkepank , told bild .
" bread and meatballs that are left over after conferences are allowed to be eaten by workers .
if she had been reprimanded , she would not have done it again . "
the newspaper reported that a judge in the courtroom where the secretary and her employer , hermann schulte-hiltrop , met on tuesday urged schulte-hiltrop to issue a warning instead of a firing , saying the incident was not a classic case of theft .
but schulte-hiltrop , the head of the builders ' association , insisted he had done the right thing in firing her .
" from the outside it naturally looks like a minor offence , " he said .
" but we work on highly sensitive information here .
and if you do n't trust someone any longer , it 's not a good feeling . "
" inhumane and immoral " the case , which is to be officially heard in january 2010 , has sparked anger among labor unions and politicians .
michael groschek , the secretary general of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in north-rhine westphalia called the incident " inhumane and immoral . "
" we should n't tolerate managers getting hefty bonuses despite squandering millions on speculative trading and ordinary people being turned out on the streets on account of eating a meatball , " groschek told news agency ap .
juergen czech of the labor union ig construction , agriculture and environment said the employer needed to ask himself what the firing meant for the secretary , warning that at her age , magdalene h , would have difficulties finding a new job .

annual spending should be raised to eight billion euros if europe is to meet its goal of cutting carbon emissions 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
" today we have a unique opportunity to change an energy model based on polluting , scarce and risky fossil fuels , into a clean , sustainable and less dependent one , " said andris piebalgs , the eu 's energy commissioner , at a press conference in brussels wednesday .
a roadmap for future energy research spending dubbed the strategic energy technology plan -lrb- set -rrb- , the commission 's report emphasized that additional investment to promote technologies such as solar and wind power was urgently needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind power could produce 20 percent of europe 's electricity by 2020 " locked-in investments , vested interests , as well as the high risks and need for significant investments in less profitable alternatives , mean that change will be slow without a major push , " the study said .
the commission report is a roadmap that will help set funding priorities within the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , and the member states .
coordinating research and development among the eu 's 27 member governments will be difficult , said energy economist claudia kemfert of berlin 's diw research institute .
" individual member countries have to decide how much they want to spend and what they spend it on , " kemfert told deutsche welle .
" there will be pressure for them to spend the money in their own countries . "
the bulk of the new funding would come from the private sector and member states . the eu 's european trading system for co2 credits and the european investment bank will also provide some financing .
solar and carbon capture the big winners solar power projects receive the most attention in the set study , with 16 billion euros of funding proposed for the next decade with the goal of producing 15 percent of the eu 's electricity from solar power by 2020 .
some of the solar research projects supported by the set roadmap include new ways to build photovoltaic cells more cheaply and quickly than today and for further research in the field of concentrated solar power , which uses the sun 's energy to create heat that powers turbines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report proposes 13 billion euros of funding for carbon storage technology " solar power has the greatest potential but also has the highest costs at the moment , " said kemfert .
" those costs will decline but it will take investment to do that . "
a german consortium known as desertec has proposed using concentrated solar power to build a network of power plants across the deserts of north africa and the middle east which would export much of their electricity to europe at a cost of approximately 400 billion euros by 2050 .
carbon capture and storage technologies , which inject carbon dioxide emitted by coal power plants into the ground rather than releasing the emissions into the atmosphere , would receive 13 billion euros in funding according to the eu roadmap , the second-highest sum in the report .
wind energy gets less additional research funds would also flow into research for biofuels , nuclear power , improving energy efficiency and building ' smart grid ' technology which will create a unified european electricity grid that can accommodate renewable forms of energy .
wind energy , which already provides a significant amount of electricity in germany and spain , would receive six billion euros of additional funding under the plan , which would enable wind power to supply 20 percent of the eu 's electricity needs by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing ' smart grid ' technology to ease power transmission is a key goal calling the funding proposal " a step in the right direction , " hermann albers , head of germany 's wind power federation was also critical of the commissions funding suggestions , noting that wind power already produced seven percent of germany 's electricity .
" the foreseen investments in wind energy are clearly too small in comparison to ccs and nuclear technology , " albers told deutsche welle .
" some rethinking on the eu level is urgently needed . "
new jobs and energy security in addition to helping europe meet its carbon reduction goals , the report emphasized that targeted investments in the renewable energy sector could stimulate the development of new industries and jobs and provide europe with an economic advantage in the decades ahead .
the additional 50 billion euros worth of spending could create as many as 600,000 new jobs , with the european renewable energy sector employing as many as 2.8 million people by 2020 , the study said .
europe 's energy security would also be improved by increasing the use of renewable fuels , the report said .
currently , 80 percent of european electricity production is derived from fossil fuels , much of which is imported from outside of the eu .

the nobel jury said they were honored for their studies on how ribosomes function , a breakthrough that has been vital in the development of new antibiotics .
the nobel committee cited the work of the trio as " directly assisting the saving of lives and decreasing humanity 's suffering . "
" many of today 's antibiotics cure various diseases by blocking the function of bacterial ribosomes .
without functional ribosomes , bacteria can not survive .
this is why ribosomes are such an important target for new antibiotics . "
research crucial to developing new drugs the three scientists have generated three-dimensional models to illustrating the ribosomes ' individual atomic structure .
these models are now used in the quest for new antibiotics .
about half the current antibiotics in use block the function of bacterial ribosomes , but there is a growing problem of bacterial strains that are resistant to drugs , the committee said on wednesday .
the three will share the 10 million swedish crowns -lrb- 1 million euros , $ 1.42 million -rrb- prize .
steitz , a professor for molecular biophysics at yale university , told reporters he was about to go to the gym when he received the phone call from stockholm .
" my caller from stockholm said i should n't go to the gym .
there would be phone calls , " the scientist told swedish radio .
ramakrishnan works at the mrc laboratory of molecular biology at cambridge university .
yonath , who works at the department of structural biology at the weizmann institute of science in israel , said she did not expect the prize about a discovery made almost a decade ago .
the nobel prizes are handed out annually for achievements in science , literature , economics and peace .

the nobel jury said they were honored for their studies on how ribosomes function , a breakthrough that has been vital in the development of new antibiotics .
the nobel committee cited the work of the trio as " directly assisting the saving of lives and decreasing humanity 's suffering . "
" many of today 's antibiotics cure various diseases by blocking the function of bacterial ribosomes .
without functional ribosomes , bacteria can not survive .
this is why ribosomes are such an important target for new antibiotics . "
research crucial to developing new drugs the three scientists have generated three-dimensional models to illustrating the ribosomes ' individual atomic structure .
these models are now used in the quest for new antibiotics .
about half the current antibiotics in use block the function of bacterial ribosomes , but there is a growing problem of bacterial strains that are resistant to drugs , the committee said on wednesday .
the three will share the 10 million swedish crowns -lrb- 1 million euros , $ 1.42 million -rrb- prize .
steitz , a professor for molecular biophysics at yale university , told reporters he was about to go to the gym when he received the phone call from stockholm .
" my caller from stockholm said i should n't go to the gym .
there would be phone calls , " the scientist told swedish radio .
ramakrishnan works at the mrc laboratory of molecular biology at cambridge university .
yonath , who works at the department of structural biology at the weizmann institute of science in israel , said she did not expect the prize about a discovery made almost a decade ago .
the nobel prizes are handed out annually for achievements in science , literature , economics and peace .
the prize in chemistry was this year 's third , following awards for medicine on monday and physics on tuesday. ai / reuters / dpa / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she was fired for helping herself to a meatball from a conference buffet at her workplace .
the case is to be heard in january . the 57-year-old secretary , identified in the german media as magdalene h , worked for the builders ' association in the state of north-rhine westphalia for more than three decades .
the incident took place last july when she organized a conference buffet for her boss and his guests and helped herself to two rolls and a frikadelle , a german meatball specialty , during the preparations .
boss insists firing was right thing german mass-selling newspaper bild reported on wednesday that magdalene h was confronted by her boss after a colleague noticed some food was missing .
but once she admitted to consuming the meatball , she was fired .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frikadellen are popular in germany " she believed her behavior was acceptable , " her lawyer , wolfgang pinkepank , told bild .
" bread and meatballs that are left over after conferences are allowed to be eaten by workers .
if she had been reprimanded , she would not have done it again . "
the newspaper reported that a judge in the courtroom where the secretary and her employer , hermann schulte-hiltrop , met on tuesday urged schulte-hiltrop to issue a warning instead of a firing , saying the incident was not a classic case of theft .
but schulte-hiltrop , the head of the builders ' association , insisted he had done the right thing in firing her .
" from the outside it naturally looks like a minor offence , " he said .
" but we work on highly sensitive information here .
and if you do n't trust someone any longer , it 's not a good feeling . "
" inhumane and immoral " the case , which is to be officially heard in january 2010 , has sparked anger among labor unions and politicians .
michael groschek , the secretary general of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in north-rhine westphalia called the incident " inhumane and immoral . "
" we should n't tolerate managers getting hefty bonuses despite squandering millions on speculative trading and ordinary people being turned out on the streets on account of eating a meatball , " groschek told news agency ap .
juergen czech of the labor union ig construction , agriculture and environment said the employer needed to ask himself what the firing meant for the secretary , warning that at her age , magdalene h , would have difficulties finding a new job .

it took 40 years before the berlin wall fell and germany was reunited . sixty years ago , delegates gathered in the grand hall of the former aviation ministry in berlin as germans across the soviet occupied zone followed the events on the radio .
the reporter announced the events as " a piece of german history unfolding . "
a short time later wilhelm pieck declared the birth of the first " workers and peasants state on german soil . "
pieck became the first president of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , as east germany was officially known .
" based on the new constitution , the german democratic republic has been founded unanimously by all parties and organizations present in the german people 's council , " pieck said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilhelm pieck became the first president of east germany less than one month earlier , on september 15 , 1949 , konrad adenauer had been elected as first chancellor of west germany .
in the eyes of the communists in east germany and moscow , adenauer was the " chancellor of western imperialism , " portrayed as the enemy of the people .
one day later , the soviet leadership in moscow sent a delegation of german communist exiles to berlin to implement a socialist alternative to the west .
a division of europe unfolds the creation of two separate german states confirmed what many had expected in the aftermath of world war ii .
the border between east and west germany was not yet fortified with barbed wire – but already it marked the division not only of germany but of europe as a whole .
the two states on both sides of the new border became satellites of their respective allied occupiers .
the soviet dictator josef stalin had a clear agenda in mind .
with the creation of east germany , he pushed the political and military influence of the soviet union well into the heart of europe .
stalin described the new communist state as " the creation of a peace loving , democratic germany alongside the peaceful soviet union . "
according to stalin , the new state would prevent both new wars and the " enslavement of european countries by the western imperialists . "
the " better " german state in west germany , economic progress and political stability soon helped people to get over the woes of the post-war hardship .
but east german leaders wanted more than just material prosperity .
they wanted a fresh ideological start after the catastrophe of nazi germany .
bildunterschrift : the birth of east germany was celebrated with parades in berlin many of the citizens ' of the new eastern state agreed with that concept .
for them , socialism seemed like the proper answer to fascism , war and the holocaust .
walter ulbricht , who became a top communist party official , said the crucial issue was " the struggle against fascist ideology and against other reactionary ideologies that work against the interests of the working class and against progress and development in germany . "
ulbricht later said that " there will be a day when the sed -lrb- east germany 's communist party -rrb- will be the leading party of all of germany – because the majority of germans will want it that way . "
but as enthusiastic as the first reactions were – the dramatic loss of faith in the political leadership installed by moscow came very soon .
an experiment gone wrong the gdr seemed doomed from the very beginning .
the vision that one day its party would lead all of germany was soon turned to be on its head .
in 1989 , peaceful revolution toppled the communist regime .
in the end it was the people of the gdr that wanted the political system of the west and not vice versa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the 40th anniversary was celebrated in 1989 , the end of the regime was only weeks away yet in october 1989 the communist leadership seemed to be in denial that the end was near .
they staged an elaborate celebration to mark the then 40th anniversary of east germany .
yet at that time east germans were already out on the streets demonstrating for change – and thousands had already fled the " workers ' and peasants ' paradise " via hungary to west germany .
in a few weeks from then , on november 9 , 1989 , the berlin wall came down to dramatically mark the collapse of east germany .
after 40 years of gdr , the dream of the allegedly " better " version of germany burst with a momentum so powerful that the citizens of the communist east had lost all faith and interest to change their state and have it survive into a new era .

but as it parades in the limelight , the young democracy can not hide its many troubles . for years , the czech republic was hailed as the wunderkind of the former east bloc countries , the shining economic example and leader of the pack .
in record time , it appeared to have shed its past to become a fully-fledged member of the western world .
but now , 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall , much of the glitter has fallen off europe 's brightest new star , and it has become tangled up in a mess of domestic political infighting and an apparent inability to decide what it wants and where it wants to stand on the international stage .
so what went wrong ?
petr kratochvil , deputy director of the prague institute of international relations , said it all started after the country had secured the two things it knew it wanted : nato and eu membership .
" there were two phases after 1989 , " kratochvil told deutsche welle .
" the first was the transition from the communist past to the establishment of a democratic system . "
behind that clear aim , he says , the nation and its politicians did willingly unite .
but once it had been achieved , the new democracy did n't know what to do next .
struggling for unity and , kratochvil says , the czech republic has not yet come up with an answer .
" there has been no unity across the political spectrum ever since , " he said , adding that on the whole politicians are more concerned with petty arguments and scoring points than with the country itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan fischer earlier this year , the animosity led to a vote of no confidence for the government .
since then the country has been in the hands of a caretaker government under the leadership of a bureaucrat , jan fischer , the former head of the national statistics office .
he took on the interim post promising that his would not be a government of vision , but one of hard work .
" i really hope that we 'll be able to do something for our country , " fischer said at the time of his appointment .
" we will lead the czech republic into new elections and we 'll do this quietly and with respect for all of our international obligations . "
however , that is not the way things have gone .
a snap election was planned for november .
but in what may have been classic czech political style , the social democrats , whose backing was necessary for the vote to take place , suddenly backed out , leaving the poll scheduled for june 2010 .
a history of change political scientist jiri pehe , director of new york university in prague , says such instability is partially a consequence of having been subjected to an ever-changing political elite .
" we have never had time to develop a robust political culture based on self-confidence , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have an institutional democracy which was built at tremendous speed , " he said , adding that democratic values such as respect for minorities and tolerance of other people have developed at a much slower pace .
" we do n't have democracy as a culture . "
and that , he says , is the trouble with people like president vaclav klaus and the 17 senators who are holding both their country and europe hostage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of czechs want to be part of europe , but klaus does n't " deep down , they are not democrats , " pehe said .
" they feel they have the absolute truth and do n't care whether or not 500 million people agree with it . "
motivated by self-importance pehe believes the president 's reluctance to add his name to the controversial lisbon treaty is rooted in the national conviction " that the czechs have something intellectually unique to offer europe , something so unique it is worth fighting for . "
but it is that notion of national self-importance - coupled with a worry that no matter what the czech republic does , big international decisions will ultimately be made by major powers - which is getting in the way of the country 's future .
" the idea that the country can not contribute so it is not worth trying to , limits the capacity of politicians to act , " pehe said .
some commentators have said vaclav klaus is thoroughly enjoying the attention he is getting from holding out on europe , but pehe says it has swayed public opinion against him .
so perhaps it is , as jan fischer told eu leaders in brussels on wednesday , really just a matter of time before the czech republic ratifies the treaty and thereby makes a clear statement on at least one outstanding issue .

the nobel jury said they were honored for their studies on how ribosomes function , a breakthrough that has been vital in the development of new antibiotics .
the nobel committee cited the work of the trio as " directly assisting the saving of lives and decreasing humanity 's suffering . "
" many of today 's antibiotics cure various diseases by blocking the function of bacterial ribosomes .
without functional ribosomes , bacteria can not survive .
this is why ribosomes are such an important target for new antibiotics . "
research crucial to developing new drugs the three scientists have generated three-dimensional models to illustrating the ribosomes ' individual atomic structure .
these models are now used in the quest for new antibiotics .
about half the current antibiotics in use block the function of bacterial ribosomes , but there is a growing problem of bacterial strains that are resistant to drugs , the committee said on wednesday .
the three will share the 10 million swedish crowns -lrb- 1 million euros , $ 1.42 million -rrb- prize .
steitz , a professor for molecular biophysics at yale university , told reporters he was about to go to the gym when he received the phone call from stockholm .
" my caller from stockholm said i should n't go to the gym .
there would be phone calls , " the scientist told swedish radio .
ramakrishnan works at the mrc laboratory of molecular biology at cambridge university .
yonath , who works at the department of structural biology at the weizmann institute of science in israel , said she did not expect the prize about a discovery made almost a decade ago .
the nobel prizes are handed out annually for achievements in science , literature , economics and peace .
the prize in chemistry was this year 's third , following awards for medicine on monday and physics on tuesday. ai / reuters / dpa / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to the commission , the eu 's executive arm , 20 of the bloc 's 27 member countries are on track to break that limit this year .
in july , brussels launched action against latvia , lithuania , malta , poland and romania following earlier procedures against france , greece , ireland and spain .
eu blames recession for budget woes the commission blamed the ballooning budget deficits on the global recession , admitting that several eu governments had increased their public spending to limit the impact of the economic crisis .
several eu countries are grappling with falling tax revenues and rising unemployment and many have initiated economic stimulus measures and bail-outs for banks and leading companies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia says the offenders will not be forced to radically rein in spending in light of the recession " a large majority of eu member states are set to have budget deficits above 3 percent of gdp in 2009 as a result of the economic crisis .
we need to continue supporting the economy until the recovery takes hold , in line with the european economic recovery plan , " economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said .
but the commissioner also warned that eu governments need to rein in public spending and bring their public finances back in order .
" now is also the moment to design coordinated exit strategies so that , when the moment is right , we can begin to roll back the soaring debt levels , " he said .
almunia said the stability and growth pact under which the action was taken " is sufficiently flexible to combine the fiscal stimulus in the short term with consolidation of the public finances in the medium term . "
germany grapples with soaring deficit germany 's budget deficit will be 3.9 percent of gdp this year and 5.9 percent next year , the commission said .
the recession in europe 's largest economy has slashed tax revenues and increased government spending on subsidies .

but merkel has warned that the spiraling budget deficit reduces the scope for immediate tax relief , and that there wo n't be any cuts before 2011 .
the commission has estimated a deficit of 4.5 percent for italy , 3.4 percent in the netherlands and 6.5 percent in portugal .

the stability and growth pact was established in the 1990s to boost confidence in the euro .
in 2005 , the pact was loosened , making it easier for countries breaching the 3 percent limit to avoid sanctions .

but the commissioner also warned that eu governments need to rein in public spending and bring their public finances back in order .
" now is also the moment to design coordinated exit strategies so that , when the moment is right , we can begin to roll back the soaring debt levels , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 07.10.2009 priceless manuscripts lost during world war ii returned to germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after six decades the two books are to be returned to germany at a ceremony at the national archives in washington dc , an american world war ii veteran handed over two priceless 400-year-old manuscripts to the german ambassador . in the closing days of world war ii , as the allies marched deeper into germany , it was not unheard of for soldiers to take souvenirs .
usually they consisted of a helmet , or a flag , or maybe a knife .
but in the case of robert thomas , an 18-year-old soldier in george patton 's third army , his souvenirs turned out to be two legal manuscripts more than 400 years old .
as the tide of the war turned and allied bombing began to take its toll on german buildings and institutions , rare books and artworks were moved underground to caves or abandoned mines .
it was in an abandoned salt mine in the small town of merkers outside of frankfurt that the young infantryman stumbled on a room filled from floor to ceiling with thousands of books .
a different kind of souvenir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert thomas , left , handed the books over to the german ambassador thomas grabbed two of the books and took them home with him to the united states .
" i kept them in two boxes in the darkest coolest place at my house in order to preserve them .
they are pretty much in the same condition as i found them , " said the 83-year-old veteran .
it was the officials at the national archives who urged thomas to return them to the rightful owner .
" the books will go home now .
that 's the right thing to do , " said thomas as he handed over the manuscripts .
the oldest of the two books , one written in german and the other latin , was published in 1573 and deals with prussian statutes .
the other was published in 1593 and is a treatise on roman law .
the books were originally from the diocesan museum of paderborn and will be returned to the university of bonn library where they were before the war .
at a ceremony at the national archives in washington dc where thomas handed the books over to german ambassador klaus scharioth , the ambassador said that getting the books back was a stroke of luck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the books are legal treatises " we 're really lucky to get these books back , " said scharioth .
" the fact that these books are returned tells you a lot about our relationship today - it 's a sign of friendship and trust . "
other manuscripts found it is not the first time that german manuscripts have been returned .
in 1992 , a woman who had lived through auschwitz turned over seven medieval manuscripts that had been taken by an american soldier who drove a tank in patton 's army .
the manuscripts were dated from the 15th and 16th centuries and were traced back to st. anthony 's church in the town of hambach near aachen .
one of the most famous hoards of german antiquities and manuscripts are known as the quedlinburg treasure .
the church treasures were hidden in a mine during the waning weeks of world war ii and disappeared soon after us troops occupied the area .
in the 1980s objets d 'art started surfacing in a small texas town in the united states , stolen by an american soldier .
when he died , his relatives tried to sell the art work and the ensuing court case made headlines .
in the end , the german cultural foundation bought most of the works for $ 3 million .
in 2008 , german cultural institutions published a catalog of over 180,000 works of art that disappeared after the war. av / afp / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

usually they consisted of a helmet , or a flag , or maybe a knife .
but in the case of robert thomas , an 18-year-old soldier in george patton 's third army , his souvenirs turned out to be two legal manuscripts more than 400 years old .
as the tide of the war turned and allied bombing began to take its toll on german buildings and institutions , rare books and artworks were moved underground to caves or abandoned mines .
it was in an abandoned salt mine in the small town of merkers outside of frankfurt that the young infantryman stumbled on a room filled from floor to ceiling with thousands of books .
a different kind of souvenir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert thomas , left , handed the books over to the german ambassador thomas grabbed two of the books and took them home with him to the united states .
" i kept them in two boxes in the darkest coolest place at my house in order to preserve them .
they are pretty much in the same condition as i found them , " said the 83-year-old veteran .
it was the officials at the national archives who urged thomas to return them to the rightful owner .
" the books will go home now .
that 's the right thing to do , " said thomas as he handed over the manuscripts .
the oldest of the two books , one written in german and the other latin , was published in 1573 and deals with prussian statutes .
the other was published in 1593 and is a treatise on roman law .
the books were originally from the diocesan museum of paderborn and will be returned to the university of bonn library where they were before the war .
at a ceremony at the national archives in washington dc where thomas handed the books over to german ambassador klaus scharioth , the ambassador said that getting the books back was a stroke of luck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the books are legal treatises " we 're really lucky to get these books back , " said scharioth .
" the fact that these books are returned tells you a lot about our relationship today - it 's a sign of friendship and trust . "
other manuscripts found it is not the first time that german manuscripts have been returned .
in 1992 , a woman who had lived through auschwitz turned over seven medieval manuscripts that had been taken by an american soldier who drove a tank in patton 's army .
the manuscripts were dated from the 15th and 16th centuries and were traced back to st. anthony 's church in the town of hambach near aachen .
one of the most famous hoards of german antiquities and manuscripts are known as the quedlinburg treasure .
the church treasures were hidden in a mine during the waning weeks of world war ii and disappeared soon after us troops occupied the area .
in the 1980s objets d 'art started surfacing in a small texas town in the united states , stolen by an american soldier .
when he died , his relatives tried to sell the art work and the ensuing court case made headlines .
in the end , the german cultural foundation bought most of the works for $ 3 million .
in 2008 , german cultural institutions published a catalog of over 180,000 works of art that disappeared after the war. av / afp / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she was fired for helping herself to a meatball from a conference buffet at her workplace .
the case is to be heard in january . the 57-year-old secretary , identified in the german media as magdalene h , worked for the builders ' association in the state of north-rhine westphalia for more than three decades .
the incident took place last july when she organized a conference buffet for her boss and his guests and helped herself to two rolls and a frikadelle , a german meatball specialty , during the preparations .
boss insists firing was right thing german mass-selling newspaper bild reported on wednesday that magdalene h was confronted by her boss after a colleague noticed some food was missing .
but once she admitted to consuming the meatball , she was fired .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frikadellen are popular in germany " she believed her behavior was acceptable , " her lawyer , wolfgang pinkepank , told bild .
" bread and meatballs that are left over after conferences are allowed to be eaten by workers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de alternative energy -pipe- 07.10.2009 eu wants to boost green energy spending by 50 billion euros großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar power would receive the most money under the eu plan investment in clean energy technology should be boosted by 50 billion euros through 2020 in order for europe to meet its climate goals , according to a new report issued by the european commission on wednesday . currently , the european union and its member states spend about three billion euros a year on various forms of alternative and renewable energy but this sum is not sufficient , the report said .
annual spending should be raised to eight billion euros if europe is to meet its goal of cutting carbon emissions 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
" today we have a unique opportunity to change an energy model based on polluting , scarce and risky fossil fuels , into a clean , sustainable and less dependent one , " said andris piebalgs , the eu 's energy commissioner , at a press conference in brussels wednesday .
a roadmap for future energy research spending dubbed the strategic energy technology plan -lrb- set -rrb- , the commission 's report emphasized that additional investment to promote technologies such as solar and wind power was urgently needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind power could produce 20 percent of europe 's electricity by 2020 " locked-in investments , vested interests , as well as the high risks and need for significant investments in less profitable alternatives , mean that change will be slow without a major push , " the study said .
the commission report is a roadmap that will help set funding priorities within the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , and the member states .
coordinating research and development among the eu 's 27 member governments will be difficult , said energy economist claudia kemfert of berlin 's diw research institute .
" individual member countries have to decide how much they want to spend and what they spend it on , " kemfert told deutsche welle .
" there will be pressure for them to spend the money in their own countries . "
the bulk of the new funding would come from the private sector and member states . the eu 's european trading system for co2 credits and the european investment bank will also provide some financing .
solar and carbon capture the big winners solar power projects receive the most attention in the set study , with 16 billion euros of funding proposed for the next decade with the goal of producing 15 percent of the eu 's electricity from solar power by 2020 .
some of the solar research projects supported by the set roadmap include new ways to build photovoltaic cells more cheaply and quickly than today and for further research in the field of concentrated solar power , which uses the sun 's energy to create heat that powers turbines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report proposes 13 billion euros of funding for carbon storage technology " solar power has the greatest potential but also has the highest costs at the moment , " said kemfert .
" those costs will decline but it will take investment to do that . "
a german consortium known as desertec has proposed using concentrated solar power to build a network of power plants across the deserts of north africa and the middle east which would export much of their electricity to europe at a cost of approximately 400 billion euros by 2050 .
carbon capture and storage technologies , which inject carbon dioxide emitted by coal power plants into the ground rather than releasing the emissions into the atmosphere , would receive 13 billion euros in funding according to the eu roadmap , the second-highest sum in the report .
wind energy gets less additional research funds would also flow into research for biofuels , nuclear power , improving energy efficiency and building ' smart grid ' technology which will create a unified european electricity grid that can accommodate renewable forms of energy .
wind energy , which already provides a significant amount of electricity in germany and spain , would receive six billion euros of additional funding under the plan , which would enable wind power to supply 20 percent of the eu 's electricity needs by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing ' smart grid ' technology to ease power transmission is a key goal calling the funding proposal " a step in the right direction , " hermann albers , head of germany 's wind power federation was also critical of the commissions funding suggestions , noting that wind power already produced seven percent of germany 's electricity .
" the foreseen investments in wind energy are clearly too small in comparison to ccs and nuclear technology , " albers told deutsche welle .
" some rethinking on the eu level is urgently needed . "
new jobs and energy security in addition to helping europe meet its carbon reduction goals , the report emphasized that targeted investments in the renewable energy sector could stimulate the development of new industries and jobs and provide europe with an economic advantage in the decades ahead .
the additional 50 billion euros worth of spending could create as many as 600,000 new jobs , with the european renewable energy sector employing as many as 2.8 million people by 2020 , the study said .
europe 's energy security would also be improved by increasing the use of renewable fuels , the report said .
currently , 80 percent of european electricity production is derived from fossil fuels , much of which is imported from outside of the eu .

usually they consisted of a helmet , or a flag , or maybe a knife .
but in the case of robert thomas , an 18-year-old soldier in george patton 's third army , his souvenirs turned out to be two legal manuscripts more than 400 years old .
as the tide of the war turned and allied bombing began to take its toll on german buildings and institutions , rare books and artworks were moved underground to caves or abandoned mines .
it was in an abandoned salt mine in the small town of merkers outside of frankfurt that the young infantryman stumbled on a room filled from floor to ceiling with thousands of books .
a different kind of souvenir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert thomas , left , handed the books over to the german ambassador thomas grabbed two of the books and took them home with him to the united states .
" i kept them in two boxes in the darkest coolest place at my house in order to preserve them .
they are pretty much in the same condition as i found them , " said the 83-year-old veteran .
it was the officials at the national archives who urged thomas to return them to the rightful owner .
" the books will go home now .
that 's the right thing to do , " said thomas as he handed over the manuscripts .
the oldest of the two books , one written in german and the other latin , was published in 1573 and deals with prussian statutes .
the other was published in 1593 and is a treatise on roman law .
the books were originally from the diocesan museum of paderborn and will be returned to the university of bonn library where they were before the war .
at a ceremony at the national archives in washington dc where thomas handed the books over to german ambassador klaus scharioth , the ambassador said that getting the books back was a stroke of luck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the books are legal treatises " we 're really lucky to get these books back , " said scharioth .
" the fact that these books are returned tells you a lot about our relationship today - it 's a sign of friendship and trust . "
other manuscripts found it is not the first time that german manuscripts have been returned .
in 1992 , a woman who had lived through auschwitz turned over seven medieval manuscripts that had been taken by an american soldier who drove a tank in patton 's army .
the manuscripts were dated from the 15th and 16th centuries and were traced back to st. anthony 's church in the town of hambach near aachen .
one of the most famous hoards of german antiquities and manuscripts are known as the quedlinburg treasure .
the church treasures were hidden in a mine during the waning weeks of world war ii and disappeared soon after us troops occupied the area .
in the 1980s objets d 'art started surfacing in a small texas town in the united states , stolen by an american soldier .
when he died , his relatives tried to sell the art work and the ensuing court case made headlines .
in the end , the german cultural foundation bought most of the works for $ 3 million .
in 2008 , german cultural institutions published a catalog of over 180,000 works of art that disappeared after the war. av / afp / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

usually they consisted of a helmet , or a flag , or maybe a knife .
but in the case of robert thomas , an 18-year-old soldier in george patton 's third army , his souvenirs turned out to be two legal manuscripts more than 400 years old .
as the tide of the war turned and allied bombing began to take its toll on german buildings and institutions , rare books and artworks were moved underground to caves or abandoned mines .
it was in an abandoned salt mine in the small town of merkers outside of frankfurt that the young infantryman stumbled on a room filled from floor to ceiling with thousands of books .
a different kind of souvenir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert thomas , left , handed the books over to the german ambassador thomas grabbed two of the books and took them home with him to the united states .
" i kept them in two boxes in the darkest coolest place at my house in order to preserve them .
they are pretty much in the same condition as i found them , " said the 83-year-old veteran .
it was the officials at the national archives who urged thomas to return them to the rightful owner .
" the books will go home now .
that 's the right thing to do , " said thomas as he handed over the manuscripts .
the oldest of the two books , one written in german and the other latin , was published in 1573 and deals with prussian statutes .
the other was published in 1593 and is a treatise on roman law .
the books were originally from the diocesan museum of paderborn and will be returned to the university of bonn library where they were before the war .
at a ceremony at the national archives in washington dc where thomas handed the books over to german ambassador klaus scharioth , the ambassador said that getting the books back was a stroke of luck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the books are legal treatises " we 're really lucky to get these books back , " said scharioth .
" the fact that these books are returned tells you a lot about our relationship today - it 's a sign of friendship and trust . "
other manuscripts found it is not the first time that german manuscripts have been returned .
in 1992 , a woman who had lived through auschwitz turned over seven medieval manuscripts that had been taken by an american soldier who drove a tank in patton 's army .
the manuscripts were dated from the 15th and 16th centuries and were traced back to st. anthony 's church in the town of hambach near aachen .
one of the most famous hoards of german antiquities and manuscripts are known as the quedlinburg treasure .
the church treasures were hidden in a mine during the waning weeks of world war ii and disappeared soon after us troops occupied the area .
in the 1980s objets d 'art started surfacing in a small texas town in the united states , stolen by an american soldier .
when he died , his relatives tried to sell the art work and the ensuing court case made headlines .
in the end , the german cultural foundation bought most of the works for $ 3 million .

it took 40 years before the berlin wall fell and germany was reunited . sixty years ago , delegates gathered in the grand hall of the former aviation ministry in berlin as germans across the soviet occupied zone followed the events on the radio .
the reporter announced the events as " a piece of german history unfolding . "
a short time later wilhelm pieck declared the birth of the first " workers and peasants state on german soil . "
pieck became the first president of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , as east germany was officially known .
" based on the new constitution , the german democratic republic has been founded unanimously by all parties and organizations present in the german people 's council , " pieck said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilhelm pieck became the first president of east germany less than one month earlier , on september 15 , 1949 , konrad adenauer had been elected as first chancellor of west germany .
in the eyes of the communists in east germany and moscow , adenauer was the " chancellor of western imperialism , " portrayed as the enemy of the people .
one day later , the soviet leadership in moscow sent a delegation of german communist exiles to berlin to implement a socialist alternative to the west .
a division of europe unfolds the creation of two separate german states confirmed what many had expected in the aftermath of world war ii .
the border between east and west germany was not yet fortified with barbed wire – but already it marked the division not only of germany but of europe as a whole .
the two states on both sides of the new border became satellites of their respective allied occupiers .
the soviet dictator josef stalin had a clear agenda in mind .
with the creation of east germany , he pushed the political and military influence of the soviet union well into the heart of europe .
stalin described the new communist state as " the creation of a peace loving , democratic germany alongside the peaceful soviet union . "
according to stalin , the new state would prevent both new wars and the " enslavement of european countries by the western imperialists . "
the " better " german state in west germany , economic progress and political stability soon helped people to get over the woes of the post-war hardship .
but east german leaders wanted more than just material prosperity .
they wanted a fresh ideological start after the catastrophe of nazi germany .
bildunterschrift : the birth of east germany was celebrated with parades in berlin many of the citizens ' of the new eastern state agreed with that concept .
for them , socialism seemed like the proper answer to fascism , war and the holocaust .
walter ulbricht , who became a top communist party official , said the crucial issue was " the struggle against fascist ideology and against other reactionary ideologies that work against the interests of the working class and against progress and development in germany . "
ulbricht later said that " there will be a day when the sed -lrb- east germany 's communist party -rrb- will be the leading party of all of germany – because the majority of germans will want it that way . "
but as enthusiastic as the first reactions were – the dramatic loss of faith in the political leadership installed by moscow came very soon .
an experiment gone wrong the gdr seemed doomed from the very beginning .
the vision that one day its party would lead all of germany was soon turned to be on its head .
in 1989 , peaceful revolution toppled the communist regime .
in the end it was the people of the gdr that wanted the political system of the west and not vice versa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the 40th anniversary was celebrated in 1989 , the end of the regime was only weeks away yet in october 1989 the communist leadership seemed to be in denial that the end was near .
they staged an elaborate celebration to mark the then 40th anniversary of east germany .
yet at that time east germans were already out on the streets demonstrating for change – and thousands had already fled the " workers ' and peasants ' paradise " via hungary to west germany .
in a few weeks from then , on november 9 , 1989 , the berlin wall came down to dramatically mark the collapse of east germany .
after 40 years of gdr , the dream of the allegedly " better " version of germany burst with a momentum so powerful that the citizens of the communist east had lost all faith and interest to change their state and have it survive into a new era .

annual spending should be raised to eight billion euros if europe is to meet its goal of cutting carbon emissions 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
" today we have a unique opportunity to change an energy model based on polluting , scarce and risky fossil fuels , into a clean , sustainable and less dependent one , " said andris piebalgs , the eu 's energy commissioner , at a press conference in brussels wednesday .
a roadmap for future energy research spending dubbed the strategic energy technology plan -lrb- set -rrb- , the commission 's report emphasized that additional investment to promote technologies such as solar and wind power was urgently needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind power could produce 20 percent of europe 's electricity by 2020 " locked-in investments , vested interests , as well as the high risks and need for significant investments in less profitable alternatives , mean that change will be slow without a major push , " the study said .
the commission report is a roadmap that will help set funding priorities within the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , and the member states .
coordinating research and development among the eu 's 27 member governments will be difficult , said energy economist claudia kemfert of berlin 's diw research institute .
" individual member countries have to decide how much they want to spend and what they spend it on , " kemfert told deutsche welle .
" there will be pressure for them to spend the money in their own countries . "
the bulk of the new funding would come from the private sector and member states . the eu 's european trading system for co2 credits and the european investment bank will also provide some financing .
solar and carbon capture the big winners solar power projects receive the most attention in the set study , with 16 billion euros of funding proposed for the next decade with the goal of producing 15 percent of the eu 's electricity from solar power by 2020 .
some of the solar research projects supported by the set roadmap include new ways to build photovoltaic cells more cheaply and quickly than today and for further research in the field of concentrated solar power , which uses the sun 's energy to create heat that powers turbines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report proposes 13 billion euros of funding for carbon storage technology " solar power has the greatest potential but also has the highest costs at the moment , " said kemfert .
" those costs will decline but it will take investment to do that . "
a german consortium known as desertec has proposed using concentrated solar power to build a network of power plants across the deserts of north africa and the middle east which would export much of their electricity to europe at a cost of approximately 400 billion euros by 2050 .
carbon capture and storage technologies , which inject carbon dioxide emitted by coal power plants into the ground rather than releasing the emissions into the atmosphere , would receive 13 billion euros in funding according to the eu roadmap , the second-highest sum in the report .
wind energy gets less additional research funds would also flow into research for biofuels , nuclear power , improving energy efficiency and building ' smart grid ' technology which will create a unified european electricity grid that can accommodate renewable forms of energy .
wind energy , which already provides a significant amount of electricity in germany and spain , would receive six billion euros of additional funding under the plan , which would enable wind power to supply 20 percent of the eu 's electricity needs by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing ' smart grid ' technology to ease power transmission is a key goal calling the funding proposal " a step in the right direction , " hermann albers , head of germany 's wind power federation was also critical of the commissions funding suggestions , noting that wind power already produced seven percent of germany 's electricity .
" the foreseen investments in wind energy are clearly too small in comparison to ccs and nuclear technology , " albers told deutsche welle .
" some rethinking on the eu level is urgently needed . "
new jobs and energy security in addition to helping europe meet its carbon reduction goals , the report emphasized that targeted investments in the renewable energy sector could stimulate the development of new industries and jobs and provide europe with an economic advantage in the decades ahead .
the additional 50 billion euros worth of spending could create as many as 600,000 new jobs , with the european renewable energy sector employing as many as 2.8 million people by 2020 , the study said .
europe 's energy security would also be improved by increasing the use of renewable fuels , the report said .
currently , 80 percent of european electricity production is derived from fossil fuels , much of which is imported from outside of the eu .

a german consortium known as desertec has proposed using concentrated solar power to build a network of power plants across the deserts of north africa and the middle east which would export much of their electricity to europe at a cost of approximately 400 billion euros by 2050 .
carbon capture and storage technologies , which inject carbon dioxide emitted by coal power plants into the ground rather than releasing the emissions into the atmosphere , would receive 13 billion euros in funding according to the eu roadmap , the second-highest sum in the report .
wind energy gets less additional research funds would also flow into research for biofuels , nuclear power , improving energy efficiency and building ' smart grid ' technology which will create a unified european electricity grid that can accommodate renewable forms of energy .
wind energy , which already provides a significant amount of electricity in germany and spain , would receive six billion euros of additional funding under the plan , which would enable wind power to supply 20 percent of the eu 's electricity needs by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing ' smart grid ' technology to ease power transmission is a key goal calling the funding proposal " a step in the right direction , " hermann albers , head of germany 's wind power federation was also critical of the commissions funding suggestions , noting that wind power already produced seven percent of germany 's electricity .
" the foreseen investments in wind energy are clearly too small in comparison to ccs and nuclear technology , " albers told deutsche welle .
" some rethinking on the eu level is urgently needed . "
new jobs and energy security in addition to helping europe meet its carbon reduction goals , the report emphasized that targeted investments in the renewable energy sector could stimulate the development of new industries and jobs and provide europe with an economic advantage in the decades ahead .
the additional 50 billion euros worth of spending could create as many as 600,000 new jobs , with the european renewable energy sector employing as many as 2.8 million people by 2020 , the study said .
europe 's energy security would also be improved by increasing the use of renewable fuels , the report said .
currently , 80 percent of european electricity production is derived from fossil fuels , much of which is imported from outside of the eu .

he is an outspoken man who likes to use direct and colorful language , especially when comparing the cost of bank bailouts with the amount of aid paid to help the world 's poorest nations weather the economic storm .
" in one night we passed $ 700 billion to the banks , " stiglitz says .
" global foreign aid has really been $ 60-70 billion a year .
so in one hour we passed all the foreign aid of all the developed countries to all the developing countries for a decade . "
" and you ask : who is more needy ?
the american banker or developing countries ?
it 's hard not to come up with the conclusion that our values got destroyed . "
new philosophy for imf lending although the columbia university professor says the international monetary fund has done a good job of managing the crisis so far .
he still urges the imf to rethink its lending policies .
in the past , stiglitz says , imf-credits often had damaging side-effects for the recipients .
the loans were usually tied to drastic reform programs that sent the economies of many borrowers into a downward spiral .
stiglitz warns that if the imf wants to become a global insurer against economic disruption , as the funds 's director dominique strauss-kahn claims , then it needs to take a new approach to dealing with the needs of poor countries .
" when you have a crisis and the doctor comes in and says : ' by the way , if you want the medicine you have to do a , b , c and d ' and you say ' i do n't want to do a , b , c and d ' - you are not getting medicine , then it does n't serve the function of insurance , " stiglitz points out .
global finance sector needs taxation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the imf is working hard to prevent another financial crisis financial markets should also be subject of new taxes designed to discourage ' dysfunctional ' trading and help pay for the damage the global crisis has inflicted on poorer countries , stiglitz says .
imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn recently announced that the washington-based organization is already studying ways to tax the financial industry at the request of group of 20 leaders .
such a global financial-transaction tax would only be fair , the stiglitz argues , and it would not be without precedent .
" in environmental economics we have a principle called ' polluter pay ' .
if you cause pollution you have to pay for the clean-up .
the financial sector polluted the global economy with toxic assets and now they ought to clean up that , " the nobel prize-winning economist says .
excessive risk-taking by the banking sector has imposed huge costs on the rest of the society , including workers , developing nations , house-holders and tax-payers , he explains .
a global tax on financial market transactions is therefore not just a question of equity , but a question of efficiency .
stiglitz stresses that such a tax would also help shrink a ' bloated ' financial industry in the united states , arguing that statistics showing that the finance sector accounted for 40 percent of us corporate profits before the crisis were a clear signal that “ something 's wrong . ”
tax revenues could be used for poor countries stiglitz says the money raised by the proposed tax could be used to help poor countries , which were by no means responsible for the financial crisis , but are nevertheless suffering its worst consequences .
according to estimates by the development committee of the world bank and the international monetary fund , another 90 million people around the world are at risk of being driven into extreme poverty by the end of 2010 .

so in one hour we passed all the foreign aid of all the developed countries to all the developing countries for a decade . "
" and you ask : who is more needy ?
the american banker or developing countries ?
it 's hard not to come up with the conclusion that our values got destroyed . "
new philosophy for imf lending although the columbia university professor says the international monetary fund has done a good job of managing the crisis so far .
he still urges the imf to rethink its lending policies .
in the past , stiglitz says , imf-credits often had damaging side-effects for the recipients .
the loans were usually tied to drastic reform programs that sent the economies of many borrowers into a downward spiral .
stiglitz warns that if the imf wants to become a global insurer against economic disruption , as the funds 's director dominique strauss-kahn claims , then it needs to take a new approach to dealing with the needs of poor countries .
" when you have a crisis and the doctor comes in and says : ' by the way , if you want the medicine you have to do a , b , c and d ' and you say ' i do n't want to do a , b , c and d ' - you are not getting medicine , then it does n't serve the function of insurance , " stiglitz points out .
global finance sector needs taxation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the imf is working hard to prevent another financial crisis financial markets should also be subject of new taxes designed to discourage ' dysfunctional ' trading and help pay for the damage the global crisis has inflicted on poorer countries , stiglitz says .
imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn recently announced that the washington-based organization is already studying ways to tax the financial industry at the request of group of 20 leaders .
such a global financial-transaction tax would only be fair , the stiglitz argues , and it would not be without precedent .
" in environmental economics we have a principle called ' polluter pay ' .
if you cause pollution you have to pay for the clean-up .
the financial sector polluted the global economy with toxic assets and now they ought to clean up that , " the nobel prize-winning economist says .
excessive risk-taking by the banking sector has imposed huge costs on the rest of the society , including workers , developing nations , house-holders and tax-payers , he explains .
a global tax on financial market transactions is therefore not just a question of equity , but a question of efficiency .
stiglitz stresses that such a tax would also help shrink a ' bloated ' financial industry in the united states , arguing that statistics showing that the finance sector accounted for 40 percent of us corporate profits before the crisis were a clear signal that “ something 's wrong . ”
tax revenues could be used for poor countries stiglitz says the money raised by the proposed tax could be used to help poor countries , which were by no means responsible for the financial crisis , but are nevertheless suffering its worst consequences .
according to estimates by the development committee of the world bank and the international monetary fund , another 90 million people around the world are at risk of being driven into extreme poverty by the end of 2010 .

the nobel jury said they were honored for their studies on how ribosomes function , a breakthrough that has been vital in the development of new antibiotics .
the nobel committee cited the work of the trio as " directly assisting the saving of lives and decreasing humanity 's suffering . "
" many of today 's antibiotics cure various diseases by blocking the function of bacterial ribosomes .
without functional ribosomes , bacteria can not survive .
this is why ribosomes are such an important target for new antibiotics . "
research crucial to developing new drugs the three scientists have generated three-dimensional models to illustrating the ribosomes ' individual atomic structure .
these models are now used in the quest for new antibiotics .
about half the current antibiotics in use block the function of bacterial ribosomes , but there is a growing problem of bacterial strains that are resistant to drugs , the committee said on wednesday .
the three will share the 10 million swedish crowns -lrb- 1 million euros , $ 1.42 million -rrb- prize .
steitz , a professor for molecular biophysics at yale university , told reporters he was about to go to the gym when he received the phone call from stockholm .
" my caller from stockholm said i should n't go to the gym .
there would be phone calls , " the scientist told swedish radio .
ramakrishnan works at the mrc laboratory of molecular biology at cambridge university .
yonath , who works at the department of structural biology at the weizmann institute of science in israel , said she did not expect the prize about a discovery made almost a decade ago .
the nobel prizes are handed out annually for achievements in science , literature , economics and peace .
the prize in chemistry was this year 's third , following awards for medicine on monday and physics on tuesday. ai / reuters / dpa / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but as it parades in the limelight , the young democracy can not hide its many troubles . for years , the czech republic was hailed as the wunderkind of the former east bloc countries , the shining economic example and leader of the pack .
in record time , it appeared to have shed its past to become a fully-fledged member of the western world .
but now , 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall , much of the glitter has fallen off europe 's brightest new star , and it has become tangled up in a mess of domestic political infighting and an apparent inability to decide what it wants and where it wants to stand on the international stage .
so what went wrong ?
petr kratochvil , deputy director of the prague institute of international relations , said it all started after the country had secured the two things it knew it wanted : nato and eu membership .
" there were two phases after 1989 , " kratochvil told deutsche welle .
" the first was the transition from the communist past to the establishment of a democratic system . "
behind that clear aim , he says , the nation and its politicians did willingly unite .
but once it had been achieved , the new democracy did n't know what to do next .
struggling for unity and , kratochvil says , the czech republic has not yet come up with an answer .
" there has been no unity across the political spectrum ever since , " he said , adding that on the whole politicians are more concerned with petty arguments and scoring points than with the country itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan fischer earlier this year , the animosity led to a vote of no confidence for the government .
since then the country has been in the hands of a caretaker government under the leadership of a bureaucrat , jan fischer , the former head of the national statistics office .
he took on the interim post promising that his would not be a government of vision , but one of hard work .
" i really hope that we 'll be able to do something for our country , " fischer said at the time of his appointment .
" we will lead the czech republic into new elections and we 'll do this quietly and with respect for all of our international obligations . "
however , that is not the way things have gone .
a snap election was planned for november .
but in what may have been classic czech political style , the social democrats , whose backing was necessary for the vote to take place , suddenly backed out , leaving the poll scheduled for june 2010 .
a history of change political scientist jiri pehe , director of new york university in prague , says such instability is partially a consequence of having been subjected to an ever-changing political elite .
" we have never had time to develop a robust political culture based on self-confidence , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have an institutional democracy which was built at tremendous speed , " he said , adding that democratic values such as respect for minorities and tolerance of other people have developed at a much slower pace .
" we do n't have democracy as a culture . "
and that , he says , is the trouble with people like president vaclav klaus and the 17 senators who are holding both their country and europe hostage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of czechs want to be part of europe , but klaus does n't " deep down , they are not democrats , " pehe said .
" they feel they have the absolute truth and do n't care whether or not 500 million people agree with it . "
motivated by self-importance pehe believes the president 's reluctance to add his name to the controversial lisbon treaty is rooted in the national conviction " that the czechs have something intellectually unique to offer europe , something so unique it is worth fighting for . "
but it is that notion of national self-importance - coupled with a worry that no matter what the czech republic does , big international decisions will ultimately be made by major powers - which is getting in the way of the country 's future .
" the idea that the country can not contribute so it is not worth trying to , limits the capacity of politicians to act , " pehe said .
some commentators have said vaclav klaus is thoroughly enjoying the attention he is getting from holding out on europe , but pehe says it has swayed public opinion against him .
so perhaps it is , as jan fischer told eu leaders in brussels on wednesday , really just a matter of time before the czech republic ratifies the treaty and thereby makes a clear statement on at least one outstanding issue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de alternative energy -pipe- 07.10.2009 eu wants to boost green energy spending by 50 billion euros großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar power would receive the most money under the eu plan investment in clean energy technology should be boosted by 50 billion euros through 2020 in order for europe to meet its climate goals , according to a new report issued by the european commission on wednesday . currently , the european union and its member states spend about three billion euros a year on various forms of alternative and renewable energy but this sum is not sufficient , the report said .
annual spending should be raised to eight billion euros if europe is to meet its goal of cutting carbon emissions 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
" today we have a unique opportunity to change an energy model based on polluting , scarce and risky fossil fuels , into a clean , sustainable and less dependent one , " said andris piebalgs , the eu 's energy commissioner , at a press conference in brussels wednesday .
a roadmap for future energy research spending dubbed the strategic energy technology plan -lrb- set -rrb- , the commission 's report emphasized that additional investment to promote technologies such as solar and wind power was urgently needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind power could produce 20 percent of europe 's electricity by 2020 " locked-in investments , vested interests , as well as the high risks and need for significant investments in less profitable alternatives , mean that change will be slow without a major push , " the study said .
the commission report is a roadmap that will help set funding priorities within the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , and the member states .
coordinating research and development among the eu 's 27 member governments will be difficult , said energy economist claudia kemfert of berlin 's diw research institute .
" individual member countries have to decide how much they want to spend and what they spend it on , " kemfert told deutsche welle .
" there will be pressure for them to spend the money in their own countries . "
the bulk of the new funding would come from the private sector and member states . the eu 's european trading system for co2 credits and the european investment bank will also provide some financing .
solar and carbon capture the big winners solar power projects receive the most attention in the set study , with 16 billion euros of funding proposed for the next decade with the goal of producing 15 percent of the eu 's electricity from solar power by 2020 .
some of the solar research projects supported by the set roadmap include new ways to build photovoltaic cells more cheaply and quickly than today and for further research in the field of concentrated solar power , which uses the sun 's energy to create heat that powers turbines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report proposes 13 billion euros of funding for carbon storage technology " solar power has the greatest potential but also has the highest costs at the moment , " said kemfert .
" those costs will decline but it will take investment to do that . "
a german consortium known as desertec has proposed using concentrated solar power to build a network of power plants across the deserts of north africa and the middle east which would export much of their electricity to europe at a cost of approximately 400 billion euros by 2050 .
carbon capture and storage technologies , which inject carbon dioxide emitted by coal power plants into the ground rather than releasing the emissions into the atmosphere , would receive 13 billion euros in funding according to the eu roadmap , the second-highest sum in the report .
wind energy gets less additional research funds would also flow into research for biofuels , nuclear power , improving energy efficiency and building ' smart grid ' technology which will create a unified european electricity grid that can accommodate renewable forms of energy .
wind energy , which already provides a significant amount of electricity in germany and spain , would receive six billion euros of additional funding under the plan , which would enable wind power to supply 20 percent of the eu 's electricity needs by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing ' smart grid ' technology to ease power transmission is a key goal calling the funding proposal " a step in the right direction , " hermann albers , head of germany 's wind power federation was also critical of the commissions funding suggestions , noting that wind power already produced seven percent of germany 's electricity .
" the foreseen investments in wind energy are clearly too small in comparison to ccs and nuclear technology , " albers told deutsche welle .
" some rethinking on the eu level is urgently needed . "
new jobs and energy security in addition to helping europe meet its carbon reduction goals , the report emphasized that targeted investments in the renewable energy sector could stimulate the development of new industries and jobs and provide europe with an economic advantage in the decades ahead .
the additional 50 billion euros worth of spending could create as many as 600,000 new jobs , with the european renewable energy sector employing as many as 2.8 million people by 2020 , the study said .
europe 's energy security would also be improved by increasing the use of renewable fuels , the report said .
currently , 80 percent of european electricity production is derived from fossil fuels , much of which is imported from outside of the eu .

but as it parades in the limelight , the young democracy can not hide its many troubles . for years , the czech republic was hailed as the wunderkind of the former east bloc countries , the shining economic example and leader of the pack .
in record time , it appeared to have shed its past to become a fully-fledged member of the western world .
but now , 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall , much of the glitter has fallen off europe 's brightest new star , and it has become tangled up in a mess of domestic political infighting and an apparent inability to decide what it wants and where it wants to stand on the international stage .
so what went wrong ?
petr kratochvil , deputy director of the prague institute of international relations , said it all started after the country had secured the two things it knew it wanted : nato and eu membership .
" there were two phases after 1989 , " kratochvil told deutsche welle .
" the first was the transition from the communist past to the establishment of a democratic system . "
behind that clear aim , he says , the nation and its politicians did willingly unite .
but once it had been achieved , the new democracy did n't know what to do next .
struggling for unity and , kratochvil says , the czech republic has not yet come up with an answer .

" i really hope that we 'll be able to do something for our country , " fischer said at the time of his appointment .
" we will lead the czech republic into new elections and we 'll do this quietly and with respect for all of our international obligations . "
however , that is not the way things have gone .
a snap election was planned for november .
but in what may have been classic czech political style , the social democrats , whose backing was necessary for the vote to take place , suddenly backed out , leaving the poll scheduled for june 2010 .
a history of change political scientist jiri pehe , director of new york university in prague , says such instability is partially a consequence of having been subjected to an ever-changing political elite .
" we have never had time to develop a robust political culture based on self-confidence , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have an institutional democracy which was built at tremendous speed , " he said , adding that democratic values such as respect for minorities and tolerance of other people have developed at a much slower pace .
" we do n't have democracy as a culture . "

motivated by self-importance pehe believes the president 's reluctance to add his name to the controversial lisbon treaty is rooted in the national conviction " that the czechs have something intellectually unique to offer europe , something so unique it is worth fighting for . "

" the idea that the country can not contribute so it is not worth trying to , limits the capacity of politicians to act , " pehe said .
some commentators have said vaclav klaus is thoroughly enjoying the attention he is getting from holding out on europe , but pehe says it has swayed public opinion against him .
so perhaps it is , as jan fischer told eu leaders in brussels on wednesday , really just a matter of time before the czech republic ratifies the treaty and thereby makes a clear statement on at least one outstanding issue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 07.10.2009 stiglitz urges financial powers to rethink their values großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph stiglitz says the international monetary fund needs a new philosophy a tax on financial institutions is needed to improve the efficiency of the global economy and provide aid to developing countries , says joseph stiglitz , a former world bank chief economist and nobel prize winner . joseph stiglitz is one of the harshest critics of the banking industry 's rush to return to " business as usual " in the wake of the financial crisis .
he is an outspoken man who likes to use direct and colorful language , especially when comparing the cost of bank bailouts with the amount of aid paid to help the world 's poorest nations weather the economic storm .
" in one night we passed $ 700 billion to the banks , " stiglitz says .
" global foreign aid has really been $ 60-70 billion a year .
so in one hour we passed all the foreign aid of all the developed countries to all the developing countries for a decade . "
" and you ask : who is more needy ?
the american banker or developing countries ?
it 's hard not to come up with the conclusion that our values got destroyed . "
new philosophy for imf lending although the columbia university professor says the international monetary fund has done a good job of managing the crisis so far .
he still urges the imf to rethink its lending policies .
in the past , stiglitz says , imf-credits often had damaging side-effects for the recipients .
the loans were usually tied to drastic reform programs that sent the economies of many borrowers into a downward spiral .
stiglitz warns that if the imf wants to become a global insurer against economic disruption , as the funds 's director dominique strauss-kahn claims , then it needs to take a new approach to dealing with the needs of poor countries .
" when you have a crisis and the doctor comes in and says : ' by the way , if you want the medicine you have to do a , b , c and d ' and you say ' i do n't want to do a , b , c and d ' - you are not getting medicine , then it does n't serve the function of insurance , " stiglitz points out .
global finance sector needs taxation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the imf is working hard to prevent another financial crisis financial markets should also be subject of new taxes designed to discourage ' dysfunctional ' trading and help pay for the damage the global crisis has inflicted on poorer countries , stiglitz says .
imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn recently announced that the washington-based organization is already studying ways to tax the financial industry at the request of group of 20 leaders .
such a global financial-transaction tax would only be fair , the stiglitz argues , and it would not be without precedent .
" in environmental economics we have a principle called ' polluter pay ' .
if you cause pollution you have to pay for the clean-up .
the financial sector polluted the global economy with toxic assets and now they ought to clean up that , " the nobel prize-winning economist says .
excessive risk-taking by the banking sector has imposed huge costs on the rest of the society , including workers , developing nations , house-holders and tax-payers , he explains .
a global tax on financial market transactions is therefore not just a question of equity , but a question of efficiency .
stiglitz stresses that such a tax would also help shrink a ' bloated ' financial industry in the united states , arguing that statistics showing that the finance sector accounted for 40 percent of us corporate profits before the crisis were a clear signal that “ something 's wrong . ”
tax revenues could be used for poor countries stiglitz says the money raised by the proposed tax could be used to help poor countries , which were by no means responsible for the financial crisis , but are nevertheless suffering its worst consequences .
according to estimates by the development committee of the world bank and the international monetary fund , another 90 million people around the world are at risk of being driven into extreme poverty by the end of 2010 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de alternative energy -pipe- 07.10.2009 eu wants to boost green energy spending by 50 billion euros großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar power would receive the most money under the eu plan investment in clean energy technology should be boosted by 50 billion euros through 2020 in order for europe to meet its climate goals , according to a new report issued by the european commission on wednesday . currently , the european union and its member states spend about three billion euros a year on various forms of alternative and renewable energy but this sum is not sufficient , the report said .
annual spending should be raised to eight billion euros if europe is to meet its goal of cutting carbon emissions 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
" today we have a unique opportunity to change an energy model based on polluting , scarce and risky fossil fuels , into a clean , sustainable and less dependent one , " said andris piebalgs , the eu 's energy commissioner , at a press conference in brussels wednesday .
a roadmap for future energy research spending dubbed the strategic energy technology plan -lrb- set -rrb- , the commission 's report emphasized that additional investment to promote technologies such as solar and wind power was urgently needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind power could produce 20 percent of europe 's electricity by 2020 " locked-in investments , vested interests , as well as the high risks and need for significant investments in less profitable alternatives , mean that change will be slow without a major push , " the study said .
the commission report is a roadmap that will help set funding priorities within the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , and the member states .
coordinating research and development among the eu 's 27 member governments will be difficult , said energy economist claudia kemfert of berlin 's diw research institute .
" individual member countries have to decide how much they want to spend and what they spend it on , " kemfert told deutsche welle .
" there will be pressure for them to spend the money in their own countries . "
the bulk of the new funding would come from the private sector and member states . the eu 's european trading system for co2 credits and the european investment bank will also provide some financing .
solar and carbon capture the big winners solar power projects receive the most attention in the set study , with 16 billion euros of funding proposed for the next decade with the goal of producing 15 percent of the eu 's electricity from solar power by 2020 .
some of the solar research projects supported by the set roadmap include new ways to build photovoltaic cells more cheaply and quickly than today and for further research in the field of concentrated solar power , which uses the sun 's energy to create heat that powers turbines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report proposes 13 billion euros of funding for carbon storage technology " solar power has the greatest potential but also has the highest costs at the moment , " said kemfert .
" those costs will decline but it will take investment to do that . "
a german consortium known as desertec has proposed using concentrated solar power to build a network of power plants across the deserts of north africa and the middle east which would export much of their electricity to europe at a cost of approximately 400 billion euros by 2050 .
carbon capture and storage technologies , which inject carbon dioxide emitted by coal power plants into the ground rather than releasing the emissions into the atmosphere , would receive 13 billion euros in funding according to the eu roadmap , the second-highest sum in the report .
wind energy gets less additional research funds would also flow into research for biofuels , nuclear power , improving energy efficiency and building ' smart grid ' technology which will create a unified european electricity grid that can accommodate renewable forms of energy .
wind energy , which already provides a significant amount of electricity in germany and spain , would receive six billion euros of additional funding under the plan , which would enable wind power to supply 20 percent of the eu 's electricity needs by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing ' smart grid ' technology to ease power transmission is a key goal calling the funding proposal " a step in the right direction , " hermann albers , head of germany 's wind power federation was also critical of the commissions funding suggestions , noting that wind power already produced seven percent of germany 's electricity .
" the foreseen investments in wind energy are clearly too small in comparison to ccs and nuclear technology , " albers told deutsche welle .
" some rethinking on the eu level is urgently needed . "
new jobs and energy security in addition to helping europe meet its carbon reduction goals , the report emphasized that targeted investments in the renewable energy sector could stimulate the development of new industries and jobs and provide europe with an economic advantage in the decades ahead .
the additional 50 billion euros worth of spending could create as many as 600,000 new jobs , with the european renewable energy sector employing as many as 2.8 million people by 2020 , the study said .
europe 's energy security would also be improved by increasing the use of renewable fuels , the report said .
currently , 80 percent of european electricity production is derived from fossil fuels , much of which is imported from outside of the eu .

annual spending should be raised to eight billion euros if europe is to meet its goal of cutting carbon emissions 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
" today we have a unique opportunity to change an energy model based on polluting , scarce and risky fossil fuels , into a clean , sustainable and less dependent one , " said andris piebalgs , the eu 's energy commissioner , at a press conference in brussels wednesday .
a roadmap for future energy research spending dubbed the strategic energy technology plan -lrb- set -rrb- , the commission 's report emphasized that additional investment to promote technologies such as solar and wind power was urgently needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind power could produce 20 percent of europe 's electricity by 2020 " locked-in investments , vested interests , as well as the high risks and need for significant investments in less profitable alternatives , mean that change will be slow without a major push , " the study said .
the commission report is a roadmap that will help set funding priorities within the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , and the member states .
coordinating research and development among the eu 's 27 member governments will be difficult , said energy economist claudia kemfert of berlin 's diw research institute .
" individual member countries have to decide how much they want to spend and what they spend it on , " kemfert told deutsche welle .
" there will be pressure for them to spend the money in their own countries . "
the bulk of the new funding would come from the private sector and member states . the eu 's european trading system for co2 credits and the european investment bank will also provide some financing .
solar and carbon capture the big winners solar power projects receive the most attention in the set study , with 16 billion euros of funding proposed for the next decade with the goal of producing 15 percent of the eu 's electricity from solar power by 2020 .
some of the solar research projects supported by the set roadmap include new ways to build photovoltaic cells more cheaply and quickly than today and for further research in the field of concentrated solar power , which uses the sun 's energy to create heat that powers turbines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report proposes 13 billion euros of funding for carbon storage technology " solar power has the greatest potential but also has the highest costs at the moment , " said kemfert .
" those costs will decline but it will take investment to do that . "
a german consortium known as desertec has proposed using concentrated solar power to build a network of power plants across the deserts of north africa and the middle east which would export much of their electricity to europe at a cost of approximately 400 billion euros by 2050 .
carbon capture and storage technologies , which inject carbon dioxide emitted by coal power plants into the ground rather than releasing the emissions into the atmosphere , would receive 13 billion euros in funding according to the eu roadmap , the second-highest sum in the report .
wind energy gets less additional research funds would also flow into research for biofuels , nuclear power , improving energy efficiency and building ' smart grid ' technology which will create a unified european electricity grid that can accommodate renewable forms of energy .
wind energy , which already provides a significant amount of electricity in germany and spain , would receive six billion euros of additional funding under the plan , which would enable wind power to supply 20 percent of the eu 's electricity needs by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing ' smart grid ' technology to ease power transmission is a key goal calling the funding proposal " a step in the right direction , " hermann albers , head of germany 's wind power federation was also critical of the commissions funding suggestions , noting that wind power already produced seven percent of germany 's electricity .
" the foreseen investments in wind energy are clearly too small in comparison to ccs and nuclear technology , " albers told deutsche welle .
" some rethinking on the eu level is urgently needed . "
new jobs and energy security in addition to helping europe meet its carbon reduction goals , the report emphasized that targeted investments in the renewable energy sector could stimulate the development of new industries and jobs and provide europe with an economic advantage in the decades ahead .
the additional 50 billion euros worth of spending could create as many as 600,000 new jobs , with the european renewable energy sector employing as many as 2.8 million people by 2020 , the study said .
europe 's energy security would also be improved by increasing the use of renewable fuels , the report said .
currently , 80 percent of european electricity production is derived from fossil fuels , much of which is imported from outside of the eu .

the nobel jury said they were honored for their studies on how ribosomes function , a breakthrough that has been vital in the development of new antibiotics .
the nobel committee cited the work of the trio as " directly assisting the saving of lives and decreasing humanity 's suffering . "
" many of today 's antibiotics cure various diseases by blocking the function of bacterial ribosomes .
without functional ribosomes , bacteria can not survive .
this is why ribosomes are such an important target for new antibiotics . "
research crucial to developing new drugs the three scientists have generated three-dimensional models to illustrating the ribosomes ' individual atomic structure .
these models are now used in the quest for new antibiotics .
about half the current antibiotics in use block the function of bacterial ribosomes , but there is a growing problem of bacterial strains that are resistant to drugs , the committee said on wednesday .
the three will share the 10 million swedish crowns -lrb- 1 million euros , $ 1.42 million -rrb- prize .
steitz , a professor for molecular biophysics at yale university , told reporters he was about to go to the gym when he received the phone call from stockholm .
" my caller from stockholm said i should n't go to the gym .
there would be phone calls , " the scientist told swedish radio .
ramakrishnan works at the mrc laboratory of molecular biology at cambridge university .
yonath , who works at the department of structural biology at the weizmann institute of science in israel , said she did not expect the prize about a discovery made almost a decade ago .
the nobel prizes are handed out annually for achievements in science , literature , economics and peace .
the prize in chemistry was this year 's third , following awards for medicine on monday and physics on tuesday. ai / reuters / dpa / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

usually they consisted of a helmet , or a flag , or maybe a knife .
but in the case of robert thomas , an 18-year-old soldier in george patton 's third army , his souvenirs turned out to be two legal manuscripts more than 400 years old .
as the tide of the war turned and allied bombing began to take its toll on german buildings and institutions , rare books and artworks were moved underground to caves or abandoned mines .
it was in an abandoned salt mine in the small town of merkers outside of frankfurt that the young infantryman stumbled on a room filled from floor to ceiling with thousands of books .
a different kind of souvenir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert thomas , left , handed the books over to the german ambassador thomas grabbed two of the books and took them home with him to the united states .
" i kept them in two boxes in the darkest coolest place at my house in order to preserve them .
they are pretty much in the same condition as i found them , " said the 83-year-old veteran .
it was the officials at the national archives who urged thomas to return them to the rightful owner .
" the books will go home now .
that 's the right thing to do , " said thomas as he handed over the manuscripts .
the oldest of the two books , one written in german and the other latin , was published in 1573 and deals with prussian statutes .
the other was published in 1593 and is a treatise on roman law .
the books were originally from the diocesan museum of paderborn and will be returned to the university of bonn library where they were before the war .
at a ceremony at the national archives in washington dc where thomas handed the books over to german ambassador klaus scharioth , the ambassador said that getting the books back was a stroke of luck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the books are legal treatises " we 're really lucky to get these books back , " said scharioth .
" the fact that these books are returned tells you a lot about our relationship today - it 's a sign of friendship and trust . "
other manuscripts found it is not the first time that german manuscripts have been returned .
in 1992 , a woman who had lived through auschwitz turned over seven medieval manuscripts that had been taken by an american soldier who drove a tank in patton 's army .
the manuscripts were dated from the 15th and 16th centuries and were traced back to st. anthony 's church in the town of hambach near aachen .
one of the most famous hoards of german antiquities and manuscripts are known as the quedlinburg treasure .
the church treasures were hidden in a mine during the waning weeks of world war ii and disappeared soon after us troops occupied the area .
in the 1980s objets d 'art started surfacing in a small texas town in the united states , stolen by an american soldier .
when he died , his relatives tried to sell the art work and the ensuing court case made headlines .
in the end , the german cultural foundation bought most of the works for $ 3 million .
in 2008 , german cultural institutions published a catalog of over 180,000 works of art that disappeared after the war. av / afp / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it took 40 years before the berlin wall fell and germany was reunited . sixty years ago , delegates gathered in the grand hall of the former aviation ministry in berlin as germans across the soviet occupied zone followed the events on the radio .
the reporter announced the events as " a piece of german history unfolding . "
a short time later wilhelm pieck declared the birth of the first " workers and peasants state on german soil . "
pieck became the first president of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , as east germany was officially known .
" based on the new constitution , the german democratic republic has been founded unanimously by all parties and organizations present in the german people 's council , " pieck said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilhelm pieck became the first president of east germany less than one month earlier , on september 15 , 1949 , konrad adenauer had been elected as first chancellor of west germany .
in the eyes of the communists in east germany and moscow , adenauer was the " chancellor of western imperialism , " portrayed as the enemy of the people .
one day later , the soviet leadership in moscow sent a delegation of german communist exiles to berlin to implement a socialist alternative to the west .
a division of europe unfolds the creation of two separate german states confirmed what many had expected in the aftermath of world war ii .
the border between east and west germany was not yet fortified with barbed wire – but already it marked the division not only of germany but of europe as a whole .
the two states on both sides of the new border became satellites of their respective allied occupiers .
the soviet dictator josef stalin had a clear agenda in mind .
with the creation of east germany , he pushed the political and military influence of the soviet union well into the heart of europe .
stalin described the new communist state as " the creation of a peace loving , democratic germany alongside the peaceful soviet union . "
according to stalin , the new state would prevent both new wars and the " enslavement of european countries by the western imperialists . "
the " better " german state in west germany , economic progress and political stability soon helped people to get over the woes of the post-war hardship .
but east german leaders wanted more than just material prosperity .
they wanted a fresh ideological start after the catastrophe of nazi germany .
bildunterschrift : the birth of east germany was celebrated with parades in berlin many of the citizens ' of the new eastern state agreed with that concept .
for them , socialism seemed like the proper answer to fascism , war and the holocaust .
walter ulbricht , who became a top communist party official , said the crucial issue was " the struggle against fascist ideology and against other reactionary ideologies that work against the interests of the working class and against progress and development in germany . "
ulbricht later said that " there will be a day when the sed -lrb- east germany 's communist party -rrb- will be the leading party of all of germany – because the majority of germans will want it that way . "
but as enthusiastic as the first reactions were – the dramatic loss of faith in the political leadership installed by moscow came very soon .
an experiment gone wrong the gdr seemed doomed from the very beginning .
the vision that one day its party would lead all of germany was soon turned to be on its head .
in 1989 , peaceful revolution toppled the communist regime .
in the end it was the people of the gdr that wanted the political system of the west and not vice versa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the 40th anniversary was celebrated in 1989 , the end of the regime was only weeks away yet in october 1989 the communist leadership seemed to be in denial that the end was near .
they staged an elaborate celebration to mark the then 40th anniversary of east germany .
yet at that time east germans were already out on the streets demonstrating for change – and thousands had already fled the " workers ' and peasants ' paradise " via hungary to west germany .
in a few weeks from then , on november 9 , 1989 , the berlin wall came down to dramatically mark the collapse of east germany .
after 40 years of gdr , the dream of the allegedly " better " version of germany burst with a momentum so powerful that the citizens of the communist east had lost all faith and interest to change their state and have it survive into a new era .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de alternative energy -pipe- 07.10.2009 eu wants to boost green energy spending by 50 billion euros großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar power would receive the most money under the eu plan investment in clean energy technology should be boosted by 50 billion euros through 2020 in order for europe to meet its climate goals , according to a new report issued by the european commission on wednesday . currently , the european union and its member states spend about three billion euros a year on various forms of alternative and renewable energy but this sum is not sufficient , the report said .
annual spending should be raised to eight billion euros if europe is to meet its goal of cutting carbon emissions 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
" today we have a unique opportunity to change an energy model based on polluting , scarce and risky fossil fuels , into a clean , sustainable and less dependent one , " said andris piebalgs , the eu 's energy commissioner , at a press conference in brussels wednesday .
a roadmap for future energy research spending dubbed the strategic energy technology plan -lrb- set -rrb- , the commission 's report emphasized that additional investment to promote technologies such as solar and wind power was urgently needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind power could produce 20 percent of europe 's electricity by 2020 " locked-in investments , vested interests , as well as the high risks and need for significant investments in less profitable alternatives , mean that change will be slow without a major push , " the study said .
the commission report is a roadmap that will help set funding priorities within the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , and the member states .
coordinating research and development among the eu 's 27 member governments will be difficult , said energy economist claudia kemfert of berlin 's diw research institute .
" individual member countries have to decide how much they want to spend and what they spend it on , " kemfert told deutsche welle .
" there will be pressure for them to spend the money in their own countries . "
the bulk of the new funding would come from the private sector and member states . the eu 's european trading system for co2 credits and the european investment bank will also provide some financing .
solar and carbon capture the big winners solar power projects receive the most attention in the set study , with 16 billion euros of funding proposed for the next decade with the goal of producing 15 percent of the eu 's electricity from solar power by 2020 .
some of the solar research projects supported by the set roadmap include new ways to build photovoltaic cells more cheaply and quickly than today and for further research in the field of concentrated solar power , which uses the sun 's energy to create heat that powers turbines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report proposes 13 billion euros of funding for carbon storage technology " solar power has the greatest potential but also has the highest costs at the moment , " said kemfert .
" those costs will decline but it will take investment to do that . "
a german consortium known as desertec has proposed using concentrated solar power to build a network of power plants across the deserts of north africa and the middle east which would export much of their electricity to europe at a cost of approximately 400 billion euros by 2050 .
carbon capture and storage technologies , which inject carbon dioxide emitted by coal power plants into the ground rather than releasing the emissions into the atmosphere , would receive 13 billion euros in funding according to the eu roadmap , the second-highest sum in the report .
wind energy gets less additional research funds would also flow into research for biofuels , nuclear power , improving energy efficiency and building ' smart grid ' technology which will create a unified european electricity grid that can accommodate renewable forms of energy .
wind energy , which already provides a significant amount of electricity in germany and spain , would receive six billion euros of additional funding under the plan , which would enable wind power to supply 20 percent of the eu 's electricity needs by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing ' smart grid ' technology to ease power transmission is a key goal calling the funding proposal " a step in the right direction , " hermann albers , head of germany 's wind power federation was also critical of the commissions funding suggestions , noting that wind power already produced seven percent of germany 's electricity .
" the foreseen investments in wind energy are clearly too small in comparison to ccs and nuclear technology , " albers told deutsche welle .
" some rethinking on the eu level is urgently needed . "
new jobs and energy security in addition to helping europe meet its carbon reduction goals , the report emphasized that targeted investments in the renewable energy sector could stimulate the development of new industries and jobs and provide europe with an economic advantage in the decades ahead .
the additional 50 billion euros worth of spending could create as many as 600,000 new jobs , with the european renewable energy sector employing as many as 2.8 million people by 2020 , the study said .
europe 's energy security would also be improved by increasing the use of renewable fuels , the report said .
currently , 80 percent of european electricity production is derived from fossil fuels , much of which is imported from outside of the eu .

she was fired for helping herself to a meatball from a conference buffet at her workplace .
the case is to be heard in january . the 57-year-old secretary , identified in the german media as magdalene h , worked for the builders ' association in the state of north-rhine westphalia for more than three decades .
the incident took place last july when she organized a conference buffet for her boss and his guests and helped herself to two rolls and a frikadelle , a german meatball specialty , during the preparations .
boss insists firing was right thing german mass-selling newspaper bild reported on wednesday that magdalene h was confronted by her boss after a colleague noticed some food was missing .
but once she admitted to consuming the meatball , she was fired .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frikadellen are popular in germany " she believed her behavior was acceptable , " her lawyer , wolfgang pinkepank , told bild .
" bread and meatballs that are left over after conferences are allowed to be eaten by workers .
if she had been reprimanded , she would not have done it again . "
the newspaper reported that a judge in the courtroom where the secretary and her employer , hermann schulte-hiltrop , met on tuesday urged schulte-hiltrop to issue a warning instead of a firing , saying the incident was not a classic case of theft .
but schulte-hiltrop , the head of the builders ' association , insisted he had done the right thing in firing her .
" from the outside it naturally looks like a minor offence , " he said .
" but we work on highly sensitive information here .
and if you do n't trust someone any longer , it 's not a good feeling . "

they are small , they strike at night and they can be deadly : mosquitos carrying malaria .
it 's one of the deadliest diseases in africa .
yet it ’ s quite easily preventable . malaria is one of africa 's biggest plagues .
it kills almost a million people a year around the world .
90 % of those who die are in africa .
pregnant women and small children are particularly vulnerable .
it 's mostly the poor who die , because they often ca n't afford any treatment once the first symptoms break out .
in any case , prevention is better than cure .
some forms of malaria do n't react to many available drugs anyhow .
but prevention tends to be simple .
for instance , sleeping under a mosquito net or by wearing long-sleeved clothes after sun set .
for other useful hints , tune in to our new series about malaria .
we follow one african family in its quest to eradicate malaria .
and , on the way , they teach us what we can do against it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 07.10.2009 stiglitz urges financial powers to rethink their values großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph stiglitz says the international monetary fund needs a new philosophy a tax on financial institutions is needed to improve the efficiency of the global economy and provide aid to developing countries , says joseph stiglitz , a former world bank chief economist and nobel prize winner . joseph stiglitz is one of the harshest critics of the banking industry 's rush to return to " business as usual " in the wake of the financial crisis .
he is an outspoken man who likes to use direct and colorful language , especially when comparing the cost of bank bailouts with the amount of aid paid to help the world 's poorest nations weather the economic storm .
" in one night we passed $ 700 billion to the banks , " stiglitz says .
" global foreign aid has really been $ 60-70 billion a year .
so in one hour we passed all the foreign aid of all the developed countries to all the developing countries for a decade . "
" and you ask : who is more needy ?
the american banker or developing countries ?
it 's hard not to come up with the conclusion that our values got destroyed . "
new philosophy for imf lending although the columbia university professor says the international monetary fund has done a good job of managing the crisis so far .
he still urges the imf to rethink its lending policies .
in the past , stiglitz says , imf-credits often had damaging side-effects for the recipients .
the loans were usually tied to drastic reform programs that sent the economies of many borrowers into a downward spiral .
stiglitz warns that if the imf wants to become a global insurer against economic disruption , as the funds 's director dominique strauss-kahn claims , then it needs to take a new approach to dealing with the needs of poor countries .
" when you have a crisis and the doctor comes in and says : ' by the way , if you want the medicine you have to do a , b , c and d ' and you say ' i do n't want to do a , b , c and d ' - you are not getting medicine , then it does n't serve the function of insurance , " stiglitz points out .
global finance sector needs taxation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the imf is working hard to prevent another financial crisis financial markets should also be subject of new taxes designed to discourage ' dysfunctional ' trading and help pay for the damage the global crisis has inflicted on poorer countries , stiglitz says .
imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn recently announced that the washington-based organization is already studying ways to tax the financial industry at the request of group of 20 leaders .
such a global financial-transaction tax would only be fair , the stiglitz argues , and it would not be without precedent .
" in environmental economics we have a principle called ' polluter pay ' .
if you cause pollution you have to pay for the clean-up .
the financial sector polluted the global economy with toxic assets and now they ought to clean up that , " the nobel prize-winning economist says .
excessive risk-taking by the banking sector has imposed huge costs on the rest of the society , including workers , developing nations , house-holders and tax-payers , he explains .
a global tax on financial market transactions is therefore not just a question of equity , but a question of efficiency .
stiglitz stresses that such a tax would also help shrink a ' bloated ' financial industry in the united states , arguing that statistics showing that the finance sector accounted for 40 percent of us corporate profits before the crisis were a clear signal that “ something 's wrong . ”
tax revenues could be used for poor countries stiglitz says the money raised by the proposed tax could be used to help poor countries , which were by no means responsible for the financial crisis , but are nevertheless suffering its worst consequences .
according to estimates by the development committee of the world bank and the international monetary fund , another 90 million people around the world are at risk of being driven into extreme poverty by the end of 2010 .

he is an outspoken man who likes to use direct and colorful language , especially when comparing the cost of bank bailouts with the amount of aid paid to help the world 's poorest nations weather the economic storm .
" in one night we passed $ 700 billion to the banks , " stiglitz says .
" global foreign aid has really been $ 60-70 billion a year .
so in one hour we passed all the foreign aid of all the developed countries to all the developing countries for a decade . "
" and you ask : who is more needy ?
the american banker or developing countries ?
it 's hard not to come up with the conclusion that our values got destroyed . "
new philosophy for imf lending although the columbia university professor says the international monetary fund has done a good job of managing the crisis so far .
he still urges the imf to rethink its lending policies .
in the past , stiglitz says , imf-credits often had damaging side-effects for the recipients .
the loans were usually tied to drastic reform programs that sent the economies of many borrowers into a downward spiral .
stiglitz warns that if the imf wants to become a global insurer against economic disruption , as the funds 's director dominique strauss-kahn claims , then it needs to take a new approach to dealing with the needs of poor countries .
" when you have a crisis and the doctor comes in and says : ' by the way , if you want the medicine you have to do a , b , c and d ' and you say ' i do n't want to do a , b , c and d ' - you are not getting medicine , then it does n't serve the function of insurance , " stiglitz points out .
global finance sector needs taxation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the imf is working hard to prevent another financial crisis financial markets should also be subject of new taxes designed to discourage ' dysfunctional ' trading and help pay for the damage the global crisis has inflicted on poorer countries , stiglitz says .
imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn recently announced that the washington-based organization is already studying ways to tax the financial industry at the request of group of 20 leaders .
such a global financial-transaction tax would only be fair , the stiglitz argues , and it would not be without precedent .
" in environmental economics we have a principle called ' polluter pay ' .
if you cause pollution you have to pay for the clean-up .
the financial sector polluted the global economy with toxic assets and now they ought to clean up that , " the nobel prize-winning economist says .
excessive risk-taking by the banking sector has imposed huge costs on the rest of the society , including workers , developing nations , house-holders and tax-payers , he explains .
a global tax on financial market transactions is therefore not just a question of equity , but a question of efficiency .
stiglitz stresses that such a tax would also help shrink a ' bloated ' financial industry in the united states , arguing that statistics showing that the finance sector accounted for 40 percent of us corporate profits before the crisis were a clear signal that “ something 's wrong . ”
tax revenues could be used for poor countries stiglitz says the money raised by the proposed tax could be used to help poor countries , which were by no means responsible for the financial crisis , but are nevertheless suffering its worst consequences .
according to estimates by the development committee of the world bank and the international monetary fund , another 90 million people around the world are at risk of being driven into extreme poverty by the end of 2010 .

he is an outspoken man who likes to use direct and colorful language , especially when comparing the cost of bank bailouts with the amount of aid paid to help the world 's poorest nations weather the economic storm .
" in one night we passed $ 700 billion to the banks , " stiglitz says .
" global foreign aid has really been $ 60-70 billion a year .
so in one hour we passed all the foreign aid of all the developed countries to all the developing countries for a decade . "
" and you ask : who is more needy ?
the american banker or developing countries ?
it 's hard not to come up with the conclusion that our values got destroyed . "
new philosophy for imf lending although the columbia university professor says the international monetary fund has done a good job of managing the crisis so far .
he still urges the imf to rethink its lending policies .
in the past , stiglitz says , imf-credits often had damaging side-effects for the recipients .
the loans were usually tied to drastic reform programs that sent the economies of many borrowers into a downward spiral .
stiglitz warns that if the imf wants to become a global insurer against economic disruption , as the funds 's director dominique strauss-kahn claims , then it needs to take a new approach to dealing with the needs of poor countries .
" when you have a crisis and the doctor comes in and says : ' by the way , if you want the medicine you have to do a , b , c and d ' and you say ' i do n't want to do a , b , c and d ' - you are not getting medicine , then it does n't serve the function of insurance , " stiglitz points out .
global finance sector needs taxation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the imf is working hard to prevent another financial crisis financial markets should also be subject of new taxes designed to discourage ' dysfunctional ' trading and help pay for the damage the global crisis has inflicted on poorer countries , stiglitz says .
imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn recently announced that the washington-based organization is already studying ways to tax the financial industry at the request of group of 20 leaders .
such a global financial-transaction tax would only be fair , the stiglitz argues , and it would not be without precedent .
" in environmental economics we have a principle called ' polluter pay ' .
if you cause pollution you have to pay for the clean-up .
the financial sector polluted the global economy with toxic assets and now they ought to clean up that , " the nobel prize-winning economist says .
excessive risk-taking by the banking sector has imposed huge costs on the rest of the society , including workers , developing nations , house-holders and tax-payers , he explains .
a global tax on financial market transactions is therefore not just a question of equity , but a question of efficiency .
stiglitz stresses that such a tax would also help shrink a ' bloated ' financial industry in the united states , arguing that statistics showing that the finance sector accounted for 40 percent of us corporate profits before the crisis were a clear signal that “ something 's wrong . ”
tax revenues could be used for poor countries stiglitz says the money raised by the proposed tax could be used to help poor countries , which were by no means responsible for the financial crisis , but are nevertheless suffering its worst consequences .
according to estimates by the development committee of the world bank and the international monetary fund , another 90 million people around the world are at risk of being driven into extreme poverty by the end of 2010 .

it took 40 years before the berlin wall fell and germany was reunited . sixty years ago , delegates gathered in the grand hall of the former aviation ministry in berlin as germans across the soviet occupied zone followed the events on the radio .
the reporter announced the events as " a piece of german history unfolding . "
a short time later wilhelm pieck declared the birth of the first " workers and peasants state on german soil . "
pieck became the first president of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , as east germany was officially known .
" based on the new constitution , the german democratic republic has been founded unanimously by all parties and organizations present in the german people 's council , " pieck said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilhelm pieck became the first president of east germany less than one month earlier , on september 15 , 1949 , konrad adenauer had been elected as first chancellor of west germany .
in the eyes of the communists in east germany and moscow , adenauer was the " chancellor of western imperialism , " portrayed as the enemy of the people .
one day later , the soviet leadership in moscow sent a delegation of german communist exiles to berlin to implement a socialist alternative to the west .
a division of europe unfolds the creation of two separate german states confirmed what many had expected in the aftermath of world war ii .
the border between east and west germany was not yet fortified with barbed wire – but already it marked the division not only of germany but of europe as a whole .
the two states on both sides of the new border became satellites of their respective allied occupiers .
the soviet dictator josef stalin had a clear agenda in mind .
with the creation of east germany , he pushed the political and military influence of the soviet union well into the heart of europe .
stalin described the new communist state as " the creation of a peace loving , democratic germany alongside the peaceful soviet union . "
according to stalin , the new state would prevent both new wars and the " enslavement of european countries by the western imperialists . "
the " better " german state in west germany , economic progress and political stability soon helped people to get over the woes of the post-war hardship .
but east german leaders wanted more than just material prosperity .
they wanted a fresh ideological start after the catastrophe of nazi germany .
bildunterschrift : the birth of east germany was celebrated with parades in berlin many of the citizens ' of the new eastern state agreed with that concept .
for them , socialism seemed like the proper answer to fascism , war and the holocaust .
walter ulbricht , who became a top communist party official , said the crucial issue was " the struggle against fascist ideology and against other reactionary ideologies that work against the interests of the working class and against progress and development in germany . "
ulbricht later said that " there will be a day when the sed -lrb- east germany 's communist party -rrb- will be the leading party of all of germany – because the majority of germans will want it that way . "
but as enthusiastic as the first reactions were – the dramatic loss of faith in the political leadership installed by moscow came very soon .
an experiment gone wrong the gdr seemed doomed from the very beginning .
the vision that one day its party would lead all of germany was soon turned to be on its head .
in 1989 , peaceful revolution toppled the communist regime .
in the end it was the people of the gdr that wanted the political system of the west and not vice versa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the 40th anniversary was celebrated in 1989 , the end of the regime was only weeks away yet in october 1989 the communist leadership seemed to be in denial that the end was near .
they staged an elaborate celebration to mark the then 40th anniversary of east germany .
yet at that time east germans were already out on the streets demonstrating for change – and thousands had already fled the " workers ' and peasants ' paradise " via hungary to west germany .
in a few weeks from then , on november 9 , 1989 , the berlin wall came down to dramatically mark the collapse of east germany .
after 40 years of gdr , the dream of the allegedly " better " version of germany burst with a momentum so powerful that the citizens of the communist east had lost all faith and interest to change their state and have it survive into a new era .

usually they consisted of a helmet , or a flag , or maybe a knife .
but in the case of robert thomas , an 18-year-old soldier in george patton 's third army , his souvenirs turned out to be two legal manuscripts more than 400 years old .
as the tide of the war turned and allied bombing began to take its toll on german buildings and institutions , rare books and artworks were moved underground to caves or abandoned mines .
it was in an abandoned salt mine in the small town of merkers outside of frankfurt that the young infantryman stumbled on a room filled from floor to ceiling with thousands of books .
a different kind of souvenir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert thomas , left , handed the books over to the german ambassador thomas grabbed two of the books and took them home with him to the united states .
" i kept them in two boxes in the darkest coolest place at my house in order to preserve them .
they are pretty much in the same condition as i found them , " said the 83-year-old veteran .
it was the officials at the national archives who urged thomas to return them to the rightful owner .
" the books will go home now .
that 's the right thing to do , " said thomas as he handed over the manuscripts .
the oldest of the two books , one written in german and the other latin , was published in 1573 and deals with prussian statutes .
the other was published in 1593 and is a treatise on roman law .
the books were originally from the diocesan museum of paderborn and will be returned to the university of bonn library where they were before the war .
at a ceremony at the national archives in washington dc where thomas handed the books over to german ambassador klaus scharioth , the ambassador said that getting the books back was a stroke of luck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the books are legal treatises " we 're really lucky to get these books back , " said scharioth .
" the fact that these books are returned tells you a lot about our relationship today - it 's a sign of friendship and trust . "
other manuscripts found it is not the first time that german manuscripts have been returned .
in 1992 , a woman who had lived through auschwitz turned over seven medieval manuscripts that had been taken by an american soldier who drove a tank in patton 's army .
the manuscripts were dated from the 15th and 16th centuries and were traced back to st. anthony 's church in the town of hambach near aachen .
one of the most famous hoards of german antiquities and manuscripts are known as the quedlinburg treasure .
the church treasures were hidden in a mine during the waning weeks of world war ii and disappeared soon after us troops occupied the area .
in the 1980s objets d 'art started surfacing in a small texas town in the united states , stolen by an american soldier .
when he died , his relatives tried to sell the art work and the ensuing court case made headlines .
in the end , the german cultural foundation bought most of the works for $ 3 million .

usually they consisted of a helmet , or a flag , or maybe a knife .
but in the case of robert thomas , an 18-year-old soldier in george patton 's third army , his souvenirs turned out to be two legal manuscripts more than 400 years old .
as the tide of the war turned and allied bombing began to take its toll on german buildings and institutions , rare books and artworks were moved underground to caves or abandoned mines .
it was in an abandoned salt mine in the small town of merkers outside of frankfurt that the young infantryman stumbled on a room filled from floor to ceiling with thousands of books .

" i kept them in two boxes in the darkest coolest place at my house in order to preserve them .
they are pretty much in the same condition as i found them , " said the 83-year-old veteran .
it was the officials at the national archives who urged thomas to return them to the rightful owner .
" the books will go home now .
that 's the right thing to do , " said thomas as he handed over the manuscripts .
the oldest of the two books , one written in german and the other latin , was published in 1573 and deals with prussian statutes .
the other was published in 1593 and is a treatise on roman law .
the books were originally from the diocesan museum of paderborn and will be returned to the university of bonn library where they were before the war .
at a ceremony at the national archives in washington dc where thomas handed the books over to german ambassador klaus scharioth , the ambassador said that getting the books back was a stroke of luck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the books are legal treatises " we 're really lucky to get these books back , " said scharioth .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 07.10.2009 stiglitz urges financial powers to rethink their values großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph stiglitz says the international monetary fund needs a new philosophy a tax on financial institutions is needed to improve the efficiency of the global economy and provide aid to developing countries , says joseph stiglitz , a former world bank chief economist and nobel prize winner . joseph stiglitz is one of the harshest critics of the banking industry 's rush to return to " business as usual " in the wake of the financial crisis .
he is an outspoken man who likes to use direct and colorful language , especially when comparing the cost of bank bailouts with the amount of aid paid to help the world 's poorest nations weather the economic storm .
" in one night we passed $ 700 billion to the banks , " stiglitz says .
" global foreign aid has really been $ 60-70 billion a year .
so in one hour we passed all the foreign aid of all the developed countries to all the developing countries for a decade . "
" and you ask : who is more needy ?
the american banker or developing countries ?
it 's hard not to come up with the conclusion that our values got destroyed . "
new philosophy for imf lending although the columbia university professor says the international monetary fund has done a good job of managing the crisis so far .
he still urges the imf to rethink its lending policies .
in the past , stiglitz says , imf-credits often had damaging side-effects for the recipients .
the loans were usually tied to drastic reform programs that sent the economies of many borrowers into a downward spiral .
stiglitz warns that if the imf wants to become a global insurer against economic disruption , as the funds 's director dominique strauss-kahn claims , then it needs to take a new approach to dealing with the needs of poor countries .
" when you have a crisis and the doctor comes in and says : ' by the way , if you want the medicine you have to do a , b , c and d ' and you say ' i do n't want to do a , b , c and d ' - you are not getting medicine , then it does n't serve the function of insurance , " stiglitz points out .
global finance sector needs taxation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the imf is working hard to prevent another financial crisis financial markets should also be subject of new taxes designed to discourage ' dysfunctional ' trading and help pay for the damage the global crisis has inflicted on poorer countries , stiglitz says .
imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn recently announced that the washington-based organization is already studying ways to tax the financial industry at the request of group of 20 leaders .
such a global financial-transaction tax would only be fair , the stiglitz argues , and it would not be without precedent .
" in environmental economics we have a principle called ' polluter pay ' .
if you cause pollution you have to pay for the clean-up .
the financial sector polluted the global economy with toxic assets and now they ought to clean up that , " the nobel prize-winning economist says .
excessive risk-taking by the banking sector has imposed huge costs on the rest of the society , including workers , developing nations , house-holders and tax-payers , he explains .
a global tax on financial market transactions is therefore not just a question of equity , but a question of efficiency .
stiglitz stresses that such a tax would also help shrink a ' bloated ' financial industry in the united states , arguing that statistics showing that the finance sector accounted for 40 percent of us corporate profits before the crisis were a clear signal that “ something 's wrong . ”
tax revenues could be used for poor countries stiglitz says the money raised by the proposed tax could be used to help poor countries , which were by no means responsible for the financial crisis , but are nevertheless suffering its worst consequences .
according to estimates by the development committee of the world bank and the international monetary fund , another 90 million people around the world are at risk of being driven into extreme poverty by the end of 2010 .

he is an outspoken man who likes to use direct and colorful language , especially when comparing the cost of bank bailouts with the amount of aid paid to help the world 's poorest nations weather the economic storm .
" in one night we passed $ 700 billion to the banks , " stiglitz says .
" global foreign aid has really been $ 60-70 billion a year .
so in one hour we passed all the foreign aid of all the developed countries to all the developing countries for a decade . "
" and you ask : who is more needy ?
the american banker or developing countries ?
it 's hard not to come up with the conclusion that our values got destroyed . "
new philosophy for imf lending although the columbia university professor says the international monetary fund has done a good job of managing the crisis so far .
he still urges the imf to rethink its lending policies .
in the past , stiglitz says , imf-credits often had damaging side-effects for the recipients .
the loans were usually tied to drastic reform programs that sent the economies of many borrowers into a downward spiral .
stiglitz warns that if the imf wants to become a global insurer against economic disruption , as the funds 's director dominique strauss-kahn claims , then it needs to take a new approach to dealing with the needs of poor countries .

they are small , they strike at night and they can be deadly : mosquitos carrying malaria .
it 's one of the deadliest diseases in africa .
yet it ’ s quite easily preventable . malaria is one of africa 's biggest plagues .
it kills almost a million people a year around the world .
90 % of those who die are in africa .
pregnant women and small children are particularly vulnerable .
it 's mostly the poor who die , because they often ca n't afford any treatment once the first symptoms break out .
in any case , prevention is better than cure .
some forms of malaria do n't react to many available drugs anyhow .
but prevention tends to be simple .
for instance , sleeping under a mosquito net or by wearing long-sleeved clothes after sun set .
for other useful hints , tune in to our new series about malaria .
we follow one african family in its quest to eradicate malaria .
and , on the way , they teach us what we can do against it .

african children can have difficult lives .
they may have to walk for miles to school or maybe they live in a conflict zone - we introduce you to some of the common challenges and the basic rights of young africans . while european kids are still playing with toys , african children usually have to work .
in the country , hundreds of thousands go to school in the morning and in the afternoon they help their parents in the fields .
and many have to look after themselves at a pretty tender age , because their parents ca n't feed them .
african children often have a tough life .
they are more likely to die before the age of five than children on any other continent .
they sometimes live in areas afflicted by violence and insecurity .
besides , they are less likely to get a good education than their contemporaries in asia , america or europe .
learning by ear tells the stories of some of these small african heroes .
but it is n't all about the struggles they face .
it 's also about people fighting for children ’ s ' rights and trying to make a difference .
our programs also reflect the progress that has been made .
for instance , there ’ s a children 's parliament that is fighting for children ’ s rights in nigeria .

the nobel jury said they were honored for their studies on how ribosomes function , a breakthrough that has been vital in the development of new antibiotics .
the nobel committee cited the work of the trio as " directly assisting the saving of lives and decreasing humanity 's suffering . "
" many of today 's antibiotics cure various diseases by blocking the function of bacterial ribosomes .
without functional ribosomes , bacteria can not survive .
this is why ribosomes are such an important target for new antibiotics . "
research crucial to developing new drugs the three scientists have generated three-dimensional models to illustrating the ribosomes ' individual atomic structure .
these models are now used in the quest for new antibiotics .
about half the current antibiotics in use block the function of bacterial ribosomes , but there is a growing problem of bacterial strains that are resistant to drugs , the committee said on wednesday .
the three will share the 10 million swedish crowns -lrb- 1 million euros , $ 1.42 million -rrb- prize .
steitz , a professor for molecular biophysics at yale university , told reporters he was about to go to the gym when he received the phone call from stockholm .
" my caller from stockholm said i should n't go to the gym .
there would be phone calls , " the scientist told swedish radio .
ramakrishnan works at the mrc laboratory of molecular biology at cambridge university .
yonath , who works at the department of structural biology at the weizmann institute of science in israel , said she did not expect the prize about a discovery made almost a decade ago .
the nobel prizes are handed out annually for achievements in science , literature , economics and peace .
the prize in chemistry was this year 's third , following awards for medicine on monday and physics on tuesday. ai / reuters / dpa / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de alternative energy -pipe- 07.10.2009 eu wants to boost green energy spending by 50 billion euros großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar power would receive the most money under the eu plan investment in clean energy technology should be boosted by 50 billion euros through 2020 in order for europe to meet its climate goals , according to a new report issued by the european commission on wednesday . currently , the european union and its member states spend about three billion euros a year on various forms of alternative and renewable energy but this sum is not sufficient , the report said .
annual spending should be raised to eight billion euros if europe is to meet its goal of cutting carbon emissions 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
" today we have a unique opportunity to change an energy model based on polluting , scarce and risky fossil fuels , into a clean , sustainable and less dependent one , " said andris piebalgs , the eu 's energy commissioner , at a press conference in brussels wednesday .
a roadmap for future energy research spending dubbed the strategic energy technology plan -lrb- set -rrb- , the commission 's report emphasized that additional investment to promote technologies such as solar and wind power was urgently needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind power could produce 20 percent of europe 's electricity by 2020 " locked-in investments , vested interests , as well as the high risks and need for significant investments in less profitable alternatives , mean that change will be slow without a major push , " the study said .
the commission report is a roadmap that will help set funding priorities within the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , and the member states .
coordinating research and development among the eu 's 27 member governments will be difficult , said energy economist claudia kemfert of berlin 's diw research institute .
" individual member countries have to decide how much they want to spend and what they spend it on , " kemfert told deutsche welle .
" there will be pressure for them to spend the money in their own countries . "
the bulk of the new funding would come from the private sector and member states . the eu 's european trading system for co2 credits and the european investment bank will also provide some financing .
solar and carbon capture the big winners solar power projects receive the most attention in the set study , with 16 billion euros of funding proposed for the next decade with the goal of producing 15 percent of the eu 's electricity from solar power by 2020 .
some of the solar research projects supported by the set roadmap include new ways to build photovoltaic cells more cheaply and quickly than today and for further research in the field of concentrated solar power , which uses the sun 's energy to create heat that powers turbines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report proposes 13 billion euros of funding for carbon storage technology " solar power has the greatest potential but also has the highest costs at the moment , " said kemfert .
" those costs will decline but it will take investment to do that . "
a german consortium known as desertec has proposed using concentrated solar power to build a network of power plants across the deserts of north africa and the middle east which would export much of their electricity to europe at a cost of approximately 400 billion euros by 2050 .
carbon capture and storage technologies , which inject carbon dioxide emitted by coal power plants into the ground rather than releasing the emissions into the atmosphere , would receive 13 billion euros in funding according to the eu roadmap , the second-highest sum in the report .
wind energy gets less additional research funds would also flow into research for biofuels , nuclear power , improving energy efficiency and building ' smart grid ' technology which will create a unified european electricity grid that can accommodate renewable forms of energy .
wind energy , which already provides a significant amount of electricity in germany and spain , would receive six billion euros of additional funding under the plan , which would enable wind power to supply 20 percent of the eu 's electricity needs by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing ' smart grid ' technology to ease power transmission is a key goal calling the funding proposal " a step in the right direction , " hermann albers , head of germany 's wind power federation was also critical of the commissions funding suggestions , noting that wind power already produced seven percent of germany 's electricity .
" the foreseen investments in wind energy are clearly too small in comparison to ccs and nuclear technology , " albers told deutsche welle .
" some rethinking on the eu level is urgently needed . "
new jobs and energy security in addition to helping europe meet its carbon reduction goals , the report emphasized that targeted investments in the renewable energy sector could stimulate the development of new industries and jobs and provide europe with an economic advantage in the decades ahead .
the additional 50 billion euros worth of spending could create as many as 600,000 new jobs , with the european renewable energy sector employing as many as 2.8 million people by 2020 , the study said .
europe 's energy security would also be improved by increasing the use of renewable fuels , the report said .
currently , 80 percent of european electricity production is derived from fossil fuels , much of which is imported from outside of the eu .

his honesty has paid off - but his dishonesty could have proved even more profitable . in october 2006 , a man found a bag containing 400,000 euros -lrb- $ 588,000 -rrb- in the lavatory of one of the high-speed ice trains travelling between berlin and frankfurt .
instead of jumping off at the next station and booking a direct flight to the bahamas , the honest pensioner from wiesbaden handed over the booty to police .
the owner of the money had three years to claim the loot .
but that deadline has now passed , and no one has come forward .
germany 's national rail company , deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- , thus gets to keep the money , which it said it would use to set up child-friendly waiting rooms at several major train stations .
db announced it would give the man who found the bag 25,000 euros for his honesty .
it 's not a bad sum , unless you consider that he could have had 16 times that amount. ca / dpa / afp / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 07.10.2009 eu warns germany , eight other nations for excessive budget deficits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's economy has been hit hard by the global recession the eu commission on wednesday warned germany , italy and seven other eu nations for flouting the bloc 's stability and growth pact which requires them to keep budget deficits under three percent of gross domestic product . in addition to germany and italy , the commission on wednesday also began a budget scrutiny process against austria , belgium , the czech republic , the netherlands , portugal , slovakia and slovenia about their budget deficits .
according to the commission , the eu 's executive arm , 20 of the bloc 's 27 member countries are on track to break that limit this year .
in july , brussels launched action against latvia , lithuania , malta , poland and romania following earlier procedures against france , greece , ireland and spain .
eu blames recession for budget woes the commission blamed the ballooning budget deficits on the global recession , admitting that several eu governments had increased their public spending to limit the impact of the economic crisis .
several eu countries are grappling with falling tax revenues and rising unemployment and many have initiated economic stimulus measures and bail-outs for banks and leading companies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia says the offenders will not be forced to radically rein in spending in light of the recession " a large majority of eu member states are set to have budget deficits above 3 percent of gdp in 2009 as a result of the economic crisis .
we need to continue supporting the economy until the recovery takes hold , in line with the european economic recovery plan , " economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said .
but the commissioner also warned that eu governments need to rein in public spending and bring their public finances back in order .
" now is also the moment to design coordinated exit strategies so that , when the moment is right , we can begin to roll back the soaring debt levels , " he said .
almunia said the stability and growth pact under which the action was taken " is sufficiently flexible to combine the fiscal stimulus in the short term with consolidation of the public finances in the medium term . "
germany grapples with soaring deficit germany 's budget deficit will be 3.9 percent of gdp this year and 5.9 percent next year , the commission said .
the recession in europe 's largest economy has slashed tax revenues and increased government spending on subsidies .
leaked government documents in germany this week said that public deficits need to be cut by 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 56 billion -rrb- between 2011 and 2013 .
bildunterschrift : the soaring deficit is a political issue in germany - merkel here with the fdp 's guido westerwelle germany 's soaring deficit is also a bone of contention for the country 's next center-right government .
the pro-business fdp party , which is set to form a coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives , won the election largely on the back of promised tax cuts .
but merkel has warned that the spiraling budget deficit reduces the scope for immediate tax relief , and that there wo n't be any cuts before 2011 .
the commission has estimated a deficit of 4.5 percent for italy , 3.4 percent in the netherlands and 6.5 percent in portugal .
europe still suffering from downturn europe hit a recovery setback on wednesday with the euro-zone economy shrinking more than expected .
finance ministers from the 16 nations that use the euro agreed last week at a meeting in sweden that their countries would have to take action in 2011 against debt and public deficits .
the pact " must not be interpreted as offering one-way flexibility , " euro-group head and luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker warned .
the stability and growth pact was established in the 1990s to boost confidence in the euro .
in 2005 , the pact was loosened , making it easier for countries breaching the 3 percent limit to avoid sanctions .
nations that overshoot the eu deficit limit can be subject to economic sanctions , though none have so far been fined. sp / afp / reuters / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

wallace souza , also a local congressman , had enjoyed parliamentary immunity until last week when the amazonas state assembly expelled him .
a search is under way , with airports and roads from the city of manaus in the amazon region being monitored .
mr souza has not been charged and denies any wrongdoing .
the case made headlines around the world when the police accused mr souza of being involved in drug trafficking and ordering killings to increase the popularity of his tv programme .
smear campaign as well as being a former tv presenter , mr souza was a popular politician elected to the assembly in the state of amazonas with a large majority .
however , his expulsion following a vote last week meant he lost his parliamentary immunity and now it appears he is on the run , after a warrant was issued for his arrest .
the authorities in amazonas claim he ordered several killings in order to get rid of his rivals , while afterwards tv crews from his programme would mysteriously arrive at the crime scenes before the police , enabling them to secure graphic footage .
mr souza who has not been charged in connection with any killings , denies the accusations , and says they are part of a smear campaign by his political opponents .
however , the police say they have been unable to find the former crime show presenter despite searching a number of locations where he could have been .
it is a scene which in the past might well have made a dramatic sequence on mr souza 's own crime show .

the pathway for potential donors is not always as smooth or accommodating as it could be .
it is not just a question of popping in to a clinic and producing a sample .
donors need to be assessed to ensure they are suitable and a variety of tests , mostly blood tests , are required before accepting a man as a donor .
the man may be asked to attend to donate up to 10 times and will need to come back after six months .
the process is therefore time-consuming for the donor and also for the clinic staff .

this seemed like the easiest option but setting up our donor bank was incredibly time-consuming and not without cost .

there is a need for financial investment to employ dedicated staff and provide the necessary resources .
whilst our initial thoughts were ' why do n't all centres set up their own bank ? ' , we quickly understood the reasons why not and i do not believe the responsibility for provision of donor sperm lies with the fertility centres .

' amazing gift ' some would argue that the provision of resources by the department of health , which is already under financial constraints in providing a robust health service , is not justified .
i would challenge this opinion as the inability for a couple to conceive a child , through no fault of their own , is devastating .
the gift of sperm donation is an amazing thing to do and brings so much happiness to childless couples .
i welcome the department of health initiative to support a " hub " centre for sperm donation which would involve setting up 14 centres across the uk to manage services for donors .
resources are needed to provide a donor sperm service and i believe that there are plenty of willing donors out there , it 's just a question of making it as easy as possible for them to donate during their busy working day . "

the pathway for potential donors is not always as smooth or accommodating as it could be .
it is not just a question of popping in to a clinic and producing a sample .
donors need to be assessed to ensure they are suitable and a variety of tests , mostly blood tests , are required before accepting a man as a donor .

barts ' solution at the centre for reproductive medicine at barts hospital , we had traditionally bought in sperm from uk donor banks to treat our patients but then found it impossible to do so .
we ended up with a long waiting list for our patients due to the difficulty in buying sperm because two of the private clinics in london which we 'd been using stopped selling sperm .
whilst our initial thoughts were ' why do n't all centres set up their own bank ? ' , we quickly understood the reasons why not we decided the only solution for us at barts was to set up our own donor bank for use for our own patients .
this seemed like the easiest option but setting up our donor bank was incredibly time-consuming and not without cost .
indeed , most of the work involved is performed by a very dedicated embryology team and often on their own time .
there is a need for financial investment to employ dedicated staff and provide the necessary resources .
whilst our initial thoughts were ' why do n't all centres set up their own bank ? ' , we quickly understood the reasons why not and i do not believe the responsibility for provision of donor sperm lies with the fertility centres .
however , it can be done and we have fabulous donors who have made a tremendous difference to so many of our patients who now have a child .
' amazing gift ' some would argue that the provision of resources by the department of health , which is already under financial constraints in providing a robust health service , is not justified .
i would challenge this opinion as the inability for a couple to conceive a child , through no fault of their own , is devastating .
the gift of sperm donation is an amazing thing to do and brings so much happiness to childless couples .
i welcome the department of health initiative to support a " hub " centre for sperm donation which would involve setting up 14 centres across the uk to manage services for donors .
resources are needed to provide a donor sperm service and i believe that there are plenty of willing donors out there , it 's just a question of making it as easy as possible for them to donate during their busy working day .

stephen green told bbc world business report that a change in culture was needed to improve the public 's perception of bankers .
he also said that london was secure as a major financial centre , but would lose market share as asia developed .
last month , hsbc announced that its chief executive michael geoghan would move to hong kong from london .
but mr green said the bank 's decision did not mean it was turning its back on london .
" two-thirds of our business is in asia .
it 's where we think the centre of gravity of the world 's economy is shifting , " he said .
' learn the lessons ' mr green , in istanbul for the annual meetings of the world bank and the international monetary fund , admitted the banking industry collectively owed the world an apology for the financial crisis .
" it also owes the real world a commitment to learn the lessons .
some of them are about governance and ethics and culture within the industry , " he said .
" you ca n't do all this simply by rules and regulations . "
however , commenting on increased regulations for banks , mr green said it was " inevitable " that regulators as well as the banks themselves could learn from the crisis .
he added that the industry needed to " pay much more attention to liquidity " than it had done previously .
on monday , the financial services authority in the uk published new rules governing funding standards at banks and building societies , stating that banks should hold more assets that were truly liquid , such as government bonds .

its pittville campus in cheltenham , currently home to the faculty of media , art and communications , will shut by the end of 2011 .
the university also says it will not be moving into the blackfriars development in gloucester .
vice-chancellor , professor patricia broadfoot said funding cuts and a cap on student numbers were responsible .
she said : " this means universities up and down the country can not anticipate any growth in their income and we are experiencing significant cuts in our funding from the higher education funding council -lsb- for england -rsb- .
' big blow ' " clearly we have to get our house in order and make the ship ready for the storm . "
the university says campuses and courses are a priority to protect the " student experience " .
it claimed that by rationalising its estates it can become a leaner operation .
prof broadfoot added : " we will sell our london campus which costs about £ 1m a year to run and is not core to our mission to be the university for gloucestershire .
" we will consolidate our cheltenham operation on two sites .
she added : " losing our presence at blackfriars is a big blow . "
