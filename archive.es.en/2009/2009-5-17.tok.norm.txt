musical " the producers " takes the stage in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a simpering , silly hitler is the centerpiece of " the producers " ' flop turned satiric hit they sing , they dance , they conquer france !
stormtroopers and a simpering , silly hitler take the stage in the berlin production of musical comedy " the producers " .
is germany ready to laugh at its own taboos ? andreas bieber , one of the stars of the new production at berlin 's admiralspalast theatre , wants one thing to be clear : " people think it 's a musical about hitler – of course that 's not the case . " but that notorious name is part of what is raising eyebrows over the show , which has goose-stepping as well as tap-dancing , and mines taboos for comic effect . " the producers " tells the story of two theatrical ne 'er do wells , lecherous has-been max bialystock , and wimpy wannabe leopold bloom , who discover that flops can make more money than hits .
they set out to produce the loser of all losers – a musical about hitler , written by and starring a demented neo-nazi , and directed by a flamboyant gay director , which is " certain to offend people of all races , creeds and religions , and guaranteed to close in one night . "
surprisingly , when the manic but macho lead is replaced with a campy , outrageous performance by the director , the fascist frolic is taken for brilliant satire .
" springtime for hitler " becomes a smash hit , and the producers end up in jail for defrauding their backers .
bildunterschrift : singing , dancing nazis storm the stage in " the producers " american comedy icon mel brooks ' original 1968 movie sparked a tony-award winning 2001 broadway show , which in turn was made into a 2005 musical film .
audiences in london , tokyo , athens and even tel aviv have all fallen for the crazy comedy .
but a german-language version was lacking until last summer 's production in vienna , austria .
a love letter to a lost culture , or a risky joke ?
the production is now on stage in berlin .
titus hoffmann , resident director at the admiralspalast for the production of " the producers " , calls the show a love letter to show business , including an entertainment culture that once thrived in the german capital .
" there was a huge cabaret scene , lots of satirical , ironic , funny people , that were killed in the third reich then , or they had to leave and they went to america and a lot of those people went to new york and worked on broadway .
" and somehow , it feels a bit like it 's a return , and it brings the humor back to the country , which is so great .
because apart from all the awful and terrible things that happened through hitler , what still is lacking a little in germany is good humor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : controversial banners announce the german premier of the musical " the producers " so far , not everyone here is getting the joke .
local papers have described the show as " risky " and even the production 's advertising has caused a fuss .
it 's illegal to portray the swastika publicly in germany , so the casually reclining hitler in poster ads for the play wears an armband displaying a pretzel .
banners showing the doughy treat in black on a red and white banner have been hanging in the theatre courtyard for months . they 've garnered double-takes from passersby , and a few complaints to the police .
the storm troopers wear the real thing when they take the stage , though , due to a theatrical exception . equal opportunity offender in some ways , brooks ' classic can be seen as an equal opportunity offender , with jokes about gays , jews , dumb blondes and sex-crazed little old ladies . the humor at times relies on pratfalls and slapstick .
the song lyrics are especially clever jabs , rhyming nazi with " hotsy-totsy " and declaring , " we 're marching to a faster pace .
look out , here comes the master race ! "
some of the biggest laughs at friday night 's preview show came thanks to nutty neo-nazi playwright franz liebkind , who wears lederhosen and a german military helmet , and has a flock of teutonic-titled pigeons .
he insists that the two producers join him in wearing a swastika armband and taking an oath in the name of " adolph elizabeth hitler . "
max bialystock grabs the red band , turns it this way and that , and describes it as " idiot proof " since the symbol looks the same from either direction – the audience exploded with delighted guffaws .
" it 's not ok to make fun of the holocaust .
but hitler as a person , is ok to ridicule . "
still there 's a slight uneasiness that comes from seeing one-armed salutes in a city with such a tortured history , agrees nigel west , the production 's director . " when you see the show in america , you do n't think twice about it .
because of where we are , you do think twice about it … of course there 's a large age group that could still be affected by what went on , but people hopefully below the age of 60 will come and they 'll forgive and they 'll go with it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actor martin sommerlatte plays adolf hitler in the musical " the producers " 34-year-old sven schmidt lived up to west 's hopes – although surprised by some of the scenes , schmidt said he laughed a lot , and his only complaint was that the second half lagged a little .
" it 's another generation .
we do n't have that much to do with it anymore , " schmidt said .
" this was a parody of hitler , so it 's ok to laugh .
other things , it might not be ok to laugh at .
it 's not ok to make fun of the holocaust .
but hitler as a person is ok to ridicule " .
actor andreas bieber thinks berlin is the perfect place for brooks ' hit .
he hopes audiences will come to the performance knowing what the show is about , and ready to let themselves enjoy it . " berlin of course is the city where it all happened .
and everybody 's reminded about that all the time .
it 's really not about denying history and what happened , but we have to move on , and we have to look at things from a different angle , and it 's great to do that in the city where it all happened . "
previews of " the producers " take place this weekend , with the official premier of the musical sunday evening .
the production is currently booked for a two and a half month run .
response in vienna was muted , with the scheduled run of a year cut to 10 months .
but the cast and crew hope that in berlin , the show will go on - and on . author : susan stone editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some of the biggest laughs at friday night 's preview show came thanks to nutty neo-nazi playwright franz liebkind , who wears lederhosen and a german military helmet , and has a flock of teutonic-titled pigeons .
he insists that the two producers join him in wearing a swastika armband and taking an oath in the name of " adolph elizabeth hitler . "
max bialystock grabs the red band , turns it this way and that , and describes it as " idiot proof " since the symbol looks the same from either direction – the audience exploded with delighted guffaws .
" it 's not ok to make fun of the holocaust .

still there 's a slight uneasiness that comes from seeing one-armed salutes in a city with such a tortured history , agrees nigel west , the production 's director . " when you see the show in america , you do n't think twice about it .
because of where we are , you do think twice about it … of course there 's a large age group that could still be affected by what went on , but people hopefully below the age of 60 will come and they 'll forgive and they 'll go with it . "

the song lyrics are especially clever jabs , rhyming nazi with " hotsy-totsy " and declaring , " we 're marching to a faster pace .
look out , here comes the master race ! "
some of the biggest laughs at friday night 's preview show came thanks to nutty neo-nazi playwright franz liebkind , who wears lederhosen and a german military helmet , and has a flock of teutonic-titled pigeons .
he insists that the two producers join him in wearing a swastika armband and taking an oath in the name of " adolph elizabeth hitler . "
max bialystock grabs the red band , turns it this way and that , and describes it as " idiot proof " since the symbol looks the same from either direction – the audience exploded with delighted guffaws .
" it 's not ok to make fun of the holocaust .
but hitler as a person , is ok to ridicule . "
still there 's a slight uneasiness that comes from seeing one-armed salutes in a city with such a tortured history , agrees nigel west , the production 's director . " when you see the show in america , you do n't think twice about it .
because of where we are , you do think twice about it … of course there 's a large age group that could still be affected by what went on , but people hopefully below the age of 60 will come and they 'll forgive and they 'll go with it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actor martin sommerlatte plays adolf hitler in the musical " the producers " 34-year-old sven schmidt lived up to west 's hopes – although surprised by some of the scenes , schmidt said he laughed a lot , and his only complaint was that the second half lagged a little .
" it 's another generation .
we do n't have that much to do with it anymore , " schmidt said .
" this was a parody of hitler , so it 's ok to laugh .
other things , it might not be ok to laugh at .
it 's not ok to make fun of the holocaust .
but hitler as a person is ok to ridicule " .
actor andreas bieber thinks berlin is the perfect place for brooks ' hit .
he hopes audiences will come to the performance knowing what the show is about , and ready to let themselves enjoy it . " berlin of course is the city where it all happened .
and everybody 's reminded about that all the time .
it 's really not about denying history and what happened , but we have to move on , and we have to look at things from a different angle , and it 's great to do that in the city where it all happened . "
previews of " the producers " take place this weekend , with the official premier of the musical sunday evening .
the production is currently booked for a two and a half month run .
response in vienna was muted , with the scheduled run of a year cut to 10 months .
but the cast and crew hope that in berlin , the show will go on - and on . author : susan stone editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle 's ranjitha balasubramanyam says while the war may be over , peace is still some way off . as the sri lankan military 's mop-up operations continue in what appears to be the culmination of a long-drawn-out war against the liberation tigers of tamil eelam , a senior rebel leader has been quoted as saying that the battle has " reached its bitter end " .
in an apparent admission of defeat , selvarasa pathmanathan , the tigers ' chief of international relations , also said in a statement on a pro-rebel website that they had " decided to silence " their guns .
some observers and certainly the government of president mahinda rajapakse believe the tigers had little choice , having been boxed into a tiny patch of land not exceeding a few square kilometres in the northeast of the island nation .
so , few are likely to be taken in by the rebel claim that they have decided to give up fighting entirely on account of their desire " to remove the last weak excuse of the enemy for killing our people . "
paradoxes in the plot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over the years tens of thousands have been killed in the fighting .
from the onset , president rajapakse made no bones about the fact that his government sought to crush the ltte militarily while keeping the door open for negotiations .
ironically , it was ltte leader velupillai prabhakaran who was largely instrumental in the 2005 presidential poll victory for rajapakse , already a hardliner .
the ltte had ordered the people of the tamil-dominated north and east of the country to boycott the polls .
that directive from the rebels , who had a stranglehold on the population in the region , resulted in a defeat for incumbent prime minister ranil wickremesinghe , in the absence of support from a large segment of the tamil electorate .
again , paradoxically , it was wickremesinghe who had pushed for a political solution and initiated a ceasefire with the rebels in 2002 .
i clearly remember the bewilderment on wickremesinghe 's face as the tigers ' " decree " filtered down to southern sri lanka .
one must remember that the capital colombo in the south west of the country is in the midst of the majority sinhala community , while the various tamil-dominated parts of the country lie in the north – primarily former tiger stronghold jaffna , the wanni mainland , and the eastern districts of trincomalee , batticaloa and ampara . in the years that i spent in the island nation , there was little doubt that there was an effective " internal border " demarcating the sinhala and tamil / muslim majority areas of the country .
wasted opportunity most people in the sinhala-dominated south saw the 2002 ceasefire as a complete farce and feared that it simply afforded the tigers the chance to re-arm and strengthen their fighting ranks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tigers are accused of using child soldiers in their armed struggle ultimately , it emerged that those fears were not entirely unfounded .
some analysts say the tigers - banned in sri lanka , india and the us - also used their new-found clout and freedoms under the ceasefire to assassinate several political opponents .
they did all this in total disregard for the peace efforts facilitated by norway , which had the eu 's backing .
in the end , the international community was disenchanted with the tigers ' conduct during the " ceasefire " years , and the manner in which they stymied the peace talks .
once it became apparent that neither side cared for norway 's intervention , oslo had little choice but to bow out .
eventually the eu also listed the ltte as a terrorist group .
for those of us who watched the events unfold in sri lanka from close quarters , there was a sense of dismay at the lost opportunity – not simply that the " ceasefire " was n't for real but that the tigers , who had time and again shown remarkable organisational and strategic skills , had failed to make use of their " ticket " to the political mainstream .
western powers snubbed in recent weeks , as the military stepped up the war in the north , the un said thousands of innocent people had been killed in the conflict zone with some 50,000 others being trapped .
president rajapakse 's government thumbed its nose at the international community , shrugging off condemnation of the manner in which it has pushed ahead with its military offensive .
the sri lankan government also angered the eu a couple of weeks ago by refusing entry to the swedish foreign minister who had planned to accompany his british and french counterparts to the country to press for an immediate truce .
the uk 's david miliband and france 's bernard kouchner visited colombo to urge the two sides to cease fire in order to enable the un to evacuate civilians .
however , the rajapakse government , which was convinced that victory was close at hand , rejected their pleas .
now it appears by all accounts that the ltte 's armed struggle has been finished off , and that the tigers are a spent force .
few would have believed just a couple of years ago that asia 's longest running civil war was drawing to a close .
the rebels ran a de-facto state covering nearly one-third of the country .
they had set up a parallel administrative and social infrastructure , complete with their own schools , a bank , courts , a taxation system , a civil service and even a border control mechanism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the end of war mean an end to bombings , destruction and suffering ?
and in the south , they spread terror through suicide bombings and political assassinations .
few of us who lived through the bombings in colombo can erase memories of the carnage , destruction and the utter dread that resulted .
post-war scenario now the question that 's on most observers ' minds is whether rajapakse , who has won adulation from his sinhala constituency for achieving what seemed to be a near-impossible task will also be able to persuade the large and divided tamil community - many in the outside world view sri lankan tamils as a monolithic entity and they could n't be farther from the truth - that his government will provide a benevolent and constructive leadership for all .
it would seem to me that even those of the fractured tamil community that did n't subscribe to the rebels ' strategies must find the speed at which the tiger infrastructure has crumbled extremely incomprehensible .
moreover , they must now adapt to a life without the tigers .
that said , some caution that military victory may not spell peace , as the tigers could well return to guerrilla warfare .

deutsche welle 's ranjitha balasubramanyam says while the war may be over , peace is still some way off . as the sri lankan military 's mop-up operations continue in what appears to be the culmination of a long-drawn-out war against the liberation tigers of tamil eelam , a senior rebel leader has been quoted as saying that the battle has " reached its bitter end " .
in an apparent admission of defeat , selvarasa pathmanathan , the tigers ' chief of international relations , also said in a statement on a pro-rebel website that they had " decided to silence " their guns .
some observers and certainly the government of president mahinda rajapakse believe the tigers had little choice , having been boxed into a tiny patch of land not exceeding a few square kilometres in the northeast of the island nation .
so , few are likely to be taken in by the rebel claim that they have decided to give up fighting entirely on account of their desire " to remove the last weak excuse of the enemy for killing our people . "
paradoxes in the plot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over the years tens of thousands have been killed in the fighting .
from the onset , president rajapakse made no bones about the fact that his government sought to crush the ltte militarily while keeping the door open for negotiations .
ironically , it was ltte leader velupillai prabhakaran who was largely instrumental in the 2005 presidential poll victory for rajapakse , already a hardliner .
the ltte had ordered the people of the tamil-dominated north and east of the country to boycott the polls .
that directive from the rebels , who had a stranglehold on the population in the region , resulted in a defeat for incumbent prime minister ranil wickremesinghe , in the absence of support from a large segment of the tamil electorate .
again , paradoxically , it was wickremesinghe who had pushed for a political solution and initiated a ceasefire with the rebels in 2002 .
i clearly remember the bewilderment on wickremesinghe 's face as the tigers ' " decree " filtered down to southern sri lanka .
one must remember that the capital colombo in the south west of the country is in the midst of the majority sinhala community , while the various tamil-dominated parts of the country lie in the north – primarily former tiger stronghold jaffna , the wanni mainland , and the eastern districts of trincomalee , batticaloa and ampara . in the years that i spent in the island nation , there was little doubt that there was an effective " internal border " demarcating the sinhala and tamil / muslim majority areas of the country .
wasted opportunity most people in the sinhala-dominated south saw the 2002 ceasefire as a complete farce and feared that it simply afforded the tigers the chance to re-arm and strengthen their fighting ranks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tigers are accused of using child soldiers in their armed struggle ultimately , it emerged that those fears were not entirely unfounded .
some analysts say the tigers - banned in sri lanka , india and the us - also used their new-found clout and freedoms under the ceasefire to assassinate several political opponents .
they did all this in total disregard for the peace efforts facilitated by norway , which had the eu 's backing .
in the end , the international community was disenchanted with the tigers ' conduct during the " ceasefire " years , and the manner in which they stymied the peace talks .
once it became apparent that neither side cared for norway 's intervention , oslo had little choice but to bow out .
eventually the eu also listed the ltte as a terrorist group .
for those of us who watched the events unfold in sri lanka from close quarters , there was a sense of dismay at the lost opportunity – not simply that the " ceasefire " was n't for real but that the tigers , who had time and again shown remarkable organisational and strategic skills , had failed to make use of their " ticket " to the political mainstream .
western powers snubbed in recent weeks , as the military stepped up the war in the north , the un said thousands of innocent people had been killed in the conflict zone with some 50,000 others being trapped .
president rajapakse 's government thumbed its nose at the international community , shrugging off condemnation of the manner in which it has pushed ahead with its military offensive .
the sri lankan government also angered the eu a couple of weeks ago by refusing entry to the swedish foreign minister who had planned to accompany his british and french counterparts to the country to press for an immediate truce .
the uk 's david miliband and france 's bernard kouchner visited colombo to urge the two sides to cease fire in order to enable the un to evacuate civilians .
however , the rajapakse government , which was convinced that victory was close at hand , rejected their pleas .
now it appears by all accounts that the ltte 's armed struggle has been finished off , and that the tigers are a spent force .
few would have believed just a couple of years ago that asia 's longest running civil war was drawing to a close .
the rebels ran a de-facto state covering nearly one-third of the country .
they had set up a parallel administrative and social infrastructure , complete with their own schools , a bank , courts , a taxation system , a civil service and even a border control mechanism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the end of war mean an end to bombings , destruction and suffering ?
and in the south , they spread terror through suicide bombings and political assassinations .
few of us who lived through the bombings in colombo can erase memories of the carnage , destruction and the utter dread that resulted .
post-war scenario now the question that 's on most observers ' minds is whether rajapakse , who has won adulation from his sinhala constituency for achieving what seemed to be a near-impossible task will also be able to persuade the large and divided tamil community - many in the outside world view sri lankan tamils as a monolithic entity and they could n't be farther from the truth - that his government will provide a benevolent and constructive leadership for all .
it would seem to me that even those of the fractured tamil community that did n't subscribe to the rebels ' strategies must find the speed at which the tiger infrastructure has crumbled extremely incomprehensible .
moreover , they must now adapt to a life without the tigers .
that said , some caution that military victory may not spell peace , as the tigers could well return to guerrilla warfare .

the ltte had ordered the people of the tamil-dominated north and east of the country to boycott the polls .
that directive from the rebels , who had a stranglehold on the population in the region , resulted in a defeat for incumbent prime minister ranil wickremesinghe , in the absence of support from a large segment of the tamil electorate .
again , paradoxically , it was wickremesinghe who had pushed for a political solution and initiated a ceasefire with the rebels in 2002 .
i clearly remember the bewilderment on wickremesinghe 's face as the tigers ' " decree " filtered down to southern sri lanka .
one must remember that the capital colombo in the south west of the country is in the midst of the majority sinhala community , while the various tamil-dominated parts of the country lie in the north – primarily former tiger stronghold jaffna , the wanni mainland , and the eastern districts of trincomalee , batticaloa and ampara . in the years that i spent in the island nation , there was little doubt that there was an effective " internal border " demarcating the sinhala and tamil / muslim majority areas of the country .
wasted opportunity most people in the sinhala-dominated south saw the 2002 ceasefire as a complete farce and feared that it simply afforded the tigers the chance to re-arm and strengthen their fighting ranks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tigers are accused of using child soldiers in their armed struggle ultimately , it emerged that those fears were not entirely unfounded .
some analysts say the tigers - banned in sri lanka , india and the us - also used their new-found clout and freedoms under the ceasefire to assassinate several political opponents .
they did all this in total disregard for the peace efforts facilitated by norway , which had the eu 's backing .
in the end , the international community was disenchanted with the tigers ' conduct during the " ceasefire " years , and the manner in which they stymied the peace talks .
once it became apparent that neither side cared for norway 's intervention , oslo had little choice but to bow out .
eventually the eu also listed the ltte as a terrorist group .
for those of us who watched the events unfold in sri lanka from close quarters , there was a sense of dismay at the lost opportunity – not simply that the " ceasefire " was n't for real but that the tigers , who had time and again shown remarkable organisational and strategic skills , had failed to make use of their " ticket " to the political mainstream .
western powers snubbed in recent weeks , as the military stepped up the war in the north , the un said thousands of innocent people had been killed in the conflict zone with some 50,000 others being trapped .
president rajapakse 's government thumbed its nose at the international community , shrugging off condemnation of the manner in which it has pushed ahead with its military offensive .
the sri lankan government also angered the eu a couple of weeks ago by refusing entry to the swedish foreign minister who had planned to accompany his british and french counterparts to the country to press for an immediate truce .
the uk 's david miliband and france 's bernard kouchner visited colombo to urge the two sides to cease fire in order to enable the un to evacuate civilians .
however , the rajapakse government , which was convinced that victory was close at hand , rejected their pleas .
now it appears by all accounts that the ltte 's armed struggle has been finished off , and that the tigers are a spent force .
few would have believed just a couple of years ago that asia 's longest running civil war was drawing to a close .
the rebels ran a de-facto state covering nearly one-third of the country .
they had set up a parallel administrative and social infrastructure , complete with their own schools , a bank , courts , a taxation system , a civil service and even a border control mechanism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the end of war mean an end to bombings , destruction and suffering ?
and in the south , they spread terror through suicide bombings and political assassinations .
few of us who lived through the bombings in colombo can erase memories of the carnage , destruction and the utter dread that resulted .
post-war scenario now the question that 's on most observers ' minds is whether rajapakse , who has won adulation from his sinhala constituency for achieving what seemed to be a near-impossible task will also be able to persuade the large and divided tamil community - many in the outside world view sri lankan tamils as a monolithic entity and they could n't be farther from the truth - that his government will provide a benevolent and constructive leadership for all .
it would seem to me that even those of the fractured tamil community that did n't subscribe to the rebels ' strategies must find the speed at which the tiger infrastructure has crumbled extremely incomprehensible .
moreover , they must now adapt to a life without the tigers .
that said , some caution that military victory may not spell peace , as the tigers could well return to guerrilla warfare .

deutsche welle 's ranjitha balasubramanyam says while the war may be over , peace is still some way off . as the sri lankan military 's mop-up operations continue in what appears to be the culmination of a long-drawn-out war against the liberation tigers of tamil eelam , a senior rebel leader has been quoted as saying that the battle has " reached its bitter end " .
in an apparent admission of defeat , selvarasa pathmanathan , the tigers ' chief of international relations , also said in a statement on a pro-rebel website that they had " decided to silence " their guns .
some observers and certainly the government of president mahinda rajapakse believe the tigers had little choice , having been boxed into a tiny patch of land not exceeding a few square kilometres in the northeast of the island nation .
so , few are likely to be taken in by the rebel claim that they have decided to give up fighting entirely on account of their desire " to remove the last weak excuse of the enemy for killing our people . "
paradoxes in the plot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over the years tens of thousands have been killed in the fighting .

the discussions were to include a " cooperative arrangement and possible merger " of karstadt with metro 's own department store chain , galeria kaufhof .
metro , one of europe 's largest retailers , also runs its own brand name supermarket chain .
arcandor , which operates the quelle mail-order business , karstadt department stores and the thomas cook travel agency chain , has been in trouble for several years , with other retailers chipping away at its market share .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metro ceo cordes proposes a private solution rather than a government bailout in a statement , arcandor boss karl-gerhard eick said he was willing to talk about metro 's proposal , but doubted whether the german competition authorities would allow a merger of the country 's two largest department store chains .
together , karstadt and kaufhof have 247 stores nationwide .
arcandor a victim of the credit crunch last friday , arcandor said it would appeal to chancellor angela merkel 's government for a 650 million euro bailout to stave off collapse .
chief executive eick said a decision was needed within four weeks so that banks could roll over the 650 million in credit that expires on june 12 .
eick said the global economic crisis was making it difficult to obtain new credit without government guarantees .
four months from a general election , the demand could put the government on the spot .
a closure of karstadt and arcandor 's famous century-old kadewe luxury department store in berlin would wipe out a shopping institution – not to mention more than 50,000 jobs. gb / dpa / reuters editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

over 97 percent of shareholders reportedly backed the decision , passed at a two-day annual shareholders meeting in frankfurt on saturday .
commerzbank , which was forced to ask for state aid last year , is to issue 295 million new shares at a price of six euros per share , according to a statement by the bank .
the government is to acquire the new shares via the financial market stabilisation fund -lrb- soffin -rrb- - the german government 's rescue fund .
on thursday , the european commission approved the second tranche of german state aid to the tune of about 10 billion euros .
the brussels-based body insisted that the plans for the new injection of capital , which comes after a first infusion of eight billion euros , is meant to ensure the bank 's long-term health without giving it an unfair advantage over rivals .
in return for the comission 's approval , commerzbank will be forced to recentre its activities into business and individual retail banking and abandon its investment banking and commercial real-estate activities , which have accounted for about 45 percent of its total activities .
commerzbank chief executive martin blessing told press on friday that the state aid will be paid back in full and that the bank currently does n't require any further state aid .
struggling commerzbank ended 2008 with a sharp loss of 6.6 billion euros , due to the integration of ailing dresdner bank and the global credit crunch .
the bank has stayed in the red in 2009 , posting a net loss of 861 million euros for the first quarter on friday .
following the full integration of the dresdner bank in late january 2009 , commerzbank executives underlined that the restructuring would pay off in the future , forecasting a profit by 2011 at the latest , and an operating profit of more than four billion euros by 2012. nk / afp / dpa editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many see grybauskaite as a competent leader who remains outside party politics . european union budget chief dalia grybauskaite appears to have won a resounding victory in lithuania 's presidential election , according to an exit poll .
grybauskaite received 67.9 percent of the first-round vote , far outstripping social democrat candidate algirdas butkevicius who bagged just 11.8 percent .
the exit poll found that the five other candidates lagged far behind butkevicius .
under lithuanian law , half of the country 's 2.7 million registered voters must have voted for a presidential candidate who obtains over 50 percent of the vote to avoid a run-off ballot against the second-ranked rival .
first figures from the country 's electoral commission showed that turnout was still well short of that hurdle .
pulling the country " out of the political and economic shadows " lithuanians have gone to the polls at a time of deep economic recession and disenchantment with politicians .
53-year old grybauskaite is seen as a tough-talking , competent leader who has remained outside party politics with its scandals and corruption allegations .
grybauskaite has vowed to pull her country of 3.34 million " out of the political and economic shadows . " she has been a member of the european commission , the eu executive arm , since lithuania joined the bloc in 2004 .
in her role as a european commission member , grybauskaite has frequently chastised vilnius for having squandered the country 's economic boom and failure to prepare for the deepening recession .
" my conscience as a citizen would n't let me stay in brussels , " she said ahead of the election . " one of the first tasks will be to solve this crisis , to try to stabilize lithuania 's financial position so that the country can climb back up the curve as fast as possible . "
lithuania 's non-partisan incumbent president valdas adamkus , 82 , is retiring after serving two five-year terms , and his successor is due to take the reins in july .
if elected , grybauskaite would be the baltic nation 's first female head of state. rb / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

qualms with prime minister the demonstrators protested what they called the anti-secular principles of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
his opponents accuse him of attempting to make turkey more overtly islamic through incremental steps , such as failing to end bans on islamic-style headscarves at turkish universities .

the tigers have been fighting for a separate , independent state on the indian ocean island for 25 years . sri lankan president rajapakse says the rebels have been defeated militarily .
according to the country 's forces , all civilians who were trapped by fighting between government troops and rebels in the northeast of the country have now escaped .
the military said over 50,000 people had fled the area north of the town of mullataivu over the past three days .
however , reports say that the area on sunday was wracked by chaos and that it was therefore difficult to independently confirm the government statements .
tamil tiger founding leader vellupillai prabhakaran was reportedly shot dead on monday while trying to drive out of the battle zone in an ambulance , according to senior defense officials .
state television also broadcast images of of the corpse of prabhakaran 's son charles anthony , who has also reportedly been killed .
the military , and people who have escaped the fighting , say tamil rebels had been using civilians as human shields .

"
" this is the need of the hour , " he wrote .
" these are historically unprecedented times and require historically prudent decisions . "
" our only regrets , " he went on to say , " are for the lives lost and that we could not hold out for longer . "
earlier , an army spokesman had said fighting was continuing against last pockets of resistance by tamil tiger rebels , who are reportedly cut off from any ocean access and confined to a square kilometer of territory .
on sunday , the army said it had foiled a last-ditch , pre-dawn attempt by tamil rebels to breach military defenses and killed 70 fighters trying to escape .
a military spokesman , brig. udaya nanayakkara also said at least one suicide bomber had attacked sri lankan troops .
he gave no further details , however .
the pro-rebel tamil net website , citing a doctor in the area , said the bodies of hundreds of wounded and dead people lay strewn across the battlefront .
at least 70,000 people are estimated to have died in the conflict since it began in 1983. gb / reuters / ap editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fdp leader guido westerwelle says the free democrats are now keeping all options open . " we want to rule , " party leader guido westerwelle said to over 500 fdp delegates at a party convention over the weekend .
general elections in germany are due in september this year and traditionally the liberals ' goal would be to join forces as junior partners with angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
opinion polls show , however , that a coalition between the fdp and the cdu is unlikely to gain a ruling majority .
so , the free democrats are forced to keep their options open .
westerwelle on sunday reconfirmed his preference for the cdu , but added that his party also would n't exclude forming a three-way coalition with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens .
announcement to come before upcoming elections the fdp , germany 's third largest party behind the cdu and the spd , concluded their party convention on sunday saying that any concrete plans for a possible coalition would only be announced one week ahead of september ’ s election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : struck says the free democrats must join the spd and the greens if they want to rule peter struck , the chairman of the spd 's parliamentary faction , told the german newspaper welt am sonntag in a sunday interview that the fdp would have to enter a coalition with the spd and the greens if it wanted to win a majority in the general elections .
" it does n't matter what guido westerwelle says at this point : the free democrats will have to be ready to enter a coalition with the spd and the greens if they want to rule .
otherwise they would risk being out of power until at least 2013 , making it 15 years since they have been a part of a ruling coalition .
westerwelle would n't risk that , " he said .
fdp running on tax reform the economy is likely to be one of the main battlegrounds in the september election , and the fdp has vehemently criticized merkel 's coalition policies , in particular state bailouts and government stimulus measures .
" if a big company goes bust , the german eagle flies in .
if a small company goes bust , the bankruptcy vultures arrive , " westerwelle said with both fists clenched at the weekend convention .
westerwelle has also promised tax cuts to help lift germany out of its deepest recession since the end of the second world war .
the fdp election campaign promises an overhaul of the german tax system and a reduction of the burden on middle class families to the tune of up to 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 47.40 billion -rrb- .
" tax cuts will help the economy more than subsidizing one branch after the other .
we should relieve the burden on the middle classes .
that is the best answer to the downturn , " he said. glb / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle 's ranjitha balasubramanyam says while the war may be over , peace is still some way off . as the sri lankan military 's mop-up operations continue in what appears to be the culmination of a long-drawn-out war against the liberation tigers of tamil eelam , a senior rebel leader has been quoted as saying that the battle has " reached its bitter end " .
in an apparent admission of defeat , selvarasa pathmanathan , the tigers ' chief of international relations , also said in a statement on a pro-rebel website that they had " decided to silence " their guns .
some observers and certainly the government of president mahinda rajapakse believe the tigers had little choice , having been boxed into a tiny patch of land not exceeding a few square kilometres in the northeast of the island nation .
so , few are likely to be taken in by the rebel claim that they have decided to give up fighting entirely on account of their desire " to remove the last weak excuse of the enemy for killing our people . "
paradoxes in the plot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over the years tens of thousands have been killed in the fighting .
from the onset , president rajapakse made no bones about the fact that his government sought to crush the ltte militarily while keeping the door open for negotiations .
ironically , it was ltte leader velupillai prabhakaran who was largely instrumental in the 2005 presidential poll victory for rajapakse , already a hardliner .
the ltte had ordered the people of the tamil-dominated north and east of the country to boycott the polls .
that directive from the rebels , who had a stranglehold on the population in the region , resulted in a defeat for incumbent prime minister ranil wickremesinghe , in the absence of support from a large segment of the tamil electorate .
again , paradoxically , it was wickremesinghe who had pushed for a political solution and initiated a ceasefire with the rebels in 2002 .
i clearly remember the bewilderment on wickremesinghe 's face as the tigers ' " decree " filtered down to southern sri lanka .
one must remember that the capital colombo in the south west of the country is in the midst of the majority sinhala community , while the various tamil-dominated parts of the country lie in the north – primarily former tiger stronghold jaffna , the wanni mainland , and the eastern districts of trincomalee , batticaloa and ampara . in the years that i spent in the island nation , there was little doubt that there was an effective " internal border " demarcating the sinhala and tamil / muslim majority areas of the country .
wasted opportunity most people in the sinhala-dominated south saw the 2002 ceasefire as a complete farce and feared that it simply afforded the tigers the chance to re-arm and strengthen their fighting ranks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tigers are accused of using child soldiers in their armed struggle ultimately , it emerged that those fears were not entirely unfounded .
some analysts say the tigers - banned in sri lanka , india and the us - also used their new-found clout and freedoms under the ceasefire to assassinate several political opponents .
they did all this in total disregard for the peace efforts facilitated by norway , which had the eu 's backing .
in the end , the international community was disenchanted with the tigers ' conduct during the " ceasefire " years , and the manner in which they stymied the peace talks .
once it became apparent that neither side cared for norway 's intervention , oslo had little choice but to bow out .
eventually the eu also listed the ltte as a terrorist group .
for those of us who watched the events unfold in sri lanka from close quarters , there was a sense of dismay at the lost opportunity – not simply that the " ceasefire " was n't for real but that the tigers , who had time and again shown remarkable organisational and strategic skills , had failed to make use of their " ticket " to the political mainstream .
western powers snubbed in recent weeks , as the military stepped up the war in the north , the un said thousands of innocent people had been killed in the conflict zone with some 50,000 others being trapped .
president rajapakse 's government thumbed its nose at the international community , shrugging off condemnation of the manner in which it has pushed ahead with its military offensive .
the sri lankan government also angered the eu a couple of weeks ago by refusing entry to the swedish foreign minister who had planned to accompany his british and french counterparts to the country to press for an immediate truce .
the uk 's david miliband and france 's bernard kouchner visited colombo to urge the two sides to cease fire in order to enable the un to evacuate civilians .
however , the rajapakse government , which was convinced that victory was close at hand , rejected their pleas .
now it appears by all accounts that the ltte 's armed struggle has been finished off , and that the tigers are a spent force .
few would have believed just a couple of years ago that asia 's longest running civil war was drawing to a close .
the rebels ran a de-facto state covering nearly one-third of the country .
they had set up a parallel administrative and social infrastructure , complete with their own schools , a bank , courts , a taxation system , a civil service and even a border control mechanism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the end of war mean an end to bombings , destruction and suffering ?
and in the south , they spread terror through suicide bombings and political assassinations .
few of us who lived through the bombings in colombo can erase memories of the carnage , destruction and the utter dread that resulted .
post-war scenario now the question that 's on most observers ' minds is whether rajapakse , who has won adulation from his sinhala constituency for achieving what seemed to be a near-impossible task will also be able to persuade the large and divided tamil community - many in the outside world view sri lankan tamils as a monolithic entity and they could n't be farther from the truth - that his government will provide a benevolent and constructive leadership for all .
it would seem to me that even those of the fractured tamil community that did n't subscribe to the rebels ' strategies must find the speed at which the tiger infrastructure has crumbled extremely incomprehensible .
moreover , they must now adapt to a life without the tigers .
that said , some caution that military victory may not spell peace , as the tigers could well return to guerrilla warfare .

post-war scenario now the question that 's on most observers ' minds is whether rajapakse , who has won adulation from his sinhala constituency for achieving what seemed to be a near-impossible task will also be able to persuade the large and divided tamil community - many in the outside world view sri lankan tamils as a monolithic entity and they could n't be farther from the truth - that his government will provide a benevolent and constructive leadership for all .
it would seem to me that even those of the fractured tamil community that did n't subscribe to the rebels ' strategies must find the speed at which the tiger infrastructure has crumbled extremely incomprehensible .
moreover , they must now adapt to a life without the tigers .
that said , some caution that military victory may not spell peace , as the tigers could well return to guerrilla warfare .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 17.05.2009 opinion : while the war may be over , peace is still some way off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a couple of years ago few would have believed that asia 's longest running civil war was drawing to a close .
deutsche welle 's ranjitha balasubramanyam says while the war may be over , peace is still some way off . as the sri lankan military 's mop-up operations continue in what appears to be the culmination of a long-drawn-out war against the liberation tigers of tamil eelam , a senior rebel leader has been quoted as saying that the battle has " reached its bitter end " .
in an apparent admission of defeat , selvarasa pathmanathan , the tigers ' chief of international relations , also said in a statement on a pro-rebel website that they had " decided to silence " their guns .
some observers and certainly the government of president mahinda rajapakse believe the tigers had little choice , having been boxed into a tiny patch of land not exceeding a few square kilometres in the northeast of the island nation .
so , few are likely to be taken in by the rebel claim that they have decided to give up fighting entirely on account of their desire " to remove the last weak excuse of the enemy for killing our people . "
paradoxes in the plot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over the years tens of thousands have been killed in the fighting .
from the onset , president rajapakse made no bones about the fact that his government sought to crush the ltte militarily while keeping the door open for negotiations .
ironically , it was ltte leader velupillai prabhakaran who was largely instrumental in the 2005 presidential poll victory for rajapakse , already a hardliner .
the ltte had ordered the people of the tamil-dominated north and east of the country to boycott the polls .
that directive from the rebels , who had a stranglehold on the population in the region , resulted in a defeat for incumbent prime minister ranil wickremesinghe , in the absence of support from a large segment of the tamil electorate .
again , paradoxically , it was wickremesinghe who had pushed for a political solution and initiated a ceasefire with the rebels in 2002 .
i clearly remember the bewilderment on wickremesinghe 's face as the tigers ' " decree " filtered down to southern sri lanka .
one must remember that the capital colombo in the south west of the country is in the midst of the majority sinhala community , while the various tamil-dominated parts of the country lie in the north – primarily former tiger stronghold jaffna , the wanni mainland , and the eastern districts of trincomalee , batticaloa and ampara . in the years that i spent in the island nation , there was little doubt that there was an effective " internal border " demarcating the sinhala and tamil / muslim majority areas of the country .
wasted opportunity most people in the sinhala-dominated south saw the 2002 ceasefire as a complete farce and feared that it simply afforded the tigers the chance to re-arm and strengthen their fighting ranks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tigers are accused of using child soldiers in their armed struggle ultimately , it emerged that those fears were not entirely unfounded .
some analysts say the tigers - banned in sri lanka , india and the us - also used their new-found clout and freedoms under the ceasefire to assassinate several political opponents .
they did all this in total disregard for the peace efforts facilitated by norway , which had the eu 's backing .
in the end , the international community was disenchanted with the tigers ' conduct during the " ceasefire " years , and the manner in which they stymied the peace talks .
once it became apparent that neither side cared for norway 's intervention , oslo had little choice but to bow out .
eventually the eu also listed the ltte as a terrorist group .
for those of us who watched the events unfold in sri lanka from close quarters , there was a sense of dismay at the lost opportunity – not simply that the " ceasefire " was n't for real but that the tigers , who had time and again shown remarkable organisational and strategic skills , had failed to make use of their " ticket " to the political mainstream .
western powers snubbed in recent weeks , as the military stepped up the war in the north , the un said thousands of innocent people had been killed in the conflict zone with some 50,000 others being trapped .
president rajapakse 's government thumbed its nose at the international community , shrugging off condemnation of the manner in which it has pushed ahead with its military offensive .
the sri lankan government also angered the eu a couple of weeks ago by refusing entry to the swedish foreign minister who had planned to accompany his british and french counterparts to the country to press for an immediate truce .
the uk 's david miliband and france 's bernard kouchner visited colombo to urge the two sides to cease fire in order to enable the un to evacuate civilians .
however , the rajapakse government , which was convinced that victory was close at hand , rejected their pleas .
now it appears by all accounts that the ltte 's armed struggle has been finished off , and that the tigers are a spent force .
few would have believed just a couple of years ago that asia 's longest running civil war was drawing to a close .
the rebels ran a de-facto state covering nearly one-third of the country .
they had set up a parallel administrative and social infrastructure , complete with their own schools , a bank , courts , a taxation system , a civil service and even a border control mechanism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the end of war mean an end to bombings , destruction and suffering ?
and in the south , they spread terror through suicide bombings and political assassinations .
few of us who lived through the bombings in colombo can erase memories of the carnage , destruction and the utter dread that resulted .
post-war scenario now the question that 's on most observers ' minds is whether rajapakse , who has won adulation from his sinhala constituency for achieving what seemed to be a near-impossible task will also be able to persuade the large and divided tamil community - many in the outside world view sri lankan tamils as a monolithic entity and they could n't be farther from the truth - that his government will provide a benevolent and constructive leadership for all .

deutsche welle 's ranjitha balasubramanyam says while the war may be over , peace is still some way off . as the sri lankan military 's mop-up operations continue in what appears to be the culmination of a long-drawn-out war against the liberation tigers of tamil eelam , a senior rebel leader has been quoted as saying that the battle has " reached its bitter end " .
in an apparent admission of defeat , selvarasa pathmanathan , the tigers ' chief of international relations , also said in a statement on a pro-rebel website that they had " decided to silence " their guns .
some observers and certainly the government of president mahinda rajapakse believe the tigers had little choice , having been boxed into a tiny patch of land not exceeding a few square kilometres in the northeast of the island nation .
so , few are likely to be taken in by the rebel claim that they have decided to give up fighting entirely on account of their desire " to remove the last weak excuse of the enemy for killing our people . "
paradoxes in the plot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over the years tens of thousands have been killed in the fighting .
from the onset , president rajapakse made no bones about the fact that his government sought to crush the ltte militarily while keeping the door open for negotiations .
ironically , it was ltte leader velupillai prabhakaran who was largely instrumental in the 2005 presidential poll victory for rajapakse , already a hardliner .
the ltte had ordered the people of the tamil-dominated north and east of the country to boycott the polls .
that directive from the rebels , who had a stranglehold on the population in the region , resulted in a defeat for incumbent prime minister ranil wickremesinghe , in the absence of support from a large segment of the tamil electorate .
again , paradoxically , it was wickremesinghe who had pushed for a political solution and initiated a ceasefire with the rebels in 2002 .
i clearly remember the bewilderment on wickremesinghe 's face as the tigers ' " decree " filtered down to southern sri lanka .
one must remember that the capital colombo in the south west of the country is in the midst of the majority sinhala community , while the various tamil-dominated parts of the country lie in the north – primarily former tiger stronghold jaffna , the wanni mainland , and the eastern districts of trincomalee , batticaloa and ampara . in the years that i spent in the island nation , there was little doubt that there was an effective " internal border " demarcating the sinhala and tamil / muslim majority areas of the country .
wasted opportunity most people in the sinhala-dominated south saw the 2002 ceasefire as a complete farce and feared that it simply afforded the tigers the chance to re-arm and strengthen their fighting ranks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tigers are accused of using child soldiers in their armed struggle ultimately , it emerged that those fears were not entirely unfounded .
some analysts say the tigers - banned in sri lanka , india and the us - also used their new-found clout and freedoms under the ceasefire to assassinate several political opponents .
they did all this in total disregard for the peace efforts facilitated by norway , which had the eu 's backing .
in the end , the international community was disenchanted with the tigers ' conduct during the " ceasefire " years , and the manner in which they stymied the peace talks .
once it became apparent that neither side cared for norway 's intervention , oslo had little choice but to bow out .
eventually the eu also listed the ltte as a terrorist group .
for those of us who watched the events unfold in sri lanka from close quarters , there was a sense of dismay at the lost opportunity – not simply that the " ceasefire " was n't for real but that the tigers , who had time and again shown remarkable organisational and strategic skills , had failed to make use of their " ticket " to the political mainstream .
western powers snubbed in recent weeks , as the military stepped up the war in the north , the un said thousands of innocent people had been killed in the conflict zone with some 50,000 others being trapped .
president rajapakse 's government thumbed its nose at the international community , shrugging off condemnation of the manner in which it has pushed ahead with its military offensive .
the sri lankan government also angered the eu a couple of weeks ago by refusing entry to the swedish foreign minister who had planned to accompany his british and french counterparts to the country to press for an immediate truce .
the uk 's david miliband and france 's bernard kouchner visited colombo to urge the two sides to cease fire in order to enable the un to evacuate civilians .
however , the rajapakse government , which was convinced that victory was close at hand , rejected their pleas .
now it appears by all accounts that the ltte 's armed struggle has been finished off , and that the tigers are a spent force .
few would have believed just a couple of years ago that asia 's longest running civil war was drawing to a close .
the rebels ran a de-facto state covering nearly one-third of the country .
they had set up a parallel administrative and social infrastructure , complete with their own schools , a bank , courts , a taxation system , a civil service and even a border control mechanism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the end of war mean an end to bombings , destruction and suffering ?
and in the south , they spread terror through suicide bombings and political assassinations .
few of us who lived through the bombings in colombo can erase memories of the carnage , destruction and the utter dread that resulted .
post-war scenario now the question that 's on most observers ' minds is whether rajapakse , who has won adulation from his sinhala constituency for achieving what seemed to be a near-impossible task will also be able to persuade the large and divided tamil community - many in the outside world view sri lankan tamils as a monolithic entity and they could n't be farther from the truth - that his government will provide a benevolent and constructive leadership for all .
it would seem to me that even those of the fractured tamil community that did n't subscribe to the rebels ' strategies must find the speed at which the tiger infrastructure has crumbled extremely incomprehensible .
moreover , they must now adapt to a life without the tigers .
that said , some caution that military victory may not spell peace , as the tigers could well return to guerrilla warfare .

many see grybauskaite as a competent leader who remains outside party politics . european union budget chief dalia grybauskaite appears to have won a resounding victory in lithuania 's presidential election , according to an exit poll .
grybauskaite received 67.9 percent of the first-round vote , far outstripping social democrat candidate algirdas butkevicius who bagged just 11.8 percent .
the exit poll found that the five other candidates lagged far behind butkevicius .
under lithuanian law , half of the country 's 2.7 million registered voters must have voted for a presidential candidate who obtains over 50 percent of the vote to avoid a run-off ballot against the second-ranked rival .
first figures from the country 's electoral commission showed that turnout was still well short of that hurdle .
pulling the country " out of the political and economic shadows " lithuanians have gone to the polls at a time of deep economic recession and disenchantment with politicians .
53-year old grybauskaite is seen as a tough-talking , competent leader who has remained outside party politics with its scandals and corruption allegations .
grybauskaite has vowed to pull her country of 3.34 million " out of the political and economic shadows . " she has been a member of the european commission , the eu executive arm , since lithuania joined the bloc in 2004 .
in her role as a european commission member , grybauskaite has frequently chastised vilnius for having squandered the country 's economic boom and failure to prepare for the deepening recession .
" my conscience as a citizen would n't let me stay in brussels , " she said ahead of the election . " one of the first tasks will be to solve this crisis , to try to stabilize lithuania 's financial position so that the country can climb back up the curve as fast as possible . "
lithuania 's non-partisan incumbent president valdas adamkus , 82 , is retiring after serving two five-year terms , and his successor is due to take the reins in july .
if elected , grybauskaite would be the baltic nation 's first female head of state. rb / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the discussions were to include a " cooperative arrangement and possible merger " of karstadt with metro 's own department store chain , galeria kaufhof .
metro , one of europe 's largest retailers , also runs its own brand name supermarket chain .
arcandor , which operates the quelle mail-order business , karstadt department stores and the thomas cook travel agency chain , has been in trouble for several years , with other retailers chipping away at its market share .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metro ceo cordes proposes a private solution rather than a government bailout in a statement , arcandor boss karl-gerhard eick said he was willing to talk about metro 's proposal , but doubted whether the german competition authorities would allow a merger of the country 's two largest department store chains .
together , karstadt and kaufhof have 247 stores nationwide .
arcandor a victim of the credit crunch last friday , arcandor said it would appeal to chancellor angela merkel 's government for a 650 million euro bailout to stave off collapse .
chief executive eick said a decision was needed within four weeks so that banks could roll over the 650 million in credit that expires on june 12 .
eick said the global economic crisis was making it difficult to obtain new credit without government guarantees .
four months from a general election , the demand could put the government on the spot .
a closure of karstadt and arcandor 's famous century-old kadewe luxury department store in berlin would wipe out a shopping institution – not to mention more than 50,000 jobs. gb / dpa / reuters editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many see grybauskaite as a competent leader who remains outside party politics . european union budget chief dalia grybauskaite appears to have won a resounding victory in lithuania 's presidential election , according to an exit poll .
grybauskaite received 67.9 percent of the first-round vote , far outstripping social democrat candidate algirdas butkevicius who bagged just 11.8 percent .
the exit poll found that the five other candidates lagged far behind butkevicius .
under lithuanian law , half of the country 's 2.7 million registered voters must have voted for a presidential candidate who obtains over 50 percent of the vote to avoid a run-off ballot against the second-ranked rival .
first figures from the country 's electoral commission showed that turnout was still well short of that hurdle .
pulling the country " out of the political and economic shadows " lithuanians have gone to the polls at a time of deep economic recession and disenchantment with politicians .
53-year old grybauskaite is seen as a tough-talking , competent leader who has remained outside party politics with its scandals and corruption allegations .
grybauskaite has vowed to pull her country of 3.34 million " out of the political and economic shadows . " she has been a member of the european commission , the eu executive arm , since lithuania joined the bloc in 2004 .
in her role as a european commission member , grybauskaite has frequently chastised vilnius for having squandered the country 's economic boom and failure to prepare for the deepening recession .
" my conscience as a citizen would n't let me stay in brussels , " she said ahead of the election . " one of the first tasks will be to solve this crisis , to try to stabilize lithuania 's financial position so that the country can climb back up the curve as fast as possible . "
lithuania 's non-partisan incumbent president valdas adamkus , 82 , is retiring after serving two five-year terms , and his successor is due to take the reins in july .
if elected , grybauskaite would be the baltic nation 's first female head of state. rb / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

zeeman says it is constantly changing , as a number of artists and crews express themselves .
" artists do n't only work as individuals .
they are working as crews which you could compare to teams in sports , " she says .
" there can be some kind of battling over space ; that one evening one crew puts one piece of art up , and the next day another crew comes and puts a bigger one on it .
" in that way you can see a wall changing and growing . "

he has been creating urban art for many years and says he does not plan his work .
instead , he says he allows himself to be inspired by the city 's streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stencil and a spray can is all they need to make instant art " when i walk the streets , i paint a lot of trash that is lying around on the street , which you can perfectly legally transform into art , because it is not forbidden to paint on trash .
it is forbidden to leave it on the street , but not to paint on it , " he says .
nomad says items anything from sofas and mattresses to old washing machines are good " canvases " for his paintings .
" i roller paint on it , i spray on it , and most of the time i use a classic marker … because you can carry it all the time with you .
it comes in handy when you are just walking around . "
nomad says he appreciates the urban art guide 's interactive presentation , but he feels when the work is taken off the street and put on the internet , things gets lost in " it translation " .
" i do n't think that urban art happens in galleries , or on the internet .
it does n't happen anywhere but on the street , " nomad said .

many see grybauskaite as a competent leader who remains outside party politics . european union budget chief dalia grybauskaite appears to have won a resounding victory in lithuania 's presidential election , according to an exit poll .
grybauskaite received 67.9 percent of the first-round vote , far outstripping social democrat candidate algirdas butkevicius who bagged just 11.8 percent .
the exit poll found that the five other candidates lagged far behind butkevicius .
under lithuanian law , half of the country 's 2.7 million registered voters must have voted for a presidential candidate who obtains over 50 percent of the vote to avoid a run-off ballot against the second-ranked rival .
first figures from the country 's electoral commission showed that turnout was still well short of that hurdle .

grybauskaite has vowed to pull her country of 3.34 million " out of the political and economic shadows . " she has been a member of the european commission , the eu executive arm , since lithuania joined the bloc in 2004 .
in her role as a european commission member , grybauskaite has frequently chastised vilnius for having squandered the country 's economic boom and failure to prepare for the deepening recession .
" my conscience as a citizen would n't let me stay in brussels , " she said ahead of the election . " one of the first tasks will be to solve this crisis , to try to stabilize lithuania 's financial position so that the country can climb back up the curve as fast as possible . "
lithuania 's non-partisan incumbent president valdas adamkus , 82 , is retiring after serving two five-year terms , and his successor is due to take the reins in july .

grybauskaite received 67.9 percent of the first-round vote , far outstripping social democrat candidate algirdas butkevicius who bagged just 11.8 percent .
the exit poll found that the five other candidates lagged far behind butkevicius .
under lithuanian law , half of the country 's 2.7 million registered voters must have voted for a presidential candidate who obtains over 50 percent of the vote to avoid a run-off ballot against the second-ranked rival .
first figures from the country 's electoral commission showed that turnout was still well short of that hurdle .
pulling the country " out of the political and economic shadows " lithuanians have gone to the polls at a time of deep economic recession and disenchantment with politicians .
53-year old grybauskaite is seen as a tough-talking , competent leader who has remained outside party politics with its scandals and corruption allegations .
grybauskaite has vowed to pull her country of 3.34 million " out of the political and economic shadows . " she has been a member of the european commission , the eu executive arm , since lithuania joined the bloc in 2004 .
in her role as a european commission member , grybauskaite has frequently chastised vilnius for having squandered the country 's economic boom and failure to prepare for the deepening recession .
" my conscience as a citizen would n't let me stay in brussels , " she said ahead of the election . " one of the first tasks will be to solve this crisis , to try to stabilize lithuania 's financial position so that the country can climb back up the curve as fast as possible . "
lithuania 's non-partisan incumbent president valdas adamkus , 82 , is retiring after serving two five-year terms , and his successor is due to take the reins in july .
if elected , grybauskaite would be the baltic nation 's first female head of state. rb / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

over 97 percent of shareholders reportedly backed the decision , passed at a two-day annual shareholders meeting in frankfurt on saturday .
commerzbank , which was forced to ask for state aid last year , is to issue 295 million new shares at a price of six euros per share , according to a statement by the bank .
the government is to acquire the new shares via the financial market stabilisation fund -lrb- soffin -rrb- - the german government 's rescue fund .
on thursday , the european commission approved the second tranche of german state aid to the tune of about 10 billion euros .
the brussels-based body insisted that the plans for the new injection of capital , which comes after a first infusion of eight billion euros , is meant to ensure the bank 's long-term health without giving it an unfair advantage over rivals .
in return for the comission 's approval , commerzbank will be forced to recentre its activities into business and individual retail banking and abandon its investment banking and commercial real-estate activities , which have accounted for about 45 percent of its total activities .
commerzbank chief executive martin blessing told press on friday that the state aid will be paid back in full and that the bank currently does n't require any further state aid .
struggling commerzbank ended 2008 with a sharp loss of 6.6 billion euros , due to the integration of ailing dresdner bank and the global credit crunch .
the bank has stayed in the red in 2009 , posting a net loss of 861 million euros for the first quarter on friday .
following the full integration of the dresdner bank in late january 2009 , commerzbank executives underlined that the restructuring would pay off in the future , forecasting a profit by 2011 at the latest , and an operating profit of more than four billion euros by 2012. nk / afp / dpa editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the brussels-based body insisted that the plans for the new injection of capital , which comes after a first infusion of eight billion euros , is meant to ensure the bank 's long-term health without giving it an unfair advantage over rivals .
in return for the comission 's approval , commerzbank will be forced to recentre its activities into business and individual retail banking and abandon its investment banking and commercial real-estate activities , which have accounted for about 45 percent of its total activities .
commerzbank chief executive martin blessing told press on friday that the state aid will be paid back in full and that the bank currently does n't require any further state aid .
struggling commerzbank ended 2008 with a sharp loss of 6.6 billion euros , due to the integration of ailing dresdner bank and the global credit crunch .
the bank has stayed in the red in 2009 , posting a net loss of 861 million euros for the first quarter on friday .
following the full integration of the dresdner bank in late january 2009 , commerzbank executives underlined that the restructuring would pay off in the future , forecasting a profit by 2011 at the latest , and an operating profit of more than four billion euros by 2012. nk / afp / dpa editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the tigers have been fighting for a separate , independent state on the indian ocean island for 25 years . sri lankan president rajapakse says the rebels have been defeated militarily .
according to the country 's forces , all civilians who were trapped by fighting between government troops and rebels in the northeast of the country have now escaped .
the military said over 50,000 people had fled the area north of the town of mullataivu over the past three days .
however , reports say that the area on sunday was wracked by chaos and that it was therefore difficult to independently confirm the government statements .
tamil tiger founding leader vellupillai prabhakaran was reportedly shot dead on monday while trying to drive out of the battle zone in an ambulance , according to senior defense officials .
state television also broadcast images of of the corpse of prabhakaran 's son charles anthony , who has also reportedly been killed .
the military , and people who have escaped the fighting , say tamil rebels had been using civilians as human shields .

"
" this is the need of the hour , " he wrote .
" these are historically unprecedented times and require historically prudent decisions . "
" our only regrets , " he went on to say , " are for the lives lost and that we could not hold out for longer . "
earlier , an army spokesman had said fighting was continuing against last pockets of resistance by tamil tiger rebels , who are reportedly cut off from any ocean access and confined to a square kilometer of territory .
on sunday , the army said it had foiled a last-ditch , pre-dawn attempt by tamil rebels to breach military defenses and killed 70 fighters trying to escape .
a military spokesman , brig. udaya nanayakkara also said at least one suicide bomber had attacked sri lankan troops .
he gave no further details , however .
the pro-rebel tamil net website , citing a doctor in the area , said the bodies of hundreds of wounded and dead people lay strewn across the battlefront .
at least 70,000 people are estimated to have died in the conflict since it began in 1983. gb / reuters / ap editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the tigers have been fighting for a separate , independent state on the indian ocean island for 25 years . sri lankan president rajapakse says the rebels have been defeated militarily .
according to the country 's forces , all civilians who were trapped by fighting between government troops and rebels in the northeast of the country have now escaped .
the military said over 50,000 people had fled the area north of the town of mullataivu over the past three days .
however , reports say that the area on sunday was wracked by chaos and that it was therefore difficult to independently confirm the government statements .

musical " the producers " takes the stage in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a simpering , silly hitler is the centerpiece of " the producers " ' flop turned satiric hit they sing , they dance , they conquer france !
stormtroopers and a simpering , silly hitler take the stage in the berlin production of musical comedy " the producers " .
is germany ready to laugh at its own taboos ? andreas bieber , one of the stars of the new production at berlin 's admiralspalast theatre , wants one thing to be clear : " people think it 's a musical about hitler – of course that 's not the case . " but that notorious name is part of what is raising eyebrows over the show , which has goose-stepping as well as tap-dancing , and mines taboos for comic effect . " the producers " tells the story of two theatrical ne 'er do wells , lecherous has-been max bialystock , and wimpy wannabe leopold bloom , who discover that flops can make more money than hits .
they set out to produce the loser of all losers – a musical about hitler , written by and starring a demented neo-nazi , and directed by a flamboyant gay director , which is " certain to offend people of all races , creeds and religions , and guaranteed to close in one night . "
surprisingly , when the manic but macho lead is replaced with a campy , outrageous performance by the director , the fascist frolic is taken for brilliant satire .
" springtime for hitler " becomes a smash hit , and the producers end up in jail for defrauding their backers .
bildunterschrift : singing , dancing nazis storm the stage in " the producers " american comedy icon mel brooks ' original 1968 movie sparked a tony-award winning 2001 broadway show , which in turn was made into a 2005 musical film .
audiences in london , tokyo , athens and even tel aviv have all fallen for the crazy comedy .
but a german-language version was lacking until last summer 's production in vienna , austria .
a love letter to a lost culture , or a risky joke ?
the production is now on stage in berlin .
titus hoffmann , resident director at the admiralspalast for the production of " the producers " , calls the show a love letter to show business , including an entertainment culture that once thrived in the german capital .
" there was a huge cabaret scene , lots of satirical , ironic , funny people , that were killed in the third reich then , or they had to leave and they went to america and a lot of those people went to new york and worked on broadway .
" and somehow , it feels a bit like it 's a return , and it brings the humor back to the country , which is so great .
because apart from all the awful and terrible things that happened through hitler , what still is lacking a little in germany is good humor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : controversial banners announce the german premier of the musical " the producers " so far , not everyone here is getting the joke .
local papers have described the show as " risky " and even the production 's advertising has caused a fuss .
it 's illegal to portray the swastika publicly in germany , so the casually reclining hitler in poster ads for the play wears an armband displaying a pretzel .
banners showing the doughy treat in black on a red and white banner have been hanging in the theatre courtyard for months . they 've garnered double-takes from passersby , and a few complaints to the police .
the storm troopers wear the real thing when they take the stage , though , due to a theatrical exception . equal opportunity offender in some ways , brooks ' classic can be seen as an equal opportunity offender , with jokes about gays , jews , dumb blondes and sex-crazed little old ladies . the humor at times relies on pratfalls and slapstick .
the song lyrics are especially clever jabs , rhyming nazi with " hotsy-totsy " and declaring , " we 're marching to a faster pace .
look out , here comes the master race ! "
some of the biggest laughs at friday night 's preview show came thanks to nutty neo-nazi playwright franz liebkind , who wears lederhosen and a german military helmet , and has a flock of teutonic-titled pigeons .
he insists that the two producers join him in wearing a swastika armband and taking an oath in the name of " adolph elizabeth hitler . "
max bialystock grabs the red band , turns it this way and that , and describes it as " idiot proof " since the symbol looks the same from either direction – the audience exploded with delighted guffaws .
" it 's not ok to make fun of the holocaust .
but hitler as a person , is ok to ridicule . "
still there 's a slight uneasiness that comes from seeing one-armed salutes in a city with such a tortured history , agrees nigel west , the production 's director . " when you see the show in america , you do n't think twice about it .
because of where we are , you do think twice about it … of course there 's a large age group that could still be affected by what went on , but people hopefully below the age of 60 will come and they 'll forgive and they 'll go with it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actor martin sommerlatte plays adolf hitler in the musical " the producers " 34-year-old sven schmidt lived up to west 's hopes – although surprised by some of the scenes , schmidt said he laughed a lot , and his only complaint was that the second half lagged a little .
" it 's another generation .
we do n't have that much to do with it anymore , " schmidt said .
" this was a parody of hitler , so it 's ok to laugh .
other things , it might not be ok to laugh at .
it 's not ok to make fun of the holocaust .
but hitler as a person is ok to ridicule " .
actor andreas bieber thinks berlin is the perfect place for brooks ' hit .
he hopes audiences will come to the performance knowing what the show is about , and ready to let themselves enjoy it . " berlin of course is the city where it all happened .
and everybody 's reminded about that all the time .
it 's really not about denying history and what happened , but we have to move on , and we have to look at things from a different angle , and it 's great to do that in the city where it all happened . "
previews of " the producers " take place this weekend , with the official premier of the musical sunday evening .
the production is currently booked for a two and a half month run .
response in vienna was muted , with the scheduled run of a year cut to 10 months .
but the cast and crew hope that in berlin , the show will go on - and on . author : susan stone editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a love letter to a lost culture , or a risky joke ?
the production is now on stage in berlin .
titus hoffmann , resident director at the admiralspalast for the production of " the producers " , calls the show a love letter to show business , including an entertainment culture that once thrived in the german capital .
" there was a huge cabaret scene , lots of satirical , ironic , funny people , that were killed in the third reich then , or they had to leave and they went to america and a lot of those people went to new york and worked on broadway .

because apart from all the awful and terrible things that happened through hitler , what still is lacking a little in germany is good humor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : controversial banners announce the german premier of the musical " the producers " so far , not everyone here is getting the joke .

the song lyrics are especially clever jabs , rhyming nazi with " hotsy-totsy " and declaring , " we 're marching to a faster pace .
look out , here comes the master race ! "
some of the biggest laughs at friday night 's preview show came thanks to nutty neo-nazi playwright franz liebkind , who wears lederhosen and a german military helmet , and has a flock of teutonic-titled pigeons .
he insists that the two producers join him in wearing a swastika armband and taking an oath in the name of " adolph elizabeth hitler . "
max bialystock grabs the red band , turns it this way and that , and describes it as " idiot proof " since the symbol looks the same from either direction – the audience exploded with delighted guffaws .
" it 's not ok to make fun of the holocaust .
but hitler as a person , is ok to ridicule . "
still there 's a slight uneasiness that comes from seeing one-armed salutes in a city with such a tortured history , agrees nigel west , the production 's director . " when you see the show in america , you do n't think twice about it .
because of where we are , you do think twice about it … of course there 's a large age group that could still be affected by what went on , but people hopefully below the age of 60 will come and they 'll forgive and they 'll go with it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actor martin sommerlatte plays adolf hitler in the musical " the producers " 34-year-old sven schmidt lived up to west 's hopes – although surprised by some of the scenes , schmidt said he laughed a lot , and his only complaint was that the second half lagged a little .
" it 's another generation .

" this was a parody of hitler , so it 's ok to laugh .

stormtroopers and a simpering , silly hitler take the stage in the berlin production of musical comedy " the producers " .
is germany ready to laugh at its own taboos ? andreas bieber , one of the stars of the new production at berlin 's admiralspalast theatre , wants one thing to be clear : " people think it 's a musical about hitler – of course that 's not the case . " but that notorious name is part of what is raising eyebrows over the show , which has goose-stepping as well as tap-dancing , and mines taboos for comic effect .

they set out to produce the loser of all losers – a musical about hitler , written by and starring a demented neo-nazi , and directed by a flamboyant gay director , which is " certain to offend people of all races , creeds and religions , and guaranteed to close in one night . "
surprisingly , when the manic but macho lead is replaced with a campy , outrageous performance by the director , the fascist frolic is taken for brilliant satire .

a love letter to a lost culture , or a risky joke ?
the production is now on stage in berlin .
titus hoffmann , resident director at the admiralspalast for the production of " the producers " , calls the show a love letter to show business , including an entertainment culture that once thrived in the german capital .

banners showing the doughy treat in black on a red and white banner have been hanging in the theatre courtyard for months . they 've garnered double-takes from passersby , and a few complaints to the police .

musical " the producers " takes the stage in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a simpering , silly hitler is the centerpiece of " the producers " ' flop turned satiric hit they sing , they dance , they conquer france !
stormtroopers and a simpering , silly hitler take the stage in the berlin production of musical comedy " the producers " .
is germany ready to laugh at its own taboos ? andreas bieber , one of the stars of the new production at berlin 's admiralspalast theatre , wants one thing to be clear : " people think it 's a musical about hitler – of course that 's not the case . " but that notorious name is part of what is raising eyebrows over the show , which has goose-stepping as well as tap-dancing , and mines taboos for comic effect . " the producers " tells the story of two theatrical ne 'er do wells , lecherous has-been max bialystock , and wimpy wannabe leopold bloom , who discover that flops can make more money than hits .
they set out to produce the loser of all losers – a musical about hitler , written by and starring a demented neo-nazi , and directed by a flamboyant gay director , which is " certain to offend people of all races , creeds and religions , and guaranteed to close in one night . "
surprisingly , when the manic but macho lead is replaced with a campy , outrageous performance by the director , the fascist frolic is taken for brilliant satire .
" springtime for hitler " becomes a smash hit , and the producers end up in jail for defrauding their backers .
bildunterschrift : singing , dancing nazis storm the stage in " the producers " american comedy icon mel brooks ' original 1968 movie sparked a tony-award winning 2001 broadway show , which in turn was made into a 2005 musical film .
audiences in london , tokyo , athens and even tel aviv have all fallen for the crazy comedy .
but a german-language version was lacking until last summer 's production in vienna , austria .
a love letter to a lost culture , or a risky joke ?
the production is now on stage in berlin .
titus hoffmann , resident director at the admiralspalast for the production of " the producers " , calls the show a love letter to show business , including an entertainment culture that once thrived in the german capital .
" there was a huge cabaret scene , lots of satirical , ironic , funny people , that were killed in the third reich then , or they had to leave and they went to america and a lot of those people went to new york and worked on broadway .
" and somehow , it feels a bit like it 's a return , and it brings the humor back to the country , which is so great .
because apart from all the awful and terrible things that happened through hitler , what still is lacking a little in germany is good humor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : controversial banners announce the german premier of the musical " the producers " so far , not everyone here is getting the joke .
local papers have described the show as " risky " and even the production 's advertising has caused a fuss .
it 's illegal to portray the swastika publicly in germany , so the casually reclining hitler in poster ads for the play wears an armband displaying a pretzel .
banners showing the doughy treat in black on a red and white banner have been hanging in the theatre courtyard for months . they 've garnered double-takes from passersby , and a few complaints to the police .
the storm troopers wear the real thing when they take the stage , though , due to a theatrical exception . equal opportunity offender in some ways , brooks ' classic can be seen as an equal opportunity offender , with jokes about gays , jews , dumb blondes and sex-crazed little old ladies . the humor at times relies on pratfalls and slapstick .

fdp leader guido westerwelle says the free democrats are now keeping all options open . " we want to rule , " party leader guido westerwelle said to over 500 fdp delegates at a party convention over the weekend .
general elections in germany are due in september this year and traditionally the liberals ' goal would be to join forces as junior partners with angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
opinion polls show , however , that a coalition between the fdp and the cdu is unlikely to gain a ruling majority .
so , the free democrats are forced to keep their options open .
westerwelle on sunday reconfirmed his preference for the cdu , but added that his party also would n't exclude forming a three-way coalition with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens .
announcement to come before upcoming elections the fdp , germany 's third largest party behind the cdu and the spd , concluded their party convention on sunday saying that any concrete plans for a possible coalition would only be announced one week ahead of september ’ s election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : struck says the free democrats must join the spd and the greens if they want to rule peter struck , the chairman of the spd 's parliamentary faction , told the german newspaper welt am sonntag in a sunday interview that the fdp would have to enter a coalition with the spd and the greens if it wanted to win a majority in the general elections .
" it does n't matter what guido westerwelle says at this point : the free democrats will have to be ready to enter a coalition with the spd and the greens if they want to rule .
otherwise they would risk being out of power until at least 2013 , making it 15 years since they have been a part of a ruling coalition .
westerwelle would n't risk that , " he said .
fdp running on tax reform the economy is likely to be one of the main battlegrounds in the september election , and the fdp has vehemently criticized merkel 's coalition policies , in particular state bailouts and government stimulus measures .
" if a big company goes bust , the german eagle flies in .
if a small company goes bust , the bankruptcy vultures arrive , " westerwelle said with both fists clenched at the weekend convention .
westerwelle has also promised tax cuts to help lift germany out of its deepest recession since the end of the second world war .
the fdp election campaign promises an overhaul of the german tax system and a reduction of the burden on middle class families to the tune of up to 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 47.40 billion -rrb- .
" tax cuts will help the economy more than subsidizing one branch after the other .
we should relieve the burden on the middle classes .
that is the best answer to the downturn , " he said. glb / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

over 97 percent of shareholders reportedly backed the decision , passed at a two-day annual shareholders meeting in frankfurt on saturday .
commerzbank , which was forced to ask for state aid last year , is to issue 295 million new shares at a price of six euros per share , according to a statement by the bank .
the government is to acquire the new shares via the financial market stabilisation fund -lrb- soffin -rrb- - the german government 's rescue fund .
on thursday , the european commission approved the second tranche of german state aid to the tune of about 10 billion euros .
the brussels-based body insisted that the plans for the new injection of capital , which comes after a first infusion of eight billion euros , is meant to ensure the bank 's long-term health without giving it an unfair advantage over rivals .
in return for the comission 's approval , commerzbank will be forced to recentre its activities into business and individual retail banking and abandon its investment banking and commercial real-estate activities , which have accounted for about 45 percent of its total activities .
commerzbank chief executive martin blessing told press on friday that the state aid will be paid back in full and that the bank currently does n't require any further state aid .
struggling commerzbank ended 2008 with a sharp loss of 6.6 billion euros , due to the integration of ailing dresdner bank and the global credit crunch .
the bank has stayed in the red in 2009 , posting a net loss of 861 million euros for the first quarter on friday .
following the full integration of the dresdner bank in late january 2009 , commerzbank executives underlined that the restructuring would pay off in the future , forecasting a profit by 2011 at the latest , and an operating profit of more than four billion euros by 2012. nk / afp / dpa editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

from graffiti to sticker art , cut-outs , stencils , installations , and paste-ups , today the streets of berlin are an open gallery for those who appreciate urban art .
and now the internet and digital media have taken that a step further to document and curate interesting and unique examples of the form , with the recently launched " urban art guide " .
bildunterschrift : cut-outs and stickers from all over the city are being archived online it is a digital application that that can be used online and on iphones , and has three basic tools .
one is called " locate me " , and it includes a berlin map which outlines the pieces of urban art in the vicinity , information about them , the artist and how to get there .
another function is the gallery view , which includes more than a hundred pieces of urban art , while the third offers selected tours , mapped out in berlin 's hippest neighborhoods and highlights the best of the city 's street art . maria zeeman , from the guide 's editorial staff , says they are discovering new works daily , which they add to the urban art guide .
she says users of the guide are also helping .
" they find something and say , that 's interesting , smart , cute or romantic .
" we are more a platform for people exchanging ideas on what is the newest , what is the best idea , what is arty , what is not , " zeeman said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two singing woman on a berlin wall - graffiti or art ?
the " urban art church " in the heart of berlin , those on the hunt for real urban art can find the " urban art church " .
everything , from the ceiling , door and even the mailboxes are covered in what looks like one large eclectic collage : comic-like figures , a line of underwear hanging on a clothes line , a large serpent , robots , as well as graphic erotic scenes .
this is the cumulative work of many urban artists .
zeeman says it is constantly changing , as a number of artists and crews express themselves .
" artists do n't only work as individuals .
they are working as crews which you could compare to teams in sports , " she says .
" there can be some kind of battling over space ; that one evening one crew puts one piece of art up , and the next day another crew comes and puts a bigger one on it .
" in that way you can see a wall changing and growing . "
meeting the urban artist behind the art nomad is one of the berlin urban artists whose work is well-represented in the guide .
he has been creating urban art for many years and says he does not plan his work .
instead , he says he allows himself to be inspired by the city 's streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stencil and a spray can is all they need to make instant art " when i walk the streets , i paint a lot of trash that is lying around on the street , which you can perfectly legally transform into art , because it is not forbidden to paint on trash .
it is forbidden to leave it on the street , but not to paint on it , " he says .
nomad says items anything from sofas and mattresses to old washing machines are good " canvases " for his paintings .
" i roller paint on it , i spray on it , and most of the time i use a classic marker … because you can carry it all the time with you .
it comes in handy when you are just walking around . "
nomad says he appreciates the urban art guide 's interactive presentation , but he feels when the work is taken off the street and put on the internet , things gets lost in " it translation " .
" i do n't think that urban art happens in galleries , or on the internet .
it does n't happen anywhere but on the street , " nomad said .

sunday 's protests were organized by the kemalist thought association -lrb- kta -rrb- , an organization dedicated to preserving the legacy of mustafa kemal ataturk -lrb- 1881-1938 -rrb- , the founder of the modern turkish republic .
the marchers were waving red and white turkish flags and were headed for the mausoleum of ataturk , the traditional rallying point of those in favor of secular rule .
qualms with prime minister the demonstrators protested what they called the anti-secular principles of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
his opponents accuse him of attempting to make turkey more overtly islamic through incremental steps , such as failing to end bans on islamic-style headscarves at turkish universities .
protestors also accused the akp of seeking to replace turkey 's secular system with a regime based on sharia , or koranic law .
the akp does have religious roots but has rejected being referred to as " islamist " .
secularists are concerned about the rise of erdogan 's justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , and the election by the akp-controlled parliament of abdullah gul as president .
demonstrators were also protesting the government 's handling of the economy as unemployment in the country has reached a record high amid the global economic downturn. glb / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 17.05.2009 opinion : while the war may be over , peace is still some way off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a couple of years ago few would have believed that asia 's longest running civil war was drawing to a close .
deutsche welle 's ranjitha balasubramanyam says while the war may be over , peace is still some way off . as the sri lankan military 's mop-up operations continue in what appears to be the culmination of a long-drawn-out war against the liberation tigers of tamil eelam , a senior rebel leader has been quoted as saying that the battle has " reached its bitter end " .
in an apparent admission of defeat , selvarasa pathmanathan , the tigers ' chief of international relations , also said in a statement on a pro-rebel website that they had " decided to silence " their guns .
some observers and certainly the government of president mahinda rajapakse believe the tigers had little choice , having been boxed into a tiny patch of land not exceeding a few square kilometres in the northeast of the island nation .
so , few are likely to be taken in by the rebel claim that they have decided to give up fighting entirely on account of their desire " to remove the last weak excuse of the enemy for killing our people . "
paradoxes in the plot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over the years tens of thousands have been killed in the fighting .
from the onset , president rajapakse made no bones about the fact that his government sought to crush the ltte militarily while keeping the door open for negotiations .
ironically , it was ltte leader velupillai prabhakaran who was largely instrumental in the 2005 presidential poll victory for rajapakse , already a hardliner .
the ltte had ordered the people of the tamil-dominated north and east of the country to boycott the polls .
that directive from the rebels , who had a stranglehold on the population in the region , resulted in a defeat for incumbent prime minister ranil wickremesinghe , in the absence of support from a large segment of the tamil electorate .
again , paradoxically , it was wickremesinghe who had pushed for a political solution and initiated a ceasefire with the rebels in 2002 .
i clearly remember the bewilderment on wickremesinghe 's face as the tigers ' " decree " filtered down to southern sri lanka .
one must remember that the capital colombo in the south west of the country is in the midst of the majority sinhala community , while the various tamil-dominated parts of the country lie in the north – primarily former tiger stronghold jaffna , the wanni mainland , and the eastern districts of trincomalee , batticaloa and ampara . in the years that i spent in the island nation , there was little doubt that there was an effective " internal border " demarcating the sinhala and tamil / muslim majority areas of the country .
wasted opportunity most people in the sinhala-dominated south saw the 2002 ceasefire as a complete farce and feared that it simply afforded the tigers the chance to re-arm and strengthen their fighting ranks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tigers are accused of using child soldiers in their armed struggle ultimately , it emerged that those fears were not entirely unfounded .
some analysts say the tigers - banned in sri lanka , india and the us - also used their new-found clout and freedoms under the ceasefire to assassinate several political opponents .
they did all this in total disregard for the peace efforts facilitated by norway , which had the eu 's backing .
in the end , the international community was disenchanted with the tigers ' conduct during the " ceasefire " years , and the manner in which they stymied the peace talks .
once it became apparent that neither side cared for norway 's intervention , oslo had little choice but to bow out .
eventually the eu also listed the ltte as a terrorist group .
for those of us who watched the events unfold in sri lanka from close quarters , there was a sense of dismay at the lost opportunity – not simply that the " ceasefire " was n't for real but that the tigers , who had time and again shown remarkable organisational and strategic skills , had failed to make use of their " ticket " to the political mainstream .
western powers snubbed in recent weeks , as the military stepped up the war in the north , the un said thousands of innocent people had been killed in the conflict zone with some 50,000 others being trapped .
president rajapakse 's government thumbed its nose at the international community , shrugging off condemnation of the manner in which it has pushed ahead with its military offensive .
the sri lankan government also angered the eu a couple of weeks ago by refusing entry to the swedish foreign minister who had planned to accompany his british and french counterparts to the country to press for an immediate truce .
the uk 's david miliband and france 's bernard kouchner visited colombo to urge the two sides to cease fire in order to enable the un to evacuate civilians .
however , the rajapakse government , which was convinced that victory was close at hand , rejected their pleas .
now it appears by all accounts that the ltte 's armed struggle has been finished off , and that the tigers are a spent force .
few would have believed just a couple of years ago that asia 's longest running civil war was drawing to a close .
the rebels ran a de-facto state covering nearly one-third of the country .
they had set up a parallel administrative and social infrastructure , complete with their own schools , a bank , courts , a taxation system , a civil service and even a border control mechanism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the end of war mean an end to bombings , destruction and suffering ?
and in the south , they spread terror through suicide bombings and political assassinations .
few of us who lived through the bombings in colombo can erase memories of the carnage , destruction and the utter dread that resulted .
post-war scenario now the question that 's on most observers ' minds is whether rajapakse , who has won adulation from his sinhala constituency for achieving what seemed to be a near-impossible task will also be able to persuade the large and divided tamil community - many in the outside world view sri lankan tamils as a monolithic entity and they could n't be farther from the truth - that his government will provide a benevolent and constructive leadership for all .
it would seem to me that even those of the fractured tamil community that did n't subscribe to the rebels ' strategies must find the speed at which the tiger infrastructure has crumbled extremely incomprehensible .
moreover , they must now adapt to a life without the tigers .
that said , some caution that military victory may not spell peace , as the tigers could well return to guerrilla warfare .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 17.05.2009 lithuania set for first female president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seven candidates ran for the top job lithuanians have gone to the polls at a time of deep economic recession and disenchantment with politicians .
many see grybauskaite as a competent leader who remains outside party politics . european union budget chief dalia grybauskaite appears to have won a resounding victory in lithuania 's presidential election , according to an exit poll .
grybauskaite received 67.9 percent of the first-round vote , far outstripping social democrat candidate algirdas butkevicius who bagged just 11.8 percent .
the exit poll found that the five other candidates lagged far behind butkevicius .
under lithuanian law , half of the country 's 2.7 million registered voters must have voted for a presidential candidate who obtains over 50 percent of the vote to avoid a run-off ballot against the second-ranked rival .
first figures from the country 's electoral commission showed that turnout was still well short of that hurdle .
pulling the country " out of the political and economic shadows " lithuanians have gone to the polls at a time of deep economic recession and disenchantment with politicians .
53-year old grybauskaite is seen as a tough-talking , competent leader who has remained outside party politics with its scandals and corruption allegations .

from graffiti to sticker art , cut-outs , stencils , installations , and paste-ups , today the streets of berlin are an open gallery for those who appreciate urban art .
and now the internet and digital media have taken that a step further to document and curate interesting and unique examples of the form , with the recently launched " urban art guide " .
bildunterschrift : cut-outs and stickers from all over the city are being archived online it is a digital application that that can be used online and on iphones , and has three basic tools .
one is called " locate me " , and it includes a berlin map which outlines the pieces of urban art in the vicinity , information about them , the artist and how to get there .
another function is the gallery view , which includes more than a hundred pieces of urban art , while the third offers selected tours , mapped out in berlin 's hippest neighborhoods and highlights the best of the city 's street art . maria zeeman , from the guide 's editorial staff , says they are discovering new works daily , which they add to the urban art guide .
she says users of the guide are also helping .
" they find something and say , that 's interesting , smart , cute or romantic .
" we are more a platform for people exchanging ideas on what is the newest , what is the best idea , what is arty , what is not , " zeeman said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two singing woman on a berlin wall - graffiti or art ?
the " urban art church " in the heart of berlin , those on the hunt for real urban art can find the " urban art church " .
everything , from the ceiling , door and even the mailboxes are covered in what looks like one large eclectic collage : comic-like figures , a line of underwear hanging on a clothes line , a large serpent , robots , as well as graphic erotic scenes .
this is the cumulative work of many urban artists .
zeeman says it is constantly changing , as a number of artists and crews express themselves .
" artists do n't only work as individuals .
they are working as crews which you could compare to teams in sports , " she says .
" there can be some kind of battling over space ; that one evening one crew puts one piece of art up , and the next day another crew comes and puts a bigger one on it .
" in that way you can see a wall changing and growing . "
meeting the urban artist behind the art nomad is one of the berlin urban artists whose work is well-represented in the guide .
he has been creating urban art for many years and says he does not plan his work .
instead , he says he allows himself to be inspired by the city 's streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stencil and a spray can is all they need to make instant art " when i walk the streets , i paint a lot of trash that is lying around on the street , which you can perfectly legally transform into art , because it is not forbidden to paint on trash .
it is forbidden to leave it on the street , but not to paint on it , " he says .
nomad says items anything from sofas and mattresses to old washing machines are good " canvases " for his paintings .
" i roller paint on it , i spray on it , and most of the time i use a classic marker … because you can carry it all the time with you .
it comes in handy when you are just walking around . "
nomad says he appreciates the urban art guide 's interactive presentation , but he feels when the work is taken off the street and put on the internet , things gets lost in " it translation " .
" i do n't think that urban art happens in galleries , or on the internet .
it does n't happen anywhere but on the street , " nomad said .

from graffiti to sticker art , cut-outs , stencils , installations , and paste-ups , today the streets of berlin are an open gallery for those who appreciate urban art .
and now the internet and digital media have taken that a step further to document and curate interesting and unique examples of the form , with the recently launched " urban art guide " .
bildunterschrift : cut-outs and stickers from all over the city are being archived online it is a digital application that that can be used online and on iphones , and has three basic tools .
one is called " locate me " , and it includes a berlin map which outlines the pieces of urban art in the vicinity , information about them , the artist and how to get there .
another function is the gallery view , which includes more than a hundred pieces of urban art , while the third offers selected tours , mapped out in berlin 's hippest neighborhoods and highlights the best of the city 's street art . maria zeeman , from the guide 's editorial staff , says they are discovering new works daily , which they add to the urban art guide .
she says users of the guide are also helping .
" they find something and say , that 's interesting , smart , cute or romantic .
" we are more a platform for people exchanging ideas on what is the newest , what is the best idea , what is arty , what is not , " zeeman said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two singing woman on a berlin wall - graffiti or art ?
the " urban art church " in the heart of berlin , those on the hunt for real urban art can find the " urban art church " .
everything , from the ceiling , door and even the mailboxes are covered in what looks like one large eclectic collage : comic-like figures , a line of underwear hanging on a clothes line , a large serpent , robots , as well as graphic erotic scenes .
this is the cumulative work of many urban artists .
zeeman says it is constantly changing , as a number of artists and crews express themselves .
" artists do n't only work as individuals .
they are working as crews which you could compare to teams in sports , " she says .
" there can be some kind of battling over space ; that one evening one crew puts one piece of art up , and the next day another crew comes and puts a bigger one on it .
" in that way you can see a wall changing and growing . "
meeting the urban artist behind the art nomad is one of the berlin urban artists whose work is well-represented in the guide .
he has been creating urban art for many years and says he does not plan his work .
instead , he says he allows himself to be inspired by the city 's streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stencil and a spray can is all they need to make instant art " when i walk the streets , i paint a lot of trash that is lying around on the street , which you can perfectly legally transform into art , because it is not forbidden to paint on trash .
it is forbidden to leave it on the street , but not to paint on it , " he says .
nomad says items anything from sofas and mattresses to old washing machines are good " canvases " for his paintings .
" i roller paint on it , i spray on it , and most of the time i use a classic marker … because you can carry it all the time with you .
it comes in handy when you are just walking around . "
nomad says he appreciates the urban art guide 's interactive presentation , but he feels when the work is taken off the street and put on the internet , things gets lost in " it translation " .
" i do n't think that urban art happens in galleries , or on the internet .
it does n't happen anywhere but on the street , " nomad said .

over 97 percent of shareholders reportedly backed the decision , passed at a two-day annual shareholders meeting in frankfurt on saturday .
commerzbank , which was forced to ask for state aid last year , is to issue 295 million new shares at a price of six euros per share , according to a statement by the bank .
the government is to acquire the new shares via the financial market stabilisation fund -lrb- soffin -rrb- - the german government 's rescue fund .
on thursday , the european commission approved the second tranche of german state aid to the tune of about 10 billion euros .
the brussels-based body insisted that the plans for the new injection of capital , which comes after a first infusion of eight billion euros , is meant to ensure the bank 's long-term health without giving it an unfair advantage over rivals .
in return for the comission 's approval , commerzbank will be forced to recentre its activities into business and individual retail banking and abandon its investment banking and commercial real-estate activities , which have accounted for about 45 percent of its total activities .
commerzbank chief executive martin blessing told press on friday that the state aid will be paid back in full and that the bank currently does n't require any further state aid .
struggling commerzbank ended 2008 with a sharp loss of 6.6 billion euros , due to the integration of ailing dresdner bank and the global credit crunch .
the bank has stayed in the red in 2009 , posting a net loss of 861 million euros for the first quarter on friday .
following the full integration of the dresdner bank in late january 2009 , commerzbank executives underlined that the restructuring would pay off in the future , forecasting a profit by 2011 at the latest , and an operating profit of more than four billion euros by 2012. nk / afp / dpa editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in return for the comission 's approval , commerzbank will be forced to recentre its activities into business and individual retail banking and abandon its investment banking and commercial real-estate activities , which have accounted for about 45 percent of its total activities .
commerzbank chief executive martin blessing told press on friday that the state aid will be paid back in full and that the bank currently does n't require any further state aid .
struggling commerzbank ended 2008 with a sharp loss of 6.6 billion euros , due to the integration of ailing dresdner bank and the global credit crunch .
the bank has stayed in the red in 2009 , posting a net loss of 861 million euros for the first quarter on friday .
following the full integration of the dresdner bank in late january 2009 , commerzbank executives underlined that the restructuring would pay off in the future , forecasting a profit by 2011 at the latest , and an operating profit of more than four billion euros by 2012. nk / afp / dpa editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the tigers have been fighting for a separate , independent state on the indian ocean island for 25 years . sri lankan president rajapakse says the rebels have been defeated militarily .
according to the country 's forces , all civilians who were trapped by fighting between government troops and rebels in the northeast of the country have now escaped .
the military said over 50,000 people had fled the area north of the town of mullataivu over the past three days .
however , reports say that the area on sunday was wracked by chaos and that it was therefore difficult to independently confirm the government statements .
tamil tiger founding leader vellupillai prabhakaran was reportedly shot dead on monday while trying to drive out of the battle zone in an ambulance , according to senior defense officials .
state television also broadcast images of of the corpse of prabhakaran 's son charles anthony , who has also reportedly been killed .
the military , and people who have escaped the fighting , say tamil rebels had been using civilians as human shields .

"
" this is the need of the hour , " he wrote .
" these are historically unprecedented times and require historically prudent decisions . "
" our only regrets , " he went on to say , " are for the lives lost and that we could not hold out for longer . "
earlier , an army spokesman had said fighting was continuing against last pockets of resistance by tamil tiger rebels , who are reportedly cut off from any ocean access and confined to a square kilometer of territory .
on sunday , the army said it had foiled a last-ditch , pre-dawn attempt by tamil rebels to breach military defenses and killed 70 fighters trying to escape .
a military spokesman , brig. udaya nanayakkara also said at least one suicide bomber had attacked sri lankan troops .
he gave no further details , however .
the pro-rebel tamil net website , citing a doctor in the area , said the bodies of hundreds of wounded and dead people lay strewn across the battlefront .
at least 70,000 people are estimated to have died in the conflict since it began in 1983. gb / reuters / ap editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

is germany ready to laugh at its own taboos ? andreas bieber , one of the stars of the new production at berlin 's admiralspalast theatre , wants one thing to be clear : " people think it 's a musical about hitler – of course that 's not the case . " but that notorious name is part of what is raising eyebrows over the show , which has goose-stepping as well as tap-dancing , and mines taboos for comic effect . " the producers " tells the story of two theatrical ne 'er do wells , lecherous has-been max bialystock , and wimpy wannabe leopold bloom , who discover that flops can make more money than hits .
they set out to produce the loser of all losers – a musical about hitler , written by and starring a demented neo-nazi , and directed by a flamboyant gay director , which is " certain to offend people of all races , creeds and religions , and guaranteed to close in one night . "
surprisingly , when the manic but macho lead is replaced with a campy , outrageous performance by the director , the fascist frolic is taken for brilliant satire .
" springtime for hitler " becomes a smash hit , and the producers end up in jail for defrauding their backers .
bildunterschrift : singing , dancing nazis storm the stage in " the producers " american comedy icon mel brooks ' original 1968 movie sparked a tony-award winning 2001 broadway show , which in turn was made into a 2005 musical film .
audiences in london , tokyo , athens and even tel aviv have all fallen for the crazy comedy .
but a german-language version was lacking until last summer 's production in vienna , austria .
a love letter to a lost culture , or a risky joke ?
the production is now on stage in berlin .
titus hoffmann , resident director at the admiralspalast for the production of " the producers " , calls the show a love letter to show business , including an entertainment culture that once thrived in the german capital .
" there was a huge cabaret scene , lots of satirical , ironic , funny people , that were killed in the third reich then , or they had to leave and they went to america and a lot of those people went to new york and worked on broadway .
" and somehow , it feels a bit like it 's a return , and it brings the humor back to the country , which is so great .
because apart from all the awful and terrible things that happened through hitler , what still is lacking a little in germany is good humor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : controversial banners announce the german premier of the musical " the producers " so far , not everyone here is getting the joke .
local papers have described the show as " risky " and even the production 's advertising has caused a fuss .
it 's illegal to portray the swastika publicly in germany , so the casually reclining hitler in poster ads for the play wears an armband displaying a pretzel .
banners showing the doughy treat in black on a red and white banner have been hanging in the theatre courtyard for months . they 've garnered double-takes from passersby , and a few complaints to the police .
the storm troopers wear the real thing when they take the stage , though , due to a theatrical exception . equal opportunity offender in some ways , brooks ' classic can be seen as an equal opportunity offender , with jokes about gays , jews , dumb blondes and sex-crazed little old ladies . the humor at times relies on pratfalls and slapstick .
the song lyrics are especially clever jabs , rhyming nazi with " hotsy-totsy " and declaring , " we 're marching to a faster pace .
look out , here comes the master race ! "
some of the biggest laughs at friday night 's preview show came thanks to nutty neo-nazi playwright franz liebkind , who wears lederhosen and a german military helmet , and has a flock of teutonic-titled pigeons .
he insists that the two producers join him in wearing a swastika armband and taking an oath in the name of " adolph elizabeth hitler . "
max bialystock grabs the red band , turns it this way and that , and describes it as " idiot proof " since the symbol looks the same from either direction – the audience exploded with delighted guffaws .
" it 's not ok to make fun of the holocaust .
but hitler as a person , is ok to ridicule . "
still there 's a slight uneasiness that comes from seeing one-armed salutes in a city with such a tortured history , agrees nigel west , the production 's director . " when you see the show in america , you do n't think twice about it .
because of where we are , you do think twice about it … of course there 's a large age group that could still be affected by what went on , but people hopefully below the age of 60 will come and they 'll forgive and they 'll go with it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actor martin sommerlatte plays adolf hitler in the musical " the producers " 34-year-old sven schmidt lived up to west 's hopes – although surprised by some of the scenes , schmidt said he laughed a lot , and his only complaint was that the second half lagged a little .
" it 's another generation .
we do n't have that much to do with it anymore , " schmidt said .
" this was a parody of hitler , so it 's ok to laugh .
other things , it might not be ok to laugh at .
it 's not ok to make fun of the holocaust .
but hitler as a person is ok to ridicule " .
actor andreas bieber thinks berlin is the perfect place for brooks ' hit .
he hopes audiences will come to the performance knowing what the show is about , and ready to let themselves enjoy it . " berlin of course is the city where it all happened .
and everybody 's reminded about that all the time .
it 's really not about denying history and what happened , but we have to move on , and we have to look at things from a different angle , and it 's great to do that in the city where it all happened . "
previews of " the producers " take place this weekend , with the official premier of the musical sunday evening .
the production is currently booked for a two and a half month run .
response in vienna was muted , with the scheduled run of a year cut to 10 months .

musical " the producers " takes the stage in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a simpering , silly hitler is the centerpiece of " the producers " ' flop turned satiric hit they sing , they dance , they conquer france !
stormtroopers and a simpering , silly hitler take the stage in the berlin production of musical comedy " the producers " .
is germany ready to laugh at its own taboos ? andreas bieber , one of the stars of the new production at berlin 's admiralspalast theatre , wants one thing to be clear : " people think it 's a musical about hitler – of course that 's not the case . " but that notorious name is part of what is raising eyebrows over the show , which has goose-stepping as well as tap-dancing , and mines taboos for comic effect . " the producers " tells the story of two theatrical ne 'er do wells , lecherous has-been max bialystock , and wimpy wannabe leopold bloom , who discover that flops can make more money than hits .
they set out to produce the loser of all losers – a musical about hitler , written by and starring a demented neo-nazi , and directed by a flamboyant gay director , which is " certain to offend people of all races , creeds and religions , and guaranteed to close in one night . "
surprisingly , when the manic but macho lead is replaced with a campy , outrageous performance by the director , the fascist frolic is taken for brilliant satire .
" springtime for hitler " becomes a smash hit , and the producers end up in jail for defrauding their backers .
bildunterschrift : singing , dancing nazis storm the stage in " the producers " american comedy icon mel brooks ' original 1968 movie sparked a tony-award winning 2001 broadway show , which in turn was made into a 2005 musical film .
audiences in london , tokyo , athens and even tel aviv have all fallen for the crazy comedy .
but a german-language version was lacking until last summer 's production in vienna , austria .
a love letter to a lost culture , or a risky joke ?
the production is now on stage in berlin .
titus hoffmann , resident director at the admiralspalast for the production of " the producers " , calls the show a love letter to show business , including an entertainment culture that once thrived in the german capital .
" there was a huge cabaret scene , lots of satirical , ironic , funny people , that were killed in the third reich then , or they had to leave and they went to america and a lot of those people went to new york and worked on broadway .
" and somehow , it feels a bit like it 's a return , and it brings the humor back to the country , which is so great .
because apart from all the awful and terrible things that happened through hitler , what still is lacking a little in germany is good humor . "

fdp leader guido westerwelle says the free democrats are now keeping all options open . " we want to rule , " party leader guido westerwelle said to over 500 fdp delegates at a party convention over the weekend .
general elections in germany are due in september this year and traditionally the liberals ' goal would be to join forces as junior partners with angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
opinion polls show , however , that a coalition between the fdp and the cdu is unlikely to gain a ruling majority .
so , the free democrats are forced to keep their options open .
westerwelle on sunday reconfirmed his preference for the cdu , but added that his party also would n't exclude forming a three-way coalition with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens .
announcement to come before upcoming elections the fdp , germany 's third largest party behind the cdu and the spd , concluded their party convention on sunday saying that any concrete plans for a possible coalition would only be announced one week ahead of september ’ s election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : struck says the free democrats must join the spd and the greens if they want to rule peter struck , the chairman of the spd 's parliamentary faction , told the german newspaper welt am sonntag in a sunday interview that the fdp would have to enter a coalition with the spd and the greens if it wanted to win a majority in the general elections .
" it does n't matter what guido westerwelle says at this point : the free democrats will have to be ready to enter a coalition with the spd and the greens if they want to rule .
otherwise they would risk being out of power until at least 2013 , making it 15 years since they have been a part of a ruling coalition .
westerwelle would n't risk that , " he said .
fdp running on tax reform the economy is likely to be one of the main battlegrounds in the september election , and the fdp has vehemently criticized merkel 's coalition policies , in particular state bailouts and government stimulus measures .
" if a big company goes bust , the german eagle flies in .
if a small company goes bust , the bankruptcy vultures arrive , " westerwelle said with both fists clenched at the weekend convention .
westerwelle has also promised tax cuts to help lift germany out of its deepest recession since the end of the second world war .
the fdp election campaign promises an overhaul of the german tax system and a reduction of the burden on middle class families to the tune of up to 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 47.40 billion -rrb- .
" tax cuts will help the economy more than subsidizing one branch after the other .
we should relieve the burden on the middle classes .
that is the best answer to the downturn , " he said. glb / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle 's ranjitha balasubramanyam says while the war may be over , peace is still some way off . as the sri lankan military 's mop-up operations continue in what appears to be the culmination of a long-drawn-out war against the liberation tigers of tamil eelam , a senior rebel leader has been quoted as saying that the battle has " reached its bitter end " .
in an apparent admission of defeat , selvarasa pathmanathan , the tigers ' chief of international relations , also said in a statement on a pro-rebel website that they had " decided to silence " their guns .
some observers and certainly the government of president mahinda rajapakse believe the tigers had little choice , having been boxed into a tiny patch of land not exceeding a few square kilometres in the northeast of the island nation .
so , few are likely to be taken in by the rebel claim that they have decided to give up fighting entirely on account of their desire " to remove the last weak excuse of the enemy for killing our people . "
paradoxes in the plot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over the years tens of thousands have been killed in the fighting .
from the onset , president rajapakse made no bones about the fact that his government sought to crush the ltte militarily while keeping the door open for negotiations .
ironically , it was ltte leader velupillai prabhakaran who was largely instrumental in the 2005 presidential poll victory for rajapakse , already a hardliner .
the ltte had ordered the people of the tamil-dominated north and east of the country to boycott the polls .
that directive from the rebels , who had a stranglehold on the population in the region , resulted in a defeat for incumbent prime minister ranil wickremesinghe , in the absence of support from a large segment of the tamil electorate .
again , paradoxically , it was wickremesinghe who had pushed for a political solution and initiated a ceasefire with the rebels in 2002 .
i clearly remember the bewilderment on wickremesinghe 's face as the tigers ' " decree " filtered down to southern sri lanka .
one must remember that the capital colombo in the south west of the country is in the midst of the majority sinhala community , while the various tamil-dominated parts of the country lie in the north – primarily former tiger stronghold jaffna , the wanni mainland , and the eastern districts of trincomalee , batticaloa and ampara . in the years that i spent in the island nation , there was little doubt that there was an effective " internal border " demarcating the sinhala and tamil / muslim majority areas of the country .
wasted opportunity most people in the sinhala-dominated south saw the 2002 ceasefire as a complete farce and feared that it simply afforded the tigers the chance to re-arm and strengthen their fighting ranks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tigers are accused of using child soldiers in their armed struggle ultimately , it emerged that those fears were not entirely unfounded .
some analysts say the tigers - banned in sri lanka , india and the us - also used their new-found clout and freedoms under the ceasefire to assassinate several political opponents .
they did all this in total disregard for the peace efforts facilitated by norway , which had the eu 's backing .
in the end , the international community was disenchanted with the tigers ' conduct during the " ceasefire " years , and the manner in which they stymied the peace talks .
once it became apparent that neither side cared for norway 's intervention , oslo had little choice but to bow out .
eventually the eu also listed the ltte as a terrorist group .
for those of us who watched the events unfold in sri lanka from close quarters , there was a sense of dismay at the lost opportunity – not simply that the " ceasefire " was n't for real but that the tigers , who had time and again shown remarkable organisational and strategic skills , had failed to make use of their " ticket " to the political mainstream .
western powers snubbed in recent weeks , as the military stepped up the war in the north , the un said thousands of innocent people had been killed in the conflict zone with some 50,000 others being trapped .
president rajapakse 's government thumbed its nose at the international community , shrugging off condemnation of the manner in which it has pushed ahead with its military offensive .
the sri lankan government also angered the eu a couple of weeks ago by refusing entry to the swedish foreign minister who had planned to accompany his british and french counterparts to the country to press for an immediate truce .
the uk 's david miliband and france 's bernard kouchner visited colombo to urge the two sides to cease fire in order to enable the un to evacuate civilians .
however , the rajapakse government , which was convinced that victory was close at hand , rejected their pleas .
now it appears by all accounts that the ltte 's armed struggle has been finished off , and that the tigers are a spent force .
few would have believed just a couple of years ago that asia 's longest running civil war was drawing to a close .
the rebels ran a de-facto state covering nearly one-third of the country .
they had set up a parallel administrative and social infrastructure , complete with their own schools , a bank , courts , a taxation system , a civil service and even a border control mechanism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the end of war mean an end to bombings , destruction and suffering ?
and in the south , they spread terror through suicide bombings and political assassinations .
few of us who lived through the bombings in colombo can erase memories of the carnage , destruction and the utter dread that resulted .
post-war scenario now the question that 's on most observers ' minds is whether rajapakse , who has won adulation from his sinhala constituency for achieving what seemed to be a near-impossible task will also be able to persuade the large and divided tamil community - many in the outside world view sri lankan tamils as a monolithic entity and they could n't be farther from the truth - that his government will provide a benevolent and constructive leadership for all .
it would seem to me that even those of the fractured tamil community that did n't subscribe to the rebels ' strategies must find the speed at which the tiger infrastructure has crumbled extremely incomprehensible .
moreover , they must now adapt to a life without the tigers .
that said , some caution that military victory may not spell peace , as the tigers could well return to guerrilla warfare .

musical " the producers " takes the stage in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a simpering , silly hitler is the centerpiece of " the producers " ' flop turned satiric hit they sing , they dance , they conquer france !
stormtroopers and a simpering , silly hitler take the stage in the berlin production of musical comedy " the producers " .
is germany ready to laugh at its own taboos ? andreas bieber , one of the stars of the new production at berlin 's admiralspalast theatre , wants one thing to be clear : " people think it 's a musical about hitler – of course that 's not the case . " but that notorious name is part of what is raising eyebrows over the show , which has goose-stepping as well as tap-dancing , and mines taboos for comic effect . " the producers " tells the story of two theatrical ne 'er do wells , lecherous has-been max bialystock , and wimpy wannabe leopold bloom , who discover that flops can make more money than hits .
they set out to produce the loser of all losers – a musical about hitler , written by and starring a demented neo-nazi , and directed by a flamboyant gay director , which is " certain to offend people of all races , creeds and religions , and guaranteed to close in one night . "
surprisingly , when the manic but macho lead is replaced with a campy , outrageous performance by the director , the fascist frolic is taken for brilliant satire .
" springtime for hitler " becomes a smash hit , and the producers end up in jail for defrauding their backers .
bildunterschrift : singing , dancing nazis storm the stage in " the producers " american comedy icon mel brooks ' original 1968 movie sparked a tony-award winning 2001 broadway show , which in turn was made into a 2005 musical film .
audiences in london , tokyo , athens and even tel aviv have all fallen for the crazy comedy .
but a german-language version was lacking until last summer 's production in vienna , austria .
a love letter to a lost culture , or a risky joke ?
the production is now on stage in berlin .
titus hoffmann , resident director at the admiralspalast for the production of " the producers " , calls the show a love letter to show business , including an entertainment culture that once thrived in the german capital .
" there was a huge cabaret scene , lots of satirical , ironic , funny people , that were killed in the third reich then , or they had to leave and they went to america and a lot of those people went to new york and worked on broadway .
" and somehow , it feels a bit like it 's a return , and it brings the humor back to the country , which is so great .
because apart from all the awful and terrible things that happened through hitler , what still is lacking a little in germany is good humor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : controversial banners announce the german premier of the musical " the producers " so far , not everyone here is getting the joke .
local papers have described the show as " risky " and even the production 's advertising has caused a fuss .
it 's illegal to portray the swastika publicly in germany , so the casually reclining hitler in poster ads for the play wears an armband displaying a pretzel .
banners showing the doughy treat in black on a red and white banner have been hanging in the theatre courtyard for months . they 've garnered double-takes from passersby , and a few complaints to the police .
the storm troopers wear the real thing when they take the stage , though , due to a theatrical exception . equal opportunity offender in some ways , brooks ' classic can be seen as an equal opportunity offender , with jokes about gays , jews , dumb blondes and sex-crazed little old ladies . the humor at times relies on pratfalls and slapstick .
the song lyrics are especially clever jabs , rhyming nazi with " hotsy-totsy " and declaring , " we 're marching to a faster pace .
look out , here comes the master race ! "
some of the biggest laughs at friday night 's preview show came thanks to nutty neo-nazi playwright franz liebkind , who wears lederhosen and a german military helmet , and has a flock of teutonic-titled pigeons .
he insists that the two producers join him in wearing a swastika armband and taking an oath in the name of " adolph elizabeth hitler . "
max bialystock grabs the red band , turns it this way and that , and describes it as " idiot proof " since the symbol looks the same from either direction – the audience exploded with delighted guffaws .
" it 's not ok to make fun of the holocaust .
but hitler as a person , is ok to ridicule . "
still there 's a slight uneasiness that comes from seeing one-armed salutes in a city with such a tortured history , agrees nigel west , the production 's director . " when you see the show in america , you do n't think twice about it .
because of where we are , you do think twice about it … of course there 's a large age group that could still be affected by what went on , but people hopefully below the age of 60 will come and they 'll forgive and they 'll go with it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actor martin sommerlatte plays adolf hitler in the musical " the producers " 34-year-old sven schmidt lived up to west 's hopes – although surprised by some of the scenes , schmidt said he laughed a lot , and his only complaint was that the second half lagged a little .
" it 's another generation .
we do n't have that much to do with it anymore , " schmidt said .
" this was a parody of hitler , so it 's ok to laugh .
other things , it might not be ok to laugh at .
it 's not ok to make fun of the holocaust .
but hitler as a person is ok to ridicule " .
actor andreas bieber thinks berlin is the perfect place for brooks ' hit .
he hopes audiences will come to the performance knowing what the show is about , and ready to let themselves enjoy it . " berlin of course is the city where it all happened .
and everybody 's reminded about that all the time .
it 's really not about denying history and what happened , but we have to move on , and we have to look at things from a different angle , and it 's great to do that in the city where it all happened . "
previews of " the producers " take place this weekend , with the official premier of the musical sunday evening .
the production is currently booked for a two and a half month run .
response in vienna was muted , with the scheduled run of a year cut to 10 months .
but the cast and crew hope that in berlin , the show will go on - and on . author : susan stone editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the who meeting had been planned for some time , but took on new urgency with the outbreak last month of the new ah1n1 strain of swine flu .

deutsche welle 's ranjitha balasubramanyam says while the war may be over , peace is still some way off . as the sri lankan military 's mop-up operations continue in what appears to be the culmination of a long-drawn-out war against the liberation tigers of tamil eelam , a senior rebel leader has been quoted as saying that the battle has " reached its bitter end " .
in an apparent admission of defeat , selvarasa pathmanathan , the tigers ' chief of international relations , also said in a statement on a pro-rebel website that they had " decided to silence " their guns .
some observers and certainly the government of president mahinda rajapakse believe the tigers had little choice , having been boxed into a tiny patch of land not exceeding a few square kilometres in the northeast of the island nation .
so , few are likely to be taken in by the rebel claim that they have decided to give up fighting entirely on account of their desire " to remove the last weak excuse of the enemy for killing our people . "
paradoxes in the plot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over the years tens of thousands have been killed in the fighting .
from the onset , president rajapakse made no bones about the fact that his government sought to crush the ltte militarily while keeping the door open for negotiations .
ironically , it was ltte leader velupillai prabhakaran who was largely instrumental in the 2005 presidential poll victory for rajapakse , already a hardliner .
the ltte had ordered the people of the tamil-dominated north and east of the country to boycott the polls .
that directive from the rebels , who had a stranglehold on the population in the region , resulted in a defeat for incumbent prime minister ranil wickremesinghe , in the absence of support from a large segment of the tamil electorate .
again , paradoxically , it was wickremesinghe who had pushed for a political solution and initiated a ceasefire with the rebels in 2002 .
i clearly remember the bewilderment on wickremesinghe 's face as the tigers ' " decree " filtered down to southern sri lanka .
one must remember that the capital colombo in the south west of the country is in the midst of the majority sinhala community , while the various tamil-dominated parts of the country lie in the north – primarily former tiger stronghold jaffna , the wanni mainland , and the eastern districts of trincomalee , batticaloa and ampara . in the years that i spent in the island nation , there was little doubt that there was an effective " internal border " demarcating the sinhala and tamil / muslim majority areas of the country .
wasted opportunity most people in the sinhala-dominated south saw the 2002 ceasefire as a complete farce and feared that it simply afforded the tigers the chance to re-arm and strengthen their fighting ranks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tigers are accused of using child soldiers in their armed struggle ultimately , it emerged that those fears were not entirely unfounded .
some analysts say the tigers - banned in sri lanka , india and the us - also used their new-found clout and freedoms under the ceasefire to assassinate several political opponents .
they did all this in total disregard for the peace efforts facilitated by norway , which had the eu 's backing .
in the end , the international community was disenchanted with the tigers ' conduct during the " ceasefire " years , and the manner in which they stymied the peace talks .
once it became apparent that neither side cared for norway 's intervention , oslo had little choice but to bow out .
eventually the eu also listed the ltte as a terrorist group .
for those of us who watched the events unfold in sri lanka from close quarters , there was a sense of dismay at the lost opportunity – not simply that the " ceasefire " was n't for real but that the tigers , who had time and again shown remarkable organisational and strategic skills , had failed to make use of their " ticket " to the political mainstream .
western powers snubbed in recent weeks , as the military stepped up the war in the north , the un said thousands of innocent people had been killed in the conflict zone with some 50,000 others being trapped .
president rajapakse 's government thumbed its nose at the international community , shrugging off condemnation of the manner in which it has pushed ahead with its military offensive .
the sri lankan government also angered the eu a couple of weeks ago by refusing entry to the swedish foreign minister who had planned to accompany his british and french counterparts to the country to press for an immediate truce .
the uk 's david miliband and france 's bernard kouchner visited colombo to urge the two sides to cease fire in order to enable the un to evacuate civilians .
however , the rajapakse government , which was convinced that victory was close at hand , rejected their pleas .
now it appears by all accounts that the ltte 's armed struggle has been finished off , and that the tigers are a spent force .

eventually the eu also listed the ltte as a terrorist group .
for those of us who watched the events unfold in sri lanka from close quarters , there was a sense of dismay at the lost opportunity – not simply that the " ceasefire " was n't for real but that the tigers , who had time and again shown remarkable organisational and strategic skills , had failed to make use of their " ticket " to the political mainstream .
western powers snubbed in recent weeks , as the military stepped up the war in the north , the un said thousands of innocent people had been killed in the conflict zone with some 50,000 others being trapped .
president rajapakse 's government thumbed its nose at the international community , shrugging off condemnation of the manner in which it has pushed ahead with its military offensive .
the sri lankan government also angered the eu a couple of weeks ago by refusing entry to the swedish foreign minister who had planned to accompany his british and french counterparts to the country to press for an immediate truce .
the uk 's david miliband and france 's bernard kouchner visited colombo to urge the two sides to cease fire in order to enable the un to evacuate civilians .
however , the rajapakse government , which was convinced that victory was close at hand , rejected their pleas .
now it appears by all accounts that the ltte 's armed struggle has been finished off , and that the tigers are a spent force .
few would have believed just a couple of years ago that asia 's longest running civil war was drawing to a close .
the rebels ran a de-facto state covering nearly one-third of the country .
they had set up a parallel administrative and social infrastructure , complete with their own schools , a bank , courts , a taxation system , a civil service and even a border control mechanism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the end of war mean an end to bombings , destruction and suffering ?
and in the south , they spread terror through suicide bombings and political assassinations .
few of us who lived through the bombings in colombo can erase memories of the carnage , destruction and the utter dread that resulted .
post-war scenario now the question that 's on most observers ' minds is whether rajapakse , who has won adulation from his sinhala constituency for achieving what seemed to be a near-impossible task will also be able to persuade the large and divided tamil community - many in the outside world view sri lankan tamils as a monolithic entity and they could n't be farther from the truth - that his government will provide a benevolent and constructive leadership for all .
it would seem to me that even those of the fractured tamil community that did n't subscribe to the rebels ' strategies must find the speed at which the tiger infrastructure has crumbled extremely incomprehensible .
moreover , they must now adapt to a life without the tigers .
that said , some caution that military victory may not spell peace , as the tigers could well return to guerrilla warfare .

deutsche welle 's ranjitha balasubramanyam says while the war may be over , peace is still some way off . as the sri lankan military 's mop-up operations continue in what appears to be the culmination of a long-drawn-out war against the liberation tigers of tamil eelam , a senior rebel leader has been quoted as saying that the battle has " reached its bitter end " .
in an apparent admission of defeat , selvarasa pathmanathan , the tigers ' chief of international relations , also said in a statement on a pro-rebel website that they had " decided to silence " their guns .
some observers and certainly the government of president mahinda rajapakse believe the tigers had little choice , having been boxed into a tiny patch of land not exceeding a few square kilometres in the northeast of the island nation .
so , few are likely to be taken in by the rebel claim that they have decided to give up fighting entirely on account of their desire " to remove the last weak excuse of the enemy for killing our people . "
paradoxes in the plot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over the years tens of thousands have been killed in the fighting .
from the onset , president rajapakse made no bones about the fact that his government sought to crush the ltte militarily while keeping the door open for negotiations .
ironically , it was ltte leader velupillai prabhakaran who was largely instrumental in the 2005 presidential poll victory for rajapakse , already a hardliner .
the ltte had ordered the people of the tamil-dominated north and east of the country to boycott the polls .
that directive from the rebels , who had a stranglehold on the population in the region , resulted in a defeat for incumbent prime minister ranil wickremesinghe , in the absence of support from a large segment of the tamil electorate .
again , paradoxically , it was wickremesinghe who had pushed for a political solution and initiated a ceasefire with the rebels in 2002 .
i clearly remember the bewilderment on wickremesinghe 's face as the tigers ' " decree " filtered down to southern sri lanka .
one must remember that the capital colombo in the south west of the country is in the midst of the majority sinhala community , while the various tamil-dominated parts of the country lie in the north – primarily former tiger stronghold jaffna , the wanni mainland , and the eastern districts of trincomalee , batticaloa and ampara . in the years that i spent in the island nation , there was little doubt that there was an effective " internal border " demarcating the sinhala and tamil / muslim majority areas of the country .
wasted opportunity most people in the sinhala-dominated south saw the 2002 ceasefire as a complete farce and feared that it simply afforded the tigers the chance to re-arm and strengthen their fighting ranks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tigers are accused of using child soldiers in their armed struggle ultimately , it emerged that those fears were not entirely unfounded .
some analysts say the tigers - banned in sri lanka , india and the us - also used their new-found clout and freedoms under the ceasefire to assassinate several political opponents .
they did all this in total disregard for the peace efforts facilitated by norway , which had the eu 's backing .
in the end , the international community was disenchanted with the tigers ' conduct during the " ceasefire " years , and the manner in which they stymied the peace talks .
once it became apparent that neither side cared for norway 's intervention , oslo had little choice but to bow out .
eventually the eu also listed the ltte as a terrorist group .

general elections in germany are due in september this year and traditionally the liberals ' goal would be to join forces as junior partners with angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
opinion polls show , however , that a coalition between the fdp and the cdu is unlikely to gain a ruling majority .
so , the free democrats are forced to keep their options open .
westerwelle on sunday reconfirmed his preference for the cdu , but added that his party also would n't exclude forming a three-way coalition with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens .

" it does n't matter what guido westerwelle says at this point : the free democrats will have to be ready to enter a coalition with the spd and the greens if they want to rule .
otherwise they would risk being out of power until at least 2013 , making it 15 years since they have been a part of a ruling coalition .
westerwelle would n't risk that , " he said .
fdp running on tax reform the economy is likely to be one of the main battlegrounds in the september election , and the fdp has vehemently criticized merkel 's coalition policies , in particular state bailouts and government stimulus measures .
" if a big company goes bust , the german eagle flies in .
if a small company goes bust , the bankruptcy vultures arrive , " westerwelle said with both fists clenched at the weekend convention .
westerwelle has also promised tax cuts to help lift germany out of its deepest recession since the end of the second world war .
the fdp election campaign promises an overhaul of the german tax system and a reduction of the burden on middle class families to the tune of up to 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 47.40 billion -rrb- .

fdp leader guido westerwelle says the free democrats are now keeping all options open . " we want to rule , " party leader guido westerwelle said to over 500 fdp delegates at a party convention over the weekend .
general elections in germany are due in september this year and traditionally the liberals ' goal would be to join forces as junior partners with angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
opinion polls show , however , that a coalition between the fdp and the cdu is unlikely to gain a ruling majority .
so , the free democrats are forced to keep their options open .
westerwelle on sunday reconfirmed his preference for the cdu , but added that his party also would n't exclude forming a three-way coalition with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens .
announcement to come before upcoming elections the fdp , germany 's third largest party behind the cdu and the spd , concluded their party convention on sunday saying that any concrete plans for a possible coalition would only be announced one week ahead of september ’ s election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : struck says the free democrats must join the spd and the greens if they want to rule peter struck , the chairman of the spd 's parliamentary faction , told the german newspaper welt am sonntag in a sunday interview that the fdp would have to enter a coalition with the spd and the greens if it wanted to win a majority in the general elections .
" it does n't matter what guido westerwelle says at this point : the free democrats will have to be ready to enter a coalition with the spd and the greens if they want to rule .
otherwise they would risk being out of power until at least 2013 , making it 15 years since they have been a part of a ruling coalition .
westerwelle would n't risk that , " he said .
fdp running on tax reform the economy is likely to be one of the main battlegrounds in the september election , and the fdp has vehemently criticized merkel 's coalition policies , in particular state bailouts and government stimulus measures .
" if a big company goes bust , the german eagle flies in .
if a small company goes bust , the bankruptcy vultures arrive , " westerwelle said with both fists clenched at the weekend convention .
westerwelle has also promised tax cuts to help lift germany out of its deepest recession since the end of the second world war .
the fdp election campaign promises an overhaul of the german tax system and a reduction of the burden on middle class families to the tune of up to 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 47.40 billion -rrb- .
" tax cuts will help the economy more than subsidizing one branch after the other .
we should relieve the burden on the middle classes .
that is the best answer to the downturn , " he said. glb / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

musical " the producers " takes the stage in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a simpering , silly hitler is the centerpiece of " the producers " ' flop turned satiric hit they sing , they dance , they conquer france !
stormtroopers and a simpering , silly hitler take the stage in the berlin production of musical comedy " the producers " .
is germany ready to laugh at its own taboos ? andreas bieber , one of the stars of the new production at berlin 's admiralspalast theatre , wants one thing to be clear : " people think it 's a musical about hitler – of course that 's not the case . " but that notorious name is part of what is raising eyebrows over the show , which has goose-stepping as well as tap-dancing , and mines taboos for comic effect . " the producers " tells the story of two theatrical ne 'er do wells , lecherous has-been max bialystock , and wimpy wannabe leopold bloom , who discover that flops can make more money than hits .
they set out to produce the loser of all losers – a musical about hitler , written by and starring a demented neo-nazi , and directed by a flamboyant gay director , which is " certain to offend people of all races , creeds and religions , and guaranteed to close in one night . "
surprisingly , when the manic but macho lead is replaced with a campy , outrageous performance by the director , the fascist frolic is taken for brilliant satire .
" springtime for hitler " becomes a smash hit , and the producers end up in jail for defrauding their backers .
bildunterschrift : singing , dancing nazis storm the stage in " the producers " american comedy icon mel brooks ' original 1968 movie sparked a tony-award winning 2001 broadway show , which in turn was made into a 2005 musical film .
audiences in london , tokyo , athens and even tel aviv have all fallen for the crazy comedy .
but a german-language version was lacking until last summer 's production in vienna , austria .
a love letter to a lost culture , or a risky joke ?
the production is now on stage in berlin .
titus hoffmann , resident director at the admiralspalast for the production of " the producers " , calls the show a love letter to show business , including an entertainment culture that once thrived in the german capital .
" there was a huge cabaret scene , lots of satirical , ironic , funny people , that were killed in the third reich then , or they had to leave and they went to america and a lot of those people went to new york and worked on broadway .
" and somehow , it feels a bit like it 's a return , and it brings the humor back to the country , which is so great .
because apart from all the awful and terrible things that happened through hitler , what still is lacking a little in germany is good humor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : controversial banners announce the german premier of the musical " the producers " so far , not everyone here is getting the joke .
local papers have described the show as " risky " and even the production 's advertising has caused a fuss .
it 's illegal to portray the swastika publicly in germany , so the casually reclining hitler in poster ads for the play wears an armband displaying a pretzel .
banners showing the doughy treat in black on a red and white banner have been hanging in the theatre courtyard for months . they 've garnered double-takes from passersby , and a few complaints to the police .
the storm troopers wear the real thing when they take the stage , though , due to a theatrical exception . equal opportunity offender in some ways , brooks ' classic can be seen as an equal opportunity offender , with jokes about gays , jews , dumb blondes and sex-crazed little old ladies . the humor at times relies on pratfalls and slapstick .
the song lyrics are especially clever jabs , rhyming nazi with " hotsy-totsy " and declaring , " we 're marching to a faster pace .
look out , here comes the master race ! "
some of the biggest laughs at friday night 's preview show came thanks to nutty neo-nazi playwright franz liebkind , who wears lederhosen and a german military helmet , and has a flock of teutonic-titled pigeons .
he insists that the two producers join him in wearing a swastika armband and taking an oath in the name of " adolph elizabeth hitler . "
max bialystock grabs the red band , turns it this way and that , and describes it as " idiot proof " since the symbol looks the same from either direction – the audience exploded with delighted guffaws .
" it 's not ok to make fun of the holocaust .
but hitler as a person , is ok to ridicule . "
still there 's a slight uneasiness that comes from seeing one-armed salutes in a city with such a tortured history , agrees nigel west , the production 's director . " when you see the show in america , you do n't think twice about it .
because of where we are , you do think twice about it … of course there 's a large age group that could still be affected by what went on , but people hopefully below the age of 60 will come and they 'll forgive and they 'll go with it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actor martin sommerlatte plays adolf hitler in the musical " the producers " 34-year-old sven schmidt lived up to west 's hopes – although surprised by some of the scenes , schmidt said he laughed a lot , and his only complaint was that the second half lagged a little .
" it 's another generation .
we do n't have that much to do with it anymore , " schmidt said .
" this was a parody of hitler , so it 's ok to laugh .
other things , it might not be ok to laugh at .
it 's not ok to make fun of the holocaust .
but hitler as a person is ok to ridicule " .
actor andreas bieber thinks berlin is the perfect place for brooks ' hit .
he hopes audiences will come to the performance knowing what the show is about , and ready to let themselves enjoy it . " berlin of course is the city where it all happened .
and everybody 's reminded about that all the time .
it 's really not about denying history and what happened , but we have to move on , and we have to look at things from a different angle , and it 's great to do that in the city where it all happened . "
previews of " the producers " take place this weekend , with the official premier of the musical sunday evening .
the production is currently booked for a two and a half month run .
response in vienna was muted , with the scheduled run of a year cut to 10 months .
but the cast and crew hope that in berlin , the show will go on - and on . author : susan stone editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

over 97 percent of shareholders reportedly backed the decision , passed at a two-day annual shareholders meeting in frankfurt on saturday .
commerzbank , which was forced to ask for state aid last year , is to issue 295 million new shares at a price of six euros per share , according to a statement by the bank .
the government is to acquire the new shares via the financial market stabilisation fund -lrb- soffin -rrb- - the german government 's rescue fund .
on thursday , the european commission approved the second tranche of german state aid to the tune of about 10 billion euros .

over 97 percent of shareholders reportedly backed the decision , passed at a two-day annual shareholders meeting in frankfurt on saturday .
commerzbank , which was forced to ask for state aid last year , is to issue 295 million new shares at a price of six euros per share , according to a statement by the bank .
the government is to acquire the new shares via the financial market stabilisation fund -lrb- soffin -rrb- - the german government 's rescue fund .
on thursday , the european commission approved the second tranche of german state aid to the tune of about 10 billion euros .
the brussels-based body insisted that the plans for the new injection of capital , which comes after a first infusion of eight billion euros , is meant to ensure the bank 's long-term health without giving it an unfair advantage over rivals .
in return for the comission 's approval , commerzbank will be forced to recentre its activities into business and individual retail banking and abandon its investment banking and commercial real-estate activities , which have accounted for about 45 percent of its total activities .
commerzbank chief executive martin blessing told press on friday that the state aid will be paid back in full and that the bank currently does n't require any further state aid .
struggling commerzbank ended 2008 with a sharp loss of 6.6 billion euros , due to the integration of ailing dresdner bank and the global credit crunch .
the bank has stayed in the red in 2009 , posting a net loss of 861 million euros for the first quarter on friday .
following the full integration of the dresdner bank in late january 2009 , commerzbank executives underlined that the restructuring would pay off in the future , forecasting a profit by 2011 at the latest , and an operating profit of more than four billion euros by 2012. nk / afp / dpa editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

secularists are concerned about the rise of erdogan 's justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , and the election by the akp-controlled parliament of abdullah gul as president .
demonstrators were also protesting the government 's handling of the economy as unemployment in the country has reached a record high amid the global economic downturn. glb / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

musical " the producers " takes the stage in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a simpering , silly hitler is the centerpiece of " the producers " ' flop turned satiric hit they sing , they dance , they conquer france !
stormtroopers and a simpering , silly hitler take the stage in the berlin production of musical comedy " the producers " .
is germany ready to laugh at its own taboos ? andreas bieber , one of the stars of the new production at berlin 's admiralspalast theatre , wants one thing to be clear : " people think it 's a musical about hitler – of course that 's not the case . " but that notorious name is part of what is raising eyebrows over the show , which has goose-stepping as well as tap-dancing , and mines taboos for comic effect . " the producers " tells the story of two theatrical ne 'er do wells , lecherous has-been max bialystock , and wimpy wannabe leopold bloom , who discover that flops can make more money than hits .
they set out to produce the loser of all losers – a musical about hitler , written by and starring a demented neo-nazi , and directed by a flamboyant gay director , which is " certain to offend people of all races , creeds and religions , and guaranteed to close in one night . "
surprisingly , when the manic but macho lead is replaced with a campy , outrageous performance by the director , the fascist frolic is taken for brilliant satire .
" springtime for hitler " becomes a smash hit , and the producers end up in jail for defrauding their backers .
bildunterschrift : singing , dancing nazis storm the stage in " the producers " american comedy icon mel brooks ' original 1968 movie sparked a tony-award winning 2001 broadway show , which in turn was made into a 2005 musical film .
audiences in london , tokyo , athens and even tel aviv have all fallen for the crazy comedy .
but a german-language version was lacking until last summer 's production in vienna , austria .
a love letter to a lost culture , or a risky joke ?
the production is now on stage in berlin .
titus hoffmann , resident director at the admiralspalast for the production of " the producers " , calls the show a love letter to show business , including an entertainment culture that once thrived in the german capital .
" there was a huge cabaret scene , lots of satirical , ironic , funny people , that were killed in the third reich then , or they had to leave and they went to america and a lot of those people went to new york and worked on broadway .
" and somehow , it feels a bit like it 's a return , and it brings the humor back to the country , which is so great .
because apart from all the awful and terrible things that happened through hitler , what still is lacking a little in germany is good humor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : controversial banners announce the german premier of the musical " the producers " so far , not everyone here is getting the joke .
local papers have described the show as " risky " and even the production 's advertising has caused a fuss .
it 's illegal to portray the swastika publicly in germany , so the casually reclining hitler in poster ads for the play wears an armband displaying a pretzel .
banners showing the doughy treat in black on a red and white banner have been hanging in the theatre courtyard for months . they 've garnered double-takes from passersby , and a few complaints to the police .
the storm troopers wear the real thing when they take the stage , though , due to a theatrical exception . equal opportunity offender in some ways , brooks ' classic can be seen as an equal opportunity offender , with jokes about gays , jews , dumb blondes and sex-crazed little old ladies . the humor at times relies on pratfalls and slapstick .
the song lyrics are especially clever jabs , rhyming nazi with " hotsy-totsy " and declaring , " we 're marching to a faster pace .
look out , here comes the master race ! "
some of the biggest laughs at friday night 's preview show came thanks to nutty neo-nazi playwright franz liebkind , who wears lederhosen and a german military helmet , and has a flock of teutonic-titled pigeons .
he insists that the two producers join him in wearing a swastika armband and taking an oath in the name of " adolph elizabeth hitler . "
max bialystock grabs the red band , turns it this way and that , and describes it as " idiot proof " since the symbol looks the same from either direction – the audience exploded with delighted guffaws .
" it 's not ok to make fun of the holocaust .
but hitler as a person , is ok to ridicule . "
still there 's a slight uneasiness that comes from seeing one-armed salutes in a city with such a tortured history , agrees nigel west , the production 's director . " when you see the show in america , you do n't think twice about it .
because of where we are , you do think twice about it … of course there 's a large age group that could still be affected by what went on , but people hopefully below the age of 60 will come and they 'll forgive and they 'll go with it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actor martin sommerlatte plays adolf hitler in the musical " the producers " 34-year-old sven schmidt lived up to west 's hopes – although surprised by some of the scenes , schmidt said he laughed a lot , and his only complaint was that the second half lagged a little .
" it 's another generation .
we do n't have that much to do with it anymore , " schmidt said .
" this was a parody of hitler , so it 's ok to laugh .
other things , it might not be ok to laugh at .
it 's not ok to make fun of the holocaust .
but hitler as a person is ok to ridicule " .
actor andreas bieber thinks berlin is the perfect place for brooks ' hit .
he hopes audiences will come to the performance knowing what the show is about , and ready to let themselves enjoy it . " berlin of course is the city where it all happened .
and everybody 's reminded about that all the time .
it 's really not about denying history and what happened , but we have to move on , and we have to look at things from a different angle , and it 's great to do that in the city where it all happened . "
previews of " the producers " take place this weekend , with the official premier of the musical sunday evening .

musical " the producers " takes the stage in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a simpering , silly hitler is the centerpiece of " the producers " ' flop turned satiric hit they sing , they dance , they conquer france !
stormtroopers and a simpering , silly hitler take the stage in the berlin production of musical comedy " the producers " .
is germany ready to laugh at its own taboos ? andreas bieber , one of the stars of the new production at berlin 's admiralspalast theatre , wants one thing to be clear : " people think it 's a musical about hitler – of course that 's not the case . " but that notorious name is part of what is raising eyebrows over the show , which has goose-stepping as well as tap-dancing , and mines taboos for comic effect . " the producers " tells the story of two theatrical ne 'er do wells , lecherous has-been max bialystock , and wimpy wannabe leopold bloom , who discover that flops can make more money than hits .
they set out to produce the loser of all losers – a musical about hitler , written by and starring a demented neo-nazi , and directed by a flamboyant gay director , which is " certain to offend people of all races , creeds and religions , and guaranteed to close in one night . "
surprisingly , when the manic but macho lead is replaced with a campy , outrageous performance by the director , the fascist frolic is taken for brilliant satire .
" springtime for hitler " becomes a smash hit , and the producers end up in jail for defrauding their backers .
bildunterschrift : singing , dancing nazis storm the stage in " the producers " american comedy icon mel brooks ' original 1968 movie sparked a tony-award winning 2001 broadway show , which in turn was made into a 2005 musical film .
audiences in london , tokyo , athens and even tel aviv have all fallen for the crazy comedy .
but a german-language version was lacking until last summer 's production in vienna , austria .
a love letter to a lost culture , or a risky joke ?
the production is now on stage in berlin .
titus hoffmann , resident director at the admiralspalast for the production of " the producers " , calls the show a love letter to show business , including an entertainment culture that once thrived in the german capital .
" there was a huge cabaret scene , lots of satirical , ironic , funny people , that were killed in the third reich then , or they had to leave and they went to america and a lot of those people went to new york and worked on broadway .
" and somehow , it feels a bit like it 's a return , and it brings the humor back to the country , which is so great .
because apart from all the awful and terrible things that happened through hitler , what still is lacking a little in germany is good humor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : controversial banners announce the german premier of the musical " the producers " so far , not everyone here is getting the joke .
local papers have described the show as " risky " and even the production 's advertising has caused a fuss .
it 's illegal to portray the swastika publicly in germany , so the casually reclining hitler in poster ads for the play wears an armband displaying a pretzel .
banners showing the doughy treat in black on a red and white banner have been hanging in the theatre courtyard for months . they 've garnered double-takes from passersby , and a few complaints to the police .
the storm troopers wear the real thing when they take the stage , though , due to a theatrical exception . equal opportunity offender in some ways , brooks ' classic can be seen as an equal opportunity offender , with jokes about gays , jews , dumb blondes and sex-crazed little old ladies . the humor at times relies on pratfalls and slapstick .
the song lyrics are especially clever jabs , rhyming nazi with " hotsy-totsy " and declaring , " we 're marching to a faster pace .
look out , here comes the master race ! "
some of the biggest laughs at friday night 's preview show came thanks to nutty neo-nazi playwright franz liebkind , who wears lederhosen and a german military helmet , and has a flock of teutonic-titled pigeons .
he insists that the two producers join him in wearing a swastika armband and taking an oath in the name of " adolph elizabeth hitler . "
max bialystock grabs the red band , turns it this way and that , and describes it as " idiot proof " since the symbol looks the same from either direction – the audience exploded with delighted guffaws .
" it 's not ok to make fun of the holocaust .
but hitler as a person , is ok to ridicule . "
still there 's a slight uneasiness that comes from seeing one-armed salutes in a city with such a tortured history , agrees nigel west , the production 's director . " when you see the show in america , you do n't think twice about it .
because of where we are , you do think twice about it … of course there 's a large age group that could still be affected by what went on , but people hopefully below the age of 60 will come and they 'll forgive and they 'll go with it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actor martin sommerlatte plays adolf hitler in the musical " the producers " 34-year-old sven schmidt lived up to west 's hopes – although surprised by some of the scenes , schmidt said he laughed a lot , and his only complaint was that the second half lagged a little .
" it 's another generation .
we do n't have that much to do with it anymore , " schmidt said .
" this was a parody of hitler , so it 's ok to laugh .
other things , it might not be ok to laugh at .
it 's not ok to make fun of the holocaust .
but hitler as a person is ok to ridicule " .
actor andreas bieber thinks berlin is the perfect place for brooks ' hit .
he hopes audiences will come to the performance knowing what the show is about , and ready to let themselves enjoy it . " berlin of course is the city where it all happened .
and everybody 's reminded about that all the time .
it 's really not about denying history and what happened , but we have to move on , and we have to look at things from a different angle , and it 's great to do that in the city where it all happened . "
previews of " the producers " take place this weekend , with the official premier of the musical sunday evening .
the production is currently booked for a two and a half month run .
response in vienna was muted , with the scheduled run of a year cut to 10 months .
but the cast and crew hope that in berlin , the show will go on - and on . author : susan stone editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

from graffiti to sticker art , cut-outs , stencils , installations , and paste-ups , today the streets of berlin are an open gallery for those who appreciate urban art .
and now the internet and digital media have taken that a step further to document and curate interesting and unique examples of the form , with the recently launched " urban art guide " .
bildunterschrift : cut-outs and stickers from all over the city are being archived online it is a digital application that that can be used online and on iphones , and has three basic tools .
one is called " locate me " , and it includes a berlin map which outlines the pieces of urban art in the vicinity , information about them , the artist and how to get there .
another function is the gallery view , which includes more than a hundred pieces of urban art , while the third offers selected tours , mapped out in berlin 's hippest neighborhoods and highlights the best of the city 's street art . maria zeeman , from the guide 's editorial staff , says they are discovering new works daily , which they add to the urban art guide .
she says users of the guide are also helping .
" they find something and say , that 's interesting , smart , cute or romantic .
" we are more a platform for people exchanging ideas on what is the newest , what is the best idea , what is arty , what is not , " zeeman said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two singing woman on a berlin wall - graffiti or art ?
the " urban art church " in the heart of berlin , those on the hunt for real urban art can find the " urban art church " .
everything , from the ceiling , door and even the mailboxes are covered in what looks like one large eclectic collage : comic-like figures , a line of underwear hanging on a clothes line , a large serpent , robots , as well as graphic erotic scenes .
this is the cumulative work of many urban artists .
zeeman says it is constantly changing , as a number of artists and crews express themselves .
" artists do n't only work as individuals .
they are working as crews which you could compare to teams in sports , " she says .
" there can be some kind of battling over space ; that one evening one crew puts one piece of art up , and the next day another crew comes and puts a bigger one on it .
" in that way you can see a wall changing and growing . "
meeting the urban artist behind the art nomad is one of the berlin urban artists whose work is well-represented in the guide .
he has been creating urban art for many years and says he does not plan his work .
instead , he says he allows himself to be inspired by the city 's streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stencil and a spray can is all they need to make instant art " when i walk the streets , i paint a lot of trash that is lying around on the street , which you can perfectly legally transform into art , because it is not forbidden to paint on trash .
it is forbidden to leave it on the street , but not to paint on it , " he says .
nomad says items anything from sofas and mattresses to old washing machines are good " canvases " for his paintings .

over 97 percent of shareholders reportedly backed the decision , passed at a two-day annual shareholders meeting in frankfurt on saturday .
commerzbank , which was forced to ask for state aid last year , is to issue 295 million new shares at a price of six euros per share , according to a statement by the bank .
the government is to acquire the new shares via the financial market stabilisation fund -lrb- soffin -rrb- - the german government 's rescue fund .
on thursday , the european commission approved the second tranche of german state aid to the tune of about 10 billion euros .
the brussels-based body insisted that the plans for the new injection of capital , which comes after a first infusion of eight billion euros , is meant to ensure the bank 's long-term health without giving it an unfair advantage over rivals .
in return for the comission 's approval , commerzbank will be forced to recentre its activities into business and individual retail banking and abandon its investment banking and commercial real-estate activities , which have accounted for about 45 percent of its total activities .
commerzbank chief executive martin blessing told press on friday that the state aid will be paid back in full and that the bank currently does n't require any further state aid .
struggling commerzbank ended 2008 with a sharp loss of 6.6 billion euros , due to the integration of ailing dresdner bank and the global credit crunch .
the bank has stayed in the red in 2009 , posting a net loss of 861 million euros for the first quarter on friday .
following the full integration of the dresdner bank in late january 2009 , commerzbank executives underlined that the restructuring would pay off in the future , forecasting a profit by 2011 at the latest , and an operating profit of more than four billion euros by 2012. nk / afp / dpa editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

musical " the producers " takes the stage in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a simpering , silly hitler is the centerpiece of " the producers " ' flop turned satiric hit they sing , they dance , they conquer france !
stormtroopers and a simpering , silly hitler take the stage in the berlin production of musical comedy " the producers " .
is germany ready to laugh at its own taboos ? andreas bieber , one of the stars of the new production at berlin 's admiralspalast theatre , wants one thing to be clear : " people think it 's a musical about hitler – of course that 's not the case . " but that notorious name is part of what is raising eyebrows over the show , which has goose-stepping as well as tap-dancing , and mines taboos for comic effect . " the producers " tells the story of two theatrical ne 'er do wells , lecherous has-been max bialystock , and wimpy wannabe leopold bloom , who discover that flops can make more money than hits .
they set out to produce the loser of all losers – a musical about hitler , written by and starring a demented neo-nazi , and directed by a flamboyant gay director , which is " certain to offend people of all races , creeds and religions , and guaranteed to close in one night . "
surprisingly , when the manic but macho lead is replaced with a campy , outrageous performance by the director , the fascist frolic is taken for brilliant satire .
" springtime for hitler " becomes a smash hit , and the producers end up in jail for defrauding their backers .
bildunterschrift : singing , dancing nazis storm the stage in " the producers " american comedy icon mel brooks ' original 1968 movie sparked a tony-award winning 2001 broadway show , which in turn was made into a 2005 musical film .
audiences in london , tokyo , athens and even tel aviv have all fallen for the crazy comedy .
but a german-language version was lacking until last summer 's production in vienna , austria .
a love letter to a lost culture , or a risky joke ?
the production is now on stage in berlin .
titus hoffmann , resident director at the admiralspalast for the production of " the producers " , calls the show a love letter to show business , including an entertainment culture that once thrived in the german capital .
" there was a huge cabaret scene , lots of satirical , ironic , funny people , that were killed in the third reich then , or they had to leave and they went to america and a lot of those people went to new york and worked on broadway .
" and somehow , it feels a bit like it 's a return , and it brings the humor back to the country , which is so great .
because apart from all the awful and terrible things that happened through hitler , what still is lacking a little in germany is good humor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : controversial banners announce the german premier of the musical " the producers " so far , not everyone here is getting the joke .
local papers have described the show as " risky " and even the production 's advertising has caused a fuss .
it 's illegal to portray the swastika publicly in germany , so the casually reclining hitler in poster ads for the play wears an armband displaying a pretzel .
banners showing the doughy treat in black on a red and white banner have been hanging in the theatre courtyard for months . they 've garnered double-takes from passersby , and a few complaints to the police .
the storm troopers wear the real thing when they take the stage , though , due to a theatrical exception . equal opportunity offender in some ways , brooks ' classic can be seen as an equal opportunity offender , with jokes about gays , jews , dumb blondes and sex-crazed little old ladies . the humor at times relies on pratfalls and slapstick .
the song lyrics are especially clever jabs , rhyming nazi with " hotsy-totsy " and declaring , " we 're marching to a faster pace .
look out , here comes the master race ! "
some of the biggest laughs at friday night 's preview show came thanks to nutty neo-nazi playwright franz liebkind , who wears lederhosen and a german military helmet , and has a flock of teutonic-titled pigeons .
he insists that the two producers join him in wearing a swastika armband and taking an oath in the name of " adolph elizabeth hitler . "
max bialystock grabs the red band , turns it this way and that , and describes it as " idiot proof " since the symbol looks the same from either direction – the audience exploded with delighted guffaws .
" it 's not ok to make fun of the holocaust .
but hitler as a person , is ok to ridicule . "
still there 's a slight uneasiness that comes from seeing one-armed salutes in a city with such a tortured history , agrees nigel west , the production 's director . " when you see the show in america , you do n't think twice about it .
because of where we are , you do think twice about it … of course there 's a large age group that could still be affected by what went on , but people hopefully below the age of 60 will come and they 'll forgive and they 'll go with it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actor martin sommerlatte plays adolf hitler in the musical " the producers " 34-year-old sven schmidt lived up to west 's hopes – although surprised by some of the scenes , schmidt said he laughed a lot , and his only complaint was that the second half lagged a little .
" it 's another generation .
we do n't have that much to do with it anymore , " schmidt said .
" this was a parody of hitler , so it 's ok to laugh .
other things , it might not be ok to laugh at .
it 's not ok to make fun of the holocaust .
but hitler as a person is ok to ridicule " .
actor andreas bieber thinks berlin is the perfect place for brooks ' hit .
he hopes audiences will come to the performance knowing what the show is about , and ready to let themselves enjoy it . " berlin of course is the city where it all happened .
and everybody 's reminded about that all the time .
it 's really not about denying history and what happened , but we have to move on , and we have to look at things from a different angle , and it 's great to do that in the city where it all happened . "
previews of " the producers " take place this weekend , with the official premier of the musical sunday evening .
the production is currently booked for a two and a half month run .
response in vienna was muted , with the scheduled run of a year cut to 10 months .
but the cast and crew hope that in berlin , the show will go on - and on . author : susan stone editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

over 97 percent of shareholders reportedly backed the decision , passed at a two-day annual shareholders meeting in frankfurt on saturday .
commerzbank , which was forced to ask for state aid last year , is to issue 295 million new shares at a price of six euros per share , according to a statement by the bank .
the government is to acquire the new shares via the financial market stabilisation fund -lrb- soffin -rrb- - the german government 's rescue fund .
on thursday , the european commission approved the second tranche of german state aid to the tune of about 10 billion euros .
the brussels-based body insisted that the plans for the new injection of capital , which comes after a first infusion of eight billion euros , is meant to ensure the bank 's long-term health without giving it an unfair advantage over rivals .
in return for the comission 's approval , commerzbank will be forced to recentre its activities into business and individual retail banking and abandon its investment banking and commercial real-estate activities , which have accounted for about 45 percent of its total activities .
commerzbank chief executive martin blessing told press on friday that the state aid will be paid back in full and that the bank currently does n't require any further state aid .
struggling commerzbank ended 2008 with a sharp loss of 6.6 billion euros , due to the integration of ailing dresdner bank and the global credit crunch .
the bank has stayed in the red in 2009 , posting a net loss of 861 million euros for the first quarter on friday .
following the full integration of the dresdner bank in late january 2009 , commerzbank executives underlined that the restructuring would pay off in the future , forecasting a profit by 2011 at the latest , and an operating profit of more than four billion euros by 2012. nk / afp / dpa editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle 's ranjitha balasubramanyam says while the war may be over , peace is still some way off . as the sri lankan military 's mop-up operations continue in what appears to be the culmination of a long-drawn-out war against the liberation tigers of tamil eelam , a senior rebel leader has been quoted as saying that the battle has " reached its bitter end " .
in an apparent admission of defeat , selvarasa pathmanathan , the tigers ' chief of international relations , also said in a statement on a pro-rebel website that they had " decided to silence " their guns .
some observers and certainly the government of president mahinda rajapakse believe the tigers had little choice , having been boxed into a tiny patch of land not exceeding a few square kilometres in the northeast of the island nation .
so , few are likely to be taken in by the rebel claim that they have decided to give up fighting entirely on account of their desire " to remove the last weak excuse of the enemy for killing our people . "
paradoxes in the plot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over the years tens of thousands have been killed in the fighting .
from the onset , president rajapakse made no bones about the fact that his government sought to crush the ltte militarily while keeping the door open for negotiations .
ironically , it was ltte leader velupillai prabhakaran who was largely instrumental in the 2005 presidential poll victory for rajapakse , already a hardliner .
the ltte had ordered the people of the tamil-dominated north and east of the country to boycott the polls .
that directive from the rebels , who had a stranglehold on the population in the region , resulted in a defeat for incumbent prime minister ranil wickremesinghe , in the absence of support from a large segment of the tamil electorate .
again , paradoxically , it was wickremesinghe who had pushed for a political solution and initiated a ceasefire with the rebels in 2002 .
i clearly remember the bewilderment on wickremesinghe 's face as the tigers ' " decree " filtered down to southern sri lanka .
one must remember that the capital colombo in the south west of the country is in the midst of the majority sinhala community , while the various tamil-dominated parts of the country lie in the north – primarily former tiger stronghold jaffna , the wanni mainland , and the eastern districts of trincomalee , batticaloa and ampara . in the years that i spent in the island nation , there was little doubt that there was an effective " internal border " demarcating the sinhala and tamil / muslim majority areas of the country .
wasted opportunity most people in the sinhala-dominated south saw the 2002 ceasefire as a complete farce and feared that it simply afforded the tigers the chance to re-arm and strengthen their fighting ranks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tigers are accused of using child soldiers in their armed struggle ultimately , it emerged that those fears were not entirely unfounded .
some analysts say the tigers - banned in sri lanka , india and the us - also used their new-found clout and freedoms under the ceasefire to assassinate several political opponents .
they did all this in total disregard for the peace efforts facilitated by norway , which had the eu 's backing .
in the end , the international community was disenchanted with the tigers ' conduct during the " ceasefire " years , and the manner in which they stymied the peace talks .
once it became apparent that neither side cared for norway 's intervention , oslo had little choice but to bow out .
eventually the eu also listed the ltte as a terrorist group .
for those of us who watched the events unfold in sri lanka from close quarters , there was a sense of dismay at the lost opportunity – not simply that the " ceasefire " was n't for real but that the tigers , who had time and again shown remarkable organisational and strategic skills , had failed to make use of their " ticket " to the political mainstream .
western powers snubbed in recent weeks , as the military stepped up the war in the north , the un said thousands of innocent people had been killed in the conflict zone with some 50,000 others being trapped .
president rajapakse 's government thumbed its nose at the international community , shrugging off condemnation of the manner in which it has pushed ahead with its military offensive .
the sri lankan government also angered the eu a couple of weeks ago by refusing entry to the swedish foreign minister who had planned to accompany his british and french counterparts to the country to press for an immediate truce .
the uk 's david miliband and france 's bernard kouchner visited colombo to urge the two sides to cease fire in order to enable the un to evacuate civilians .
however , the rajapakse government , which was convinced that victory was close at hand , rejected their pleas .
now it appears by all accounts that the ltte 's armed struggle has been finished off , and that the tigers are a spent force .
few would have believed just a couple of years ago that asia 's longest running civil war was drawing to a close .
the rebels ran a de-facto state covering nearly one-third of the country .
they had set up a parallel administrative and social infrastructure , complete with their own schools , a bank , courts , a taxation system , a civil service and even a border control mechanism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the end of war mean an end to bombings , destruction and suffering ?
and in the south , they spread terror through suicide bombings and political assassinations .
few of us who lived through the bombings in colombo can erase memories of the carnage , destruction and the utter dread that resulted .
post-war scenario now the question that 's on most observers ' minds is whether rajapakse , who has won adulation from his sinhala constituency for achieving what seemed to be a near-impossible task will also be able to persuade the large and divided tamil community - many in the outside world view sri lankan tamils as a monolithic entity and they could n't be farther from the truth - that his government will provide a benevolent and constructive leadership for all .
it would seem to me that even those of the fractured tamil community that did n't subscribe to the rebels ' strategies must find the speed at which the tiger infrastructure has crumbled extremely incomprehensible .
moreover , they must now adapt to a life without the tigers .
that said , some caution that military victory may not spell peace , as the tigers could well return to guerrilla warfare .

from graffiti to sticker art , cut-outs , stencils , installations , and paste-ups , today the streets of berlin are an open gallery for those who appreciate urban art .
and now the internet and digital media have taken that a step further to document and curate interesting and unique examples of the form , with the recently launched " urban art guide " .
bildunterschrift : cut-outs and stickers from all over the city are being archived online it is a digital application that that can be used online and on iphones , and has three basic tools .
one is called " locate me " , and it includes a berlin map which outlines the pieces of urban art in the vicinity , information about them , the artist and how to get there .
another function is the gallery view , which includes more than a hundred pieces of urban art , while the third offers selected tours , mapped out in berlin 's hippest neighborhoods and highlights the best of the city 's street art . maria zeeman , from the guide 's editorial staff , says they are discovering new works daily , which they add to the urban art guide .
she says users of the guide are also helping .
" they find something and say , that 's interesting , smart , cute or romantic .
" we are more a platform for people exchanging ideas on what is the newest , what is the best idea , what is arty , what is not , " zeeman said .

deutsche welle 's ranjitha balasubramanyam says while the war may be over , peace is still some way off . as the sri lankan military 's mop-up operations continue in what appears to be the culmination of a long-drawn-out war against the liberation tigers of tamil eelam , a senior rebel leader has been quoted as saying that the battle has " reached its bitter end " .
in an apparent admission of defeat , selvarasa pathmanathan , the tigers ' chief of international relations , also said in a statement on a pro-rebel website that they had " decided to silence " their guns .
some observers and certainly the government of president mahinda rajapakse believe the tigers had little choice , having been boxed into a tiny patch of land not exceeding a few square kilometres in the northeast of the island nation .
so , few are likely to be taken in by the rebel claim that they have decided to give up fighting entirely on account of their desire " to remove the last weak excuse of the enemy for killing our people . "
paradoxes in the plot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over the years tens of thousands have been killed in the fighting .
from the onset , president rajapakse made no bones about the fact that his government sought to crush the ltte militarily while keeping the door open for negotiations .
ironically , it was ltte leader velupillai prabhakaran who was largely instrumental in the 2005 presidential poll victory for rajapakse , already a hardliner .
the ltte had ordered the people of the tamil-dominated north and east of the country to boycott the polls .
that directive from the rebels , who had a stranglehold on the population in the region , resulted in a defeat for incumbent prime minister ranil wickremesinghe , in the absence of support from a large segment of the tamil electorate .
again , paradoxically , it was wickremesinghe who had pushed for a political solution and initiated a ceasefire with the rebels in 2002 .
i clearly remember the bewilderment on wickremesinghe 's face as the tigers ' " decree " filtered down to southern sri lanka .
one must remember that the capital colombo in the south west of the country is in the midst of the majority sinhala community , while the various tamil-dominated parts of the country lie in the north – primarily former tiger stronghold jaffna , the wanni mainland , and the eastern districts of trincomalee , batticaloa and ampara . in the years that i spent in the island nation , there was little doubt that there was an effective " internal border " demarcating the sinhala and tamil / muslim majority areas of the country .
wasted opportunity most people in the sinhala-dominated south saw the 2002 ceasefire as a complete farce and feared that it simply afforded the tigers the chance to re-arm and strengthen their fighting ranks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tigers are accused of using child soldiers in their armed struggle ultimately , it emerged that those fears were not entirely unfounded .
some analysts say the tigers - banned in sri lanka , india and the us - also used their new-found clout and freedoms under the ceasefire to assassinate several political opponents .
they did all this in total disregard for the peace efforts facilitated by norway , which had the eu 's backing .
in the end , the international community was disenchanted with the tigers ' conduct during the " ceasefire " years , and the manner in which they stymied the peace talks .
once it became apparent that neither side cared for norway 's intervention , oslo had little choice but to bow out .
eventually the eu also listed the ltte as a terrorist group .
for those of us who watched the events unfold in sri lanka from close quarters , there was a sense of dismay at the lost opportunity – not simply that the " ceasefire " was n't for real but that the tigers , who had time and again shown remarkable organisational and strategic skills , had failed to make use of their " ticket " to the political mainstream .
western powers snubbed in recent weeks , as the military stepped up the war in the north , the un said thousands of innocent people had been killed in the conflict zone with some 50,000 others being trapped .
president rajapakse 's government thumbed its nose at the international community , shrugging off condemnation of the manner in which it has pushed ahead with its military offensive .
the sri lankan government also angered the eu a couple of weeks ago by refusing entry to the swedish foreign minister who had planned to accompany his british and french counterparts to the country to press for an immediate truce .
the uk 's david miliband and france 's bernard kouchner visited colombo to urge the two sides to cease fire in order to enable the un to evacuate civilians .
however , the rajapakse government , which was convinced that victory was close at hand , rejected their pleas .
now it appears by all accounts that the ltte 's armed struggle has been finished off , and that the tigers are a spent force .
few would have believed just a couple of years ago that asia 's longest running civil war was drawing to a close .
the rebels ran a de-facto state covering nearly one-third of the country .
they had set up a parallel administrative and social infrastructure , complete with their own schools , a bank , courts , a taxation system , a civil service and even a border control mechanism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the end of war mean an end to bombings , destruction and suffering ?
and in the south , they spread terror through suicide bombings and political assassinations .
few of us who lived through the bombings in colombo can erase memories of the carnage , destruction and the utter dread that resulted .
post-war scenario now the question that 's on most observers ' minds is whether rajapakse , who has won adulation from his sinhala constituency for achieving what seemed to be a near-impossible task will also be able to persuade the large and divided tamil community - many in the outside world view sri lankan tamils as a monolithic entity and they could n't be farther from the truth - that his government will provide a benevolent and constructive leadership for all .
it would seem to me that even those of the fractured tamil community that did n't subscribe to the rebels ' strategies must find the speed at which the tiger infrastructure has crumbled extremely incomprehensible .
moreover , they must now adapt to a life without the tigers .
that said , some caution that military victory may not spell peace , as the tigers could well return to guerrilla warfare .

musical " the producers " takes the stage in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a simpering , silly hitler is the centerpiece of " the producers " ' flop turned satiric hit they sing , they dance , they conquer france !
stormtroopers and a simpering , silly hitler take the stage in the berlin production of musical comedy " the producers " .
is germany ready to laugh at its own taboos ? andreas bieber , one of the stars of the new production at berlin 's admiralspalast theatre , wants one thing to be clear : " people think it 's a musical about hitler – of course that 's not the case . " but that notorious name is part of what is raising eyebrows over the show , which has goose-stepping as well as tap-dancing , and mines taboos for comic effect . " the producers " tells the story of two theatrical ne 'er do wells , lecherous has-been max bialystock , and wimpy wannabe leopold bloom , who discover that flops can make more money than hits .
they set out to produce the loser of all losers – a musical about hitler , written by and starring a demented neo-nazi , and directed by a flamboyant gay director , which is " certain to offend people of all races , creeds and religions , and guaranteed to close in one night . "
surprisingly , when the manic but macho lead is replaced with a campy , outrageous performance by the director , the fascist frolic is taken for brilliant satire .
" springtime for hitler " becomes a smash hit , and the producers end up in jail for defrauding their backers .
bildunterschrift : singing , dancing nazis storm the stage in " the producers " american comedy icon mel brooks ' original 1968 movie sparked a tony-award winning 2001 broadway show , which in turn was made into a 2005 musical film .
audiences in london , tokyo , athens and even tel aviv have all fallen for the crazy comedy .
but a german-language version was lacking until last summer 's production in vienna , austria .
a love letter to a lost culture , or a risky joke ?
the production is now on stage in berlin .
titus hoffmann , resident director at the admiralspalast for the production of " the producers " , calls the show a love letter to show business , including an entertainment culture that once thrived in the german capital .
" there was a huge cabaret scene , lots of satirical , ironic , funny people , that were killed in the third reich then , or they had to leave and they went to america and a lot of those people went to new york and worked on broadway .
" and somehow , it feels a bit like it 's a return , and it brings the humor back to the country , which is so great .
because apart from all the awful and terrible things that happened through hitler , what still is lacking a little in germany is good humor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : controversial banners announce the german premier of the musical " the producers " so far , not everyone here is getting the joke .
local papers have described the show as " risky " and even the production 's advertising has caused a fuss .
it 's illegal to portray the swastika publicly in germany , so the casually reclining hitler in poster ads for the play wears an armband displaying a pretzel .
banners showing the doughy treat in black on a red and white banner have been hanging in the theatre courtyard for months . they 've garnered double-takes from passersby , and a few complaints to the police .
the storm troopers wear the real thing when they take the stage , though , due to a theatrical exception . equal opportunity offender in some ways , brooks ' classic can be seen as an equal opportunity offender , with jokes about gays , jews , dumb blondes and sex-crazed little old ladies . the humor at times relies on pratfalls and slapstick .
the song lyrics are especially clever jabs , rhyming nazi with " hotsy-totsy " and declaring , " we 're marching to a faster pace .
look out , here comes the master race ! "
some of the biggest laughs at friday night 's preview show came thanks to nutty neo-nazi playwright franz liebkind , who wears lederhosen and a german military helmet , and has a flock of teutonic-titled pigeons .

musical " the producers " takes the stage in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a simpering , silly hitler is the centerpiece of " the producers " ' flop turned satiric hit they sing , they dance , they conquer france !
stormtroopers and a simpering , silly hitler take the stage in the berlin production of musical comedy " the producers " .
is germany ready to laugh at its own taboos ? andreas bieber , one of the stars of the new production at berlin 's admiralspalast theatre , wants one thing to be clear : " people think it 's a musical about hitler – of course that 's not the case . " but that notorious name is part of what is raising eyebrows over the show , which has goose-stepping as well as tap-dancing , and mines taboos for comic effect . " the producers " tells the story of two theatrical ne 'er do wells , lecherous has-been max bialystock , and wimpy wannabe leopold bloom , who discover that flops can make more money than hits .
they set out to produce the loser of all losers – a musical about hitler , written by and starring a demented neo-nazi , and directed by a flamboyant gay director , which is " certain to offend people of all races , creeds and religions , and guaranteed to close in one night . "
surprisingly , when the manic but macho lead is replaced with a campy , outrageous performance by the director , the fascist frolic is taken for brilliant satire .
" springtime for hitler " becomes a smash hit , and the producers end up in jail for defrauding their backers .
bildunterschrift : singing , dancing nazis storm the stage in " the producers " american comedy icon mel brooks ' original 1968 movie sparked a tony-award winning 2001 broadway show , which in turn was made into a 2005 musical film .
audiences in london , tokyo , athens and even tel aviv have all fallen for the crazy comedy .
but a german-language version was lacking until last summer 's production in vienna , austria .
a love letter to a lost culture , or a risky joke ?
the production is now on stage in berlin .
titus hoffmann , resident director at the admiralspalast for the production of " the producers " , calls the show a love letter to show business , including an entertainment culture that once thrived in the german capital .
" there was a huge cabaret scene , lots of satirical , ironic , funny people , that were killed in the third reich then , or they had to leave and they went to america and a lot of those people went to new york and worked on broadway .
" and somehow , it feels a bit like it 's a return , and it brings the humor back to the country , which is so great .
because apart from all the awful and terrible things that happened through hitler , what still is lacking a little in germany is good humor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : controversial banners announce the german premier of the musical " the producers " so far , not everyone here is getting the joke .
local papers have described the show as " risky " and even the production 's advertising has caused a fuss .
it 's illegal to portray the swastika publicly in germany , so the casually reclining hitler in poster ads for the play wears an armband displaying a pretzel .
banners showing the doughy treat in black on a red and white banner have been hanging in the theatre courtyard for months . they 've garnered double-takes from passersby , and a few complaints to the police .
the storm troopers wear the real thing when they take the stage , though , due to a theatrical exception . equal opportunity offender in some ways , brooks ' classic can be seen as an equal opportunity offender , with jokes about gays , jews , dumb blondes and sex-crazed little old ladies . the humor at times relies on pratfalls and slapstick .
the song lyrics are especially clever jabs , rhyming nazi with " hotsy-totsy " and declaring , " we 're marching to a faster pace .
look out , here comes the master race ! "
some of the biggest laughs at friday night 's preview show came thanks to nutty neo-nazi playwright franz liebkind , who wears lederhosen and a german military helmet , and has a flock of teutonic-titled pigeons .
he insists that the two producers join him in wearing a swastika armband and taking an oath in the name of " adolph elizabeth hitler . "
max bialystock grabs the red band , turns it this way and that , and describes it as " idiot proof " since the symbol looks the same from either direction – the audience exploded with delighted guffaws .

musical " the producers " takes the stage in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a simpering , silly hitler is the centerpiece of " the producers " ' flop turned satiric hit they sing , they dance , they conquer france !
stormtroopers and a simpering , silly hitler take the stage in the berlin production of musical comedy " the producers " .
is germany ready to laugh at its own taboos ? andreas bieber , one of the stars of the new production at berlin 's admiralspalast theatre , wants one thing to be clear : " people think it 's a musical about hitler – of course that 's not the case . " but that notorious name is part of what is raising eyebrows over the show , which has goose-stepping as well as tap-dancing , and mines taboos for comic effect . " the producers " tells the story of two theatrical ne 'er do wells , lecherous has-been max bialystock , and wimpy wannabe leopold bloom , who discover that flops can make more money than hits .
they set out to produce the loser of all losers – a musical about hitler , written by and starring a demented neo-nazi , and directed by a flamboyant gay director , which is " certain to offend people of all races , creeds and religions , and guaranteed to close in one night . "
surprisingly , when the manic but macho lead is replaced with a campy , outrageous performance by the director , the fascist frolic is taken for brilliant satire .
" springtime for hitler " becomes a smash hit , and the producers end up in jail for defrauding their backers .
bildunterschrift : singing , dancing nazis storm the stage in " the producers " american comedy icon mel brooks ' original 1968 movie sparked a tony-award winning 2001 broadway show , which in turn was made into a 2005 musical film .
audiences in london , tokyo , athens and even tel aviv have all fallen for the crazy comedy .
but a german-language version was lacking until last summer 's production in vienna , austria .
a love letter to a lost culture , or a risky joke ?
the production is now on stage in berlin .
titus hoffmann , resident director at the admiralspalast for the production of " the producers " , calls the show a love letter to show business , including an entertainment culture that once thrived in the german capital .
" there was a huge cabaret scene , lots of satirical , ironic , funny people , that were killed in the third reich then , or they had to leave and they went to america and a lot of those people went to new york and worked on broadway .
" and somehow , it feels a bit like it 's a return , and it brings the humor back to the country , which is so great .
because apart from all the awful and terrible things that happened through hitler , what still is lacking a little in germany is good humor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : controversial banners announce the german premier of the musical " the producers " so far , not everyone here is getting the joke .
local papers have described the show as " risky " and even the production 's advertising has caused a fuss .
it 's illegal to portray the swastika publicly in germany , so the casually reclining hitler in poster ads for the play wears an armband displaying a pretzel .
banners showing the doughy treat in black on a red and white banner have been hanging in the theatre courtyard for months . they 've garnered double-takes from passersby , and a few complaints to the police .
the storm troopers wear the real thing when they take the stage , though , due to a theatrical exception . equal opportunity offender in some ways , brooks ' classic can be seen as an equal opportunity offender , with jokes about gays , jews , dumb blondes and sex-crazed little old ladies . the humor at times relies on pratfalls and slapstick .
the song lyrics are especially clever jabs , rhyming nazi with " hotsy-totsy " and declaring , " we 're marching to a faster pace .
look out , here comes the master race ! "
some of the biggest laughs at friday night 's preview show came thanks to nutty neo-nazi playwright franz liebkind , who wears lederhosen and a german military helmet , and has a flock of teutonic-titled pigeons .
he insists that the two producers join him in wearing a swastika armband and taking an oath in the name of " adolph elizabeth hitler . "
max bialystock grabs the red band , turns it this way and that , and describes it as " idiot proof " since the symbol looks the same from either direction – the audience exploded with delighted guffaws .
" it 's not ok to make fun of the holocaust .
but hitler as a person , is ok to ridicule . "
still there 's a slight uneasiness that comes from seeing one-armed salutes in a city with such a tortured history , agrees nigel west , the production 's director . " when you see the show in america , you do n't think twice about it .
because of where we are , you do think twice about it … of course there 's a large age group that could still be affected by what went on , but people hopefully below the age of 60 will come and they 'll forgive and they 'll go with it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actor martin sommerlatte plays adolf hitler in the musical " the producers " 34-year-old sven schmidt lived up to west 's hopes – although surprised by some of the scenes , schmidt said he laughed a lot , and his only complaint was that the second half lagged a little .
" it 's another generation .
we do n't have that much to do with it anymore , " schmidt said .
" this was a parody of hitler , so it 's ok to laugh .
other things , it might not be ok to laugh at .
it 's not ok to make fun of the holocaust .
but hitler as a person is ok to ridicule " .
actor andreas bieber thinks berlin is the perfect place for brooks ' hit .
he hopes audiences will come to the performance knowing what the show is about , and ready to let themselves enjoy it . " berlin of course is the city where it all happened .
and everybody 's reminded about that all the time .
it 's really not about denying history and what happened , but we have to move on , and we have to look at things from a different angle , and it 's great to do that in the city where it all happened . "
previews of " the producers " take place this weekend , with the official premier of the musical sunday evening .
the production is currently booked for a two and a half month run .
response in vienna was muted , with the scheduled run of a year cut to 10 months .

deutsche welle 's ranjitha balasubramanyam says while the war may be over , peace is still some way off . as the sri lankan military 's mop-up operations continue in what appears to be the culmination of a long-drawn-out war against the liberation tigers of tamil eelam , a senior rebel leader has been quoted as saying that the battle has " reached its bitter end " .
in an apparent admission of defeat , selvarasa pathmanathan , the tigers ' chief of international relations , also said in a statement on a pro-rebel website that they had " decided to silence " their guns .
some observers and certainly the government of president mahinda rajapakse believe the tigers had little choice , having been boxed into a tiny patch of land not exceeding a few square kilometres in the northeast of the island nation .
so , few are likely to be taken in by the rebel claim that they have decided to give up fighting entirely on account of their desire " to remove the last weak excuse of the enemy for killing our people . "
paradoxes in the plot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over the years tens of thousands have been killed in the fighting .
from the onset , president rajapakse made no bones about the fact that his government sought to crush the ltte militarily while keeping the door open for negotiations .
ironically , it was ltte leader velupillai prabhakaran who was largely instrumental in the 2005 presidential poll victory for rajapakse , already a hardliner .
the ltte had ordered the people of the tamil-dominated north and east of the country to boycott the polls .
that directive from the rebels , who had a stranglehold on the population in the region , resulted in a defeat for incumbent prime minister ranil wickremesinghe , in the absence of support from a large segment of the tamil electorate .
again , paradoxically , it was wickremesinghe who had pushed for a political solution and initiated a ceasefire with the rebels in 2002 .
i clearly remember the bewilderment on wickremesinghe 's face as the tigers ' " decree " filtered down to southern sri lanka .
one must remember that the capital colombo in the south west of the country is in the midst of the majority sinhala community , while the various tamil-dominated parts of the country lie in the north – primarily former tiger stronghold jaffna , the wanni mainland , and the eastern districts of trincomalee , batticaloa and ampara . in the years that i spent in the island nation , there was little doubt that there was an effective " internal border " demarcating the sinhala and tamil / muslim majority areas of the country .
wasted opportunity most people in the sinhala-dominated south saw the 2002 ceasefire as a complete farce and feared that it simply afforded the tigers the chance to re-arm and strengthen their fighting ranks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tigers are accused of using child soldiers in their armed struggle ultimately , it emerged that those fears were not entirely unfounded .
some analysts say the tigers - banned in sri lanka , india and the us - also used their new-found clout and freedoms under the ceasefire to assassinate several political opponents .
they did all this in total disregard for the peace efforts facilitated by norway , which had the eu 's backing .
in the end , the international community was disenchanted with the tigers ' conduct during the " ceasefire " years , and the manner in which they stymied the peace talks .
once it became apparent that neither side cared for norway 's intervention , oslo had little choice but to bow out .
eventually the eu also listed the ltte as a terrorist group .
for those of us who watched the events unfold in sri lanka from close quarters , there was a sense of dismay at the lost opportunity – not simply that the " ceasefire " was n't for real but that the tigers , who had time and again shown remarkable organisational and strategic skills , had failed to make use of their " ticket " to the political mainstream .
western powers snubbed in recent weeks , as the military stepped up the war in the north , the un said thousands of innocent people had been killed in the conflict zone with some 50,000 others being trapped .
president rajapakse 's government thumbed its nose at the international community , shrugging off condemnation of the manner in which it has pushed ahead with its military offensive .
the sri lankan government also angered the eu a couple of weeks ago by refusing entry to the swedish foreign minister who had planned to accompany his british and french counterparts to the country to press for an immediate truce .
the uk 's david miliband and france 's bernard kouchner visited colombo to urge the two sides to cease fire in order to enable the un to evacuate civilians .
however , the rajapakse government , which was convinced that victory was close at hand , rejected their pleas .
now it appears by all accounts that the ltte 's armed struggle has been finished off , and that the tigers are a spent force .
few would have believed just a couple of years ago that asia 's longest running civil war was drawing to a close .
the rebels ran a de-facto state covering nearly one-third of the country .
they had set up a parallel administrative and social infrastructure , complete with their own schools , a bank , courts , a taxation system , a civil service and even a border control mechanism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the end of war mean an end to bombings , destruction and suffering ?
and in the south , they spread terror through suicide bombings and political assassinations .
few of us who lived through the bombings in colombo can erase memories of the carnage , destruction and the utter dread that resulted .
post-war scenario now the question that 's on most observers ' minds is whether rajapakse , who has won adulation from his sinhala constituency for achieving what seemed to be a near-impossible task will also be able to persuade the large and divided tamil community - many in the outside world view sri lankan tamils as a monolithic entity and they could n't be farther from the truth - that his government will provide a benevolent and constructive leadership for all .
it would seem to me that even those of the fractured tamil community that did n't subscribe to the rebels ' strategies must find the speed at which the tiger infrastructure has crumbled extremely incomprehensible .
moreover , they must now adapt to a life without the tigers .
that said , some caution that military victory may not spell peace , as the tigers could well return to guerrilla warfare .

in the end , the international community was disenchanted with the tigers ' conduct during the " ceasefire " years , and the manner in which they stymied the peace talks .
once it became apparent that neither side cared for norway 's intervention , oslo had little choice but to bow out .
eventually the eu also listed the ltte as a terrorist group .
for those of us who watched the events unfold in sri lanka from close quarters , there was a sense of dismay at the lost opportunity – not simply that the " ceasefire " was n't for real but that the tigers , who had time and again shown remarkable organisational and strategic skills , had failed to make use of their " ticket " to the political mainstream .
western powers snubbed in recent weeks , as the military stepped up the war in the north , the un said thousands of innocent people had been killed in the conflict zone with some 50,000 others being trapped .
president rajapakse 's government thumbed its nose at the international community , shrugging off condemnation of the manner in which it has pushed ahead with its military offensive .
the sri lankan government also angered the eu a couple of weeks ago by refusing entry to the swedish foreign minister who had planned to accompany his british and french counterparts to the country to press for an immediate truce .
the uk 's david miliband and france 's bernard kouchner visited colombo to urge the two sides to cease fire in order to enable the un to evacuate civilians .
however , the rajapakse government , which was convinced that victory was close at hand , rejected their pleas .
now it appears by all accounts that the ltte 's armed struggle has been finished off , and that the tigers are a spent force .
few would have believed just a couple of years ago that asia 's longest running civil war was drawing to a close .
the rebels ran a de-facto state covering nearly one-third of the country .
they had set up a parallel administrative and social infrastructure , complete with their own schools , a bank , courts , a taxation system , a civil service and even a border control mechanism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the end of war mean an end to bombings , destruction and suffering ?
and in the south , they spread terror through suicide bombings and political assassinations .
few of us who lived through the bombings in colombo can erase memories of the carnage , destruction and the utter dread that resulted .
post-war scenario now the question that 's on most observers ' minds is whether rajapakse , who has won adulation from his sinhala constituency for achieving what seemed to be a near-impossible task will also be able to persuade the large and divided tamil community - many in the outside world view sri lankan tamils as a monolithic entity and they could n't be farther from the truth - that his government will provide a benevolent and constructive leadership for all .
it would seem to me that even those of the fractured tamil community that did n't subscribe to the rebels ' strategies must find the speed at which the tiger infrastructure has crumbled extremely incomprehensible .
moreover , they must now adapt to a life without the tigers .
that said , some caution that military victory may not spell peace , as the tigers could well return to guerrilla warfare .

deutsche welle 's ranjitha balasubramanyam says while the war may be over , peace is still some way off . as the sri lankan military 's mop-up operations continue in what appears to be the culmination of a long-drawn-out war against the liberation tigers of tamil eelam , a senior rebel leader has been quoted as saying that the battle has " reached its bitter end " .
in an apparent admission of defeat , selvarasa pathmanathan , the tigers ' chief of international relations , also said in a statement on a pro-rebel website that they had " decided to silence " their guns .
some observers and certainly the government of president mahinda rajapakse believe the tigers had little choice , having been boxed into a tiny patch of land not exceeding a few square kilometres in the northeast of the island nation .
so , few are likely to be taken in by the rebel claim that they have decided to give up fighting entirely on account of their desire " to remove the last weak excuse of the enemy for killing our people . "
paradoxes in the plot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over the years tens of thousands have been killed in the fighting .
from the onset , president rajapakse made no bones about the fact that his government sought to crush the ltte militarily while keeping the door open for negotiations .
ironically , it was ltte leader velupillai prabhakaran who was largely instrumental in the 2005 presidential poll victory for rajapakse , already a hardliner .
the ltte had ordered the people of the tamil-dominated north and east of the country to boycott the polls .
that directive from the rebels , who had a stranglehold on the population in the region , resulted in a defeat for incumbent prime minister ranil wickremesinghe , in the absence of support from a large segment of the tamil electorate .
again , paradoxically , it was wickremesinghe who had pushed for a political solution and initiated a ceasefire with the rebels in 2002 .
i clearly remember the bewilderment on wickremesinghe 's face as the tigers ' " decree " filtered down to southern sri lanka .
one must remember that the capital colombo in the south west of the country is in the midst of the majority sinhala community , while the various tamil-dominated parts of the country lie in the north – primarily former tiger stronghold jaffna , the wanni mainland , and the eastern districts of trincomalee , batticaloa and ampara . in the years that i spent in the island nation , there was little doubt that there was an effective " internal border " demarcating the sinhala and tamil / muslim majority areas of the country .
wasted opportunity most people in the sinhala-dominated south saw the 2002 ceasefire as a complete farce and feared that it simply afforded the tigers the chance to re-arm and strengthen their fighting ranks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tigers are accused of using child soldiers in their armed struggle ultimately , it emerged that those fears were not entirely unfounded .
some analysts say the tigers - banned in sri lanka , india and the us - also used their new-found clout and freedoms under the ceasefire to assassinate several political opponents .
they did all this in total disregard for the peace efforts facilitated by norway , which had the eu 's backing .

fdp leader guido westerwelle says the free democrats are now keeping all options open . " we want to rule , " party leader guido westerwelle said to over 500 fdp delegates at a party convention over the weekend .
general elections in germany are due in september this year and traditionally the liberals ' goal would be to join forces as junior partners with angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
opinion polls show , however , that a coalition between the fdp and the cdu is unlikely to gain a ruling majority .
so , the free democrats are forced to keep their options open .
westerwelle on sunday reconfirmed his preference for the cdu , but added that his party also would n't exclude forming a three-way coalition with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens .
announcement to come before upcoming elections the fdp , germany 's third largest party behind the cdu and the spd , concluded their party convention on sunday saying that any concrete plans for a possible coalition would only be announced one week ahead of september ’ s election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : struck says the free democrats must join the spd and the greens if they want to rule peter struck , the chairman of the spd 's parliamentary faction , told the german newspaper welt am sonntag in a sunday interview that the fdp would have to enter a coalition with the spd and the greens if it wanted to win a majority in the general elections .
" it does n't matter what guido westerwelle says at this point : the free democrats will have to be ready to enter a coalition with the spd and the greens if they want to rule .
otherwise they would risk being out of power until at least 2013 , making it 15 years since they have been a part of a ruling coalition .
westerwelle would n't risk that , " he said .
fdp running on tax reform the economy is likely to be one of the main battlegrounds in the september election , and the fdp has vehemently criticized merkel 's coalition policies , in particular state bailouts and government stimulus measures .
" if a big company goes bust , the german eagle flies in .
if a small company goes bust , the bankruptcy vultures arrive , " westerwelle said with both fists clenched at the weekend convention .
westerwelle has also promised tax cuts to help lift germany out of its deepest recession since the end of the second world war .
the fdp election campaign promises an overhaul of the german tax system and a reduction of the burden on middle class families to the tune of up to 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 47.40 billion -rrb- .
" tax cuts will help the economy more than subsidizing one branch after the other .
we should relieve the burden on the middle classes .
that is the best answer to the downturn , " he said. glb / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

over 97 percent of shareholders reportedly backed the decision , passed at a two-day annual shareholders meeting in frankfurt on saturday .
commerzbank , which was forced to ask for state aid last year , is to issue 295 million new shares at a price of six euros per share , according to a statement by the bank .
the government is to acquire the new shares via the financial market stabilisation fund -lrb- soffin -rrb- - the german government 's rescue fund .
on thursday , the european commission approved the second tranche of german state aid to the tune of about 10 billion euros .
the brussels-based body insisted that the plans for the new injection of capital , which comes after a first infusion of eight billion euros , is meant to ensure the bank 's long-term health without giving it an unfair advantage over rivals .
in return for the comission 's approval , commerzbank will be forced to recentre its activities into business and individual retail banking and abandon its investment banking and commercial real-estate activities , which have accounted for about 45 percent of its total activities .
commerzbank chief executive martin blessing told press on friday that the state aid will be paid back in full and that the bank currently does n't require any further state aid .
struggling commerzbank ended 2008 with a sharp loss of 6.6 billion euros , due to the integration of ailing dresdner bank and the global credit crunch .
the bank has stayed in the red in 2009 , posting a net loss of 861 million euros for the first quarter on friday .
following the full integration of the dresdner bank in late january 2009 , commerzbank executives underlined that the restructuring would pay off in the future , forecasting a profit by 2011 at the latest , and an operating profit of more than four billion euros by 2012. nk / afp / dpa editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

over 97 percent of shareholders reportedly backed the decision , passed at a two-day annual shareholders meeting in frankfurt on saturday .
commerzbank , which was forced to ask for state aid last year , is to issue 295 million new shares at a price of six euros per share , according to a statement by the bank .
the government is to acquire the new shares via the financial market stabilisation fund -lrb- soffin -rrb- - the german government 's rescue fund .
on thursday , the european commission approved the second tranche of german state aid to the tune of about 10 billion euros .
the brussels-based body insisted that the plans for the new injection of capital , which comes after a first infusion of eight billion euros , is meant to ensure the bank 's long-term health without giving it an unfair advantage over rivals .
in return for the comission 's approval , commerzbank will be forced to recentre its activities into business and individual retail banking and abandon its investment banking and commercial real-estate activities , which have accounted for about 45 percent of its total activities .
commerzbank chief executive martin blessing told press on friday that the state aid will be paid back in full and that the bank currently does n't require any further state aid .
struggling commerzbank ended 2008 with a sharp loss of 6.6 billion euros , due to the integration of ailing dresdner bank and the global credit crunch .
the bank has stayed in the red in 2009 , posting a net loss of 861 million euros for the first quarter on friday .
following the full integration of the dresdner bank in late january 2009 , commerzbank executives underlined that the restructuring would pay off in the future , forecasting a profit by 2011 at the latest , and an operating profit of more than four billion euros by 2012. nk / afp / dpa editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

zeeman says it is constantly changing , as a number of artists and crews express themselves .
" artists do n't only work as individuals .
they are working as crews which you could compare to teams in sports , " she says .

sunday 's protests were organized by the kemalist thought association -lrb- kta -rrb- , an organization dedicated to preserving the legacy of mustafa kemal ataturk -lrb- 1881-1938 -rrb- , the founder of the modern turkish republic .
the marchers were waving red and white turkish flags and were headed for the mausoleum of ataturk , the traditional rallying point of those in favor of secular rule .
qualms with prime minister the demonstrators protested what they called the anti-secular principles of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
his opponents accuse him of attempting to make turkey more overtly islamic through incremental steps , such as failing to end bans on islamic-style headscarves at turkish universities .
protestors also accused the akp of seeking to replace turkey 's secular system with a regime based on sharia , or koranic law .
the akp does have religious roots but has rejected being referred to as " islamist " .
secularists are concerned about the rise of erdogan 's justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , and the election by the akp-controlled parliament of abdullah gul as president .
demonstrators were also protesting the government 's handling of the economy as unemployment in the country has reached a record high amid the global economic downturn. glb / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many see grybauskaite as a competent leader who remains outside party politics . european union budget chief dalia grybauskaite appears to have won a resounding victory in lithuania 's presidential election , according to an exit poll .
grybauskaite received 67.9 percent of the first-round vote , far outstripping social democrat candidate algirdas butkevicius who bagged just 11.8 percent .
the exit poll found that the five other candidates lagged far behind butkevicius .
under lithuanian law , half of the country 's 2.7 million registered voters must have voted for a presidential candidate who obtains over 50 percent of the vote to avoid a run-off ballot against the second-ranked rival .
first figures from the country 's electoral commission showed that turnout was still well short of that hurdle .

grybauskaite has vowed to pull her country of 3.34 million " out of the political and economic shadows . " she has been a member of the european commission , the eu executive arm , since lithuania joined the bloc in 2004 .
in her role as a european commission member , grybauskaite has frequently chastised vilnius for having squandered the country 's economic boom and failure to prepare for the deepening recession .
" my conscience as a citizen would n't let me stay in brussels , " she said ahead of the election . " one of the first tasks will be to solve this crisis , to try to stabilize lithuania 's financial position so that the country can climb back up the curve as fast as possible . "
lithuania 's non-partisan incumbent president valdas adamkus , 82 , is retiring after serving two five-year terms , and his successor is due to take the reins in july .

many see grybauskaite as a competent leader who remains outside party politics . european union budget chief dalia grybauskaite appears to have won a resounding victory in lithuania 's presidential election , according to an exit poll .
grybauskaite received 67.9 percent of the first-round vote , far outstripping social democrat candidate algirdas butkevicius who bagged just 11.8 percent .
the exit poll found that the five other candidates lagged far behind butkevicius .
under lithuanian law , half of the country 's 2.7 million registered voters must have voted for a presidential candidate who obtains over 50 percent of the vote to avoid a run-off ballot against the second-ranked rival .

grybauskaite has vowed to pull her country of 3.34 million " out of the political and economic shadows . " she has been a member of the european commission , the eu executive arm , since lithuania joined the bloc in 2004 .
in her role as a european commission member , grybauskaite has frequently chastised vilnius for having squandered the country 's economic boom and failure to prepare for the deepening recession .
" my conscience as a citizen would n't let me stay in brussels , " she said ahead of the election . " one of the first tasks will be to solve this crisis , to try to stabilize lithuania 's financial position so that the country can climb back up the curve as fast as possible . "

from graffiti to sticker art , cut-outs , stencils , installations , and paste-ups , today the streets of berlin are an open gallery for those who appreciate urban art .
and now the internet and digital media have taken that a step further to document and curate interesting and unique examples of the form , with the recently launched " urban art guide " .
bildunterschrift : cut-outs and stickers from all over the city are being archived online it is a digital application that that can be used online and on iphones , and has three basic tools .
one is called " locate me " , and it includes a berlin map which outlines the pieces of urban art in the vicinity , information about them , the artist and how to get there .
another function is the gallery view , which includes more than a hundred pieces of urban art , while the third offers selected tours , mapped out in berlin 's hippest neighborhoods and highlights the best of the city 's street art . maria zeeman , from the guide 's editorial staff , says they are discovering new works daily , which they add to the urban art guide .
she says users of the guide are also helping .
" they find something and say , that 's interesting , smart , cute or romantic .
" we are more a platform for people exchanging ideas on what is the newest , what is the best idea , what is arty , what is not , " zeeman said .

the " urban art church " in the heart of berlin , those on the hunt for real urban art can find the " urban art church " .
everything , from the ceiling , door and even the mailboxes are covered in what looks like one large eclectic collage : comic-like figures , a line of underwear hanging on a clothes line , a large serpent , robots , as well as graphic erotic scenes .
this is the cumulative work of many urban artists .
zeeman says it is constantly changing , as a number of artists and crews express themselves .
" artists do n't only work as individuals .
they are working as crews which you could compare to teams in sports , " she says .
" there can be some kind of battling over space ; that one evening one crew puts one piece of art up , and the next day another crew comes and puts a bigger one on it .
" in that way you can see a wall changing and growing . "
meeting the urban artist behind the art nomad is one of the berlin urban artists whose work is well-represented in the guide .
he has been creating urban art for many years and says he does not plan his work .
instead , he says he allows himself to be inspired by the city 's streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stencil and a spray can is all they need to make instant art " when i walk the streets , i paint a lot of trash that is lying around on the street , which you can perfectly legally transform into art , because it is not forbidden to paint on trash .
it is forbidden to leave it on the street , but not to paint on it , " he says .
nomad says items anything from sofas and mattresses to old washing machines are good " canvases " for his paintings .
" i roller paint on it , i spray on it , and most of the time i use a classic marker … because you can carry it all the time with you .
it comes in handy when you are just walking around . "
nomad says he appreciates the urban art guide 's interactive presentation , but he feels when the work is taken off the street and put on the internet , things gets lost in " it translation " .
" i do n't think that urban art happens in galleries , or on the internet .
it does n't happen anywhere but on the street , " nomad said .

sunday 's protests were organized by the kemalist thought association -lrb- kta -rrb- , an organization dedicated to preserving the legacy of mustafa kemal ataturk -lrb- 1881-1938 -rrb- , the founder of the modern turkish republic .

protestors also accused the akp of seeking to replace turkey 's secular system with a regime based on sharia , or koranic law .
the akp does have religious roots but has rejected being referred to as " islamist " .

the discussions were to include a " cooperative arrangement and possible merger " of karstadt with metro 's own department store chain , galeria kaufhof .
metro , one of europe 's largest retailers , also runs its own brand name supermarket chain .
arcandor , which operates the quelle mail-order business , karstadt department stores and the thomas cook travel agency chain , has been in trouble for several years , with other retailers chipping away at its market share .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metro ceo cordes proposes a private solution rather than a government bailout in a statement , arcandor boss karl-gerhard eick said he was willing to talk about metro 's proposal , but doubted whether the german competition authorities would allow a merger of the country 's two largest department store chains .
together , karstadt and kaufhof have 247 stores nationwide .
arcandor a victim of the credit crunch last friday , arcandor said it would appeal to chancellor angela merkel 's government for a 650 million euro bailout to stave off collapse .
chief executive eick said a decision was needed within four weeks so that banks could roll over the 650 million in credit that expires on june 12 .
eick said the global economic crisis was making it difficult to obtain new credit without government guarantees .
four months from a general election , the demand could put the government on the spot .

fdp leader guido westerwelle says the free democrats are now keeping all options open . " we want to rule , " party leader guido westerwelle said to over 500 fdp delegates at a party convention over the weekend .
general elections in germany are due in september this year and traditionally the liberals ' goal would be to join forces as junior partners with angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
opinion polls show , however , that a coalition between the fdp and the cdu is unlikely to gain a ruling majority .
so , the free democrats are forced to keep their options open .
westerwelle on sunday reconfirmed his preference for the cdu , but added that his party also would n't exclude forming a three-way coalition with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens .
announcement to come before upcoming elections the fdp , germany 's third largest party behind the cdu and the spd , concluded their party convention on sunday saying that any concrete plans for a possible coalition would only be announced one week ahead of september ’ s election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : struck says the free democrats must join the spd and the greens if they want to rule peter struck , the chairman of the spd 's parliamentary faction , told the german newspaper welt am sonntag in a sunday interview that the fdp would have to enter a coalition with the spd and the greens if it wanted to win a majority in the general elections .
" it does n't matter what guido westerwelle says at this point : the free democrats will have to be ready to enter a coalition with the spd and the greens if they want to rule .
otherwise they would risk being out of power until at least 2013 , making it 15 years since they have been a part of a ruling coalition .
westerwelle would n't risk that , " he said .
fdp running on tax reform the economy is likely to be one of the main battlegrounds in the september election , and the fdp has vehemently criticized merkel 's coalition policies , in particular state bailouts and government stimulus measures .
" if a big company goes bust , the german eagle flies in .
if a small company goes bust , the bankruptcy vultures arrive , " westerwelle said with both fists clenched at the weekend convention .
westerwelle has also promised tax cuts to help lift germany out of its deepest recession since the end of the second world war .
the fdp election campaign promises an overhaul of the german tax system and a reduction of the burden on middle class families to the tune of up to 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 47.40 billion -rrb- .
" tax cuts will help the economy more than subsidizing one branch after the other .
we should relieve the burden on the middle classes .

over 97 percent of shareholders reportedly backed the decision , passed at a two-day annual shareholders meeting in frankfurt on saturday .
commerzbank , which was forced to ask for state aid last year , is to issue 295 million new shares at a price of six euros per share , according to a statement by the bank .
the government is to acquire the new shares via the financial market stabilisation fund -lrb- soffin -rrb- - the german government 's rescue fund .
on thursday , the european commission approved the second tranche of german state aid to the tune of about 10 billion euros .
the brussels-based body insisted that the plans for the new injection of capital , which comes after a first infusion of eight billion euros , is meant to ensure the bank 's long-term health without giving it an unfair advantage over rivals .
in return for the comission 's approval , commerzbank will be forced to recentre its activities into business and individual retail banking and abandon its investment banking and commercial real-estate activities , which have accounted for about 45 percent of its total activities .
commerzbank chief executive martin blessing told press on friday that the state aid will be paid back in full and that the bank currently does n't require any further state aid .
struggling commerzbank ended 2008 with a sharp loss of 6.6 billion euros , due to the integration of ailing dresdner bank and the global credit crunch .
the bank has stayed in the red in 2009 , posting a net loss of 861 million euros for the first quarter on friday .
following the full integration of the dresdner bank in late january 2009 , commerzbank executives underlined that the restructuring would pay off in the future , forecasting a profit by 2011 at the latest , and an operating profit of more than four billion euros by 2012. nk / afp / dpa editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

from graffiti to sticker art , cut-outs , stencils , installations , and paste-ups , today the streets of berlin are an open gallery for those who appreciate urban art .
and now the internet and digital media have taken that a step further to document and curate interesting and unique examples of the form , with the recently launched " urban art guide " .
bildunterschrift : cut-outs and stickers from all over the city are being archived online it is a digital application that that can be used online and on iphones , and has three basic tools .
one is called " locate me " , and it includes a berlin map which outlines the pieces of urban art in the vicinity , information about them , the artist and how to get there .
another function is the gallery view , which includes more than a hundred pieces of urban art , while the third offers selected tours , mapped out in berlin 's hippest neighborhoods and highlights the best of the city 's street art . maria zeeman , from the guide 's editorial staff , says they are discovering new works daily , which they add to the urban art guide .
she says users of the guide are also helping .
" they find something and say , that 's interesting , smart , cute or romantic .
" we are more a platform for people exchanging ideas on what is the newest , what is the best idea , what is arty , what is not , " zeeman said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two singing woman on a berlin wall - graffiti or art ?
the " urban art church " in the heart of berlin , those on the hunt for real urban art can find the " urban art church " .
everything , from the ceiling , door and even the mailboxes are covered in what looks like one large eclectic collage : comic-like figures , a line of underwear hanging on a clothes line , a large serpent , robots , as well as graphic erotic scenes .
this is the cumulative work of many urban artists .
zeeman says it is constantly changing , as a number of artists and crews express themselves .
" artists do n't only work as individuals .
they are working as crews which you could compare to teams in sports , " she says .
" there can be some kind of battling over space ; that one evening one crew puts one piece of art up , and the next day another crew comes and puts a bigger one on it .
" in that way you can see a wall changing and growing . "
meeting the urban artist behind the art nomad is one of the berlin urban artists whose work is well-represented in the guide .
he has been creating urban art for many years and says he does not plan his work .
instead , he says he allows himself to be inspired by the city 's streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stencil and a spray can is all they need to make instant art " when i walk the streets , i paint a lot of trash that is lying around on the street , which you can perfectly legally transform into art , because it is not forbidden to paint on trash .
it is forbidden to leave it on the street , but not to paint on it , " he says .
nomad says items anything from sofas and mattresses to old washing machines are good " canvases " for his paintings .
" i roller paint on it , i spray on it , and most of the time i use a classic marker … because you can carry it all the time with you .
it comes in handy when you are just walking around . "
nomad says he appreciates the urban art guide 's interactive presentation , but he feels when the work is taken off the street and put on the internet , things gets lost in " it translation " .
" i do n't think that urban art happens in galleries , or on the internet .
it does n't happen anywhere but on the street , " nomad said .

tory mp david maclean , who led the secrecy bid , rejected sunday telegraph claims he used public money to renovate a house and avoid capital gains tax .
labour mps david clelland and fraser kemp and tories julian lewis and david ruffley are also accused of benefiting .
prime minister gordon brown has vowed to stamp out " unacceptable behaviour " .
writing in the news of the world , mr brown said he " does not rule out any sanction " , as he pledged to restore trust after the expenses revelations .
the latest in a string of allegations published by the telegraph media group focuses on mps who backed an unsuccessful bill , introduced by mr maclean , to exempt mps from the freedom of information -lrb- foi -rrb- act .
i was forced to obey a rule which i thought illogical david maclean conservative mp statement in full : david maclean the newspaper claims that after using £ 20,000 of taxpayer 's money to renovate a property before selling it , mr maclean , who represents penrith and the border , avoided paying capital gains tax on the sale by telling the taxman it was his main home .
but in a statement issued to the bbc , the mp said he utterly refuted the allegation .
he said that when he became opposition chief whip he was told it was compulsory to make london his main home .
" i have never ' flipped ' my property or sought to refurbish it at taxpayer 's expense , " he said .
meanwhile , tyne bridge mp david clelland reportedly " bought out " his partner 's share of a joint mortgage on a flat in london at a cost of thousands of pounds to the taxpayer in higher claims for interest payments as well as legal fees .
' nothing illegal ' the telegraph says that after the deal , approved by the commons fees office , mortgage interest payments - funded by expenses - increased by almost £ 200 a month .
however , the labour backbench mp has said there was " nothing illegal or improper " in the claims he had made .
referring to the london property , he said : " i do n't regard it as a home - -lsb- it -rsb- is what i have to have to do my work as a member of parliament .
and that 's why the costs fall on the taxpayer . "
other claims include : former labour whip fraser kemp is said to have apologised for repeat claims for items for his second home .
the mp for houghton and washington east is reported to have claimed for 16 bed sheets , two televisions and two dvd players for a one-bedroom flat .
mr kemp told the telegraph he would pay money back for his " error " .
new forest east mp julian lewis , who reportedly claimed more than £ 7,000 from the taxpayer for redecorating his second home and installing new kitchen appliances , has denied any wrongdoing .
the conservative mp said the westminster expenses system was " rotten " but insisted he had only used it to carry out essential maintenance and had not abused the system .
reports suggested tory shadow minister for police reform david ruffley had " flipped " his second home from london to his bury st edmunds constituency before claiming back thousands for furniture and fittings , including a £ 1,674 sofa .
mr ruffley said he had saved the taxpayer cash by designating his london property as his main home , while renting an unfurnished constituency property .
he had asked the fees office what an appropriate reimbursement would be and as a result paid for two-thirds of the cost of a £ 2,175 harrods tv and £ 6,765 in bedroom furniture himself .
amid signs of rising public anger about some mp expense and allowance claims , the prime minister wrote he was under " no illusions that repayment will not necessarily be sufficient sanction " .
mr brown 's comments came after a week in which former labour minister elliot morley and labour mp david chaytor were suspended from the parliamentary labour party after admitting claiming for a mortgages that had already been cleared .
expenses row casualties david chaytor - suspended from parliamentary labour party after reports he claimed £ 13,000 for a mortgage he had already paid off elliot morley - suspended from parliamentary labour party after admitting claiming £ 16,000 for a mortgage he had already paid off shahid malik - resigned as justice minister pending inquiry into his expenses andrew mackay - quit as parliamentary aide to david cameron over " unacceptable " expenses claim labour 's shahid malik also stood down from ministerial post pending an inquiry into his expenses while tory mp andrew mackay quit as parliamentary aide to david cameron over an expenses claim .
the bbc 's political correspondent carole walker said the prime minister had a number of disciplinary options at his disposal , including expelling individuals from the labour party or the government itself .
david cameron has already stated that conservative mps must repay any " excessive " expenses claims or face expulsion from from the party .
the metropolitan police service and crown prosecution service are due to meet next week to discuss whether a criminal investigation should be launched into some of the telegraph 's allegations about mps .
opinion polls published in sunday 's newspapers appeared to indicate the extent to which the expenses row has damaged labour in the run up to the euro and local elections , due to be held on 4 june .
a bpix poll of 2,300 people for the mail on sunday newspaper found just 17 % of voters polled planned to vote labour at the european elections next month - the same percentage which pledged to vote for the uk independence party .
another poll by comres for the independent on sunday suggested labour might get 21 % of the projected vote , compared with 40 % for the tories , 18 % for the lib dems and 21 % for " other parties " , such as green and ukip .
