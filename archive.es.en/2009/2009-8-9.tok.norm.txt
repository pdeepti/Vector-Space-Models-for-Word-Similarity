schalke striker kevin kuranyi scored in both halves to secure a 2-1 victory over newly-promoted nuremberg . playing without strikers miroslav klose and luca toni , as well as defender martin demichelis , the bavarians managed a tie at hoffenheim . it looked as though the hosts had scored in the 11th minute with a header from josip simunic , but referees judged it had been palmed out of the goal by keeper michael rensing . bayern took the lead against the run of play through ivica olic in the 25th minute before chinedu obasi evened the score with a low drive set up by vedad ibisevic . " the team forgot to play football in the first half , " said bayern manager louis van gaal .
" in the second , they were flat , but we did not use our chances . " magath wins again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : felix magath returned to his winning ways with his new club schalke striker kevin kuranyi scored in both halves to secure a 2-1 victory over newly-promoted nuremberg . the win marked a successful debut for coach felix magath , who led vfl wolfsburg to the championship last season . kuranyi , who has had his troubles over the past few years , struck in the 36th minute after a pass from jefferson farfan .
he added a second goal five minutes into the second half by firing in a cross from georgian levan kenia . slovak striker marek mintal managed to get one back two minutes before time but nuremberg had to settle for the loss . " i am glad to have won this match but i am not particularly happy , " magath said .
" our game was not good .
after the 1-0 and the 2-0 we should have controlled it much better . " frankfurt stun bremen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt wins a wild one werder bremen , hosting eintracht frankfurt , were stunned by a 3-2 loss . frankfurt striker yannis amanatidis hit twice only to see bremen fight back before the break .
but the visitors got an all-important third when czech striker martin fenin caught the bremen defense napping to tap in at close range at the 71st minute . cologne was defeated by borussia dortmund with a goal from marvin matip in the 75th minute .
elsewhere , hertha berlin managed a 1-0 win over hanover 96 . in mainz , an early header from tim hoogland put the home side ahead , and a penalty save by goalkeeper heinz mueller on a kick from tranquillo barnetta gave the hosts a bit of hope .
but leverkusen regrouped and barnetta fed eren derdiyok and stefan kiessling for a pair of goals late in the first half .
but it was mainz 's daniel gunkel who managed to salvage a draw with a late freekick . champions start with a win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's brazilian grafite netted for his club on friday night , reigning champions wolfsburg started their season with a 2-0 win against visitors stuttgart . new wolfsburg coach armin veh made just one change from the side preferred by his predecessor felix magath last season with karim ziani starting in the midfield behind edin dzeko and grafite . stuttgart coach markus babbel gave new signings alexander hleb and pavel pogrebnyak an immediate chance to see what they could do . the two sides showed plenty of energy in the first half and stuttgart had some opportunities with sami khedira seeing a shot saved on the line by wolfsburg goalkeeper diego benaglio and pogrebnyak also having a header saved , but by the half-time whistle , neither side had hit the back of the net . wolfsburg , however , was the better team throughout and the deadlock was broken in the 71st minute by zvjezdan misimovic with a curled left-footed shot from the edge of the box .
just 11 minutes later , the freshly-crowned german footballer of the year , grafite , managed to get the clincher by shrugging off a defender and slotting a shot past keeper jens lehmann . champions wolfsburg wolfsburg went undefeated at home last season with 16 wins and a draw en route to a surprise first national title ahead of bayern munich and stuttgart . grafite was last season 's bundesliga top scorer knotching up 28 goals to his credit . grafite summed up tonight 's opening victory thus : " it was a nice evening for the club and for myself .
another goal for me , i am happy ! " av / reuters / dpa editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 09.08.2009 russia and the great natural gas balancing act großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia hopes to be able to save on gas use at home so that they can send more of it abroad russia controls the world 's largest gas reserves , but a combination of factors , including power production , climate change and logistics , are keeping it from reaping the greatest benefits . russia is running out of natural gas - or at least it 's running out of easily accessible natural gas .
according to the oil and gas journal 's 2008 survey , russia holds the world 's largest natural gas reserves , with 1,680 trillion cubic feet -lrb- 47.5 trillion cubic meters -rrb- , which is nearly twice the reserves in the next largest country , iran .
most of the known reserves , roughly 80 percent , are located in western siberia and are concentrated in giant or super-giant gas fields .
since the early 1970s , the amount of new fields discovered has been on the decline and output from the country 's core super-giant fields has been steadily decreasing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , left , successfully convinced erdogan to agree to allow russia access to turkish territorial waters according to claudia kemfert , director of the energy , transportation and environment at the german institute for economic research , there are new fields that potentially could be tapped , but they pose specific problems .
massive reserves are said to exist to the northwest of russia 's northern border , but those fields lie under the barents sea , which is covered in ice for much of the year .
fields further to the east also exist , but there the problem becomes one of transport .
most of russia 's gas customers are in europe , on the other side of the continent .
the second dilemma is currently being taken care of by a set of pipelines that will supply europe with gas , known as south stream and nord stream .
south stream will run from the beregovaya compressor station at dzhubga on the russia 's black sea coast to bulgaria 's city of varna , and would eventually supply gas to eastern europe and italy and austria .
russian prime minister vladimir putin was in ankara on thursday to persuade his turkish counterpart , recep tayyip erdogan , to sign up to the agreement .
the main reason behind south stream is russia 's desire to bypass ukraine - which is the transit route for almost 80 percent of russian gas to europe - at all costs .
the only way to do that is to route the pipeline through turkish territorial waters .
the other pipeline , nord stream , is currently being laid between russia and germany across the baltic sea , entering swedish , finnish and danish territorial waters .
germany is russia 's biggest gas customer in the eu and its second-biggest overall , after ukraine , which has had a notoriously rocky relationship with moscow since becoming independent following the fall of the soviet union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nord stream pipeline will connect russia directly with germany , its biggest european customer up until now , russia has had no way of turning off the gas to ukraine without also depriving its european customers .
these two pipelines make the issue moot and will have the effect of completely isolating kiev , at least when it comes to gas and energy economics .
switching to coal russia has had a long and difficult relationship with its gas and oil supplies .
according to the united states department of energy statistics , a slight majority , or 55 percent , of russian power stations run on natural gas , which by law has to be supplied at a severely reduced rate .
during the 1990s , when post-soviet russia was struggling to get back on its feet , the country found itself with an excess of natural gas on their hands .
that excess was pawned off on other countries and , due to lengthy agreements , will continue to be so for the foreseeable future .
this puts russia in a tricky position .
by forcing national gas company gazprom to sell gas to power plants at a reduced rate , the government is actually missing out on millions of dollars in tax money .
gazprom is russia 's largest tax payer , contributing up to 25 percent of the total amount added to the coffers each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia gets 55 percent of its energy from natural gas , which is supplied to power plants at a reduced cost but russia also relies on natural gas for 55 percent of its energy needs .
the country is home to the world 's second-largest coal reserves , after the united states , but after restructuring over the last couple of years , 80 percent of coal production in the country comes from independent producers .
this makes russia the only place in the world where it 's cheaper to run power plants on gas than coal , so they are reluctant to turn to the black stuff .
any economist would tell you that the smart thing for russia to do would be to switch all the gas-fired power plants to coal , and then send all that unused gas to europe at regular market prices . however , coal-fired power plants emit enormous amounts of carbon dioxide into the environment , and as a signatory to the kytoto protocol , russia is obligated to reduce its carbon output .
so russia has started to go another way and has begun to lean a little on renewable energy like hydropower .
according to alexi kokorin , climate expert at the russian branch or the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , this is not a move to be more climate friendly , but only to look more climate friendly .
kokorin said that russian gas fields are being pushed further and further into the arctic , making it more difficult and more expensive to extract .
" russia does n't have the technology to extract the gas and it 's becoming more and more expensive to get enough gas to send to europe and china , therefore the government has decided that they have to save gas in the country , " he said .
upcoming climate treaty in a recently released g8 climate scorecard , russia was listed in seventh place , only beating out canada , which is quite significant since both countries are kyoto signatories .
this comes just five months ahead of a crucial meeting in copenhagen which is intended to hammer out a new climate agreement .
government officials begin another round of climate talks in bonn on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international feathers were ruffled two years ago when a russian submarine planted a flag on the sea floor of the north pole given its geographical location , the argument could be made that russia would be one of the very few countries that would benefit from global warming melting huge swaths of ice , providing better access to oil and gas reserves buried deep beneath arctic waters .
kokorin both agrees and disagrees with the assessment .
yes , he admitted , less ice would make extraction of gas and oil from the barents sea much easier .
however , melting permafrost would make it more difficult and expensive to extract current known reserves in siberia .
claudia kemfert says there are many voices within russia , especially scientists , saying that climate change is positive for russia and that they would benefit because the ice would decrease and then the access would be improved .
russia signed the kyoto protocol , said kemfert , because in the mid-90s it was still an emerging nation trying to get back on its feet after the fall of the soviet union .
the russians were treated much the same way as india and china are being treated in relation to the copenhagen agreement .
now that they 're among the world eight richest nations , they ca n't exactly claim that they need to be handled with kid gloves .
there is also the small matter of who actually owns the gas and oil reserves in the arctic .
with just over 24,000 kilometers -lrb- 15,000 miles -rrb- of arctic coastline , russia certainly has a claim .
but so do the united states , canada , norway , and denmark .
rough estimates put the amount of oil and gas in the arctic at 20 percent of the total global reserves on the planet .
with that kind of potential , said kemfert , it wo n't matter to russia if the ice is there or not .
" of course they 'll try and sell it to the rest of the world , even if the ice is there , " she said .
" it 's much more expensive to drill into the sea with the ice , but they 've already been doing it in parts of siberia . "

the other pipeline , nord stream , is currently being laid between russia and germany across the baltic sea , entering swedish , finnish and danish territorial waters .
germany is russia 's biggest gas customer in the eu and its second-biggest overall , after ukraine , which has had a notoriously rocky relationship with moscow since becoming independent following the fall of the soviet union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nord stream pipeline will connect russia directly with germany , its biggest european customer up until now , russia has had no way of turning off the gas to ukraine without also depriving its european customers .
these two pipelines make the issue moot and will have the effect of completely isolating kiev , at least when it comes to gas and energy economics .
switching to coal russia has had a long and difficult relationship with its gas and oil supplies .
according to the united states department of energy statistics , a slight majority , or 55 percent , of russian power stations run on natural gas , which by law has to be supplied at a severely reduced rate .
during the 1990s , when post-soviet russia was struggling to get back on its feet , the country found itself with an excess of natural gas on their hands .
that excess was pawned off on other countries and , due to lengthy agreements , will continue to be so for the foreseeable future .
this puts russia in a tricky position .
by forcing national gas company gazprom to sell gas to power plants at a reduced rate , the government is actually missing out on millions of dollars in tax money .
gazprom is russia 's largest tax payer , contributing up to 25 percent of the total amount added to the coffers each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia gets 55 percent of its energy from natural gas , which is supplied to power plants at a reduced cost but russia also relies on natural gas for 55 percent of its energy needs .
the country is home to the world 's second-largest coal reserves , after the united states , but after restructuring over the last couple of years , 80 percent of coal production in the country comes from independent producers .
this makes russia the only place in the world where it 's cheaper to run power plants on gas than coal , so they are reluctant to turn to the black stuff .
any economist would tell you that the smart thing for russia to do would be to switch all the gas-fired power plants to coal , and then send all that unused gas to europe at regular market prices . however , coal-fired power plants emit enormous amounts of carbon dioxide into the environment , and as a signatory to the kytoto protocol , russia is obligated to reduce its carbon output .
so russia has started to go another way and has begun to lean a little on renewable energy like hydropower .
according to alexi kokorin , climate expert at the russian branch or the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , this is not a move to be more climate friendly , but only to look more climate friendly .
kokorin said that russian gas fields are being pushed further and further into the arctic , making it more difficult and more expensive to extract .
" russia does n't have the technology to extract the gas and it 's becoming more and more expensive to get enough gas to send to europe and china , therefore the government has decided that they have to save gas in the country , " he said .
upcoming climate treaty in a recently released g8 climate scorecard , russia was listed in seventh place , only beating out canada , which is quite significant since both countries are kyoto signatories .
this comes just five months ahead of a crucial meeting in copenhagen which is intended to hammer out a new climate agreement .
government officials begin another round of climate talks in bonn on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international feathers were ruffled two years ago when a russian submarine planted a flag on the sea floor of the north pole given its geographical location , the argument could be made that russia would be one of the very few countries that would benefit from global warming melting huge swaths of ice , providing better access to oil and gas reserves buried deep beneath arctic waters .
kokorin both agrees and disagrees with the assessment .
yes , he admitted , less ice would make extraction of gas and oil from the barents sea much easier .
however , melting permafrost would make it more difficult and expensive to extract current known reserves in siberia .
claudia kemfert says there are many voices within russia , especially scientists , saying that climate change is positive for russia and that they would benefit because the ice would decrease and then the access would be improved .
russia signed the kyoto protocol , said kemfert , because in the mid-90s it was still an emerging nation trying to get back on its feet after the fall of the soviet union .
the russians were treated much the same way as india and china are being treated in relation to the copenhagen agreement .
now that they 're among the world eight richest nations , they ca n't exactly claim that they need to be handled with kid gloves .
there is also the small matter of who actually owns the gas and oil reserves in the arctic .
with just over 24,000 kilometers -lrb- 15,000 miles -rrb- of arctic coastline , russia certainly has a claim .
but so do the united states , canada , norway , and denmark .
rough estimates put the amount of oil and gas in the arctic at 20 percent of the total global reserves on the planet .
with that kind of potential , said kemfert , it wo n't matter to russia if the ice is there or not .
" of course they 'll try and sell it to the rest of the world , even if the ice is there , " she said .
" it 's much more expensive to drill into the sea with the ice , but they 've already been doing it in parts of siberia . "

according to the oil and gas journal 's 2008 survey , russia holds the world 's largest natural gas reserves , with 1,680 trillion cubic feet -lrb- 47.5 trillion cubic meters -rrb- , which is nearly twice the reserves in the next largest country , iran .
most of the known reserves , roughly 80 percent , are located in western siberia and are concentrated in giant or super-giant gas fields .
since the early 1970s , the amount of new fields discovered has been on the decline and output from the country 's core super-giant fields has been steadily decreasing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , left , successfully convinced erdogan to agree to allow russia access to turkish territorial waters according to claudia kemfert , director of the energy , transportation and environment at the german institute for economic research , there are new fields that potentially could be tapped , but they pose specific problems .
massive reserves are said to exist to the northwest of russia 's northern border , but those fields lie under the barents sea , which is covered in ice for much of the year .
fields further to the east also exist , but there the problem becomes one of transport .
most of russia 's gas customers are in europe , on the other side of the continent .
the second dilemma is currently being taken care of by a set of pipelines that will supply europe with gas , known as south stream and nord stream .
south stream will run from the beregovaya compressor station at dzhubga on the russia 's black sea coast to bulgaria 's city of varna , and would eventually supply gas to eastern europe and italy and austria .
russian prime minister vladimir putin was in ankara on thursday to persuade his turkish counterpart , recep tayyip erdogan , to sign up to the agreement .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nord stream pipeline will connect russia directly with germany , its biggest european customer up until now , russia has had no way of turning off the gas to ukraine without also depriving its european customers .
these two pipelines make the issue moot and will have the effect of completely isolating kiev , at least when it comes to gas and energy economics .
switching to coal russia has had a long and difficult relationship with its gas and oil supplies .
according to the united states department of energy statistics , a slight majority , or 55 percent , of russian power stations run on natural gas , which by law has to be supplied at a severely reduced rate .
during the 1990s , when post-soviet russia was struggling to get back on its feet , the country found itself with an excess of natural gas on their hands .
that excess was pawned off on other countries and , due to lengthy agreements , will continue to be so for the foreseeable future .
this puts russia in a tricky position .
by forcing national gas company gazprom to sell gas to power plants at a reduced rate , the government is actually missing out on millions of dollars in tax money .
gazprom is russia 's largest tax payer , contributing up to 25 percent of the total amount added to the coffers each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia gets 55 percent of its energy from natural gas , which is supplied to power plants at a reduced cost but russia also relies on natural gas for 55 percent of its energy needs .
the country is home to the world 's second-largest coal reserves , after the united states , but after restructuring over the last couple of years , 80 percent of coal production in the country comes from independent producers .
this makes russia the only place in the world where it 's cheaper to run power plants on gas than coal , so they are reluctant to turn to the black stuff .
any economist would tell you that the smart thing for russia to do would be to switch all the gas-fired power plants to coal , and then send all that unused gas to europe at regular market prices . however , coal-fired power plants emit enormous amounts of carbon dioxide into the environment , and as a signatory to the kytoto protocol , russia is obligated to reduce its carbon output .
so russia has started to go another way and has begun to lean a little on renewable energy like hydropower .
according to alexi kokorin , climate expert at the russian branch or the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , this is not a move to be more climate friendly , but only to look more climate friendly .
kokorin said that russian gas fields are being pushed further and further into the arctic , making it more difficult and more expensive to extract .
" russia does n't have the technology to extract the gas and it 's becoming more and more expensive to get enough gas to send to europe and china , therefore the government has decided that they have to save gas in the country , " he said .
upcoming climate treaty in a recently released g8 climate scorecard , russia was listed in seventh place , only beating out canada , which is quite significant since both countries are kyoto signatories .
this comes just five months ahead of a crucial meeting in copenhagen which is intended to hammer out a new climate agreement .
government officials begin another round of climate talks in bonn on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international feathers were ruffled two years ago when a russian submarine planted a flag on the sea floor of the north pole given its geographical location , the argument could be made that russia would be one of the very few countries that would benefit from global warming melting huge swaths of ice , providing better access to oil and gas reserves buried deep beneath arctic waters .
kokorin both agrees and disagrees with the assessment .
yes , he admitted , less ice would make extraction of gas and oil from the barents sea much easier .
however , melting permafrost would make it more difficult and expensive to extract current known reserves in siberia .
claudia kemfert says there are many voices within russia , especially scientists , saying that climate change is positive for russia and that they would benefit because the ice would decrease and then the access would be improved .
russia signed the kyoto protocol , said kemfert , because in the mid-90s it was still an emerging nation trying to get back on its feet after the fall of the soviet union .
the russians were treated much the same way as india and china are being treated in relation to the copenhagen agreement .
now that they 're among the world eight richest nations , they ca n't exactly claim that they need to be handled with kid gloves .
there is also the small matter of who actually owns the gas and oil reserves in the arctic .
with just over 24,000 kilometers -lrb- 15,000 miles -rrb- of arctic coastline , russia certainly has a claim .
but so do the united states , canada , norway , and denmark .
rough estimates put the amount of oil and gas in the arctic at 20 percent of the total global reserves on the planet .
with that kind of potential , said kemfert , it wo n't matter to russia if the ice is there or not .
" of course they 'll try and sell it to the rest of the world , even if the ice is there , " she said .
" it 's much more expensive to drill into the sea with the ice , but they 've already been doing it in parts of siberia . "

under existing law , german police are responsible for hostage situations . jung said in an interview with german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag that under existing law , police were responsible for hostage situations , but that it was not always possible for the police force to arrive quickly enough at a crime scene . the minister cited the recent episode involving german container ship the hansa stavanger , which was hijacked with 24 crew on board , including five germans , off the coast of somalia four months ago . he said that in the time it took a german police team to deploy to the horn of africa the situation had worsened .

germans go to the polls to elect a new parliament in september . jung said the amendment should not only apply to international operations but also to certain domestic cases in which the german armed forces were better suited to handle a situation . the hansa stavanger was eventually released four months after being captured when the hamburg-based shipping company that owns the ship paid a 1.9-million-euro ransom . dfm / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 09.08.2009 russia plays better hand in pipeline poker großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia and turkey have agreed on the construction of a gas pipeline under the black sea soon after the eu signed a deal with ankara on the nabucco pipeline .
the russian project is ahead at the moment . russia and europe are heading for a grim race in the construction of a gas pipeline under the black sea .
or so it would appear after the signing of a contract between russian prime minister vladimir putin and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
there 's a need for both the russian south stream as well as the european nabucco pipeline , because gas consumption in europe will increase in the next decade .
however , the russian project is ahead at the moment , if you consider it from a political and business point of view .
the russians will be the first to begin construction and they can probably more easily afford the estimated 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- costs with their state-run gazprom .
a private consortium is to build the eu pipeline for around 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- .
the nabucco project has to be run as a business whereas gazprom can afford massive losses .
eu members disagree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia and turkey signed the south stream pipeline deal on august 6 european states such as greece , italy , bulgaria and austria as well as turkey are partners in both pipeline projects .
this indicates two things : it 's everyone for himself when it comes to energy security .
a uniform european approach is not expected and is also not desired , for energy provision falls in the jurisdiction of the member states .
a consistent energy policy in the european union is worlds away compared to the largest producer , russia , because the 27 member states can not agree on what they really want .
after their experiences as part of the former east bloc , the baltic states and poland , the czech republic and slovakia want to avoid any dependence on russia .
the largest group in the eu , including germany and france , are compliant customers who know that they will be dependent on the russian gas stopcock for a long time to come .
in principle , it is only right that the north stream in the baltic and south stream and nabucco in the south should provide alternatives to the present supply lines through ukraine and belarus .
above all , the loser will at first be ukraine which will be deprived of its status as an important transit country to turkey .
the caucasus question the caucasus plays a key role in the great gas debate .
important gas and oil pipelines , built with the help of the us , run through georgia which is in a long-term dispute with russia .
neither south stream nor nabucco can operate properly without a stable georgia , azerbaijan and armenia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nabucco has to be run as a business whereas gazprom can afford massive losses and even more important than the question of the pipeline routes is the question of the gas supplier .
who should supply the gas for the pipelines ?
russia and the eu are endeavoring to persuade the central asian states , especially turkmenistan , iraq and iran to be the suppliers .
that 's where the actual competition is .
russia does not produce enough from its own oil fields to be able to fulfill the contracts and thus needs new sources .
the eu is also endeavoring to strengthen deliveries from the mediterranean area and norway but here too new methods of conveyance are needed .
in order to guarantee the supply of energy , the eu has to do some homework on its own territory .
europe desperately needs north-south and east-west pipelines in order to be able to smooth out production shortfalls among its member states .
france advocates that the russians should not only be viewed as competitors that one simply has to keep out of the european market .
rather , the eu , russia and turkey should run all the pipelines together .
the happy winner at the moment , thanks to its geographical position , is turkey .
it will become the most important land of transit and is connected via the third pipeline , blue stream , directly with russia .
turkey could not do anything else than sign the contracts with putin , after all , russia supplies two thirds of the gas for the turkish market and thus possesses a virtual supply monopoly .

a uniform european approach is not expected and is also not desired , for energy provision falls in the jurisdiction of the member states .
a consistent energy policy in the european union is worlds away compared to the largest producer , russia , because the 27 member states can not agree on what they really want .
after their experiences as part of the former east bloc , the baltic states and poland , the czech republic and slovakia want to avoid any dependence on russia .
the largest group in the eu , including germany and france , are compliant customers who know that they will be dependent on the russian gas stopcock for a long time to come .
in principle , it is only right that the north stream in the baltic and south stream and nabucco in the south should provide alternatives to the present supply lines through ukraine and belarus .
above all , the loser will at first be ukraine which will be deprived of its status as an important transit country to turkey .
the caucasus question the caucasus plays a key role in the great gas debate .
important gas and oil pipelines , built with the help of the us , run through georgia which is in a long-term dispute with russia .
neither south stream nor nabucco can operate properly without a stable georgia , azerbaijan and armenia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nabucco has to be run as a business whereas gazprom can afford massive losses and even more important than the question of the pipeline routes is the question of the gas supplier .
who should supply the gas for the pipelines ?
russia and the eu are endeavoring to persuade the central asian states , especially turkmenistan , iraq and iran to be the suppliers .
that 's where the actual competition is .
russia does not produce enough from its own oil fields to be able to fulfill the contracts and thus needs new sources .
the eu is also endeavoring to strengthen deliveries from the mediterranean area and norway but here too new methods of conveyance are needed .
in order to guarantee the supply of energy , the eu has to do some homework on its own territory .
europe desperately needs north-south and east-west pipelines in order to be able to smooth out production shortfalls among its member states .
france advocates that the russians should not only be viewed as competitors that one simply has to keep out of the european market .
rather , the eu , russia and turkey should run all the pipelines together .
the happy winner at the moment , thanks to its geographical position , is turkey .
it will become the most important land of transit and is connected via the third pipeline , blue stream , directly with russia .
turkey could not do anything else than sign the contracts with putin , after all , russia supplies two thirds of the gas for the turkish market and thus possesses a virtual supply monopoly .

the russian project is ahead at the moment . russia and europe are heading for a grim race in the construction of a gas pipeline under the black sea .
or so it would appear after the signing of a contract between russian prime minister vladimir putin and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
there 's a need for both the russian south stream as well as the european nabucco pipeline , because gas consumption in europe will increase in the next decade .
however , the russian project is ahead at the moment , if you consider it from a political and business point of view .
the russians will be the first to begin construction and they can probably more easily afford the estimated 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- costs with their state-run gazprom .
a private consortium is to build the eu pipeline for around 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- .
the nabucco project has to be run as a business whereas gazprom can afford massive losses .

schalke striker kevin kuranyi scored in both halves to secure a 2-1 victory over newly-promoted nuremberg . playing without strikers miroslav klose and luca toni , as well as defender martin demichelis , the bavarians managed a tie at hoffenheim . it looked as though the hosts had scored in the 11th minute with a header from josip simunic , but referees judged it had been palmed out of the goal by keeper michael rensing . bayern took the lead against the run of play through ivica olic in the 25th minute before chinedu obasi evened the score with a low drive set up by vedad ibisevic . " the team forgot to play football in the first half , " said bayern manager louis van gaal .
" in the second , they were flat , but we did not use our chances . " magath wins again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : felix magath returned to his winning ways with his new club schalke striker kevin kuranyi scored in both halves to secure a 2-1 victory over newly-promoted nuremberg . the win marked a successful debut for coach felix magath , who led vfl wolfsburg to the championship last season . kuranyi , who has had his troubles over the past few years , struck in the 36th minute after a pass from jefferson farfan .
he added a second goal five minutes into the second half by firing in a cross from georgian levan kenia . slovak striker marek mintal managed to get one back two minutes before time but nuremberg had to settle for the loss . " i am glad to have won this match but i am not particularly happy , " magath said .
" our game was not good .

" frankfurt stun bremen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt wins a wild one werder bremen , hosting eintracht frankfurt , were stunned by a 3-2 loss . frankfurt striker yannis amanatidis hit twice only to see bremen fight back before the break .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 09.08.2009 russia and the great natural gas balancing act großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia hopes to be able to save on gas use at home so that they can send more of it abroad russia controls the world 's largest gas reserves , but a combination of factors , including power production , climate change and logistics , are keeping it from reaping the greatest benefits . russia is running out of natural gas - or at least it 's running out of easily accessible natural gas .
according to the oil and gas journal 's 2008 survey , russia holds the world 's largest natural gas reserves , with 1,680 trillion cubic feet -lrb- 47.5 trillion cubic meters -rrb- , which is nearly twice the reserves in the next largest country , iran .
most of the known reserves , roughly 80 percent , are located in western siberia and are concentrated in giant or super-giant gas fields .
since the early 1970s , the amount of new fields discovered has been on the decline and output from the country 's core super-giant fields has been steadily decreasing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , left , successfully convinced erdogan to agree to allow russia access to turkish territorial waters according to claudia kemfert , director of the energy , transportation and environment at the german institute for economic research , there are new fields that potentially could be tapped , but they pose specific problems .
massive reserves are said to exist to the northwest of russia 's northern border , but those fields lie under the barents sea , which is covered in ice for much of the year .
fields further to the east also exist , but there the problem becomes one of transport .
most of russia 's gas customers are in europe , on the other side of the continent .
the second dilemma is currently being taken care of by a set of pipelines that will supply europe with gas , known as south stream and nord stream .
south stream will run from the beregovaya compressor station at dzhubga on the russia 's black sea coast to bulgaria 's city of varna , and would eventually supply gas to eastern europe and italy and austria .
russian prime minister vladimir putin was in ankara on thursday to persuade his turkish counterpart , recep tayyip erdogan , to sign up to the agreement .
the main reason behind south stream is russia 's desire to bypass ukraine - which is the transit route for almost 80 percent of russian gas to europe - at all costs .
the only way to do that is to route the pipeline through turkish territorial waters .
the other pipeline , nord stream , is currently being laid between russia and germany across the baltic sea , entering swedish , finnish and danish territorial waters .
germany is russia 's biggest gas customer in the eu and its second-biggest overall , after ukraine , which has had a notoriously rocky relationship with moscow since becoming independent following the fall of the soviet union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nord stream pipeline will connect russia directly with germany , its biggest european customer up until now , russia has had no way of turning off the gas to ukraine without also depriving its european customers .
these two pipelines make the issue moot and will have the effect of completely isolating kiev , at least when it comes to gas and energy economics .
switching to coal russia has had a long and difficult relationship with its gas and oil supplies .
according to the united states department of energy statistics , a slight majority , or 55 percent , of russian power stations run on natural gas , which by law has to be supplied at a severely reduced rate .
during the 1990s , when post-soviet russia was struggling to get back on its feet , the country found itself with an excess of natural gas on their hands .
that excess was pawned off on other countries and , due to lengthy agreements , will continue to be so for the foreseeable future .
this puts russia in a tricky position .
by forcing national gas company gazprom to sell gas to power plants at a reduced rate , the government is actually missing out on millions of dollars in tax money .
gazprom is russia 's largest tax payer , contributing up to 25 percent of the total amount added to the coffers each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia gets 55 percent of its energy from natural gas , which is supplied to power plants at a reduced cost but russia also relies on natural gas for 55 percent of its energy needs .
the country is home to the world 's second-largest coal reserves , after the united states , but after restructuring over the last couple of years , 80 percent of coal production in the country comes from independent producers .
this makes russia the only place in the world where it 's cheaper to run power plants on gas than coal , so they are reluctant to turn to the black stuff .
any economist would tell you that the smart thing for russia to do would be to switch all the gas-fired power plants to coal , and then send all that unused gas to europe at regular market prices . however , coal-fired power plants emit enormous amounts of carbon dioxide into the environment , and as a signatory to the kytoto protocol , russia is obligated to reduce its carbon output .
so russia has started to go another way and has begun to lean a little on renewable energy like hydropower .
according to alexi kokorin , climate expert at the russian branch or the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , this is not a move to be more climate friendly , but only to look more climate friendly .
kokorin said that russian gas fields are being pushed further and further into the arctic , making it more difficult and more expensive to extract .
" russia does n't have the technology to extract the gas and it 's becoming more and more expensive to get enough gas to send to europe and china , therefore the government has decided that they have to save gas in the country , " he said .
upcoming climate treaty in a recently released g8 climate scorecard , russia was listed in seventh place , only beating out canada , which is quite significant since both countries are kyoto signatories .
this comes just five months ahead of a crucial meeting in copenhagen which is intended to hammer out a new climate agreement .
government officials begin another round of climate talks in bonn on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international feathers were ruffled two years ago when a russian submarine planted a flag on the sea floor of the north pole given its geographical location , the argument could be made that russia would be one of the very few countries that would benefit from global warming melting huge swaths of ice , providing better access to oil and gas reserves buried deep beneath arctic waters .
kokorin both agrees and disagrees with the assessment .
yes , he admitted , less ice would make extraction of gas and oil from the barents sea much easier .
however , melting permafrost would make it more difficult and expensive to extract current known reserves in siberia .
claudia kemfert says there are many voices within russia , especially scientists , saying that climate change is positive for russia and that they would benefit because the ice would decrease and then the access would be improved .
russia signed the kyoto protocol , said kemfert , because in the mid-90s it was still an emerging nation trying to get back on its feet after the fall of the soviet union .
the russians were treated much the same way as india and china are being treated in relation to the copenhagen agreement .
now that they 're among the world eight richest nations , they ca n't exactly claim that they need to be handled with kid gloves .
there is also the small matter of who actually owns the gas and oil reserves in the arctic .
with just over 24,000 kilometers -lrb- 15,000 miles -rrb- of arctic coastline , russia certainly has a claim .
but so do the united states , canada , norway , and denmark .
rough estimates put the amount of oil and gas in the arctic at 20 percent of the total global reserves on the planet .
with that kind of potential , said kemfert , it wo n't matter to russia if the ice is there or not .
" of course they 'll try and sell it to the rest of the world , even if the ice is there , " she said .
" it 's much more expensive to drill into the sea with the ice , but they 've already been doing it in parts of siberia . "

according to the oil and gas journal 's 2008 survey , russia holds the world 's largest natural gas reserves , with 1,680 trillion cubic feet -lrb- 47.5 trillion cubic meters -rrb- , which is nearly twice the reserves in the next largest country , iran .
most of the known reserves , roughly 80 percent , are located in western siberia and are concentrated in giant or super-giant gas fields .
since the early 1970s , the amount of new fields discovered has been on the decline and output from the country 's core super-giant fields has been steadily decreasing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , left , successfully convinced erdogan to agree to allow russia access to turkish territorial waters according to claudia kemfert , director of the energy , transportation and environment at the german institute for economic research , there are new fields that potentially could be tapped , but they pose specific problems .
massive reserves are said to exist to the northwest of russia 's northern border , but those fields lie under the barents sea , which is covered in ice for much of the year .
fields further to the east also exist , but there the problem becomes one of transport .
most of russia 's gas customers are in europe , on the other side of the continent .
the second dilemma is currently being taken care of by a set of pipelines that will supply europe with gas , known as south stream and nord stream .
south stream will run from the beregovaya compressor station at dzhubga on the russia 's black sea coast to bulgaria 's city of varna , and would eventually supply gas to eastern europe and italy and austria .
russian prime minister vladimir putin was in ankara on thursday to persuade his turkish counterpart , recep tayyip erdogan , to sign up to the agreement .
the main reason behind south stream is russia 's desire to bypass ukraine - which is the transit route for almost 80 percent of russian gas to europe - at all costs .
the only way to do that is to route the pipeline through turkish territorial waters .
the other pipeline , nord stream , is currently being laid between russia and germany across the baltic sea , entering swedish , finnish and danish territorial waters .
germany is russia 's biggest gas customer in the eu and its second-biggest overall , after ukraine , which has had a notoriously rocky relationship with moscow since becoming independent following the fall of the soviet union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nord stream pipeline will connect russia directly with germany , its biggest european customer up until now , russia has had no way of turning off the gas to ukraine without also depriving its european customers .
these two pipelines make the issue moot and will have the effect of completely isolating kiev , at least when it comes to gas and energy economics .
switching to coal russia has had a long and difficult relationship with its gas and oil supplies .
according to the united states department of energy statistics , a slight majority , or 55 percent , of russian power stations run on natural gas , which by law has to be supplied at a severely reduced rate .
during the 1990s , when post-soviet russia was struggling to get back on its feet , the country found itself with an excess of natural gas on their hands .
that excess was pawned off on other countries and , due to lengthy agreements , will continue to be so for the foreseeable future .
this puts russia in a tricky position .
by forcing national gas company gazprom to sell gas to power plants at a reduced rate , the government is actually missing out on millions of dollars in tax money .
gazprom is russia 's largest tax payer , contributing up to 25 percent of the total amount added to the coffers each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia gets 55 percent of its energy from natural gas , which is supplied to power plants at a reduced cost but russia also relies on natural gas for 55 percent of its energy needs .
the country is home to the world 's second-largest coal reserves , after the united states , but after restructuring over the last couple of years , 80 percent of coal production in the country comes from independent producers .
this makes russia the only place in the world where it 's cheaper to run power plants on gas than coal , so they are reluctant to turn to the black stuff .
any economist would tell you that the smart thing for russia to do would be to switch all the gas-fired power plants to coal , and then send all that unused gas to europe at regular market prices . however , coal-fired power plants emit enormous amounts of carbon dioxide into the environment , and as a signatory to the kytoto protocol , russia is obligated to reduce its carbon output .
so russia has started to go another way and has begun to lean a little on renewable energy like hydropower .
according to alexi kokorin , climate expert at the russian branch or the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , this is not a move to be more climate friendly , but only to look more climate friendly .
kokorin said that russian gas fields are being pushed further and further into the arctic , making it more difficult and more expensive to extract .
" russia does n't have the technology to extract the gas and it 's becoming more and more expensive to get enough gas to send to europe and china , therefore the government has decided that they have to save gas in the country , " he said .
upcoming climate treaty in a recently released g8 climate scorecard , russia was listed in seventh place , only beating out canada , which is quite significant since both countries are kyoto signatories .
this comes just five months ahead of a crucial meeting in copenhagen which is intended to hammer out a new climate agreement .
government officials begin another round of climate talks in bonn on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international feathers were ruffled two years ago when a russian submarine planted a flag on the sea floor of the north pole given its geographical location , the argument could be made that russia would be one of the very few countries that would benefit from global warming melting huge swaths of ice , providing better access to oil and gas reserves buried deep beneath arctic waters .
kokorin both agrees and disagrees with the assessment .
yes , he admitted , less ice would make extraction of gas and oil from the barents sea much easier .
however , melting permafrost would make it more difficult and expensive to extract current known reserves in siberia .
claudia kemfert says there are many voices within russia , especially scientists , saying that climate change is positive for russia and that they would benefit because the ice would decrease and then the access would be improved .
russia signed the kyoto protocol , said kemfert , because in the mid-90s it was still an emerging nation trying to get back on its feet after the fall of the soviet union .
the russians were treated much the same way as india and china are being treated in relation to the copenhagen agreement .
now that they 're among the world eight richest nations , they ca n't exactly claim that they need to be handled with kid gloves .
there is also the small matter of who actually owns the gas and oil reserves in the arctic .
with just over 24,000 kilometers -lrb- 15,000 miles -rrb- of arctic coastline , russia certainly has a claim .
but so do the united states , canada , norway , and denmark .
rough estimates put the amount of oil and gas in the arctic at 20 percent of the total global reserves on the planet .
with that kind of potential , said kemfert , it wo n't matter to russia if the ice is there or not .
" of course they 'll try and sell it to the rest of the world , even if the ice is there , " she said .
" it 's much more expensive to drill into the sea with the ice , but they 've already been doing it in parts of siberia . "

the russian project is ahead at the moment . russia and europe are heading for a grim race in the construction of a gas pipeline under the black sea .
or so it would appear after the signing of a contract between russian prime minister vladimir putin and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
there 's a need for both the russian south stream as well as the european nabucco pipeline , because gas consumption in europe will increase in the next decade .
however , the russian project is ahead at the moment , if you consider it from a political and business point of view .
the russians will be the first to begin construction and they can probably more easily afford the estimated 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- costs with their state-run gazprom .
a private consortium is to build the eu pipeline for around 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- .
the nabucco project has to be run as a business whereas gazprom can afford massive losses .
eu members disagree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia and turkey signed the south stream pipeline deal on august 6 european states such as greece , italy , bulgaria and austria as well as turkey are partners in both pipeline projects .
this indicates two things : it 's everyone for himself when it comes to energy security .
a uniform european approach is not expected and is also not desired , for energy provision falls in the jurisdiction of the member states .
a consistent energy policy in the european union is worlds away compared to the largest producer , russia , because the 27 member states can not agree on what they really want .
after their experiences as part of the former east bloc , the baltic states and poland , the czech republic and slovakia want to avoid any dependence on russia .
the largest group in the eu , including germany and france , are compliant customers who know that they will be dependent on the russian gas stopcock for a long time to come .
in principle , it is only right that the north stream in the baltic and south stream and nabucco in the south should provide alternatives to the present supply lines through ukraine and belarus .
above all , the loser will at first be ukraine which will be deprived of its status as an important transit country to turkey .
the caucasus question the caucasus plays a key role in the great gas debate .
important gas and oil pipelines , built with the help of the us , run through georgia which is in a long-term dispute with russia .
neither south stream nor nabucco can operate properly without a stable georgia , azerbaijan and armenia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nabucco has to be run as a business whereas gazprom can afford massive losses and even more important than the question of the pipeline routes is the question of the gas supplier .
who should supply the gas for the pipelines ?
russia and the eu are endeavoring to persuade the central asian states , especially turkmenistan , iraq and iran to be the suppliers .
that 's where the actual competition is .
russia does not produce enough from its own oil fields to be able to fulfill the contracts and thus needs new sources .
the eu is also endeavoring to strengthen deliveries from the mediterranean area and norway but here too new methods of conveyance are needed .
in order to guarantee the supply of energy , the eu has to do some homework on its own territory .
europe desperately needs north-south and east-west pipelines in order to be able to smooth out production shortfalls among its member states .
france advocates that the russians should not only be viewed as competitors that one simply has to keep out of the european market .
rather , the eu , russia and turkey should run all the pipelines together .
the happy winner at the moment , thanks to its geographical position , is turkey .
it will become the most important land of transit and is connected via the third pipeline , blue stream , directly with russia .
turkey could not do anything else than sign the contracts with putin , after all , russia supplies two thirds of the gas for the turkish market and thus possesses a virtual supply monopoly .

moldova 's communist party had held a majority in the national legislature for more than a decade , but was soundly defeated by the pro-europe opposition in the july poll .
infotag is reporting that the new coalition will be called " for european integration " -lrb- fei -rrb- , and that leaders of the alliance have named fighting corruption , better relations with the eu , a free and open media , and pulling moldova 's economy out of a deep recession as top priorities .
discussions on cabinet post division between the two liberal parties and the smaller democratic party of moldova , and our moldova party , were still in progress , according to a fei statement .
a top order of business will be election of a new president , requiring a 61-vote majority in the legislature by constitutional stature ; forcing the fei parties to seek at least 8 communist mps to support a fei candidate for the presidency .
current moldovan president vladimir voronin , who is also head of moldova 's communist party , said in a statement last week the communists " were willing to talk " with the fei alliance on a jointly- acceptable presidential candidate .
rioting in the streets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : original parliamentary elections back in april sparked mass protest unwillingness by fei parties to accept a communist candidate for president in the wake of april elections produced a hung parliament , forcing new elections in july .
the april elections also sparked mass protests against results giving the communists a strong win , and near total control of parliament .
street battles between anti-communist demonstrators and police in the moldovan capital chisinau left one dead , hundreds injured , and the parliament and presidential residence badly damaged by fire .
eu officials shortly after the repeat vote in late july called on the pro- and anti-communist wings of moldova 's political arena to lay aside their differences , and form a new ruling coalition .
" the immediate priority is to put in place a government , and i urge all the political parties to engage in open and constructive dialogue , " eu foreign affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said last week .
moldova may not hold any more parliamentary elections in 2009 , but the nation 's supreme court ruled in july that if the legislature fails to elect a president by january 2010 another nation-wide vote to select mps - the third in ten months - would be possible. mrm / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

under existing law , german police are responsible for hostage situations . jung said in an interview with german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag that under existing law , police were responsible for hostage situations , but that it was not always possible for the police force to arrive quickly enough at a crime scene . the minister cited the recent episode involving german container ship the hansa stavanger , which was hijacked with 24 crew on board , including five germans , off the coast of somalia four months ago . he said that in the time it took a german police team to deploy to the horn of africa the situation had worsened .
only five pirates had boarded the ship initially , but their numbers eventually swelled to around 35 , he noted . " we should consider a constitutional amendment to allow the armed forces access to situations when the police can not act , such as when the police are not at the scene of an incident , " jung told the newspaper . " i want to put this on the agenda again at the latest when the parliamentary elections are over , " he added .
germans go to the polls to elect a new parliament in september . jung said the amendment should not only apply to international operations but also to certain domestic cases in which the german armed forces were better suited to handle a situation . the hansa stavanger was eventually released four months after being captured when the hamburg-based shipping company that owns the ship paid a 1.9-million-euro ransom . dfm / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 09.08.2009 russia plays better hand in pipeline poker großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia and turkey have agreed on the construction of a gas pipeline under the black sea soon after the eu signed a deal with ankara on the nabucco pipeline .
the russian project is ahead at the moment . russia and europe are heading for a grim race in the construction of a gas pipeline under the black sea .
or so it would appear after the signing of a contract between russian prime minister vladimir putin and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
there 's a need for both the russian south stream as well as the european nabucco pipeline , because gas consumption in europe will increase in the next decade .
however , the russian project is ahead at the moment , if you consider it from a political and business point of view .
the russians will be the first to begin construction and they can probably more easily afford the estimated 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- costs with their state-run gazprom .
a private consortium is to build the eu pipeline for around 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- .
the nabucco project has to be run as a business whereas gazprom can afford massive losses .
eu members disagree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia and turkey signed the south stream pipeline deal on august 6 european states such as greece , italy , bulgaria and austria as well as turkey are partners in both pipeline projects .
this indicates two things : it 's everyone for himself when it comes to energy security .
a uniform european approach is not expected and is also not desired , for energy provision falls in the jurisdiction of the member states .
a consistent energy policy in the european union is worlds away compared to the largest producer , russia , because the 27 member states can not agree on what they really want .
after their experiences as part of the former east bloc , the baltic states and poland , the czech republic and slovakia want to avoid any dependence on russia .
the largest group in the eu , including germany and france , are compliant customers who know that they will be dependent on the russian gas stopcock for a long time to come .
in principle , it is only right that the north stream in the baltic and south stream and nabucco in the south should provide alternatives to the present supply lines through ukraine and belarus .
above all , the loser will at first be ukraine which will be deprived of its status as an important transit country to turkey .
the caucasus question the caucasus plays a key role in the great gas debate .
important gas and oil pipelines , built with the help of the us , run through georgia which is in a long-term dispute with russia .
neither south stream nor nabucco can operate properly without a stable georgia , azerbaijan and armenia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nabucco has to be run as a business whereas gazprom can afford massive losses and even more important than the question of the pipeline routes is the question of the gas supplier .
who should supply the gas for the pipelines ?
russia and the eu are endeavoring to persuade the central asian states , especially turkmenistan , iraq and iran to be the suppliers .
that 's where the actual competition is .
russia does not produce enough from its own oil fields to be able to fulfill the contracts and thus needs new sources .
the eu is also endeavoring to strengthen deliveries from the mediterranean area and norway but here too new methods of conveyance are needed .
in order to guarantee the supply of energy , the eu has to do some homework on its own territory .
europe desperately needs north-south and east-west pipelines in order to be able to smooth out production shortfalls among its member states .
france advocates that the russians should not only be viewed as competitors that one simply has to keep out of the european market .
rather , the eu , russia and turkey should run all the pipelines together .
the happy winner at the moment , thanks to its geographical position , is turkey .
it will become the most important land of transit and is connected via the third pipeline , blue stream , directly with russia .
turkey could not do anything else than sign the contracts with putin , after all , russia supplies two thirds of the gas for the turkish market and thus possesses a virtual supply monopoly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 09.08.2009 russia and the great natural gas balancing act großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia hopes to be able to save on gas use at home so that they can send more of it abroad russia controls the world 's largest gas reserves , but a combination of factors , including power production , climate change and logistics , are keeping it from reaping the greatest benefits . russia is running out of natural gas - or at least it 's running out of easily accessible natural gas .
according to the oil and gas journal 's 2008 survey , russia holds the world 's largest natural gas reserves , with 1,680 trillion cubic feet -lrb- 47.5 trillion cubic meters -rrb- , which is nearly twice the reserves in the next largest country , iran .
most of the known reserves , roughly 80 percent , are located in western siberia and are concentrated in giant or super-giant gas fields .
since the early 1970s , the amount of new fields discovered has been on the decline and output from the country 's core super-giant fields has been steadily decreasing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , left , successfully convinced erdogan to agree to allow russia access to turkish territorial waters according to claudia kemfert , director of the energy , transportation and environment at the german institute for economic research , there are new fields that potentially could be tapped , but they pose specific problems .
massive reserves are said to exist to the northwest of russia 's northern border , but those fields lie under the barents sea , which is covered in ice for much of the year .
fields further to the east also exist , but there the problem becomes one of transport .
most of russia 's gas customers are in europe , on the other side of the continent .
the second dilemma is currently being taken care of by a set of pipelines that will supply europe with gas , known as south stream and nord stream .
south stream will run from the beregovaya compressor station at dzhubga on the russia 's black sea coast to bulgaria 's city of varna , and would eventually supply gas to eastern europe and italy and austria .
russian prime minister vladimir putin was in ankara on thursday to persuade his turkish counterpart , recep tayyip erdogan , to sign up to the agreement .
the main reason behind south stream is russia 's desire to bypass ukraine - which is the transit route for almost 80 percent of russian gas to europe - at all costs .
the only way to do that is to route the pipeline through turkish territorial waters .
the other pipeline , nord stream , is currently being laid between russia and germany across the baltic sea , entering swedish , finnish and danish territorial waters .
germany is russia 's biggest gas customer in the eu and its second-biggest overall , after ukraine , which has had a notoriously rocky relationship with moscow since becoming independent following the fall of the soviet union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nord stream pipeline will connect russia directly with germany , its biggest european customer up until now , russia has had no way of turning off the gas to ukraine without also depriving its european customers .
these two pipelines make the issue moot and will have the effect of completely isolating kiev , at least when it comes to gas and energy economics .
switching to coal russia has had a long and difficult relationship with its gas and oil supplies .
according to the united states department of energy statistics , a slight majority , or 55 percent , of russian power stations run on natural gas , which by law has to be supplied at a severely reduced rate .
during the 1990s , when post-soviet russia was struggling to get back on its feet , the country found itself with an excess of natural gas on their hands .
that excess was pawned off on other countries and , due to lengthy agreements , will continue to be so for the foreseeable future .
this puts russia in a tricky position .
by forcing national gas company gazprom to sell gas to power plants at a reduced rate , the government is actually missing out on millions of dollars in tax money .
gazprom is russia 's largest tax payer , contributing up to 25 percent of the total amount added to the coffers each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia gets 55 percent of its energy from natural gas , which is supplied to power plants at a reduced cost but russia also relies on natural gas for 55 percent of its energy needs .
the country is home to the world 's second-largest coal reserves , after the united states , but after restructuring over the last couple of years , 80 percent of coal production in the country comes from independent producers .
this makes russia the only place in the world where it 's cheaper to run power plants on gas than coal , so they are reluctant to turn to the black stuff .
any economist would tell you that the smart thing for russia to do would be to switch all the gas-fired power plants to coal , and then send all that unused gas to europe at regular market prices . however , coal-fired power plants emit enormous amounts of carbon dioxide into the environment , and as a signatory to the kytoto protocol , russia is obligated to reduce its carbon output .
so russia has started to go another way and has begun to lean a little on renewable energy like hydropower .
according to alexi kokorin , climate expert at the russian branch or the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , this is not a move to be more climate friendly , but only to look more climate friendly .
kokorin said that russian gas fields are being pushed further and further into the arctic , making it more difficult and more expensive to extract .
" russia does n't have the technology to extract the gas and it 's becoming more and more expensive to get enough gas to send to europe and china , therefore the government has decided that they have to save gas in the country , " he said .
upcoming climate treaty in a recently released g8 climate scorecard , russia was listed in seventh place , only beating out canada , which is quite significant since both countries are kyoto signatories .
this comes just five months ahead of a crucial meeting in copenhagen which is intended to hammer out a new climate agreement .
government officials begin another round of climate talks in bonn on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international feathers were ruffled two years ago when a russian submarine planted a flag on the sea floor of the north pole given its geographical location , the argument could be made that russia would be one of the very few countries that would benefit from global warming melting huge swaths of ice , providing better access to oil and gas reserves buried deep beneath arctic waters .
kokorin both agrees and disagrees with the assessment .
yes , he admitted , less ice would make extraction of gas and oil from the barents sea much easier .
however , melting permafrost would make it more difficult and expensive to extract current known reserves in siberia .
claudia kemfert says there are many voices within russia , especially scientists , saying that climate change is positive for russia and that they would benefit because the ice would decrease and then the access would be improved .
russia signed the kyoto protocol , said kemfert , because in the mid-90s it was still an emerging nation trying to get back on its feet after the fall of the soviet union .
the russians were treated much the same way as india and china are being treated in relation to the copenhagen agreement .
now that they 're among the world eight richest nations , they ca n't exactly claim that they need to be handled with kid gloves .
there is also the small matter of who actually owns the gas and oil reserves in the arctic .
with just over 24,000 kilometers -lrb- 15,000 miles -rrb- of arctic coastline , russia certainly has a claim .
but so do the united states , canada , norway , and denmark .
rough estimates put the amount of oil and gas in the arctic at 20 percent of the total global reserves on the planet .
with that kind of potential , said kemfert , it wo n't matter to russia if the ice is there or not .
" of course they 'll try and sell it to the rest of the world , even if the ice is there , " she said .
" it 's much more expensive to drill into the sea with the ice , but they 've already been doing it in parts of siberia . "

but it was mainz 's daniel gunkel who managed to salvage a draw with a late freekick . champions start with a win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's brazilian grafite netted for his club on friday night , reigning champions wolfsburg started their season with a 2-0 win against visitors stuttgart . new wolfsburg coach armin veh made just one change from the side preferred by his predecessor felix magath last season with karim ziani starting in the midfield behind edin dzeko and grafite . stuttgart coach markus babbel gave new signings alexander hleb and pavel pogrebnyak an immediate chance to see what they could do . the two sides showed plenty of energy in the first half and stuttgart had some opportunities with sami khedira seeing a shot saved on the line by wolfsburg goalkeeper diego benaglio and pogrebnyak also having a header saved , but by the half-time whistle , neither side had hit the back of the net . wolfsburg , however , was the better team throughout and the deadlock was broken in the 71st minute by zvjezdan misimovic with a curled left-footed shot from the edge of the box .
just 11 minutes later , the freshly-crowned german footballer of the year , grafite , managed to get the clincher by shrugging off a defender and slotting a shot past keeper jens lehmann . champions wolfsburg wolfsburg went undefeated at home last season with 16 wins and a draw en route to a surprise first national title ahead of bayern munich and stuttgart . grafite was last season 's bundesliga top scorer knotching up 28 goals to his credit . grafite summed up tonight 's opening victory thus : " it was a nice evening for the club and for myself .

under existing law , german police are responsible for hostage situations . jung said in an interview with german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag that under existing law , police were responsible for hostage situations , but that it was not always possible for the police force to arrive quickly enough at a crime scene . the minister cited the recent episode involving german container ship the hansa stavanger , which was hijacked with 24 crew on board , including five germans , off the coast of somalia four months ago . he said that in the time it took a german police team to deploy to the horn of africa the situation had worsened .
only five pirates had boarded the ship initially , but their numbers eventually swelled to around 35 , he noted . " we should consider a constitutional amendment to allow the armed forces access to situations when the police can not act , such as when the police are not at the scene of an incident , " jung told the newspaper . " i want to put this on the agenda again at the latest when the parliamentary elections are over , " he added .
germans go to the polls to elect a new parliament in september . jung said the amendment should not only apply to international operations but also to certain domestic cases in which the german armed forces were better suited to handle a situation . the hansa stavanger was eventually released four months after being captured when the hamburg-based shipping company that owns the ship paid a 1.9-million-euro ransom . dfm / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

under existing law , german police are responsible for hostage situations . jung said in an interview with german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag that under existing law , police were responsible for hostage situations , but that it was not always possible for the police force to arrive quickly enough at a crime scene . the minister cited the recent episode involving german container ship the hansa stavanger , which was hijacked with 24 crew on board , including five germans , off the coast of somalia four months ago . he said that in the time it took a german police team to deploy to the horn of africa the situation had worsened .
only five pirates had boarded the ship initially , but their numbers eventually swelled to around 35 , he noted . " we should consider a constitutional amendment to allow the armed forces access to situations when the police can not act , such as when the police are not at the scene of an incident , " jung told the newspaper . " i want to put this on the agenda again at the latest when the parliamentary elections are over , " he added .
germans go to the polls to elect a new parliament in september . jung said the amendment should not only apply to international operations but also to certain domestic cases in which the german armed forces were better suited to handle a situation . the hansa stavanger was eventually released four months after being captured when the hamburg-based shipping company that owns the ship paid a 1.9-million-euro ransom . dfm / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 09.08.2009 russia plays better hand in pipeline poker großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia and turkey have agreed on the construction of a gas pipeline under the black sea soon after the eu signed a deal with ankara on the nabucco pipeline .
the russian project is ahead at the moment . russia and europe are heading for a grim race in the construction of a gas pipeline under the black sea .
or so it would appear after the signing of a contract between russian prime minister vladimir putin and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
there 's a need for both the russian south stream as well as the european nabucco pipeline , because gas consumption in europe will increase in the next decade .
however , the russian project is ahead at the moment , if you consider it from a political and business point of view .
the russians will be the first to begin construction and they can probably more easily afford the estimated 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- costs with their state-run gazprom .
a private consortium is to build the eu pipeline for around 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- .
the nabucco project has to be run as a business whereas gazprom can afford massive losses .
eu members disagree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia and turkey signed the south stream pipeline deal on august 6 european states such as greece , italy , bulgaria and austria as well as turkey are partners in both pipeline projects .
this indicates two things : it 's everyone for himself when it comes to energy security .
a uniform european approach is not expected and is also not desired , for energy provision falls in the jurisdiction of the member states .
a consistent energy policy in the european union is worlds away compared to the largest producer , russia , because the 27 member states can not agree on what they really want .
after their experiences as part of the former east bloc , the baltic states and poland , the czech republic and slovakia want to avoid any dependence on russia .
the largest group in the eu , including germany and france , are compliant customers who know that they will be dependent on the russian gas stopcock for a long time to come .
in principle , it is only right that the north stream in the baltic and south stream and nabucco in the south should provide alternatives to the present supply lines through ukraine and belarus .
above all , the loser will at first be ukraine which will be deprived of its status as an important transit country to turkey .
the caucasus question the caucasus plays a key role in the great gas debate .
important gas and oil pipelines , built with the help of the us , run through georgia which is in a long-term dispute with russia .
neither south stream nor nabucco can operate properly without a stable georgia , azerbaijan and armenia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nabucco has to be run as a business whereas gazprom can afford massive losses and even more important than the question of the pipeline routes is the question of the gas supplier .
who should supply the gas for the pipelines ?
russia and the eu are endeavoring to persuade the central asian states , especially turkmenistan , iraq and iran to be the suppliers .
that 's where the actual competition is .
russia does not produce enough from its own oil fields to be able to fulfill the contracts and thus needs new sources .
the eu is also endeavoring to strengthen deliveries from the mediterranean area and norway but here too new methods of conveyance are needed .
in order to guarantee the supply of energy , the eu has to do some homework on its own territory .
europe desperately needs north-south and east-west pipelines in order to be able to smooth out production shortfalls among its member states .
france advocates that the russians should not only be viewed as competitors that one simply has to keep out of the european market .
rather , the eu , russia and turkey should run all the pipelines together .
the happy winner at the moment , thanks to its geographical position , is turkey .
it will become the most important land of transit and is connected via the third pipeline , blue stream , directly with russia .
turkey could not do anything else than sign the contracts with putin , after all , russia supplies two thirds of the gas for the turkish market and thus possesses a virtual supply monopoly .

moldova 's communist party had held a majority in the national legislature for more than a decade , but was soundly defeated by the pro-europe opposition in the july poll .
infotag is reporting that the new coalition will be called " for european integration " -lrb- fei -rrb- , and that leaders of the alliance have named fighting corruption , better relations with the eu , a free and open media , and pulling moldova 's economy out of a deep recession as top priorities .
discussions on cabinet post division between the two liberal parties and the smaller democratic party of moldova , and our moldova party , were still in progress , according to a fei statement .
a top order of business will be election of a new president , requiring a 61-vote majority in the legislature by constitutional stature ; forcing the fei parties to seek at least 8 communist mps to support a fei candidate for the presidency .
current moldovan president vladimir voronin , who is also head of moldova 's communist party , said in a statement last week the communists " were willing to talk " with the fei alliance on a jointly- acceptable presidential candidate .

the april elections also sparked mass protests against results giving the communists a strong win , and near total control of parliament .
street battles between anti-communist demonstrators and police in the moldovan capital chisinau left one dead , hundreds injured , and the parliament and presidential residence badly damaged by fire .
eu officials shortly after the repeat vote in late july called on the pro- and anti-communist wings of moldova 's political arena to lay aside their differences , and form a new ruling coalition .
" the immediate priority is to put in place a government , and i urge all the political parties to engage in open and constructive dialogue , " eu foreign affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said last week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 09.08.2009 russia and the great natural gas balancing act großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia hopes to be able to save on gas use at home so that they can send more of it abroad russia controls the world 's largest gas reserves , but a combination of factors , including power production , climate change and logistics , are keeping it from reaping the greatest benefits . russia is running out of natural gas - or at least it 's running out of easily accessible natural gas .
according to the oil and gas journal 's 2008 survey , russia holds the world 's largest natural gas reserves , with 1,680 trillion cubic feet -lrb- 47.5 trillion cubic meters -rrb- , which is nearly twice the reserves in the next largest country , iran .
most of the known reserves , roughly 80 percent , are located in western siberia and are concentrated in giant or super-giant gas fields .
since the early 1970s , the amount of new fields discovered has been on the decline and output from the country 's core super-giant fields has been steadily decreasing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , left , successfully convinced erdogan to agree to allow russia access to turkish territorial waters according to claudia kemfert , director of the energy , transportation and environment at the german institute for economic research , there are new fields that potentially could be tapped , but they pose specific problems .
massive reserves are said to exist to the northwest of russia 's northern border , but those fields lie under the barents sea , which is covered in ice for much of the year .
fields further to the east also exist , but there the problem becomes one of transport .
most of russia 's gas customers are in europe , on the other side of the continent .
the second dilemma is currently being taken care of by a set of pipelines that will supply europe with gas , known as south stream and nord stream .
south stream will run from the beregovaya compressor station at dzhubga on the russia 's black sea coast to bulgaria 's city of varna , and would eventually supply gas to eastern europe and italy and austria .
russian prime minister vladimir putin was in ankara on thursday to persuade his turkish counterpart , recep tayyip erdogan , to sign up to the agreement .
the main reason behind south stream is russia 's desire to bypass ukraine - which is the transit route for almost 80 percent of russian gas to europe - at all costs .
the only way to do that is to route the pipeline through turkish territorial waters .
the other pipeline , nord stream , is currently being laid between russia and germany across the baltic sea , entering swedish , finnish and danish territorial waters .
germany is russia 's biggest gas customer in the eu and its second-biggest overall , after ukraine , which has had a notoriously rocky relationship with moscow since becoming independent following the fall of the soviet union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nord stream pipeline will connect russia directly with germany , its biggest european customer up until now , russia has had no way of turning off the gas to ukraine without also depriving its european customers .
these two pipelines make the issue moot and will have the effect of completely isolating kiev , at least when it comes to gas and energy economics .
switching to coal russia has had a long and difficult relationship with its gas and oil supplies .
according to the united states department of energy statistics , a slight majority , or 55 percent , of russian power stations run on natural gas , which by law has to be supplied at a severely reduced rate .
during the 1990s , when post-soviet russia was struggling to get back on its feet , the country found itself with an excess of natural gas on their hands .
that excess was pawned off on other countries and , due to lengthy agreements , will continue to be so for the foreseeable future .
this puts russia in a tricky position .
by forcing national gas company gazprom to sell gas to power plants at a reduced rate , the government is actually missing out on millions of dollars in tax money .
gazprom is russia 's largest tax payer , contributing up to 25 percent of the total amount added to the coffers each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia gets 55 percent of its energy from natural gas , which is supplied to power plants at a reduced cost but russia also relies on natural gas for 55 percent of its energy needs .
the country is home to the world 's second-largest coal reserves , after the united states , but after restructuring over the last couple of years , 80 percent of coal production in the country comes from independent producers .
this makes russia the only place in the world where it 's cheaper to run power plants on gas than coal , so they are reluctant to turn to the black stuff .
any economist would tell you that the smart thing for russia to do would be to switch all the gas-fired power plants to coal , and then send all that unused gas to europe at regular market prices . however , coal-fired power plants emit enormous amounts of carbon dioxide into the environment , and as a signatory to the kytoto protocol , russia is obligated to reduce its carbon output .
so russia has started to go another way and has begun to lean a little on renewable energy like hydropower .
according to alexi kokorin , climate expert at the russian branch or the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , this is not a move to be more climate friendly , but only to look more climate friendly .
kokorin said that russian gas fields are being pushed further and further into the arctic , making it more difficult and more expensive to extract .
" russia does n't have the technology to extract the gas and it 's becoming more and more expensive to get enough gas to send to europe and china , therefore the government has decided that they have to save gas in the country , " he said .
upcoming climate treaty in a recently released g8 climate scorecard , russia was listed in seventh place , only beating out canada , which is quite significant since both countries are kyoto signatories .
this comes just five months ahead of a crucial meeting in copenhagen which is intended to hammer out a new climate agreement .
government officials begin another round of climate talks in bonn on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international feathers were ruffled two years ago when a russian submarine planted a flag on the sea floor of the north pole given its geographical location , the argument could be made that russia would be one of the very few countries that would benefit from global warming melting huge swaths of ice , providing better access to oil and gas reserves buried deep beneath arctic waters .
kokorin both agrees and disagrees with the assessment .
yes , he admitted , less ice would make extraction of gas and oil from the barents sea much easier .
however , melting permafrost would make it more difficult and expensive to extract current known reserves in siberia .
claudia kemfert says there are many voices within russia , especially scientists , saying that climate change is positive for russia and that they would benefit because the ice would decrease and then the access would be improved .
russia signed the kyoto protocol , said kemfert , because in the mid-90s it was still an emerging nation trying to get back on its feet after the fall of the soviet union .
the russians were treated much the same way as india and china are being treated in relation to the copenhagen agreement .
now that they 're among the world eight richest nations , they ca n't exactly claim that they need to be handled with kid gloves .
there is also the small matter of who actually owns the gas and oil reserves in the arctic .
with just over 24,000 kilometers -lrb- 15,000 miles -rrb- of arctic coastline , russia certainly has a claim .
but so do the united states , canada , norway , and denmark .
rough estimates put the amount of oil and gas in the arctic at 20 percent of the total global reserves on the planet .
with that kind of potential , said kemfert , it wo n't matter to russia if the ice is there or not .
" of course they 'll try and sell it to the rest of the world , even if the ice is there , " she said .
" it 's much more expensive to drill into the sea with the ice , but they 've already been doing it in parts of siberia . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 09.08.2009 russia and the great natural gas balancing act großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia hopes to be able to save on gas use at home so that they can send more of it abroad russia controls the world 's largest gas reserves , but a combination of factors , including power production , climate change and logistics , are keeping it from reaping the greatest benefits . russia is running out of natural gas - or at least it 's running out of easily accessible natural gas .
according to the oil and gas journal 's 2008 survey , russia holds the world 's largest natural gas reserves , with 1,680 trillion cubic feet -lrb- 47.5 trillion cubic meters -rrb- , which is nearly twice the reserves in the next largest country , iran .
most of the known reserves , roughly 80 percent , are located in western siberia and are concentrated in giant or super-giant gas fields .
since the early 1970s , the amount of new fields discovered has been on the decline and output from the country 's core super-giant fields has been steadily decreasing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , left , successfully convinced erdogan to agree to allow russia access to turkish territorial waters according to claudia kemfert , director of the energy , transportation and environment at the german institute for economic research , there are new fields that potentially could be tapped , but they pose specific problems .
massive reserves are said to exist to the northwest of russia 's northern border , but those fields lie under the barents sea , which is covered in ice for much of the year .
fields further to the east also exist , but there the problem becomes one of transport .
most of russia 's gas customers are in europe , on the other side of the continent .
the second dilemma is currently being taken care of by a set of pipelines that will supply europe with gas , known as south stream and nord stream .
south stream will run from the beregovaya compressor station at dzhubga on the russia 's black sea coast to bulgaria 's city of varna , and would eventually supply gas to eastern europe and italy and austria .
russian prime minister vladimir putin was in ankara on thursday to persuade his turkish counterpart , recep tayyip erdogan , to sign up to the agreement .
the main reason behind south stream is russia 's desire to bypass ukraine - which is the transit route for almost 80 percent of russian gas to europe - at all costs .
the only way to do that is to route the pipeline through turkish territorial waters .
the other pipeline , nord stream , is currently being laid between russia and germany across the baltic sea , entering swedish , finnish and danish territorial waters .
germany is russia 's biggest gas customer in the eu and its second-biggest overall , after ukraine , which has had a notoriously rocky relationship with moscow since becoming independent following the fall of the soviet union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nord stream pipeline will connect russia directly with germany , its biggest european customer up until now , russia has had no way of turning off the gas to ukraine without also depriving its european customers .
these two pipelines make the issue moot and will have the effect of completely isolating kiev , at least when it comes to gas and energy economics .
switching to coal russia has had a long and difficult relationship with its gas and oil supplies .
according to the united states department of energy statistics , a slight majority , or 55 percent , of russian power stations run on natural gas , which by law has to be supplied at a severely reduced rate .
during the 1990s , when post-soviet russia was struggling to get back on its feet , the country found itself with an excess of natural gas on their hands .
that excess was pawned off on other countries and , due to lengthy agreements , will continue to be so for the foreseeable future .
this puts russia in a tricky position .
by forcing national gas company gazprom to sell gas to power plants at a reduced rate , the government is actually missing out on millions of dollars in tax money .
gazprom is russia 's largest tax payer , contributing up to 25 percent of the total amount added to the coffers each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia gets 55 percent of its energy from natural gas , which is supplied to power plants at a reduced cost but russia also relies on natural gas for 55 percent of its energy needs .
the country is home to the world 's second-largest coal reserves , after the united states , but after restructuring over the last couple of years , 80 percent of coal production in the country comes from independent producers .
this makes russia the only place in the world where it 's cheaper to run power plants on gas than coal , so they are reluctant to turn to the black stuff .
any economist would tell you that the smart thing for russia to do would be to switch all the gas-fired power plants to coal , and then send all that unused gas to europe at regular market prices . however , coal-fired power plants emit enormous amounts of carbon dioxide into the environment , and as a signatory to the kytoto protocol , russia is obligated to reduce its carbon output .
so russia has started to go another way and has begun to lean a little on renewable energy like hydropower .
according to alexi kokorin , climate expert at the russian branch or the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , this is not a move to be more climate friendly , but only to look more climate friendly .
kokorin said that russian gas fields are being pushed further and further into the arctic , making it more difficult and more expensive to extract .
" russia does n't have the technology to extract the gas and it 's becoming more and more expensive to get enough gas to send to europe and china , therefore the government has decided that they have to save gas in the country , " he said .
upcoming climate treaty in a recently released g8 climate scorecard , russia was listed in seventh place , only beating out canada , which is quite significant since both countries are kyoto signatories .
this comes just five months ahead of a crucial meeting in copenhagen which is intended to hammer out a new climate agreement .
government officials begin another round of climate talks in bonn on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international feathers were ruffled two years ago when a russian submarine planted a flag on the sea floor of the north pole given its geographical location , the argument could be made that russia would be one of the very few countries that would benefit from global warming melting huge swaths of ice , providing better access to oil and gas reserves buried deep beneath arctic waters .
kokorin both agrees and disagrees with the assessment .
yes , he admitted , less ice would make extraction of gas and oil from the barents sea much easier .
however , melting permafrost would make it more difficult and expensive to extract current known reserves in siberia .
claudia kemfert says there are many voices within russia , especially scientists , saying that climate change is positive for russia and that they would benefit because the ice would decrease and then the access would be improved .
russia signed the kyoto protocol , said kemfert , because in the mid-90s it was still an emerging nation trying to get back on its feet after the fall of the soviet union .
the russians were treated much the same way as india and china are being treated in relation to the copenhagen agreement .
now that they 're among the world eight richest nations , they ca n't exactly claim that they need to be handled with kid gloves .
there is also the small matter of who actually owns the gas and oil reserves in the arctic .
with just over 24,000 kilometers -lrb- 15,000 miles -rrb- of arctic coastline , russia certainly has a claim .
but so do the united states , canada , norway , and denmark .
rough estimates put the amount of oil and gas in the arctic at 20 percent of the total global reserves on the planet .
with that kind of potential , said kemfert , it wo n't matter to russia if the ice is there or not .
" of course they 'll try and sell it to the rest of the world , even if the ice is there , " she said .
" it 's much more expensive to drill into the sea with the ice , but they 've already been doing it in parts of siberia . "

the russian project is ahead at the moment . russia and europe are heading for a grim race in the construction of a gas pipeline under the black sea .
or so it would appear after the signing of a contract between russian prime minister vladimir putin and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
there 's a need for both the russian south stream as well as the european nabucco pipeline , because gas consumption in europe will increase in the next decade .
however , the russian project is ahead at the moment , if you consider it from a political and business point of view .
the russians will be the first to begin construction and they can probably more easily afford the estimated 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- costs with their state-run gazprom .
a private consortium is to build the eu pipeline for around 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- .
the nabucco project has to be run as a business whereas gazprom can afford massive losses .
eu members disagree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia and turkey signed the south stream pipeline deal on august 6 european states such as greece , italy , bulgaria and austria as well as turkey are partners in both pipeline projects .
this indicates two things : it 's everyone for himself when it comes to energy security .
a uniform european approach is not expected and is also not desired , for energy provision falls in the jurisdiction of the member states .
a consistent energy policy in the european union is worlds away compared to the largest producer , russia , because the 27 member states can not agree on what they really want .
after their experiences as part of the former east bloc , the baltic states and poland , the czech republic and slovakia want to avoid any dependence on russia .
the largest group in the eu , including germany and france , are compliant customers who know that they will be dependent on the russian gas stopcock for a long time to come .
in principle , it is only right that the north stream in the baltic and south stream and nabucco in the south should provide alternatives to the present supply lines through ukraine and belarus .
above all , the loser will at first be ukraine which will be deprived of its status as an important transit country to turkey .
the caucasus question the caucasus plays a key role in the great gas debate .
important gas and oil pipelines , built with the help of the us , run through georgia which is in a long-term dispute with russia .
neither south stream nor nabucco can operate properly without a stable georgia , azerbaijan and armenia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nabucco has to be run as a business whereas gazprom can afford massive losses and even more important than the question of the pipeline routes is the question of the gas supplier .
who should supply the gas for the pipelines ?
russia and the eu are endeavoring to persuade the central asian states , especially turkmenistan , iraq and iran to be the suppliers .
that 's where the actual competition is .
russia does not produce enough from its own oil fields to be able to fulfill the contracts and thus needs new sources .
the eu is also endeavoring to strengthen deliveries from the mediterranean area and norway but here too new methods of conveyance are needed .
in order to guarantee the supply of energy , the eu has to do some homework on its own territory .
europe desperately needs north-south and east-west pipelines in order to be able to smooth out production shortfalls among its member states .
france advocates that the russians should not only be viewed as competitors that one simply has to keep out of the european market .
rather , the eu , russia and turkey should run all the pipelines together .
the happy winner at the moment , thanks to its geographical position , is turkey .
it will become the most important land of transit and is connected via the third pipeline , blue stream , directly with russia .
turkey could not do anything else than sign the contracts with putin , after all , russia supplies two thirds of the gas for the turkish market and thus possesses a virtual supply monopoly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 09.08.2009 russia and the great natural gas balancing act großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia hopes to be able to save on gas use at home so that they can send more of it abroad russia controls the world 's largest gas reserves , but a combination of factors , including power production , climate change and logistics , are keeping it from reaping the greatest benefits . russia is running out of natural gas - or at least it 's running out of easily accessible natural gas .
according to the oil and gas journal 's 2008 survey , russia holds the world 's largest natural gas reserves , with 1,680 trillion cubic feet -lrb- 47.5 trillion cubic meters -rrb- , which is nearly twice the reserves in the next largest country , iran .
most of the known reserves , roughly 80 percent , are located in western siberia and are concentrated in giant or super-giant gas fields .
since the early 1970s , the amount of new fields discovered has been on the decline and output from the country 's core super-giant fields has been steadily decreasing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , left , successfully convinced erdogan to agree to allow russia access to turkish territorial waters according to claudia kemfert , director of the energy , transportation and environment at the german institute for economic research , there are new fields that potentially could be tapped , but they pose specific problems .
massive reserves are said to exist to the northwest of russia 's northern border , but those fields lie under the barents sea , which is covered in ice for much of the year .
fields further to the east also exist , but there the problem becomes one of transport .
most of russia 's gas customers are in europe , on the other side of the continent .
the second dilemma is currently being taken care of by a set of pipelines that will supply europe with gas , known as south stream and nord stream .
south stream will run from the beregovaya compressor station at dzhubga on the russia 's black sea coast to bulgaria 's city of varna , and would eventually supply gas to eastern europe and italy and austria .
russian prime minister vladimir putin was in ankara on thursday to persuade his turkish counterpart , recep tayyip erdogan , to sign up to the agreement .
the main reason behind south stream is russia 's desire to bypass ukraine - which is the transit route for almost 80 percent of russian gas to europe - at all costs .
the only way to do that is to route the pipeline through turkish territorial waters .
the other pipeline , nord stream , is currently being laid between russia and germany across the baltic sea , entering swedish , finnish and danish territorial waters .
germany is russia 's biggest gas customer in the eu and its second-biggest overall , after ukraine , which has had a notoriously rocky relationship with moscow since becoming independent following the fall of the soviet union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nord stream pipeline will connect russia directly with germany , its biggest european customer up until now , russia has had no way of turning off the gas to ukraine without also depriving its european customers .
these two pipelines make the issue moot and will have the effect of completely isolating kiev , at least when it comes to gas and energy economics .
switching to coal russia has had a long and difficult relationship with its gas and oil supplies .
according to the united states department of energy statistics , a slight majority , or 55 percent , of russian power stations run on natural gas , which by law has to be supplied at a severely reduced rate .
during the 1990s , when post-soviet russia was struggling to get back on its feet , the country found itself with an excess of natural gas on their hands .
that excess was pawned off on other countries and , due to lengthy agreements , will continue to be so for the foreseeable future .
this puts russia in a tricky position .
by forcing national gas company gazprom to sell gas to power plants at a reduced rate , the government is actually missing out on millions of dollars in tax money .
gazprom is russia 's largest tax payer , contributing up to 25 percent of the total amount added to the coffers each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia gets 55 percent of its energy from natural gas , which is supplied to power plants at a reduced cost but russia also relies on natural gas for 55 percent of its energy needs .
the country is home to the world 's second-largest coal reserves , after the united states , but after restructuring over the last couple of years , 80 percent of coal production in the country comes from independent producers .
this makes russia the only place in the world where it 's cheaper to run power plants on gas than coal , so they are reluctant to turn to the black stuff .
any economist would tell you that the smart thing for russia to do would be to switch all the gas-fired power plants to coal , and then send all that unused gas to europe at regular market prices . however , coal-fired power plants emit enormous amounts of carbon dioxide into the environment , and as a signatory to the kytoto protocol , russia is obligated to reduce its carbon output .
so russia has started to go another way and has begun to lean a little on renewable energy like hydropower .
according to alexi kokorin , climate expert at the russian branch or the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , this is not a move to be more climate friendly , but only to look more climate friendly .
kokorin said that russian gas fields are being pushed further and further into the arctic , making it more difficult and more expensive to extract .
" russia does n't have the technology to extract the gas and it 's becoming more and more expensive to get enough gas to send to europe and china , therefore the government has decided that they have to save gas in the country , " he said .
upcoming climate treaty in a recently released g8 climate scorecard , russia was listed in seventh place , only beating out canada , which is quite significant since both countries are kyoto signatories .
this comes just five months ahead of a crucial meeting in copenhagen which is intended to hammer out a new climate agreement .
government officials begin another round of climate talks in bonn on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international feathers were ruffled two years ago when a russian submarine planted a flag on the sea floor of the north pole given its geographical location , the argument could be made that russia would be one of the very few countries that would benefit from global warming melting huge swaths of ice , providing better access to oil and gas reserves buried deep beneath arctic waters .
kokorin both agrees and disagrees with the assessment .
yes , he admitted , less ice would make extraction of gas and oil from the barents sea much easier .
however , melting permafrost would make it more difficult and expensive to extract current known reserves in siberia .
claudia kemfert says there are many voices within russia , especially scientists , saying that climate change is positive for russia and that they would benefit because the ice would decrease and then the access would be improved .
russia signed the kyoto protocol , said kemfert , because in the mid-90s it was still an emerging nation trying to get back on its feet after the fall of the soviet union .
the russians were treated much the same way as india and china are being treated in relation to the copenhagen agreement .
now that they 're among the world eight richest nations , they ca n't exactly claim that they need to be handled with kid gloves .
there is also the small matter of who actually owns the gas and oil reserves in the arctic .
with just over 24,000 kilometers -lrb- 15,000 miles -rrb- of arctic coastline , russia certainly has a claim .
but so do the united states , canada , norway , and denmark .
rough estimates put the amount of oil and gas in the arctic at 20 percent of the total global reserves on the planet .
with that kind of potential , said kemfert , it wo n't matter to russia if the ice is there or not .
" of course they 'll try and sell it to the rest of the world , even if the ice is there , " she said .
" it 's much more expensive to drill into the sea with the ice , but they 've already been doing it in parts of siberia . "

moldova 's communist party had held a majority in the national legislature for more than a decade , but was soundly defeated by the pro-europe opposition in the july poll .
infotag is reporting that the new coalition will be called " for european integration " -lrb- fei -rrb- , and that leaders of the alliance have named fighting corruption , better relations with the eu , a free and open media , and pulling moldova 's economy out of a deep recession as top priorities .
discussions on cabinet post division between the two liberal parties and the smaller democratic party of moldova , and our moldova party , were still in progress , according to a fei statement .
a top order of business will be election of a new president , requiring a 61-vote majority in the legislature by constitutional stature ; forcing the fei parties to seek at least 8 communist mps to support a fei candidate for the presidency .
current moldovan president vladimir voronin , who is also head of moldova 's communist party , said in a statement last week the communists " were willing to talk " with the fei alliance on a jointly- acceptable presidential candidate .
rioting in the streets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : original parliamentary elections back in april sparked mass protest unwillingness by fei parties to accept a communist candidate for president in the wake of april elections produced a hung parliament , forcing new elections in july .
the april elections also sparked mass protests against results giving the communists a strong win , and near total control of parliament .
street battles between anti-communist demonstrators and police in the moldovan capital chisinau left one dead , hundreds injured , and the parliament and presidential residence badly damaged by fire .
eu officials shortly after the repeat vote in late july called on the pro- and anti-communist wings of moldova 's political arena to lay aside their differences , and form a new ruling coalition .
" the immediate priority is to put in place a government , and i urge all the political parties to engage in open and constructive dialogue , " eu foreign affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said last week .
moldova may not hold any more parliamentary elections in 2009 , but the nation 's supreme court ruled in july that if the legislature fails to elect a president by january 2010 another nation-wide vote to select mps - the third in ten months - would be possible. mrm / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there are things you ca n't explain in football .

mimoun azaouagh scored almost identical goals within 48 seconds of each other as vfl bochum fought from three goals down to earn a 3-3 draw against moenchengladbach , who were reduced to 10 men after bonfim dante was shown the red card for a foul on stanislav sestak at the 60-minute mark .

moldova 's communist party had held a majority in the national legislature for more than a decade , but was soundly defeated by the pro-europe opposition in the july poll .
infotag is reporting that the new coalition will be called " for european integration " -lrb- fei -rrb- , and that leaders of the alliance have named fighting corruption , better relations with the eu , a free and open media , and pulling moldova 's economy out of a deep recession as top priorities .
discussions on cabinet post division between the two liberal parties and the smaller democratic party of moldova , and our moldova party , were still in progress , according to a fei statement .
a top order of business will be election of a new president , requiring a 61-vote majority in the legislature by constitutional stature ; forcing the fei parties to seek at least 8 communist mps to support a fei candidate for the presidency .
current moldovan president vladimir voronin , who is also head of moldova 's communist party , said in a statement last week the communists " were willing to talk " with the fei alliance on a jointly- acceptable presidential candidate .
rioting in the streets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : original parliamentary elections back in april sparked mass protest unwillingness by fei parties to accept a communist candidate for president in the wake of april elections produced a hung parliament , forcing new elections in july .
the april elections also sparked mass protests against results giving the communists a strong win , and near total control of parliament .
street battles between anti-communist demonstrators and police in the moldovan capital chisinau left one dead , hundreds injured , and the parliament and presidential residence badly damaged by fire .
eu officials shortly after the repeat vote in late july called on the pro- and anti-communist wings of moldova 's political arena to lay aside their differences , and form a new ruling coalition .
" the immediate priority is to put in place a government , and i urge all the political parties to engage in open and constructive dialogue , " eu foreign affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said last week .
moldova may not hold any more parliamentary elections in 2009 , but the nation 's supreme court ruled in july that if the legislature fails to elect a president by january 2010 another nation-wide vote to select mps - the third in ten months - would be possible. mrm / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the russian project is ahead at the moment . russia and europe are heading for a grim race in the construction of a gas pipeline under the black sea .
or so it would appear after the signing of a contract between russian prime minister vladimir putin and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
there 's a need for both the russian south stream as well as the european nabucco pipeline , because gas consumption in europe will increase in the next decade .
however , the russian project is ahead at the moment , if you consider it from a political and business point of view .
the russians will be the first to begin construction and they can probably more easily afford the estimated 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- costs with their state-run gazprom .
a private consortium is to build the eu pipeline for around 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- .
the nabucco project has to be run as a business whereas gazprom can afford massive losses .
eu members disagree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia and turkey signed the south stream pipeline deal on august 6 european states such as greece , italy , bulgaria and austria as well as turkey are partners in both pipeline projects .
this indicates two things : it 's everyone for himself when it comes to energy security .
a uniform european approach is not expected and is also not desired , for energy provision falls in the jurisdiction of the member states .
a consistent energy policy in the european union is worlds away compared to the largest producer , russia , because the 27 member states can not agree on what they really want .
after their experiences as part of the former east bloc , the baltic states and poland , the czech republic and slovakia want to avoid any dependence on russia .
the largest group in the eu , including germany and france , are compliant customers who know that they will be dependent on the russian gas stopcock for a long time to come .
in principle , it is only right that the north stream in the baltic and south stream and nabucco in the south should provide alternatives to the present supply lines through ukraine and belarus .
above all , the loser will at first be ukraine which will be deprived of its status as an important transit country to turkey .
the caucasus question the caucasus plays a key role in the great gas debate .
important gas and oil pipelines , built with the help of the us , run through georgia which is in a long-term dispute with russia .
neither south stream nor nabucco can operate properly without a stable georgia , azerbaijan and armenia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nabucco has to be run as a business whereas gazprom can afford massive losses and even more important than the question of the pipeline routes is the question of the gas supplier .
who should supply the gas for the pipelines ?
russia and the eu are endeavoring to persuade the central asian states , especially turkmenistan , iraq and iran to be the suppliers .
that 's where the actual competition is .
russia does not produce enough from its own oil fields to be able to fulfill the contracts and thus needs new sources .
the eu is also endeavoring to strengthen deliveries from the mediterranean area and norway but here too new methods of conveyance are needed .
in order to guarantee the supply of energy , the eu has to do some homework on its own territory .
europe desperately needs north-south and east-west pipelines in order to be able to smooth out production shortfalls among its member states .
france advocates that the russians should not only be viewed as competitors that one simply has to keep out of the european market .
rather , the eu , russia and turkey should run all the pipelines together .
the happy winner at the moment , thanks to its geographical position , is turkey .
it will become the most important land of transit and is connected via the third pipeline , blue stream , directly with russia .
turkey could not do anything else than sign the contracts with putin , after all , russia supplies two thirds of the gas for the turkish market and thus possesses a virtual supply monopoly .

the largest group in the eu , including germany and france , are compliant customers who know that they will be dependent on the russian gas stopcock for a long time to come .
in principle , it is only right that the north stream in the baltic and south stream and nabucco in the south should provide alternatives to the present supply lines through ukraine and belarus .
above all , the loser will at first be ukraine which will be deprived of its status as an important transit country to turkey .
the caucasus question the caucasus plays a key role in the great gas debate .
important gas and oil pipelines , built with the help of the us , run through georgia which is in a long-term dispute with russia .
neither south stream nor nabucco can operate properly without a stable georgia , azerbaijan and armenia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nabucco has to be run as a business whereas gazprom can afford massive losses and even more important than the question of the pipeline routes is the question of the gas supplier .
who should supply the gas for the pipelines ?
russia and the eu are endeavoring to persuade the central asian states , especially turkmenistan , iraq and iran to be the suppliers .
that 's where the actual competition is .
russia does not produce enough from its own oil fields to be able to fulfill the contracts and thus needs new sources .
the eu is also endeavoring to strengthen deliveries from the mediterranean area and norway but here too new methods of conveyance are needed .
in order to guarantee the supply of energy , the eu has to do some homework on its own territory .
europe desperately needs north-south and east-west pipelines in order to be able to smooth out production shortfalls among its member states .
france advocates that the russians should not only be viewed as competitors that one simply has to keep out of the european market .
rather , the eu , russia and turkey should run all the pipelines together .
the happy winner at the moment , thanks to its geographical position , is turkey .
it will become the most important land of transit and is connected via the third pipeline , blue stream , directly with russia .
turkey could not do anything else than sign the contracts with putin , after all , russia supplies two thirds of the gas for the turkish market and thus possesses a virtual supply monopoly .

germans go to the polls to elect a new parliament in september . jung said the amendment should not only apply to international operations but also to certain domestic cases in which the german armed forces were better suited to handle a situation . the hansa stavanger was eventually released four months after being captured when the hamburg-based shipping company that owns the ship paid a 1.9-million-euro ransom . dfm / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 09.08.2009 russia plays better hand in pipeline poker großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia and turkey have agreed on the construction of a gas pipeline under the black sea soon after the eu signed a deal with ankara on the nabucco pipeline .
the russian project is ahead at the moment . russia and europe are heading for a grim race in the construction of a gas pipeline under the black sea .
or so it would appear after the signing of a contract between russian prime minister vladimir putin and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
there 's a need for both the russian south stream as well as the european nabucco pipeline , because gas consumption in europe will increase in the next decade .
however , the russian project is ahead at the moment , if you consider it from a political and business point of view .
the russians will be the first to begin construction and they can probably more easily afford the estimated 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- costs with their state-run gazprom .
a private consortium is to build the eu pipeline for around 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- .
the nabucco project has to be run as a business whereas gazprom can afford massive losses .
eu members disagree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia and turkey signed the south stream pipeline deal on august 6 european states such as greece , italy , bulgaria and austria as well as turkey are partners in both pipeline projects .
this indicates two things : it 's everyone for himself when it comes to energy security .

the russian project is ahead at the moment . russia and europe are heading for a grim race in the construction of a gas pipeline under the black sea .
or so it would appear after the signing of a contract between russian prime minister vladimir putin and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
there 's a need for both the russian south stream as well as the european nabucco pipeline , because gas consumption in europe will increase in the next decade .
however , the russian project is ahead at the moment , if you consider it from a political and business point of view .
the russians will be the first to begin construction and they can probably more easily afford the estimated 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- costs with their state-run gazprom .
a private consortium is to build the eu pipeline for around 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- .

under existing law , german police are responsible for hostage situations . jung said in an interview with german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag that under existing law , police were responsible for hostage situations , but that it was not always possible for the police force to arrive quickly enough at a crime scene . the minister cited the recent episode involving german container ship the hansa stavanger , which was hijacked with 24 crew on board , including five germans , off the coast of somalia four months ago . he said that in the time it took a german police team to deploy to the horn of africa the situation had worsened .
only five pirates had boarded the ship initially , but their numbers eventually swelled to around 35 , he noted . " we should consider a constitutional amendment to allow the armed forces access to situations when the police can not act , such as when the police are not at the scene of an incident , " jung told the newspaper . " i want to put this on the agenda again at the latest when the parliamentary elections are over , " he added .
germans go to the polls to elect a new parliament in september . jung said the amendment should not only apply to international operations but also to certain domestic cases in which the german armed forces were better suited to handle a situation . the hansa stavanger was eventually released four months after being captured when the hamburg-based shipping company that owns the ship paid a 1.9-million-euro ransom . dfm / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 09.08.2009 russia and the great natural gas balancing act großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia hopes to be able to save on gas use at home so that they can send more of it abroad russia controls the world 's largest gas reserves , but a combination of factors , including power production , climate change and logistics , are keeping it from reaping the greatest benefits . russia is running out of natural gas - or at least it 's running out of easily accessible natural gas .
according to the oil and gas journal 's 2008 survey , russia holds the world 's largest natural gas reserves , with 1,680 trillion cubic feet -lrb- 47.5 trillion cubic meters -rrb- , which is nearly twice the reserves in the next largest country , iran .
most of the known reserves , roughly 80 percent , are located in western siberia and are concentrated in giant or super-giant gas fields .
since the early 1970s , the amount of new fields discovered has been on the decline and output from the country 's core super-giant fields has been steadily decreasing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , left , successfully convinced erdogan to agree to allow russia access to turkish territorial waters according to claudia kemfert , director of the energy , transportation and environment at the german institute for economic research , there are new fields that potentially could be tapped , but they pose specific problems .
massive reserves are said to exist to the northwest of russia 's northern border , but those fields lie under the barents sea , which is covered in ice for much of the year .
fields further to the east also exist , but there the problem becomes one of transport .
most of russia 's gas customers are in europe , on the other side of the continent .
the second dilemma is currently being taken care of by a set of pipelines that will supply europe with gas , known as south stream and nord stream .
south stream will run from the beregovaya compressor station at dzhubga on the russia 's black sea coast to bulgaria 's city of varna , and would eventually supply gas to eastern europe and italy and austria .
russian prime minister vladimir putin was in ankara on thursday to persuade his turkish counterpart , recep tayyip erdogan , to sign up to the agreement .
the main reason behind south stream is russia 's desire to bypass ukraine - which is the transit route for almost 80 percent of russian gas to europe - at all costs .
the only way to do that is to route the pipeline through turkish territorial waters .
the other pipeline , nord stream , is currently being laid between russia and germany across the baltic sea , entering swedish , finnish and danish territorial waters .
germany is russia 's biggest gas customer in the eu and its second-biggest overall , after ukraine , which has had a notoriously rocky relationship with moscow since becoming independent following the fall of the soviet union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nord stream pipeline will connect russia directly with germany , its biggest european customer up until now , russia has had no way of turning off the gas to ukraine without also depriving its european customers .
these two pipelines make the issue moot and will have the effect of completely isolating kiev , at least when it comes to gas and energy economics .
switching to coal russia has had a long and difficult relationship with its gas and oil supplies .
according to the united states department of energy statistics , a slight majority , or 55 percent , of russian power stations run on natural gas , which by law has to be supplied at a severely reduced rate .
during the 1990s , when post-soviet russia was struggling to get back on its feet , the country found itself with an excess of natural gas on their hands .
that excess was pawned off on other countries and , due to lengthy agreements , will continue to be so for the foreseeable future .
this puts russia in a tricky position .
by forcing national gas company gazprom to sell gas to power plants at a reduced rate , the government is actually missing out on millions of dollars in tax money .
gazprom is russia 's largest tax payer , contributing up to 25 percent of the total amount added to the coffers each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia gets 55 percent of its energy from natural gas , which is supplied to power plants at a reduced cost but russia also relies on natural gas for 55 percent of its energy needs .
the country is home to the world 's second-largest coal reserves , after the united states , but after restructuring over the last couple of years , 80 percent of coal production in the country comes from independent producers .
this makes russia the only place in the world where it 's cheaper to run power plants on gas than coal , so they are reluctant to turn to the black stuff .
any economist would tell you that the smart thing for russia to do would be to switch all the gas-fired power plants to coal , and then send all that unused gas to europe at regular market prices . however , coal-fired power plants emit enormous amounts of carbon dioxide into the environment , and as a signatory to the kytoto protocol , russia is obligated to reduce its carbon output .
so russia has started to go another way and has begun to lean a little on renewable energy like hydropower .
according to alexi kokorin , climate expert at the russian branch or the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , this is not a move to be more climate friendly , but only to look more climate friendly .
kokorin said that russian gas fields are being pushed further and further into the arctic , making it more difficult and more expensive to extract .
" russia does n't have the technology to extract the gas and it 's becoming more and more expensive to get enough gas to send to europe and china , therefore the government has decided that they have to save gas in the country , " he said .
upcoming climate treaty in a recently released g8 climate scorecard , russia was listed in seventh place , only beating out canada , which is quite significant since both countries are kyoto signatories .
this comes just five months ahead of a crucial meeting in copenhagen which is intended to hammer out a new climate agreement .
government officials begin another round of climate talks in bonn on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international feathers were ruffled two years ago when a russian submarine planted a flag on the sea floor of the north pole given its geographical location , the argument could be made that russia would be one of the very few countries that would benefit from global warming melting huge swaths of ice , providing better access to oil and gas reserves buried deep beneath arctic waters .
kokorin both agrees and disagrees with the assessment .
yes , he admitted , less ice would make extraction of gas and oil from the barents sea much easier .
however , melting permafrost would make it more difficult and expensive to extract current known reserves in siberia .
claudia kemfert says there are many voices within russia , especially scientists , saying that climate change is positive for russia and that they would benefit because the ice would decrease and then the access would be improved .
russia signed the kyoto protocol , said kemfert , because in the mid-90s it was still an emerging nation trying to get back on its feet after the fall of the soviet union .
the russians were treated much the same way as india and china are being treated in relation to the copenhagen agreement .
now that they 're among the world eight richest nations , they ca n't exactly claim that they need to be handled with kid gloves .
there is also the small matter of who actually owns the gas and oil reserves in the arctic .
with just over 24,000 kilometers -lrb- 15,000 miles -rrb- of arctic coastline , russia certainly has a claim .
but so do the united states , canada , norway , and denmark .
rough estimates put the amount of oil and gas in the arctic at 20 percent of the total global reserves on the planet .
with that kind of potential , said kemfert , it wo n't matter to russia if the ice is there or not .
" of course they 'll try and sell it to the rest of the world , even if the ice is there , " she said .
" it 's much more expensive to drill into the sea with the ice , but they 've already been doing it in parts of siberia . "

the russian project is ahead at the moment . russia and europe are heading for a grim race in the construction of a gas pipeline under the black sea .
or so it would appear after the signing of a contract between russian prime minister vladimir putin and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
there 's a need for both the russian south stream as well as the european nabucco pipeline , because gas consumption in europe will increase in the next decade .
however , the russian project is ahead at the moment , if you consider it from a political and business point of view .
the russians will be the first to begin construction and they can probably more easily afford the estimated 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- costs with their state-run gazprom .
a private consortium is to build the eu pipeline for around 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- .
the nabucco project has to be run as a business whereas gazprom can afford massive losses .
eu members disagree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia and turkey signed the south stream pipeline deal on august 6 european states such as greece , italy , bulgaria and austria as well as turkey are partners in both pipeline projects .
this indicates two things : it 's everyone for himself when it comes to energy security .
a uniform european approach is not expected and is also not desired , for energy provision falls in the jurisdiction of the member states .
a consistent energy policy in the european union is worlds away compared to the largest producer , russia , because the 27 member states can not agree on what they really want .
after their experiences as part of the former east bloc , the baltic states and poland , the czech republic and slovakia want to avoid any dependence on russia .
the largest group in the eu , including germany and france , are compliant customers who know that they will be dependent on the russian gas stopcock for a long time to come .
in principle , it is only right that the north stream in the baltic and south stream and nabucco in the south should provide alternatives to the present supply lines through ukraine and belarus .
above all , the loser will at first be ukraine which will be deprived of its status as an important transit country to turkey .
the caucasus question the caucasus plays a key role in the great gas debate .
important gas and oil pipelines , built with the help of the us , run through georgia which is in a long-term dispute with russia .
neither south stream nor nabucco can operate properly without a stable georgia , azerbaijan and armenia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nabucco has to be run as a business whereas gazprom can afford massive losses and even more important than the question of the pipeline routes is the question of the gas supplier .
who should supply the gas for the pipelines ?
russia and the eu are endeavoring to persuade the central asian states , especially turkmenistan , iraq and iran to be the suppliers .
that 's where the actual competition is .
russia does not produce enough from its own oil fields to be able to fulfill the contracts and thus needs new sources .
the eu is also endeavoring to strengthen deliveries from the mediterranean area and norway but here too new methods of conveyance are needed .
in order to guarantee the supply of energy , the eu has to do some homework on its own territory .
europe desperately needs north-south and east-west pipelines in order to be able to smooth out production shortfalls among its member states .
france advocates that the russians should not only be viewed as competitors that one simply has to keep out of the european market .
rather , the eu , russia and turkey should run all the pipelines together .
the happy winner at the moment , thanks to its geographical position , is turkey .
it will become the most important land of transit and is connected via the third pipeline , blue stream , directly with russia .
turkey could not do anything else than sign the contracts with putin , after all , russia supplies two thirds of the gas for the turkish market and thus possesses a virtual supply monopoly .

schalke striker kevin kuranyi scored in both halves to secure a 2-1 victory over newly-promoted nuremberg . playing without strikers miroslav klose and luca toni , as well as defender martin demichelis , the bavarians managed a tie at hoffenheim . it looked as though the hosts had scored in the 11th minute with a header from josip simunic , but referees judged it had been palmed out of the goal by keeper michael rensing . bayern took the lead against the run of play through ivica olic in the 25th minute before chinedu obasi evened the score with a low drive set up by vedad ibisevic .

elsewhere , hertha berlin managed a 1-0 win over hanover 96 . in mainz , an early header from tim hoogland put the home side ahead , and a penalty save by goalkeeper heinz mueller on a kick from tranquillo barnetta gave the hosts a bit of hope .

just 11 minutes later , the freshly-crowned german footballer of the year , grafite , managed to get the clincher by shrugging off a defender and slotting a shot past keeper jens lehmann . champions wolfsburg wolfsburg went undefeated at home last season with 16 wins and a draw en route to a surprise first national title ahead of bayern munich and stuttgart . grafite was last season 's bundesliga top scorer knotching up 28 goals to his credit . grafite summed up tonight 's opening victory thus : " it was a nice evening for the club and for myself .

that 's where the actual competition is .
russia does not produce enough from its own oil fields to be able to fulfill the contracts and thus needs new sources .
the eu is also endeavoring to strengthen deliveries from the mediterranean area and norway but here too new methods of conveyance are needed .
in order to guarantee the supply of energy , the eu has to do some homework on its own territory .
europe desperately needs north-south and east-west pipelines in order to be able to smooth out production shortfalls among its member states .
france advocates that the russians should not only be viewed as competitors that one simply has to keep out of the european market .
rather , the eu , russia and turkey should run all the pipelines together .
the happy winner at the moment , thanks to its geographical position , is turkey .
it will become the most important land of transit and is connected via the third pipeline , blue stream , directly with russia .
turkey could not do anything else than sign the contracts with putin , after all , russia supplies two thirds of the gas for the turkish market and thus possesses a virtual supply monopoly .

the russian project is ahead at the moment . russia and europe are heading for a grim race in the construction of a gas pipeline under the black sea .
or so it would appear after the signing of a contract between russian prime minister vladimir putin and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
there 's a need for both the russian south stream as well as the european nabucco pipeline , because gas consumption in europe will increase in the next decade .
however , the russian project is ahead at the moment , if you consider it from a political and business point of view .
the russians will be the first to begin construction and they can probably more easily afford the estimated 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- costs with their state-run gazprom .
a private consortium is to build the eu pipeline for around 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- .
the nabucco project has to be run as a business whereas gazprom can afford massive losses .
eu members disagree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia and turkey signed the south stream pipeline deal on august 6 european states such as greece , italy , bulgaria and austria as well as turkey are partners in both pipeline projects .
this indicates two things : it 's everyone for himself when it comes to energy security .
a uniform european approach is not expected and is also not desired , for energy provision falls in the jurisdiction of the member states .
a consistent energy policy in the european union is worlds away compared to the largest producer , russia , because the 27 member states can not agree on what they really want .
after their experiences as part of the former east bloc , the baltic states and poland , the czech republic and slovakia want to avoid any dependence on russia .
the largest group in the eu , including germany and france , are compliant customers who know that they will be dependent on the russian gas stopcock for a long time to come .
in principle , it is only right that the north stream in the baltic and south stream and nabucco in the south should provide alternatives to the present supply lines through ukraine and belarus .
above all , the loser will at first be ukraine which will be deprived of its status as an important transit country to turkey .
the caucasus question the caucasus plays a key role in the great gas debate .
important gas and oil pipelines , built with the help of the us , run through georgia which is in a long-term dispute with russia .
neither south stream nor nabucco can operate properly without a stable georgia , azerbaijan and armenia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nabucco has to be run as a business whereas gazprom can afford massive losses and even more important than the question of the pipeline routes is the question of the gas supplier .

schalke striker kevin kuranyi scored in both halves to secure a 2-1 victory over newly-promoted nuremberg . playing without strikers miroslav klose and luca toni , as well as defender martin demichelis , the bavarians managed a tie at hoffenheim . it looked as though the hosts had scored in the 11th minute with a header from josip simunic , but referees judged it had been palmed out of the goal by keeper michael rensing . bayern took the lead against the run of play through ivica olic in the 25th minute before chinedu obasi evened the score with a low drive set up by vedad ibisevic . " the team forgot to play football in the first half , " said bayern manager louis van gaal .
" in the second , they were flat , but we did not use our chances . " magath wins again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : felix magath returned to his winning ways with his new club schalke striker kevin kuranyi scored in both halves to secure a 2-1 victory over newly-promoted nuremberg . the win marked a successful debut for coach felix magath , who led vfl wolfsburg to the championship last season . kuranyi , who has had his troubles over the past few years , struck in the 36th minute after a pass from jefferson farfan .
he added a second goal five minutes into the second half by firing in a cross from georgian levan kenia . slovak striker marek mintal managed to get one back two minutes before time but nuremberg had to settle for the loss . " i am glad to have won this match but i am not particularly happy , " magath said .
" our game was not good .
after the 1-0 and the 2-0 we should have controlled it much better . " frankfurt stun bremen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt wins a wild one werder bremen , hosting eintracht frankfurt , were stunned by a 3-2 loss . frankfurt striker yannis amanatidis hit twice only to see bremen fight back before the break .
but the visitors got an all-important third when czech striker martin fenin caught the bremen defense napping to tap in at close range at the 71st minute . cologne was defeated by borussia dortmund with a goal from marvin matip in the 75th minute .
elsewhere , hertha berlin managed a 1-0 win over hanover 96 . in mainz , an early header from tim hoogland put the home side ahead , and a penalty save by goalkeeper heinz mueller on a kick from tranquillo barnetta gave the hosts a bit of hope .
but leverkusen regrouped and barnetta fed eren derdiyok and stefan kiessling for a pair of goals late in the first half .
but it was mainz 's daniel gunkel who managed to salvage a draw with a late freekick . champions start with a win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's brazilian grafite netted for his club on friday night , reigning champions wolfsburg started their season with a 2-0 win against visitors stuttgart . new wolfsburg coach armin veh made just one change from the side preferred by his predecessor felix magath last season with karim ziani starting in the midfield behind edin dzeko and grafite . stuttgart coach markus babbel gave new signings alexander hleb and pavel pogrebnyak an immediate chance to see what they could do . the two sides showed plenty of energy in the first half and stuttgart had some opportunities with sami khedira seeing a shot saved on the line by wolfsburg goalkeeper diego benaglio and pogrebnyak also having a header saved , but by the half-time whistle , neither side had hit the back of the net . wolfsburg , however , was the better team throughout and the deadlock was broken in the 71st minute by zvjezdan misimovic with a curled left-footed shot from the edge of the box .
just 11 minutes later , the freshly-crowned german footballer of the year , grafite , managed to get the clincher by shrugging off a defender and slotting a shot past keeper jens lehmann . champions wolfsburg wolfsburg went undefeated at home last season with 16 wins and a draw en route to a surprise first national title ahead of bayern munich and stuttgart . grafite was last season 's bundesliga top scorer knotching up 28 goals to his credit . grafite summed up tonight 's opening victory thus : " it was a nice evening for the club and for myself .

under existing law , german police are responsible for hostage situations . jung said in an interview with german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag that under existing law , police were responsible for hostage situations , but that it was not always possible for the police force to arrive quickly enough at a crime scene . the minister cited the recent episode involving german container ship the hansa stavanger , which was hijacked with 24 crew on board , including five germans , off the coast of somalia four months ago . he said that in the time it took a german police team to deploy to the horn of africa the situation had worsened .
only five pirates had boarded the ship initially , but their numbers eventually swelled to around 35 , he noted . " we should consider a constitutional amendment to allow the armed forces access to situations when the police can not act , such as when the police are not at the scene of an incident , " jung told the newspaper . " i want to put this on the agenda again at the latest when the parliamentary elections are over , " he added .
germans go to the polls to elect a new parliament in september . jung said the amendment should not only apply to international operations but also to certain domestic cases in which the german armed forces were better suited to handle a situation . the hansa stavanger was eventually released four months after being captured when the hamburg-based shipping company that owns the ship paid a 1.9-million-euro ransom . dfm / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

moldova 's communist party had held a majority in the national legislature for more than a decade , but was soundly defeated by the pro-europe opposition in the july poll .
infotag is reporting that the new coalition will be called " for european integration " -lrb- fei -rrb- , and that leaders of the alliance have named fighting corruption , better relations with the eu , a free and open media , and pulling moldova 's economy out of a deep recession as top priorities .
discussions on cabinet post division between the two liberal parties and the smaller democratic party of moldova , and our moldova party , were still in progress , according to a fei statement .
a top order of business will be election of a new president , requiring a 61-vote majority in the legislature by constitutional stature ; forcing the fei parties to seek at least 8 communist mps to support a fei candidate for the presidency .
current moldovan president vladimir voronin , who is also head of moldova 's communist party , said in a statement last week the communists " were willing to talk " with the fei alliance on a jointly- acceptable presidential candidate .

the april elections also sparked mass protests against results giving the communists a strong win , and near total control of parliament .
street battles between anti-communist demonstrators and police in the moldovan capital chisinau left one dead , hundreds injured , and the parliament and presidential residence badly damaged by fire .
eu officials shortly after the repeat vote in late july called on the pro- and anti-communist wings of moldova 's political arena to lay aside their differences , and form a new ruling coalition .
" the immediate priority is to put in place a government , and i urge all the political parties to engage in open and constructive dialogue , " eu foreign affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said last week .
moldova may not hold any more parliamentary elections in 2009 , but the nation 's supreme court ruled in july that if the legislature fails to elect a president by january 2010 another nation-wide vote to select mps - the third in ten months - would be possible. mrm / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

moldova 's communist party had held a majority in the national legislature for more than a decade , but was soundly defeated by the pro-europe opposition in the july poll .
infotag is reporting that the new coalition will be called " for european integration " -lrb- fei -rrb- , and that leaders of the alliance have named fighting corruption , better relations with the eu , a free and open media , and pulling moldova 's economy out of a deep recession as top priorities .
discussions on cabinet post division between the two liberal parties and the smaller democratic party of moldova , and our moldova party , were still in progress , according to a fei statement .
a top order of business will be election of a new president , requiring a 61-vote majority in the legislature by constitutional stature ; forcing the fei parties to seek at least 8 communist mps to support a fei candidate for the presidency .
current moldovan president vladimir voronin , who is also head of moldova 's communist party , said in a statement last week the communists " were willing to talk " with the fei alliance on a jointly- acceptable presidential candidate .
rioting in the streets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : original parliamentary elections back in april sparked mass protest unwillingness by fei parties to accept a communist candidate for president in the wake of april elections produced a hung parliament , forcing new elections in july .
the april elections also sparked mass protests against results giving the communists a strong win , and near total control of parliament .
street battles between anti-communist demonstrators and police in the moldovan capital chisinau left one dead , hundreds injured , and the parliament and presidential residence badly damaged by fire .
eu officials shortly after the repeat vote in late july called on the pro- and anti-communist wings of moldova 's political arena to lay aside their differences , and form a new ruling coalition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 09.08.2009 russia and the great natural gas balancing act großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia hopes to be able to save on gas use at home so that they can send more of it abroad russia controls the world 's largest gas reserves , but a combination of factors , including power production , climate change and logistics , are keeping it from reaping the greatest benefits . russia is running out of natural gas - or at least it 's running out of easily accessible natural gas .
according to the oil and gas journal 's 2008 survey , russia holds the world 's largest natural gas reserves , with 1,680 trillion cubic feet -lrb- 47.5 trillion cubic meters -rrb- , which is nearly twice the reserves in the next largest country , iran .
most of the known reserves , roughly 80 percent , are located in western siberia and are concentrated in giant or super-giant gas fields .
since the early 1970s , the amount of new fields discovered has been on the decline and output from the country 's core super-giant fields has been steadily decreasing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , left , successfully convinced erdogan to agree to allow russia access to turkish territorial waters according to claudia kemfert , director of the energy , transportation and environment at the german institute for economic research , there are new fields that potentially could be tapped , but they pose specific problems .
massive reserves are said to exist to the northwest of russia 's northern border , but those fields lie under the barents sea , which is covered in ice for much of the year .
fields further to the east also exist , but there the problem becomes one of transport .
most of russia 's gas customers are in europe , on the other side of the continent .
the second dilemma is currently being taken care of by a set of pipelines that will supply europe with gas , known as south stream and nord stream .
south stream will run from the beregovaya compressor station at dzhubga on the russia 's black sea coast to bulgaria 's city of varna , and would eventually supply gas to eastern europe and italy and austria .
russian prime minister vladimir putin was in ankara on thursday to persuade his turkish counterpart , recep tayyip erdogan , to sign up to the agreement .
the main reason behind south stream is russia 's desire to bypass ukraine - which is the transit route for almost 80 percent of russian gas to europe - at all costs .
the only way to do that is to route the pipeline through turkish territorial waters .
the other pipeline , nord stream , is currently being laid between russia and germany across the baltic sea , entering swedish , finnish and danish territorial waters .
germany is russia 's biggest gas customer in the eu and its second-biggest overall , after ukraine , which has had a notoriously rocky relationship with moscow since becoming independent following the fall of the soviet union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nord stream pipeline will connect russia directly with germany , its biggest european customer up until now , russia has had no way of turning off the gas to ukraine without also depriving its european customers .
these two pipelines make the issue moot and will have the effect of completely isolating kiev , at least when it comes to gas and energy economics .
switching to coal russia has had a long and difficult relationship with its gas and oil supplies .
according to the united states department of energy statistics , a slight majority , or 55 percent , of russian power stations run on natural gas , which by law has to be supplied at a severely reduced rate .
during the 1990s , when post-soviet russia was struggling to get back on its feet , the country found itself with an excess of natural gas on their hands .
that excess was pawned off on other countries and , due to lengthy agreements , will continue to be so for the foreseeable future .
this puts russia in a tricky position .
by forcing national gas company gazprom to sell gas to power plants at a reduced rate , the government is actually missing out on millions of dollars in tax money .
gazprom is russia 's largest tax payer , contributing up to 25 percent of the total amount added to the coffers each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia gets 55 percent of its energy from natural gas , which is supplied to power plants at a reduced cost but russia also relies on natural gas for 55 percent of its energy needs .
the country is home to the world 's second-largest coal reserves , after the united states , but after restructuring over the last couple of years , 80 percent of coal production in the country comes from independent producers .
this makes russia the only place in the world where it 's cheaper to run power plants on gas than coal , so they are reluctant to turn to the black stuff .
any economist would tell you that the smart thing for russia to do would be to switch all the gas-fired power plants to coal , and then send all that unused gas to europe at regular market prices . however , coal-fired power plants emit enormous amounts of carbon dioxide into the environment , and as a signatory to the kytoto protocol , russia is obligated to reduce its carbon output .
so russia has started to go another way and has begun to lean a little on renewable energy like hydropower .
according to alexi kokorin , climate expert at the russian branch or the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , this is not a move to be more climate friendly , but only to look more climate friendly .
kokorin said that russian gas fields are being pushed further and further into the arctic , making it more difficult and more expensive to extract .
" russia does n't have the technology to extract the gas and it 's becoming more and more expensive to get enough gas to send to europe and china , therefore the government has decided that they have to save gas in the country , " he said .
upcoming climate treaty in a recently released g8 climate scorecard , russia was listed in seventh place , only beating out canada , which is quite significant since both countries are kyoto signatories .
this comes just five months ahead of a crucial meeting in copenhagen which is intended to hammer out a new climate agreement .
government officials begin another round of climate talks in bonn on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international feathers were ruffled two years ago when a russian submarine planted a flag on the sea floor of the north pole given its geographical location , the argument could be made that russia would be one of the very few countries that would benefit from global warming melting huge swaths of ice , providing better access to oil and gas reserves buried deep beneath arctic waters .
kokorin both agrees and disagrees with the assessment .
yes , he admitted , less ice would make extraction of gas and oil from the barents sea much easier .
however , melting permafrost would make it more difficult and expensive to extract current known reserves in siberia .
claudia kemfert says there are many voices within russia , especially scientists , saying that climate change is positive for russia and that they would benefit because the ice would decrease and then the access would be improved .
russia signed the kyoto protocol , said kemfert , because in the mid-90s it was still an emerging nation trying to get back on its feet after the fall of the soviet union .
the russians were treated much the same way as india and china are being treated in relation to the copenhagen agreement .
now that they 're among the world eight richest nations , they ca n't exactly claim that they need to be handled with kid gloves .
there is also the small matter of who actually owns the gas and oil reserves in the arctic .
with just over 24,000 kilometers -lrb- 15,000 miles -rrb- of arctic coastline , russia certainly has a claim .
but so do the united states , canada , norway , and denmark .
rough estimates put the amount of oil and gas in the arctic at 20 percent of the total global reserves on the planet .
with that kind of potential , said kemfert , it wo n't matter to russia if the ice is there or not .
" of course they 'll try and sell it to the rest of the world , even if the ice is there , " she said .
" it 's much more expensive to drill into the sea with the ice , but they 've already been doing it in parts of siberia . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , left , successfully convinced erdogan to agree to allow russia access to turkish territorial waters according to claudia kemfert , director of the energy , transportation and environment at the german institute for economic research , there are new fields that potentially could be tapped , but they pose specific problems .
massive reserves are said to exist to the northwest of russia 's northern border , but those fields lie under the barents sea , which is covered in ice for much of the year .
fields further to the east also exist , but there the problem becomes one of transport .
most of russia 's gas customers are in europe , on the other side of the continent .
the second dilemma is currently being taken care of by a set of pipelines that will supply europe with gas , known as south stream and nord stream .
south stream will run from the beregovaya compressor station at dzhubga on the russia 's black sea coast to bulgaria 's city of varna , and would eventually supply gas to eastern europe and italy and austria .
russian prime minister vladimir putin was in ankara on thursday to persuade his turkish counterpart , recep tayyip erdogan , to sign up to the agreement .
the main reason behind south stream is russia 's desire to bypass ukraine - which is the transit route for almost 80 percent of russian gas to europe - at all costs .
the only way to do that is to route the pipeline through turkish territorial waters .
the other pipeline , nord stream , is currently being laid between russia and germany across the baltic sea , entering swedish , finnish and danish territorial waters .
germany is russia 's biggest gas customer in the eu and its second-biggest overall , after ukraine , which has had a notoriously rocky relationship with moscow since becoming independent following the fall of the soviet union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nord stream pipeline will connect russia directly with germany , its biggest european customer up until now , russia has had no way of turning off the gas to ukraine without also depriving its european customers .
these two pipelines make the issue moot and will have the effect of completely isolating kiev , at least when it comes to gas and energy economics .
switching to coal russia has had a long and difficult relationship with its gas and oil supplies .
according to the united states department of energy statistics , a slight majority , or 55 percent , of russian power stations run on natural gas , which by law has to be supplied at a severely reduced rate .
during the 1990s , when post-soviet russia was struggling to get back on its feet , the country found itself with an excess of natural gas on their hands .
that excess was pawned off on other countries and , due to lengthy agreements , will continue to be so for the foreseeable future .
this puts russia in a tricky position .
by forcing national gas company gazprom to sell gas to power plants at a reduced rate , the government is actually missing out on millions of dollars in tax money .
gazprom is russia 's largest tax payer , contributing up to 25 percent of the total amount added to the coffers each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia gets 55 percent of its energy from natural gas , which is supplied to power plants at a reduced cost but russia also relies on natural gas for 55 percent of its energy needs .
the country is home to the world 's second-largest coal reserves , after the united states , but after restructuring over the last couple of years , 80 percent of coal production in the country comes from independent producers .
this makes russia the only place in the world where it 's cheaper to run power plants on gas than coal , so they are reluctant to turn to the black stuff .
any economist would tell you that the smart thing for russia to do would be to switch all the gas-fired power plants to coal , and then send all that unused gas to europe at regular market prices . however , coal-fired power plants emit enormous amounts of carbon dioxide into the environment , and as a signatory to the kytoto protocol , russia is obligated to reduce its carbon output .
so russia has started to go another way and has begun to lean a little on renewable energy like hydropower .
according to alexi kokorin , climate expert at the russian branch or the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , this is not a move to be more climate friendly , but only to look more climate friendly .
kokorin said that russian gas fields are being pushed further and further into the arctic , making it more difficult and more expensive to extract .
" russia does n't have the technology to extract the gas and it 's becoming more and more expensive to get enough gas to send to europe and china , therefore the government has decided that they have to save gas in the country , " he said .
upcoming climate treaty in a recently released g8 climate scorecard , russia was listed in seventh place , only beating out canada , which is quite significant since both countries are kyoto signatories .
this comes just five months ahead of a crucial meeting in copenhagen which is intended to hammer out a new climate agreement .
government officials begin another round of climate talks in bonn on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international feathers were ruffled two years ago when a russian submarine planted a flag on the sea floor of the north pole given its geographical location , the argument could be made that russia would be one of the very few countries that would benefit from global warming melting huge swaths of ice , providing better access to oil and gas reserves buried deep beneath arctic waters .
kokorin both agrees and disagrees with the assessment .
yes , he admitted , less ice would make extraction of gas and oil from the barents sea much easier .
however , melting permafrost would make it more difficult and expensive to extract current known reserves in siberia .
claudia kemfert says there are many voices within russia , especially scientists , saying that climate change is positive for russia and that they would benefit because the ice would decrease and then the access would be improved .
russia signed the kyoto protocol , said kemfert , because in the mid-90s it was still an emerging nation trying to get back on its feet after the fall of the soviet union .
the russians were treated much the same way as india and china are being treated in relation to the copenhagen agreement .
now that they 're among the world eight richest nations , they ca n't exactly claim that they need to be handled with kid gloves .
there is also the small matter of who actually owns the gas and oil reserves in the arctic .
with just over 24,000 kilometers -lrb- 15,000 miles -rrb- of arctic coastline , russia certainly has a claim .
but so do the united states , canada , norway , and denmark .
rough estimates put the amount of oil and gas in the arctic at 20 percent of the total global reserves on the planet .
with that kind of potential , said kemfert , it wo n't matter to russia if the ice is there or not .
" of course they 'll try and sell it to the rest of the world , even if the ice is there , " she said .
" it 's much more expensive to drill into the sea with the ice , but they 've already been doing it in parts of siberia . "

according to the oil and gas journal 's 2008 survey , russia holds the world 's largest natural gas reserves , with 1,680 trillion cubic feet -lrb- 47.5 trillion cubic meters -rrb- , which is nearly twice the reserves in the next largest country , iran .

the russian project is ahead at the moment . russia and europe are heading for a grim race in the construction of a gas pipeline under the black sea .
or so it would appear after the signing of a contract between russian prime minister vladimir putin and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
there 's a need for both the russian south stream as well as the european nabucco pipeline , because gas consumption in europe will increase in the next decade .
however , the russian project is ahead at the moment , if you consider it from a political and business point of view .
the russians will be the first to begin construction and they can probably more easily afford the estimated 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- costs with their state-run gazprom .
a private consortium is to build the eu pipeline for around 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- .

this indicates two things : it 's everyone for himself when it comes to energy security .
a uniform european approach is not expected and is also not desired , for energy provision falls in the jurisdiction of the member states .

the largest group in the eu , including germany and france , are compliant customers who know that they will be dependent on the russian gas stopcock for a long time to come .
in principle , it is only right that the north stream in the baltic and south stream and nabucco in the south should provide alternatives to the present supply lines through ukraine and belarus .
above all , the loser will at first be ukraine which will be deprived of its status as an important transit country to turkey .
the caucasus question the caucasus plays a key role in the great gas debate .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nabucco has to be run as a business whereas gazprom can afford massive losses and even more important than the question of the pipeline routes is the question of the gas supplier .
who should supply the gas for the pipelines ?
russia and the eu are endeavoring to persuade the central asian states , especially turkmenistan , iraq and iran to be the suppliers .
that 's where the actual competition is .
russia does not produce enough from its own oil fields to be able to fulfill the contracts and thus needs new sources .
the eu is also endeavoring to strengthen deliveries from the mediterranean area and norway but here too new methods of conveyance are needed .

according to the oil and gas journal 's 2008 survey , russia holds the world 's largest natural gas reserves , with 1,680 trillion cubic feet -lrb- 47.5 trillion cubic meters -rrb- , which is nearly twice the reserves in the next largest country , iran .
most of the known reserves , roughly 80 percent , are located in western siberia and are concentrated in giant or super-giant gas fields .
since the early 1970s , the amount of new fields discovered has been on the decline and output from the country 's core super-giant fields has been steadily decreasing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , left , successfully convinced erdogan to agree to allow russia access to turkish territorial waters according to claudia kemfert , director of the energy , transportation and environment at the german institute for economic research , there are new fields that potentially could be tapped , but they pose specific problems .
massive reserves are said to exist to the northwest of russia 's northern border , but those fields lie under the barents sea , which is covered in ice for much of the year .
fields further to the east also exist , but there the problem becomes one of transport .
most of russia 's gas customers are in europe , on the other side of the continent .
the second dilemma is currently being taken care of by a set of pipelines that will supply europe with gas , known as south stream and nord stream .
south stream will run from the beregovaya compressor station at dzhubga on the russia 's black sea coast to bulgaria 's city of varna , and would eventually supply gas to eastern europe and italy and austria .
russian prime minister vladimir putin was in ankara on thursday to persuade his turkish counterpart , recep tayyip erdogan , to sign up to the agreement .
the main reason behind south stream is russia 's desire to bypass ukraine - which is the transit route for almost 80 percent of russian gas to europe - at all costs .
the only way to do that is to route the pipeline through turkish territorial waters .
the other pipeline , nord stream , is currently being laid between russia and germany across the baltic sea , entering swedish , finnish and danish territorial waters .
germany is russia 's biggest gas customer in the eu and its second-biggest overall , after ukraine , which has had a notoriously rocky relationship with moscow since becoming independent following the fall of the soviet union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nord stream pipeline will connect russia directly with germany , its biggest european customer up until now , russia has had no way of turning off the gas to ukraine without also depriving its european customers .
these two pipelines make the issue moot and will have the effect of completely isolating kiev , at least when it comes to gas and energy economics .
switching to coal russia has had a long and difficult relationship with its gas and oil supplies .
according to the united states department of energy statistics , a slight majority , or 55 percent , of russian power stations run on natural gas , which by law has to be supplied at a severely reduced rate .
during the 1990s , when post-soviet russia was struggling to get back on its feet , the country found itself with an excess of natural gas on their hands .
that excess was pawned off on other countries and , due to lengthy agreements , will continue to be so for the foreseeable future .
this puts russia in a tricky position .
by forcing national gas company gazprom to sell gas to power plants at a reduced rate , the government is actually missing out on millions of dollars in tax money .
gazprom is russia 's largest tax payer , contributing up to 25 percent of the total amount added to the coffers each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia gets 55 percent of its energy from natural gas , which is supplied to power plants at a reduced cost but russia also relies on natural gas for 55 percent of its energy needs .
the country is home to the world 's second-largest coal reserves , after the united states , but after restructuring over the last couple of years , 80 percent of coal production in the country comes from independent producers .
this makes russia the only place in the world where it 's cheaper to run power plants on gas than coal , so they are reluctant to turn to the black stuff .
any economist would tell you that the smart thing for russia to do would be to switch all the gas-fired power plants to coal , and then send all that unused gas to europe at regular market prices . however , coal-fired power plants emit enormous amounts of carbon dioxide into the environment , and as a signatory to the kytoto protocol , russia is obligated to reduce its carbon output .
so russia has started to go another way and has begun to lean a little on renewable energy like hydropower .
according to alexi kokorin , climate expert at the russian branch or the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , this is not a move to be more climate friendly , but only to look more climate friendly .
kokorin said that russian gas fields are being pushed further and further into the arctic , making it more difficult and more expensive to extract .
" russia does n't have the technology to extract the gas and it 's becoming more and more expensive to get enough gas to send to europe and china , therefore the government has decided that they have to save gas in the country , " he said .
upcoming climate treaty in a recently released g8 climate scorecard , russia was listed in seventh place , only beating out canada , which is quite significant since both countries are kyoto signatories .
this comes just five months ahead of a crucial meeting in copenhagen which is intended to hammer out a new climate agreement .
government officials begin another round of climate talks in bonn on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international feathers were ruffled two years ago when a russian submarine planted a flag on the sea floor of the north pole given its geographical location , the argument could be made that russia would be one of the very few countries that would benefit from global warming melting huge swaths of ice , providing better access to oil and gas reserves buried deep beneath arctic waters .
kokorin both agrees and disagrees with the assessment .
yes , he admitted , less ice would make extraction of gas and oil from the barents sea much easier .
however , melting permafrost would make it more difficult and expensive to extract current known reserves in siberia .
claudia kemfert says there are many voices within russia , especially scientists , saying that climate change is positive for russia and that they would benefit because the ice would decrease and then the access would be improved .
russia signed the kyoto protocol , said kemfert , because in the mid-90s it was still an emerging nation trying to get back on its feet after the fall of the soviet union .
the russians were treated much the same way as india and china are being treated in relation to the copenhagen agreement .
now that they 're among the world eight richest nations , they ca n't exactly claim that they need to be handled with kid gloves .
there is also the small matter of who actually owns the gas and oil reserves in the arctic .
with just over 24,000 kilometers -lrb- 15,000 miles -rrb- of arctic coastline , russia certainly has a claim .
but so do the united states , canada , norway , and denmark .
rough estimates put the amount of oil and gas in the arctic at 20 percent of the total global reserves on the planet .
with that kind of potential , said kemfert , it wo n't matter to russia if the ice is there or not .
" of course they 'll try and sell it to the rest of the world , even if the ice is there , " she said .
" it 's much more expensive to drill into the sea with the ice , but they 've already been doing it in parts of siberia . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 09.08.2009 russia and the great natural gas balancing act großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia hopes to be able to save on gas use at home so that they can send more of it abroad russia controls the world 's largest gas reserves , but a combination of factors , including power production , climate change and logistics , are keeping it from reaping the greatest benefits . russia is running out of natural gas - or at least it 's running out of easily accessible natural gas .
according to the oil and gas journal 's 2008 survey , russia holds the world 's largest natural gas reserves , with 1,680 trillion cubic feet -lrb- 47.5 trillion cubic meters -rrb- , which is nearly twice the reserves in the next largest country , iran .
most of the known reserves , roughly 80 percent , are located in western siberia and are concentrated in giant or super-giant gas fields .
since the early 1970s , the amount of new fields discovered has been on the decline and output from the country 's core super-giant fields has been steadily decreasing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , left , successfully convinced erdogan to agree to allow russia access to turkish territorial waters according to claudia kemfert , director of the energy , transportation and environment at the german institute for economic research , there are new fields that potentially could be tapped , but they pose specific problems .
massive reserves are said to exist to the northwest of russia 's northern border , but those fields lie under the barents sea , which is covered in ice for much of the year .
fields further to the east also exist , but there the problem becomes one of transport .
most of russia 's gas customers are in europe , on the other side of the continent .
the second dilemma is currently being taken care of by a set of pipelines that will supply europe with gas , known as south stream and nord stream .
south stream will run from the beregovaya compressor station at dzhubga on the russia 's black sea coast to bulgaria 's city of varna , and would eventually supply gas to eastern europe and italy and austria .
russian prime minister vladimir putin was in ankara on thursday to persuade his turkish counterpart , recep tayyip erdogan , to sign up to the agreement .
the main reason behind south stream is russia 's desire to bypass ukraine - which is the transit route for almost 80 percent of russian gas to europe - at all costs .
the only way to do that is to route the pipeline through turkish territorial waters .
the other pipeline , nord stream , is currently being laid between russia and germany across the baltic sea , entering swedish , finnish and danish territorial waters .
germany is russia 's biggest gas customer in the eu and its second-biggest overall , after ukraine , which has had a notoriously rocky relationship with moscow since becoming independent following the fall of the soviet union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nord stream pipeline will connect russia directly with germany , its biggest european customer up until now , russia has had no way of turning off the gas to ukraine without also depriving its european customers .
these two pipelines make the issue moot and will have the effect of completely isolating kiev , at least when it comes to gas and energy economics .
switching to coal russia has had a long and difficult relationship with its gas and oil supplies .
according to the united states department of energy statistics , a slight majority , or 55 percent , of russian power stations run on natural gas , which by law has to be supplied at a severely reduced rate .
during the 1990s , when post-soviet russia was struggling to get back on its feet , the country found itself with an excess of natural gas on their hands .
that excess was pawned off on other countries and , due to lengthy agreements , will continue to be so for the foreseeable future .
this puts russia in a tricky position .
by forcing national gas company gazprom to sell gas to power plants at a reduced rate , the government is actually missing out on millions of dollars in tax money .
gazprom is russia 's largest tax payer , contributing up to 25 percent of the total amount added to the coffers each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia gets 55 percent of its energy from natural gas , which is supplied to power plants at a reduced cost but russia also relies on natural gas for 55 percent of its energy needs .
the country is home to the world 's second-largest coal reserves , after the united states , but after restructuring over the last couple of years , 80 percent of coal production in the country comes from independent producers .
this makes russia the only place in the world where it 's cheaper to run power plants on gas than coal , so they are reluctant to turn to the black stuff .
any economist would tell you that the smart thing for russia to do would be to switch all the gas-fired power plants to coal , and then send all that unused gas to europe at regular market prices . however , coal-fired power plants emit enormous amounts of carbon dioxide into the environment , and as a signatory to the kytoto protocol , russia is obligated to reduce its carbon output .
so russia has started to go another way and has begun to lean a little on renewable energy like hydropower .
according to alexi kokorin , climate expert at the russian branch or the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , this is not a move to be more climate friendly , but only to look more climate friendly .
kokorin said that russian gas fields are being pushed further and further into the arctic , making it more difficult and more expensive to extract .
" russia does n't have the technology to extract the gas and it 's becoming more and more expensive to get enough gas to send to europe and china , therefore the government has decided that they have to save gas in the country , " he said .
upcoming climate treaty in a recently released g8 climate scorecard , russia was listed in seventh place , only beating out canada , which is quite significant since both countries are kyoto signatories .
this comes just five months ahead of a crucial meeting in copenhagen which is intended to hammer out a new climate agreement .
government officials begin another round of climate talks in bonn on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international feathers were ruffled two years ago when a russian submarine planted a flag on the sea floor of the north pole given its geographical location , the argument could be made that russia would be one of the very few countries that would benefit from global warming melting huge swaths of ice , providing better access to oil and gas reserves buried deep beneath arctic waters .
kokorin both agrees and disagrees with the assessment .
yes , he admitted , less ice would make extraction of gas and oil from the barents sea much easier .
however , melting permafrost would make it more difficult and expensive to extract current known reserves in siberia .
claudia kemfert says there are many voices within russia , especially scientists , saying that climate change is positive for russia and that they would benefit because the ice would decrease and then the access would be improved .
russia signed the kyoto protocol , said kemfert , because in the mid-90s it was still an emerging nation trying to get back on its feet after the fall of the soviet union .
the russians were treated much the same way as india and china are being treated in relation to the copenhagen agreement .
now that they 're among the world eight richest nations , they ca n't exactly claim that they need to be handled with kid gloves .
there is also the small matter of who actually owns the gas and oil reserves in the arctic .
with just over 24,000 kilometers -lrb- 15,000 miles -rrb- of arctic coastline , russia certainly has a claim .
but so do the united states , canada , norway , and denmark .
rough estimates put the amount of oil and gas in the arctic at 20 percent of the total global reserves on the planet .
with that kind of potential , said kemfert , it wo n't matter to russia if the ice is there or not .
" of course they 'll try and sell it to the rest of the world , even if the ice is there , " she said .
" it 's much more expensive to drill into the sea with the ice , but they 've already been doing it in parts of siberia . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 09.08.2009 russia and the great natural gas balancing act großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia hopes to be able to save on gas use at home so that they can send more of it abroad russia controls the world 's largest gas reserves , but a combination of factors , including power production , climate change and logistics , are keeping it from reaping the greatest benefits . russia is running out of natural gas - or at least it 's running out of easily accessible natural gas .
according to the oil and gas journal 's 2008 survey , russia holds the world 's largest natural gas reserves , with 1,680 trillion cubic feet -lrb- 47.5 trillion cubic meters -rrb- , which is nearly twice the reserves in the next largest country , iran .
most of the known reserves , roughly 80 percent , are located in western siberia and are concentrated in giant or super-giant gas fields .
since the early 1970s , the amount of new fields discovered has been on the decline and output from the country 's core super-giant fields has been steadily decreasing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , left , successfully convinced erdogan to agree to allow russia access to turkish territorial waters according to claudia kemfert , director of the energy , transportation and environment at the german institute for economic research , there are new fields that potentially could be tapped , but they pose specific problems .
massive reserves are said to exist to the northwest of russia 's northern border , but those fields lie under the barents sea , which is covered in ice for much of the year .
fields further to the east also exist , but there the problem becomes one of transport .
most of russia 's gas customers are in europe , on the other side of the continent .
the second dilemma is currently being taken care of by a set of pipelines that will supply europe with gas , known as south stream and nord stream .
south stream will run from the beregovaya compressor station at dzhubga on the russia 's black sea coast to bulgaria 's city of varna , and would eventually supply gas to eastern europe and italy and austria .
russian prime minister vladimir putin was in ankara on thursday to persuade his turkish counterpart , recep tayyip erdogan , to sign up to the agreement .
the main reason behind south stream is russia 's desire to bypass ukraine - which is the transit route for almost 80 percent of russian gas to europe - at all costs .
the only way to do that is to route the pipeline through turkish territorial waters .
the other pipeline , nord stream , is currently being laid between russia and germany across the baltic sea , entering swedish , finnish and danish territorial waters .
germany is russia 's biggest gas customer in the eu and its second-biggest overall , after ukraine , which has had a notoriously rocky relationship with moscow since becoming independent following the fall of the soviet union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nord stream pipeline will connect russia directly with germany , its biggest european customer up until now , russia has had no way of turning off the gas to ukraine without also depriving its european customers .
these two pipelines make the issue moot and will have the effect of completely isolating kiev , at least when it comes to gas and energy economics .
switching to coal russia has had a long and difficult relationship with its gas and oil supplies .
according to the united states department of energy statistics , a slight majority , or 55 percent , of russian power stations run on natural gas , which by law has to be supplied at a severely reduced rate .
during the 1990s , when post-soviet russia was struggling to get back on its feet , the country found itself with an excess of natural gas on their hands .
that excess was pawned off on other countries and , due to lengthy agreements , will continue to be so for the foreseeable future .
this puts russia in a tricky position .
by forcing national gas company gazprom to sell gas to power plants at a reduced rate , the government is actually missing out on millions of dollars in tax money .
gazprom is russia 's largest tax payer , contributing up to 25 percent of the total amount added to the coffers each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia gets 55 percent of its energy from natural gas , which is supplied to power plants at a reduced cost but russia also relies on natural gas for 55 percent of its energy needs .
the country is home to the world 's second-largest coal reserves , after the united states , but after restructuring over the last couple of years , 80 percent of coal production in the country comes from independent producers .
this makes russia the only place in the world where it 's cheaper to run power plants on gas than coal , so they are reluctant to turn to the black stuff .
any economist would tell you that the smart thing for russia to do would be to switch all the gas-fired power plants to coal , and then send all that unused gas to europe at regular market prices . however , coal-fired power plants emit enormous amounts of carbon dioxide into the environment , and as a signatory to the kytoto protocol , russia is obligated to reduce its carbon output .
so russia has started to go another way and has begun to lean a little on renewable energy like hydropower .
according to alexi kokorin , climate expert at the russian branch or the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , this is not a move to be more climate friendly , but only to look more climate friendly .
kokorin said that russian gas fields are being pushed further and further into the arctic , making it more difficult and more expensive to extract .
" russia does n't have the technology to extract the gas and it 's becoming more and more expensive to get enough gas to send to europe and china , therefore the government has decided that they have to save gas in the country , " he said .
upcoming climate treaty in a recently released g8 climate scorecard , russia was listed in seventh place , only beating out canada , which is quite significant since both countries are kyoto signatories .
this comes just five months ahead of a crucial meeting in copenhagen which is intended to hammer out a new climate agreement .
government officials begin another round of climate talks in bonn on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international feathers were ruffled two years ago when a russian submarine planted a flag on the sea floor of the north pole given its geographical location , the argument could be made that russia would be one of the very few countries that would benefit from global warming melting huge swaths of ice , providing better access to oil and gas reserves buried deep beneath arctic waters .
kokorin both agrees and disagrees with the assessment .
yes , he admitted , less ice would make extraction of gas and oil from the barents sea much easier .
however , melting permafrost would make it more difficult and expensive to extract current known reserves in siberia .
claudia kemfert says there are many voices within russia , especially scientists , saying that climate change is positive for russia and that they would benefit because the ice would decrease and then the access would be improved .
russia signed the kyoto protocol , said kemfert , because in the mid-90s it was still an emerging nation trying to get back on its feet after the fall of the soviet union .
the russians were treated much the same way as india and china are being treated in relation to the copenhagen agreement .
now that they 're among the world eight richest nations , they ca n't exactly claim that they need to be handled with kid gloves .
there is also the small matter of who actually owns the gas and oil reserves in the arctic .
with just over 24,000 kilometers -lrb- 15,000 miles -rrb- of arctic coastline , russia certainly has a claim .
but so do the united states , canada , norway , and denmark .
rough estimates put the amount of oil and gas in the arctic at 20 percent of the total global reserves on the planet .
with that kind of potential , said kemfert , it wo n't matter to russia if the ice is there or not .
" of course they 'll try and sell it to the rest of the world , even if the ice is there , " she said .
" it 's much more expensive to drill into the sea with the ice , but they 've already been doing it in parts of siberia . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 09.08.2009 russia and the great natural gas balancing act großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia hopes to be able to save on gas use at home so that they can send more of it abroad russia controls the world 's largest gas reserves , but a combination of factors , including power production , climate change and logistics , are keeping it from reaping the greatest benefits . russia is running out of natural gas - or at least it 's running out of easily accessible natural gas .
according to the oil and gas journal 's 2008 survey , russia holds the world 's largest natural gas reserves , with 1,680 trillion cubic feet -lrb- 47.5 trillion cubic meters -rrb- , which is nearly twice the reserves in the next largest country , iran .
most of the known reserves , roughly 80 percent , are located in western siberia and are concentrated in giant or super-giant gas fields .
since the early 1970s , the amount of new fields discovered has been on the decline and output from the country 's core super-giant fields has been steadily decreasing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , left , successfully convinced erdogan to agree to allow russia access to turkish territorial waters according to claudia kemfert , director of the energy , transportation and environment at the german institute for economic research , there are new fields that potentially could be tapped , but they pose specific problems .
massive reserves are said to exist to the northwest of russia 's northern border , but those fields lie under the barents sea , which is covered in ice for much of the year .
fields further to the east also exist , but there the problem becomes one of transport .
most of russia 's gas customers are in europe , on the other side of the continent .
the second dilemma is currently being taken care of by a set of pipelines that will supply europe with gas , known as south stream and nord stream .
south stream will run from the beregovaya compressor station at dzhubga on the russia 's black sea coast to bulgaria 's city of varna , and would eventually supply gas to eastern europe and italy and austria .
russian prime minister vladimir putin was in ankara on thursday to persuade his turkish counterpart , recep tayyip erdogan , to sign up to the agreement .
the main reason behind south stream is russia 's desire to bypass ukraine - which is the transit route for almost 80 percent of russian gas to europe - at all costs .
the only way to do that is to route the pipeline through turkish territorial waters .
the other pipeline , nord stream , is currently being laid between russia and germany across the baltic sea , entering swedish , finnish and danish territorial waters .
germany is russia 's biggest gas customer in the eu and its second-biggest overall , after ukraine , which has had a notoriously rocky relationship with moscow since becoming independent following the fall of the soviet union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nord stream pipeline will connect russia directly with germany , its biggest european customer up until now , russia has had no way of turning off the gas to ukraine without also depriving its european customers .
these two pipelines make the issue moot and will have the effect of completely isolating kiev , at least when it comes to gas and energy economics .
switching to coal russia has had a long and difficult relationship with its gas and oil supplies .
according to the united states department of energy statistics , a slight majority , or 55 percent , of russian power stations run on natural gas , which by law has to be supplied at a severely reduced rate .
during the 1990s , when post-soviet russia was struggling to get back on its feet , the country found itself with an excess of natural gas on their hands .
that excess was pawned off on other countries and , due to lengthy agreements , will continue to be so for the foreseeable future .
this puts russia in a tricky position .
by forcing national gas company gazprom to sell gas to power plants at a reduced rate , the government is actually missing out on millions of dollars in tax money .
gazprom is russia 's largest tax payer , contributing up to 25 percent of the total amount added to the coffers each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia gets 55 percent of its energy from natural gas , which is supplied to power plants at a reduced cost but russia also relies on natural gas for 55 percent of its energy needs .
the country is home to the world 's second-largest coal reserves , after the united states , but after restructuring over the last couple of years , 80 percent of coal production in the country comes from independent producers .
this makes russia the only place in the world where it 's cheaper to run power plants on gas than coal , so they are reluctant to turn to the black stuff .
any economist would tell you that the smart thing for russia to do would be to switch all the gas-fired power plants to coal , and then send all that unused gas to europe at regular market prices . however , coal-fired power plants emit enormous amounts of carbon dioxide into the environment , and as a signatory to the kytoto protocol , russia is obligated to reduce its carbon output .
so russia has started to go another way and has begun to lean a little on renewable energy like hydropower .
according to alexi kokorin , climate expert at the russian branch or the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , this is not a move to be more climate friendly , but only to look more climate friendly .
kokorin said that russian gas fields are being pushed further and further into the arctic , making it more difficult and more expensive to extract .
" russia does n't have the technology to extract the gas and it 's becoming more and more expensive to get enough gas to send to europe and china , therefore the government has decided that they have to save gas in the country , " he said .
upcoming climate treaty in a recently released g8 climate scorecard , russia was listed in seventh place , only beating out canada , which is quite significant since both countries are kyoto signatories .
this comes just five months ahead of a crucial meeting in copenhagen which is intended to hammer out a new climate agreement .
government officials begin another round of climate talks in bonn on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international feathers were ruffled two years ago when a russian submarine planted a flag on the sea floor of the north pole given its geographical location , the argument could be made that russia would be one of the very few countries that would benefit from global warming melting huge swaths of ice , providing better access to oil and gas reserves buried deep beneath arctic waters .
kokorin both agrees and disagrees with the assessment .
yes , he admitted , less ice would make extraction of gas and oil from the barents sea much easier .
however , melting permafrost would make it more difficult and expensive to extract current known reserves in siberia .
claudia kemfert says there are many voices within russia , especially scientists , saying that climate change is positive for russia and that they would benefit because the ice would decrease and then the access would be improved .
russia signed the kyoto protocol , said kemfert , because in the mid-90s it was still an emerging nation trying to get back on its feet after the fall of the soviet union .
the russians were treated much the same way as india and china are being treated in relation to the copenhagen agreement .
now that they 're among the world eight richest nations , they ca n't exactly claim that they need to be handled with kid gloves .
there is also the small matter of who actually owns the gas and oil reserves in the arctic .
with just over 24,000 kilometers -lrb- 15,000 miles -rrb- of arctic coastline , russia certainly has a claim .
but so do the united states , canada , norway , and denmark .

under existing law , german police are responsible for hostage situations . jung said in an interview with german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag that under existing law , police were responsible for hostage situations , but that it was not always possible for the police force to arrive quickly enough at a crime scene . the minister cited the recent episode involving german container ship the hansa stavanger , which was hijacked with 24 crew on board , including five germans , off the coast of somalia four months ago . he said that in the time it took a german police team to deploy to the horn of africa the situation had worsened .
only five pirates had boarded the ship initially , but their numbers eventually swelled to around 35 , he noted . " we should consider a constitutional amendment to allow the armed forces access to situations when the police can not act , such as when the police are not at the scene of an incident , " jung told the newspaper . " i want to put this on the agenda again at the latest when the parliamentary elections are over , " he added .
germans go to the polls to elect a new parliament in september . jung said the amendment should not only apply to international operations but also to certain domestic cases in which the german armed forces were better suited to handle a situation . the hansa stavanger was eventually released four months after being captured when the hamburg-based shipping company that owns the ship paid a 1.9-million-euro ransom . dfm / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the russian project is ahead at the moment . russia and europe are heading for a grim race in the construction of a gas pipeline under the black sea .
or so it would appear after the signing of a contract between russian prime minister vladimir putin and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
there 's a need for both the russian south stream as well as the european nabucco pipeline , because gas consumption in europe will increase in the next decade .
however , the russian project is ahead at the moment , if you consider it from a political and business point of view .
the russians will be the first to begin construction and they can probably more easily afford the estimated 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- costs with their state-run gazprom .
a private consortium is to build the eu pipeline for around 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- .
the nabucco project has to be run as a business whereas gazprom can afford massive losses .
eu members disagree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia and turkey signed the south stream pipeline deal on august 6 european states such as greece , italy , bulgaria and austria as well as turkey are partners in both pipeline projects .
this indicates two things : it 's everyone for himself when it comes to energy security .
a uniform european approach is not expected and is also not desired , for energy provision falls in the jurisdiction of the member states .
a consistent energy policy in the european union is worlds away compared to the largest producer , russia , because the 27 member states can not agree on what they really want .
after their experiences as part of the former east bloc , the baltic states and poland , the czech republic and slovakia want to avoid any dependence on russia .
the largest group in the eu , including germany and france , are compliant customers who know that they will be dependent on the russian gas stopcock for a long time to come .
in principle , it is only right that the north stream in the baltic and south stream and nabucco in the south should provide alternatives to the present supply lines through ukraine and belarus .
above all , the loser will at first be ukraine which will be deprived of its status as an important transit country to turkey .
the caucasus question the caucasus plays a key role in the great gas debate .
important gas and oil pipelines , built with the help of the us , run through georgia which is in a long-term dispute with russia .
neither south stream nor nabucco can operate properly without a stable georgia , azerbaijan and armenia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nabucco has to be run as a business whereas gazprom can afford massive losses and even more important than the question of the pipeline routes is the question of the gas supplier .
who should supply the gas for the pipelines ?
russia and the eu are endeavoring to persuade the central asian states , especially turkmenistan , iraq and iran to be the suppliers .
that 's where the actual competition is .
russia does not produce enough from its own oil fields to be able to fulfill the contracts and thus needs new sources .
the eu is also endeavoring to strengthen deliveries from the mediterranean area and norway but here too new methods of conveyance are needed .
in order to guarantee the supply of energy , the eu has to do some homework on its own territory .
europe desperately needs north-south and east-west pipelines in order to be able to smooth out production shortfalls among its member states .
france advocates that the russians should not only be viewed as competitors that one simply has to keep out of the european market .
rather , the eu , russia and turkey should run all the pipelines together .
the happy winner at the moment , thanks to its geographical position , is turkey .
it will become the most important land of transit and is connected via the third pipeline , blue stream , directly with russia .
turkey could not do anything else than sign the contracts with putin , after all , russia supplies two thirds of the gas for the turkish market and thus possesses a virtual supply monopoly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 09.08.2009 russia and the great natural gas balancing act großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia hopes to be able to save on gas use at home so that they can send more of it abroad russia controls the world 's largest gas reserves , but a combination of factors , including power production , climate change and logistics , are keeping it from reaping the greatest benefits . russia is running out of natural gas - or at least it 's running out of easily accessible natural gas .
according to the oil and gas journal 's 2008 survey , russia holds the world 's largest natural gas reserves , with 1,680 trillion cubic feet -lrb- 47.5 trillion cubic meters -rrb- , which is nearly twice the reserves in the next largest country , iran .
most of the known reserves , roughly 80 percent , are located in western siberia and are concentrated in giant or super-giant gas fields .
since the early 1970s , the amount of new fields discovered has been on the decline and output from the country 's core super-giant fields has been steadily decreasing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , left , successfully convinced erdogan to agree to allow russia access to turkish territorial waters according to claudia kemfert , director of the energy , transportation and environment at the german institute for economic research , there are new fields that potentially could be tapped , but they pose specific problems .
massive reserves are said to exist to the northwest of russia 's northern border , but those fields lie under the barents sea , which is covered in ice for much of the year .
fields further to the east also exist , but there the problem becomes one of transport .
most of russia 's gas customers are in europe , on the other side of the continent .
the second dilemma is currently being taken care of by a set of pipelines that will supply europe with gas , known as south stream and nord stream .
south stream will run from the beregovaya compressor station at dzhubga on the russia 's black sea coast to bulgaria 's city of varna , and would eventually supply gas to eastern europe and italy and austria .
russian prime minister vladimir putin was in ankara on thursday to persuade his turkish counterpart , recep tayyip erdogan , to sign up to the agreement .
the main reason behind south stream is russia 's desire to bypass ukraine - which is the transit route for almost 80 percent of russian gas to europe - at all costs .
the only way to do that is to route the pipeline through turkish territorial waters .
the other pipeline , nord stream , is currently being laid between russia and germany across the baltic sea , entering swedish , finnish and danish territorial waters .
germany is russia 's biggest gas customer in the eu and its second-biggest overall , after ukraine , which has had a notoriously rocky relationship with moscow since becoming independent following the fall of the soviet union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nord stream pipeline will connect russia directly with germany , its biggest european customer up until now , russia has had no way of turning off the gas to ukraine without also depriving its european customers .
these two pipelines make the issue moot and will have the effect of completely isolating kiev , at least when it comes to gas and energy economics .
switching to coal russia has had a long and difficult relationship with its gas and oil supplies .
according to the united states department of energy statistics , a slight majority , or 55 percent , of russian power stations run on natural gas , which by law has to be supplied at a severely reduced rate .
during the 1990s , when post-soviet russia was struggling to get back on its feet , the country found itself with an excess of natural gas on their hands .
that excess was pawned off on other countries and , due to lengthy agreements , will continue to be so for the foreseeable future .
this puts russia in a tricky position .
by forcing national gas company gazprom to sell gas to power plants at a reduced rate , the government is actually missing out on millions of dollars in tax money .
gazprom is russia 's largest tax payer , contributing up to 25 percent of the total amount added to the coffers each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia gets 55 percent of its energy from natural gas , which is supplied to power plants at a reduced cost but russia also relies on natural gas for 55 percent of its energy needs .
the country is home to the world 's second-largest coal reserves , after the united states , but after restructuring over the last couple of years , 80 percent of coal production in the country comes from independent producers .
this makes russia the only place in the world where it 's cheaper to run power plants on gas than coal , so they are reluctant to turn to the black stuff .
any economist would tell you that the smart thing for russia to do would be to switch all the gas-fired power plants to coal , and then send all that unused gas to europe at regular market prices . however , coal-fired power plants emit enormous amounts of carbon dioxide into the environment , and as a signatory to the kytoto protocol , russia is obligated to reduce its carbon output .
so russia has started to go another way and has begun to lean a little on renewable energy like hydropower .
according to alexi kokorin , climate expert at the russian branch or the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , this is not a move to be more climate friendly , but only to look more climate friendly .
kokorin said that russian gas fields are being pushed further and further into the arctic , making it more difficult and more expensive to extract .
" russia does n't have the technology to extract the gas and it 's becoming more and more expensive to get enough gas to send to europe and china , therefore the government has decided that they have to save gas in the country , " he said .
upcoming climate treaty in a recently released g8 climate scorecard , russia was listed in seventh place , only beating out canada , which is quite significant since both countries are kyoto signatories .
this comes just five months ahead of a crucial meeting in copenhagen which is intended to hammer out a new climate agreement .
government officials begin another round of climate talks in bonn on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international feathers were ruffled two years ago when a russian submarine planted a flag on the sea floor of the north pole given its geographical location , the argument could be made that russia would be one of the very few countries that would benefit from global warming melting huge swaths of ice , providing better access to oil and gas reserves buried deep beneath arctic waters .
kokorin both agrees and disagrees with the assessment .
yes , he admitted , less ice would make extraction of gas and oil from the barents sea much easier .
however , melting permafrost would make it more difficult and expensive to extract current known reserves in siberia .
claudia kemfert says there are many voices within russia , especially scientists , saying that climate change is positive for russia and that they would benefit because the ice would decrease and then the access would be improved .
russia signed the kyoto protocol , said kemfert , because in the mid-90s it was still an emerging nation trying to get back on its feet after the fall of the soviet union .
the russians were treated much the same way as india and china are being treated in relation to the copenhagen agreement .
now that they 're among the world eight richest nations , they ca n't exactly claim that they need to be handled with kid gloves .
there is also the small matter of who actually owns the gas and oil reserves in the arctic .
with just over 24,000 kilometers -lrb- 15,000 miles -rrb- of arctic coastline , russia certainly has a claim .
but so do the united states , canada , norway , and denmark .
rough estimates put the amount of oil and gas in the arctic at 20 percent of the total global reserves on the planet .
with that kind of potential , said kemfert , it wo n't matter to russia if the ice is there or not .
" of course they 'll try and sell it to the rest of the world , even if the ice is there , " she said .
" it 's much more expensive to drill into the sea with the ice , but they 've already been doing it in parts of siberia . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 09.08.2009 russia and the great natural gas balancing act großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia hopes to be able to save on gas use at home so that they can send more of it abroad russia controls the world 's largest gas reserves , but a combination of factors , including power production , climate change and logistics , are keeping it from reaping the greatest benefits . russia is running out of natural gas - or at least it 's running out of easily accessible natural gas .
according to the oil and gas journal 's 2008 survey , russia holds the world 's largest natural gas reserves , with 1,680 trillion cubic feet -lrb- 47.5 trillion cubic meters -rrb- , which is nearly twice the reserves in the next largest country , iran .
most of the known reserves , roughly 80 percent , are located in western siberia and are concentrated in giant or super-giant gas fields .
since the early 1970s , the amount of new fields discovered has been on the decline and output from the country 's core super-giant fields has been steadily decreasing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , left , successfully convinced erdogan to agree to allow russia access to turkish territorial waters according to claudia kemfert , director of the energy , transportation and environment at the german institute for economic research , there are new fields that potentially could be tapped , but they pose specific problems .
massive reserves are said to exist to the northwest of russia 's northern border , but those fields lie under the barents sea , which is covered in ice for much of the year .
fields further to the east also exist , but there the problem becomes one of transport .
most of russia 's gas customers are in europe , on the other side of the continent .
the second dilemma is currently being taken care of by a set of pipelines that will supply europe with gas , known as south stream and nord stream .
south stream will run from the beregovaya compressor station at dzhubga on the russia 's black sea coast to bulgaria 's city of varna , and would eventually supply gas to eastern europe and italy and austria .
russian prime minister vladimir putin was in ankara on thursday to persuade his turkish counterpart , recep tayyip erdogan , to sign up to the agreement .
the main reason behind south stream is russia 's desire to bypass ukraine - which is the transit route for almost 80 percent of russian gas to europe - at all costs .
the only way to do that is to route the pipeline through turkish territorial waters .
the other pipeline , nord stream , is currently being laid between russia and germany across the baltic sea , entering swedish , finnish and danish territorial waters .
germany is russia 's biggest gas customer in the eu and its second-biggest overall , after ukraine , which has had a notoriously rocky relationship with moscow since becoming independent following the fall of the soviet union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nord stream pipeline will connect russia directly with germany , its biggest european customer up until now , russia has had no way of turning off the gas to ukraine without also depriving its european customers .
these two pipelines make the issue moot and will have the effect of completely isolating kiev , at least when it comes to gas and energy economics .
switching to coal russia has had a long and difficult relationship with its gas and oil supplies .
according to the united states department of energy statistics , a slight majority , or 55 percent , of russian power stations run on natural gas , which by law has to be supplied at a severely reduced rate .
during the 1990s , when post-soviet russia was struggling to get back on its feet , the country found itself with an excess of natural gas on their hands .
that excess was pawned off on other countries and , due to lengthy agreements , will continue to be so for the foreseeable future .
this puts russia in a tricky position .
by forcing national gas company gazprom to sell gas to power plants at a reduced rate , the government is actually missing out on millions of dollars in tax money .
gazprom is russia 's largest tax payer , contributing up to 25 percent of the total amount added to the coffers each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia gets 55 percent of its energy from natural gas , which is supplied to power plants at a reduced cost but russia also relies on natural gas for 55 percent of its energy needs .
the country is home to the world 's second-largest coal reserves , after the united states , but after restructuring over the last couple of years , 80 percent of coal production in the country comes from independent producers .
this makes russia the only place in the world where it 's cheaper to run power plants on gas than coal , so they are reluctant to turn to the black stuff .
any economist would tell you that the smart thing for russia to do would be to switch all the gas-fired power plants to coal , and then send all that unused gas to europe at regular market prices . however , coal-fired power plants emit enormous amounts of carbon dioxide into the environment , and as a signatory to the kytoto protocol , russia is obligated to reduce its carbon output .
so russia has started to go another way and has begun to lean a little on renewable energy like hydropower .
according to alexi kokorin , climate expert at the russian branch or the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , this is not a move to be more climate friendly , but only to look more climate friendly .
kokorin said that russian gas fields are being pushed further and further into the arctic , making it more difficult and more expensive to extract .
" russia does n't have the technology to extract the gas and it 's becoming more and more expensive to get enough gas to send to europe and china , therefore the government has decided that they have to save gas in the country , " he said .
upcoming climate treaty in a recently released g8 climate scorecard , russia was listed in seventh place , only beating out canada , which is quite significant since both countries are kyoto signatories .
this comes just five months ahead of a crucial meeting in copenhagen which is intended to hammer out a new climate agreement .
government officials begin another round of climate talks in bonn on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international feathers were ruffled two years ago when a russian submarine planted a flag on the sea floor of the north pole given its geographical location , the argument could be made that russia would be one of the very few countries that would benefit from global warming melting huge swaths of ice , providing better access to oil and gas reserves buried deep beneath arctic waters .
kokorin both agrees and disagrees with the assessment .
yes , he admitted , less ice would make extraction of gas and oil from the barents sea much easier .
however , melting permafrost would make it more difficult and expensive to extract current known reserves in siberia .
claudia kemfert says there are many voices within russia , especially scientists , saying that climate change is positive for russia and that they would benefit because the ice would decrease and then the access would be improved .
russia signed the kyoto protocol , said kemfert , because in the mid-90s it was still an emerging nation trying to get back on its feet after the fall of the soviet union .
the russians were treated much the same way as india and china are being treated in relation to the copenhagen agreement .
now that they 're among the world eight richest nations , they ca n't exactly claim that they need to be handled with kid gloves .
there is also the small matter of who actually owns the gas and oil reserves in the arctic .
with just over 24,000 kilometers -lrb- 15,000 miles -rrb- of arctic coastline , russia certainly has a claim .
but so do the united states , canada , norway , and denmark .
rough estimates put the amount of oil and gas in the arctic at 20 percent of the total global reserves on the planet .
with that kind of potential , said kemfert , it wo n't matter to russia if the ice is there or not .
" of course they 'll try and sell it to the rest of the world , even if the ice is there , " she said .
" it 's much more expensive to drill into the sea with the ice , but they 've already been doing it in parts of siberia . "

the russian project is ahead at the moment . russia and europe are heading for a grim race in the construction of a gas pipeline under the black sea .
or so it would appear after the signing of a contract between russian prime minister vladimir putin and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
there 's a need for both the russian south stream as well as the european nabucco pipeline , because gas consumption in europe will increase in the next decade .
however , the russian project is ahead at the moment , if you consider it from a political and business point of view .
the russians will be the first to begin construction and they can probably more easily afford the estimated 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- costs with their state-run gazprom .
a private consortium is to build the eu pipeline for around 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- .
the nabucco project has to be run as a business whereas gazprom can afford massive losses .
eu members disagree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia and turkey signed the south stream pipeline deal on august 6 european states such as greece , italy , bulgaria and austria as well as turkey are partners in both pipeline projects .
this indicates two things : it 's everyone for himself when it comes to energy security .
a uniform european approach is not expected and is also not desired , for energy provision falls in the jurisdiction of the member states .
a consistent energy policy in the european union is worlds away compared to the largest producer , russia , because the 27 member states can not agree on what they really want .
after their experiences as part of the former east bloc , the baltic states and poland , the czech republic and slovakia want to avoid any dependence on russia .
the largest group in the eu , including germany and france , are compliant customers who know that they will be dependent on the russian gas stopcock for a long time to come .
in principle , it is only right that the north stream in the baltic and south stream and nabucco in the south should provide alternatives to the present supply lines through ukraine and belarus .
above all , the loser will at first be ukraine which will be deprived of its status as an important transit country to turkey .
the caucasus question the caucasus plays a key role in the great gas debate .
important gas and oil pipelines , built with the help of the us , run through georgia which is in a long-term dispute with russia .
neither south stream nor nabucco can operate properly without a stable georgia , azerbaijan and armenia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nabucco has to be run as a business whereas gazprom can afford massive losses and even more important than the question of the pipeline routes is the question of the gas supplier .
who should supply the gas for the pipelines ?
russia and the eu are endeavoring to persuade the central asian states , especially turkmenistan , iraq and iran to be the suppliers .
that 's where the actual competition is .
russia does not produce enough from its own oil fields to be able to fulfill the contracts and thus needs new sources .
the eu is also endeavoring to strengthen deliveries from the mediterranean area and norway but here too new methods of conveyance are needed .
in order to guarantee the supply of energy , the eu has to do some homework on its own territory .
europe desperately needs north-south and east-west pipelines in order to be able to smooth out production shortfalls among its member states .
france advocates that the russians should not only be viewed as competitors that one simply has to keep out of the european market .
rather , the eu , russia and turkey should run all the pipelines together .
the happy winner at the moment , thanks to its geographical position , is turkey .
it will become the most important land of transit and is connected via the third pipeline , blue stream , directly with russia .
turkey could not do anything else than sign the contracts with putin , after all , russia supplies two thirds of the gas for the turkish market and thus possesses a virtual supply monopoly .

the russian project is ahead at the moment . russia and europe are heading for a grim race in the construction of a gas pipeline under the black sea .
or so it would appear after the signing of a contract between russian prime minister vladimir putin and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
there 's a need for both the russian south stream as well as the european nabucco pipeline , because gas consumption in europe will increase in the next decade .
however , the russian project is ahead at the moment , if you consider it from a political and business point of view .
the russians will be the first to begin construction and they can probably more easily afford the estimated 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- costs with their state-run gazprom .
a private consortium is to build the eu pipeline for around 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- .
the nabucco project has to be run as a business whereas gazprom can afford massive losses .
eu members disagree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia and turkey signed the south stream pipeline deal on august 6 european states such as greece , italy , bulgaria and austria as well as turkey are partners in both pipeline projects .
this indicates two things : it 's everyone for himself when it comes to energy security .
a uniform european approach is not expected and is also not desired , for energy provision falls in the jurisdiction of the member states .
a consistent energy policy in the european union is worlds away compared to the largest producer , russia , because the 27 member states can not agree on what they really want .
after their experiences as part of the former east bloc , the baltic states and poland , the czech republic and slovakia want to avoid any dependence on russia .
the largest group in the eu , including germany and france , are compliant customers who know that they will be dependent on the russian gas stopcock for a long time to come .
in principle , it is only right that the north stream in the baltic and south stream and nabucco in the south should provide alternatives to the present supply lines through ukraine and belarus .
above all , the loser will at first be ukraine which will be deprived of its status as an important transit country to turkey .
the caucasus question the caucasus plays a key role in the great gas debate .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nabucco has to be run as a business whereas gazprom can afford massive losses and even more important than the question of the pipeline routes is the question of the gas supplier .
who should supply the gas for the pipelines ?
russia and the eu are endeavoring to persuade the central asian states , especially turkmenistan , iraq and iran to be the suppliers .
that 's where the actual competition is .
russia does not produce enough from its own oil fields to be able to fulfill the contracts and thus needs new sources .

the happy winner at the moment , thanks to its geographical position , is turkey .
it will become the most important land of transit and is connected via the third pipeline , blue stream , directly with russia .
turkey could not do anything else than sign the contracts with putin , after all , russia supplies two thirds of the gas for the turkish market and thus possesses a virtual supply monopoly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 09.08.2009 russia and the great natural gas balancing act großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia hopes to be able to save on gas use at home so that they can send more of it abroad russia controls the world 's largest gas reserves , but a combination of factors , including power production , climate change and logistics , are keeping it from reaping the greatest benefits . russia is running out of natural gas - or at least it 's running out of easily accessible natural gas .
according to the oil and gas journal 's 2008 survey , russia holds the world 's largest natural gas reserves , with 1,680 trillion cubic feet -lrb- 47.5 trillion cubic meters -rrb- , which is nearly twice the reserves in the next largest country , iran .
most of the known reserves , roughly 80 percent , are located in western siberia and are concentrated in giant or super-giant gas fields .
since the early 1970s , the amount of new fields discovered has been on the decline and output from the country 's core super-giant fields has been steadily decreasing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , left , successfully convinced erdogan to agree to allow russia access to turkish territorial waters according to claudia kemfert , director of the energy , transportation and environment at the german institute for economic research , there are new fields that potentially could be tapped , but they pose specific problems .
massive reserves are said to exist to the northwest of russia 's northern border , but those fields lie under the barents sea , which is covered in ice for much of the year .
fields further to the east also exist , but there the problem becomes one of transport .
most of russia 's gas customers are in europe , on the other side of the continent .
the second dilemma is currently being taken care of by a set of pipelines that will supply europe with gas , known as south stream and nord stream .
south stream will run from the beregovaya compressor station at dzhubga on the russia 's black sea coast to bulgaria 's city of varna , and would eventually supply gas to eastern europe and italy and austria .
russian prime minister vladimir putin was in ankara on thursday to persuade his turkish counterpart , recep tayyip erdogan , to sign up to the agreement .
the main reason behind south stream is russia 's desire to bypass ukraine - which is the transit route for almost 80 percent of russian gas to europe - at all costs .
the only way to do that is to route the pipeline through turkish territorial waters .
the other pipeline , nord stream , is currently being laid between russia and germany across the baltic sea , entering swedish , finnish and danish territorial waters .
germany is russia 's biggest gas customer in the eu and its second-biggest overall , after ukraine , which has had a notoriously rocky relationship with moscow since becoming independent following the fall of the soviet union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nord stream pipeline will connect russia directly with germany , its biggest european customer up until now , russia has had no way of turning off the gas to ukraine without also depriving its european customers .
these two pipelines make the issue moot and will have the effect of completely isolating kiev , at least when it comes to gas and energy economics .
switching to coal russia has had a long and difficult relationship with its gas and oil supplies .
according to the united states department of energy statistics , a slight majority , or 55 percent , of russian power stations run on natural gas , which by law has to be supplied at a severely reduced rate .
during the 1990s , when post-soviet russia was struggling to get back on its feet , the country found itself with an excess of natural gas on their hands .
that excess was pawned off on other countries and , due to lengthy agreements , will continue to be so for the foreseeable future .
this puts russia in a tricky position .
by forcing national gas company gazprom to sell gas to power plants at a reduced rate , the government is actually missing out on millions of dollars in tax money .
gazprom is russia 's largest tax payer , contributing up to 25 percent of the total amount added to the coffers each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia gets 55 percent of its energy from natural gas , which is supplied to power plants at a reduced cost but russia also relies on natural gas for 55 percent of its energy needs .
the country is home to the world 's second-largest coal reserves , after the united states , but after restructuring over the last couple of years , 80 percent of coal production in the country comes from independent producers .
this makes russia the only place in the world where it 's cheaper to run power plants on gas than coal , so they are reluctant to turn to the black stuff .
any economist would tell you that the smart thing for russia to do would be to switch all the gas-fired power plants to coal , and then send all that unused gas to europe at regular market prices . however , coal-fired power plants emit enormous amounts of carbon dioxide into the environment , and as a signatory to the kytoto protocol , russia is obligated to reduce its carbon output .
so russia has started to go another way and has begun to lean a little on renewable energy like hydropower .
according to alexi kokorin , climate expert at the russian branch or the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , this is not a move to be more climate friendly , but only to look more climate friendly .
kokorin said that russian gas fields are being pushed further and further into the arctic , making it more difficult and more expensive to extract .
" russia does n't have the technology to extract the gas and it 's becoming more and more expensive to get enough gas to send to europe and china , therefore the government has decided that they have to save gas in the country , " he said .
upcoming climate treaty in a recently released g8 climate scorecard , russia was listed in seventh place , only beating out canada , which is quite significant since both countries are kyoto signatories .
this comes just five months ahead of a crucial meeting in copenhagen which is intended to hammer out a new climate agreement .
government officials begin another round of climate talks in bonn on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international feathers were ruffled two years ago when a russian submarine planted a flag on the sea floor of the north pole given its geographical location , the argument could be made that russia would be one of the very few countries that would benefit from global warming melting huge swaths of ice , providing better access to oil and gas reserves buried deep beneath arctic waters .
kokorin both agrees and disagrees with the assessment .
yes , he admitted , less ice would make extraction of gas and oil from the barents sea much easier .
however , melting permafrost would make it more difficult and expensive to extract current known reserves in siberia .
claudia kemfert says there are many voices within russia , especially scientists , saying that climate change is positive for russia and that they would benefit because the ice would decrease and then the access would be improved .
russia signed the kyoto protocol , said kemfert , because in the mid-90s it was still an emerging nation trying to get back on its feet after the fall of the soviet union .
the russians were treated much the same way as india and china are being treated in relation to the copenhagen agreement .
now that they 're among the world eight richest nations , they ca n't exactly claim that they need to be handled with kid gloves .
there is also the small matter of who actually owns the gas and oil reserves in the arctic .
with just over 24,000 kilometers -lrb- 15,000 miles -rrb- of arctic coastline , russia certainly has a claim .
but so do the united states , canada , norway , and denmark .
rough estimates put the amount of oil and gas in the arctic at 20 percent of the total global reserves on the planet .
with that kind of potential , said kemfert , it wo n't matter to russia if the ice is there or not .
" of course they 'll try and sell it to the rest of the world , even if the ice is there , " she said .
" it 's much more expensive to drill into the sea with the ice , but they 've already been doing it in parts of siberia . "

under existing law , german police are responsible for hostage situations . jung said in an interview with german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag that under existing law , police were responsible for hostage situations , but that it was not always possible for the police force to arrive quickly enough at a crime scene . the minister cited the recent episode involving german container ship the hansa stavanger , which was hijacked with 24 crew on board , including five germans , off the coast of somalia four months ago . he said that in the time it took a german police team to deploy to the horn of africa the situation had worsened .
only five pirates had boarded the ship initially , but their numbers eventually swelled to around 35 , he noted . " we should consider a constitutional amendment to allow the armed forces access to situations when the police can not act , such as when the police are not at the scene of an incident , " jung told the newspaper . " i want to put this on the agenda again at the latest when the parliamentary elections are over , " he added .
germans go to the polls to elect a new parliament in september . jung said the amendment should not only apply to international operations but also to certain domestic cases in which the german armed forces were better suited to handle a situation . the hansa stavanger was eventually released four months after being captured when the hamburg-based shipping company that owns the ship paid a 1.9-million-euro ransom . dfm / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the russian project is ahead at the moment , if you consider it from a political and business point of view .
the russians will be the first to begin construction and they can probably more easily afford the estimated 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- costs with their state-run gazprom .
a private consortium is to build the eu pipeline for around 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- .
the nabucco project has to be run as a business whereas gazprom can afford massive losses .
eu members disagree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia and turkey signed the south stream pipeline deal on august 6 european states such as greece , italy , bulgaria and austria as well as turkey are partners in both pipeline projects .
this indicates two things : it 's everyone for himself when it comes to energy security .
a uniform european approach is not expected and is also not desired , for energy provision falls in the jurisdiction of the member states .
a consistent energy policy in the european union is worlds away compared to the largest producer , russia , because the 27 member states can not agree on what they really want .
after their experiences as part of the former east bloc , the baltic states and poland , the czech republic and slovakia want to avoid any dependence on russia .
the largest group in the eu , including germany and france , are compliant customers who know that they will be dependent on the russian gas stopcock for a long time to come .
in principle , it is only right that the north stream in the baltic and south stream and nabucco in the south should provide alternatives to the present supply lines through ukraine and belarus .
above all , the loser will at first be ukraine which will be deprived of its status as an important transit country to turkey .
the caucasus question the caucasus plays a key role in the great gas debate .
important gas and oil pipelines , built with the help of the us , run through georgia which is in a long-term dispute with russia .
neither south stream nor nabucco can operate properly without a stable georgia , azerbaijan and armenia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nabucco has to be run as a business whereas gazprom can afford massive losses and even more important than the question of the pipeline routes is the question of the gas supplier .
who should supply the gas for the pipelines ?
russia and the eu are endeavoring to persuade the central asian states , especially turkmenistan , iraq and iran to be the suppliers .
that 's where the actual competition is .
russia does not produce enough from its own oil fields to be able to fulfill the contracts and thus needs new sources .
the eu is also endeavoring to strengthen deliveries from the mediterranean area and norway but here too new methods of conveyance are needed .
in order to guarantee the supply of energy , the eu has to do some homework on its own territory .
europe desperately needs north-south and east-west pipelines in order to be able to smooth out production shortfalls among its member states .
france advocates that the russians should not only be viewed as competitors that one simply has to keep out of the european market .
rather , the eu , russia and turkey should run all the pipelines together .
the happy winner at the moment , thanks to its geographical position , is turkey .
it will become the most important land of transit and is connected via the third pipeline , blue stream , directly with russia .
turkey could not do anything else than sign the contracts with putin , after all , russia supplies two thirds of the gas for the turkish market and thus possesses a virtual supply monopoly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 09.08.2009 russia and the great natural gas balancing act großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia hopes to be able to save on gas use at home so that they can send more of it abroad russia controls the world 's largest gas reserves , but a combination of factors , including power production , climate change and logistics , are keeping it from reaping the greatest benefits . russia is running out of natural gas - or at least it 's running out of easily accessible natural gas .
according to the oil and gas journal 's 2008 survey , russia holds the world 's largest natural gas reserves , with 1,680 trillion cubic feet -lrb- 47.5 trillion cubic meters -rrb- , which is nearly twice the reserves in the next largest country , iran .
most of the known reserves , roughly 80 percent , are located in western siberia and are concentrated in giant or super-giant gas fields .
since the early 1970s , the amount of new fields discovered has been on the decline and output from the country 's core super-giant fields has been steadily decreasing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , left , successfully convinced erdogan to agree to allow russia access to turkish territorial waters according to claudia kemfert , director of the energy , transportation and environment at the german institute for economic research , there are new fields that potentially could be tapped , but they pose specific problems .
massive reserves are said to exist to the northwest of russia 's northern border , but those fields lie under the barents sea , which is covered in ice for much of the year .
fields further to the east also exist , but there the problem becomes one of transport .
most of russia 's gas customers are in europe , on the other side of the continent .
the second dilemma is currently being taken care of by a set of pipelines that will supply europe with gas , known as south stream and nord stream .
south stream will run from the beregovaya compressor station at dzhubga on the russia 's black sea coast to bulgaria 's city of varna , and would eventually supply gas to eastern europe and italy and austria .
russian prime minister vladimir putin was in ankara on thursday to persuade his turkish counterpart , recep tayyip erdogan , to sign up to the agreement .
the main reason behind south stream is russia 's desire to bypass ukraine - which is the transit route for almost 80 percent of russian gas to europe - at all costs .
the only way to do that is to route the pipeline through turkish territorial waters .
the other pipeline , nord stream , is currently being laid between russia and germany across the baltic sea , entering swedish , finnish and danish territorial waters .
germany is russia 's biggest gas customer in the eu and its second-biggest overall , after ukraine , which has had a notoriously rocky relationship with moscow since becoming independent following the fall of the soviet union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nord stream pipeline will connect russia directly with germany , its biggest european customer up until now , russia has had no way of turning off the gas to ukraine without also depriving its european customers .
these two pipelines make the issue moot and will have the effect of completely isolating kiev , at least when it comes to gas and energy economics .
switching to coal russia has had a long and difficult relationship with its gas and oil supplies .
according to the united states department of energy statistics , a slight majority , or 55 percent , of russian power stations run on natural gas , which by law has to be supplied at a severely reduced rate .
during the 1990s , when post-soviet russia was struggling to get back on its feet , the country found itself with an excess of natural gas on their hands .
that excess was pawned off on other countries and , due to lengthy agreements , will continue to be so for the foreseeable future .
this puts russia in a tricky position .
by forcing national gas company gazprom to sell gas to power plants at a reduced rate , the government is actually missing out on millions of dollars in tax money .
gazprom is russia 's largest tax payer , contributing up to 25 percent of the total amount added to the coffers each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia gets 55 percent of its energy from natural gas , which is supplied to power plants at a reduced cost but russia also relies on natural gas for 55 percent of its energy needs .
the country is home to the world 's second-largest coal reserves , after the united states , but after restructuring over the last couple of years , 80 percent of coal production in the country comes from independent producers .
this makes russia the only place in the world where it 's cheaper to run power plants on gas than coal , so they are reluctant to turn to the black stuff .
any economist would tell you that the smart thing for russia to do would be to switch all the gas-fired power plants to coal , and then send all that unused gas to europe at regular market prices . however , coal-fired power plants emit enormous amounts of carbon dioxide into the environment , and as a signatory to the kytoto protocol , russia is obligated to reduce its carbon output .
so russia has started to go another way and has begun to lean a little on renewable energy like hydropower .
according to alexi kokorin , climate expert at the russian branch or the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , this is not a move to be more climate friendly , but only to look more climate friendly .
kokorin said that russian gas fields are being pushed further and further into the arctic , making it more difficult and more expensive to extract .
" russia does n't have the technology to extract the gas and it 's becoming more and more expensive to get enough gas to send to europe and china , therefore the government has decided that they have to save gas in the country , " he said .
upcoming climate treaty in a recently released g8 climate scorecard , russia was listed in seventh place , only beating out canada , which is quite significant since both countries are kyoto signatories .
this comes just five months ahead of a crucial meeting in copenhagen which is intended to hammer out a new climate agreement .
government officials begin another round of climate talks in bonn on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international feathers were ruffled two years ago when a russian submarine planted a flag on the sea floor of the north pole given its geographical location , the argument could be made that russia would be one of the very few countries that would benefit from global warming melting huge swaths of ice , providing better access to oil and gas reserves buried deep beneath arctic waters .
kokorin both agrees and disagrees with the assessment .
yes , he admitted , less ice would make extraction of gas and oil from the barents sea much easier .
however , melting permafrost would make it more difficult and expensive to extract current known reserves in siberia .
claudia kemfert says there are many voices within russia , especially scientists , saying that climate change is positive for russia and that they would benefit because the ice would decrease and then the access would be improved .
russia signed the kyoto protocol , said kemfert , because in the mid-90s it was still an emerging nation trying to get back on its feet after the fall of the soviet union .
the russians were treated much the same way as india and china are being treated in relation to the copenhagen agreement .
now that they 're among the world eight richest nations , they ca n't exactly claim that they need to be handled with kid gloves .
there is also the small matter of who actually owns the gas and oil reserves in the arctic .
with just over 24,000 kilometers -lrb- 15,000 miles -rrb- of arctic coastline , russia certainly has a claim .
but so do the united states , canada , norway , and denmark .
rough estimates put the amount of oil and gas in the arctic at 20 percent of the total global reserves on the planet .
with that kind of potential , said kemfert , it wo n't matter to russia if the ice is there or not .
" of course they 'll try and sell it to the rest of the world , even if the ice is there , " she said .
" it 's much more expensive to drill into the sea with the ice , but they 've already been doing it in parts of siberia . "

according to the oil and gas journal 's 2008 survey , russia holds the world 's largest natural gas reserves , with 1,680 trillion cubic feet -lrb- 47.5 trillion cubic meters -rrb- , which is nearly twice the reserves in the next largest country , iran .
most of the known reserves , roughly 80 percent , are located in western siberia and are concentrated in giant or super-giant gas fields .
since the early 1970s , the amount of new fields discovered has been on the decline and output from the country 's core super-giant fields has been steadily decreasing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , left , successfully convinced erdogan to agree to allow russia access to turkish territorial waters according to claudia kemfert , director of the energy , transportation and environment at the german institute for economic research , there are new fields that potentially could be tapped , but they pose specific problems .
massive reserves are said to exist to the northwest of russia 's northern border , but those fields lie under the barents sea , which is covered in ice for much of the year .
fields further to the east also exist , but there the problem becomes one of transport .
most of russia 's gas customers are in europe , on the other side of the continent .
the second dilemma is currently being taken care of by a set of pipelines that will supply europe with gas , known as south stream and nord stream .
south stream will run from the beregovaya compressor station at dzhubga on the russia 's black sea coast to bulgaria 's city of varna , and would eventually supply gas to eastern europe and italy and austria .
russian prime minister vladimir putin was in ankara on thursday to persuade his turkish counterpart , recep tayyip erdogan , to sign up to the agreement .
the main reason behind south stream is russia 's desire to bypass ukraine - which is the transit route for almost 80 percent of russian gas to europe - at all costs .
the only way to do that is to route the pipeline through turkish territorial waters .
the other pipeline , nord stream , is currently being laid between russia and germany across the baltic sea , entering swedish , finnish and danish territorial waters .
germany is russia 's biggest gas customer in the eu and its second-biggest overall , after ukraine , which has had a notoriously rocky relationship with moscow since becoming independent following the fall of the soviet union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nord stream pipeline will connect russia directly with germany , its biggest european customer up until now , russia has had no way of turning off the gas to ukraine without also depriving its european customers .
these two pipelines make the issue moot and will have the effect of completely isolating kiev , at least when it comes to gas and energy economics .
switching to coal russia has had a long and difficult relationship with its gas and oil supplies .
according to the united states department of energy statistics , a slight majority , or 55 percent , of russian power stations run on natural gas , which by law has to be supplied at a severely reduced rate .
during the 1990s , when post-soviet russia was struggling to get back on its feet , the country found itself with an excess of natural gas on their hands .
that excess was pawned off on other countries and , due to lengthy agreements , will continue to be so for the foreseeable future .
this puts russia in a tricky position .
by forcing national gas company gazprom to sell gas to power plants at a reduced rate , the government is actually missing out on millions of dollars in tax money .
gazprom is russia 's largest tax payer , contributing up to 25 percent of the total amount added to the coffers each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia gets 55 percent of its energy from natural gas , which is supplied to power plants at a reduced cost but russia also relies on natural gas for 55 percent of its energy needs .
the country is home to the world 's second-largest coal reserves , after the united states , but after restructuring over the last couple of years , 80 percent of coal production in the country comes from independent producers .
this makes russia the only place in the world where it 's cheaper to run power plants on gas than coal , so they are reluctant to turn to the black stuff .
any economist would tell you that the smart thing for russia to do would be to switch all the gas-fired power plants to coal , and then send all that unused gas to europe at regular market prices . however , coal-fired power plants emit enormous amounts of carbon dioxide into the environment , and as a signatory to the kytoto protocol , russia is obligated to reduce its carbon output .

according to alexi kokorin , climate expert at the russian branch or the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , this is not a move to be more climate friendly , but only to look more climate friendly .
kokorin said that russian gas fields are being pushed further and further into the arctic , making it more difficult and more expensive to extract .
" russia does n't have the technology to extract the gas and it 's becoming more and more expensive to get enough gas to send to europe and china , therefore the government has decided that they have to save gas in the country , " he said .
upcoming climate treaty in a recently released g8 climate scorecard , russia was listed in seventh place , only beating out canada , which is quite significant since both countries are kyoto signatories .
this comes just five months ahead of a crucial meeting in copenhagen which is intended to hammer out a new climate agreement .
government officials begin another round of climate talks in bonn on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international feathers were ruffled two years ago when a russian submarine planted a flag on the sea floor of the north pole given its geographical location , the argument could be made that russia would be one of the very few countries that would benefit from global warming melting huge swaths of ice , providing better access to oil and gas reserves buried deep beneath arctic waters .
kokorin both agrees and disagrees with the assessment .
yes , he admitted , less ice would make extraction of gas and oil from the barents sea much easier .
however , melting permafrost would make it more difficult and expensive to extract current known reserves in siberia .
claudia kemfert says there are many voices within russia , especially scientists , saying that climate change is positive for russia and that they would benefit because the ice would decrease and then the access would be improved .
russia signed the kyoto protocol , said kemfert , because in the mid-90s it was still an emerging nation trying to get back on its feet after the fall of the soviet union .
the russians were treated much the same way as india and china are being treated in relation to the copenhagen agreement .
now that they 're among the world eight richest nations , they ca n't exactly claim that they need to be handled with kid gloves .
there is also the small matter of who actually owns the gas and oil reserves in the arctic .
with just over 24,000 kilometers -lrb- 15,000 miles -rrb- of arctic coastline , russia certainly has a claim .
but so do the united states , canada , norway , and denmark .
rough estimates put the amount of oil and gas in the arctic at 20 percent of the total global reserves on the planet .
with that kind of potential , said kemfert , it wo n't matter to russia if the ice is there or not .
" of course they 'll try and sell it to the rest of the world , even if the ice is there , " she said .
" it 's much more expensive to drill into the sea with the ice , but they 've already been doing it in parts of siberia . "

according to the oil and gas journal 's 2008 survey , russia holds the world 's largest natural gas reserves , with 1,680 trillion cubic feet -lrb- 47.5 trillion cubic meters -rrb- , which is nearly twice the reserves in the next largest country , iran .
most of the known reserves , roughly 80 percent , are located in western siberia and are concentrated in giant or super-giant gas fields .
since the early 1970s , the amount of new fields discovered has been on the decline and output from the country 's core super-giant fields has been steadily decreasing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , left , successfully convinced erdogan to agree to allow russia access to turkish territorial waters according to claudia kemfert , director of the energy , transportation and environment at the german institute for economic research , there are new fields that potentially could be tapped , but they pose specific problems .
massive reserves are said to exist to the northwest of russia 's northern border , but those fields lie under the barents sea , which is covered in ice for much of the year .
fields further to the east also exist , but there the problem becomes one of transport .
most of russia 's gas customers are in europe , on the other side of the continent .
the second dilemma is currently being taken care of by a set of pipelines that will supply europe with gas , known as south stream and nord stream .
south stream will run from the beregovaya compressor station at dzhubga on the russia 's black sea coast to bulgaria 's city of varna , and would eventually supply gas to eastern europe and italy and austria .
russian prime minister vladimir putin was in ankara on thursday to persuade his turkish counterpart , recep tayyip erdogan , to sign up to the agreement .
the main reason behind south stream is russia 's desire to bypass ukraine - which is the transit route for almost 80 percent of russian gas to europe - at all costs .
the only way to do that is to route the pipeline through turkish territorial waters .
the other pipeline , nord stream , is currently being laid between russia and germany across the baltic sea , entering swedish , finnish and danish territorial waters .
germany is russia 's biggest gas customer in the eu and its second-biggest overall , after ukraine , which has had a notoriously rocky relationship with moscow since becoming independent following the fall of the soviet union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nord stream pipeline will connect russia directly with germany , its biggest european customer up until now , russia has had no way of turning off the gas to ukraine without also depriving its european customers .
these two pipelines make the issue moot and will have the effect of completely isolating kiev , at least when it comes to gas and energy economics .
switching to coal russia has had a long and difficult relationship with its gas and oil supplies .
according to the united states department of energy statistics , a slight majority , or 55 percent , of russian power stations run on natural gas , which by law has to be supplied at a severely reduced rate .
during the 1990s , when post-soviet russia was struggling to get back on its feet , the country found itself with an excess of natural gas on their hands .
that excess was pawned off on other countries and , due to lengthy agreements , will continue to be so for the foreseeable future .
this puts russia in a tricky position .
by forcing national gas company gazprom to sell gas to power plants at a reduced rate , the government is actually missing out on millions of dollars in tax money .
gazprom is russia 's largest tax payer , contributing up to 25 percent of the total amount added to the coffers each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia gets 55 percent of its energy from natural gas , which is supplied to power plants at a reduced cost but russia also relies on natural gas for 55 percent of its energy needs .
the country is home to the world 's second-largest coal reserves , after the united states , but after restructuring over the last couple of years , 80 percent of coal production in the country comes from independent producers .
this makes russia the only place in the world where it 's cheaper to run power plants on gas than coal , so they are reluctant to turn to the black stuff .
any economist would tell you that the smart thing for russia to do would be to switch all the gas-fired power plants to coal , and then send all that unused gas to europe at regular market prices . however , coal-fired power plants emit enormous amounts of carbon dioxide into the environment , and as a signatory to the kytoto protocol , russia is obligated to reduce its carbon output .

moldova 's communist party had held a majority in the national legislature for more than a decade , but was soundly defeated by the pro-europe opposition in the july poll .
infotag is reporting that the new coalition will be called " for european integration " -lrb- fei -rrb- , and that leaders of the alliance have named fighting corruption , better relations with the eu , a free and open media , and pulling moldova 's economy out of a deep recession as top priorities .
discussions on cabinet post division between the two liberal parties and the smaller democratic party of moldova , and our moldova party , were still in progress , according to a fei statement .
a top order of business will be election of a new president , requiring a 61-vote majority in the legislature by constitutional stature ; forcing the fei parties to seek at least 8 communist mps to support a fei candidate for the presidency .
current moldovan president vladimir voronin , who is also head of moldova 's communist party , said in a statement last week the communists " were willing to talk " with the fei alliance on a jointly- acceptable presidential candidate .
rioting in the streets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : original parliamentary elections back in april sparked mass protest unwillingness by fei parties to accept a communist candidate for president in the wake of april elections produced a hung parliament , forcing new elections in july .
the april elections also sparked mass protests against results giving the communists a strong win , and near total control of parliament .
street battles between anti-communist demonstrators and police in the moldovan capital chisinau left one dead , hundreds injured , and the parliament and presidential residence badly damaged by fire .
eu officials shortly after the repeat vote in late july called on the pro- and anti-communist wings of moldova 's political arena to lay aside their differences , and form a new ruling coalition .
" the immediate priority is to put in place a government , and i urge all the political parties to engage in open and constructive dialogue , " eu foreign affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said last week .
moldova may not hold any more parliamentary elections in 2009 , but the nation 's supreme court ruled in july that if the legislature fails to elect a president by january 2010 another nation-wide vote to select mps - the third in ten months - would be possible. mrm / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

under existing law , german police are responsible for hostage situations . jung said in an interview with german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag that under existing law , police were responsible for hostage situations , but that it was not always possible for the police force to arrive quickly enough at a crime scene . the minister cited the recent episode involving german container ship the hansa stavanger , which was hijacked with 24 crew on board , including five germans , off the coast of somalia four months ago . he said that in the time it took a german police team to deploy to the horn of africa the situation had worsened .
only five pirates had boarded the ship initially , but their numbers eventually swelled to around 35 , he noted . " we should consider a constitutional amendment to allow the armed forces access to situations when the police can not act , such as when the police are not at the scene of an incident , " jung told the newspaper . " i want to put this on the agenda again at the latest when the parliamentary elections are over , " he added .
germans go to the polls to elect a new parliament in september . jung said the amendment should not only apply to international operations but also to certain domestic cases in which the german armed forces were better suited to handle a situation . the hansa stavanger was eventually released four months after being captured when the hamburg-based shipping company that owns the ship paid a 1.9-million-euro ransom . dfm / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

under existing law , german police are responsible for hostage situations . jung said in an interview with german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag that under existing law , police were responsible for hostage situations , but that it was not always possible for the police force to arrive quickly enough at a crime scene . the minister cited the recent episode involving german container ship the hansa stavanger , which was hijacked with 24 crew on board , including five germans , off the coast of somalia four months ago . he said that in the time it took a german police team to deploy to the horn of africa the situation had worsened .
only five pirates had boarded the ship initially , but their numbers eventually swelled to around 35 , he noted . " we should consider a constitutional amendment to allow the armed forces access to situations when the police can not act , such as when the police are not at the scene of an incident , " jung told the newspaper . " i want to put this on the agenda again at the latest when the parliamentary elections are over , " he added .
germans go to the polls to elect a new parliament in september . jung said the amendment should not only apply to international operations but also to certain domestic cases in which the german armed forces were better suited to handle a situation . the hansa stavanger was eventually released four months after being captured when the hamburg-based shipping company that owns the ship paid a 1.9-million-euro ransom . dfm / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the russian project is ahead at the moment . russia and europe are heading for a grim race in the construction of a gas pipeline under the black sea .
or so it would appear after the signing of a contract between russian prime minister vladimir putin and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
there 's a need for both the russian south stream as well as the european nabucco pipeline , because gas consumption in europe will increase in the next decade .
however , the russian project is ahead at the moment , if you consider it from a political and business point of view .
the russians will be the first to begin construction and they can probably more easily afford the estimated 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- costs with their state-run gazprom .
a private consortium is to build the eu pipeline for around 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- .
the nabucco project has to be run as a business whereas gazprom can afford massive losses .
eu members disagree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia and turkey signed the south stream pipeline deal on august 6 european states such as greece , italy , bulgaria and austria as well as turkey are partners in both pipeline projects .
this indicates two things : it 's everyone for himself when it comes to energy security .
a uniform european approach is not expected and is also not desired , for energy provision falls in the jurisdiction of the member states .
a consistent energy policy in the european union is worlds away compared to the largest producer , russia , because the 27 member states can not agree on what they really want .
after their experiences as part of the former east bloc , the baltic states and poland , the czech republic and slovakia want to avoid any dependence on russia .
the largest group in the eu , including germany and france , are compliant customers who know that they will be dependent on the russian gas stopcock for a long time to come .
in principle , it is only right that the north stream in the baltic and south stream and nabucco in the south should provide alternatives to the present supply lines through ukraine and belarus .
above all , the loser will at first be ukraine which will be deprived of its status as an important transit country to turkey .
the caucasus question the caucasus plays a key role in the great gas debate .
important gas and oil pipelines , built with the help of the us , run through georgia which is in a long-term dispute with russia .
neither south stream nor nabucco can operate properly without a stable georgia , azerbaijan and armenia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nabucco has to be run as a business whereas gazprom can afford massive losses and even more important than the question of the pipeline routes is the question of the gas supplier .
who should supply the gas for the pipelines ?
russia and the eu are endeavoring to persuade the central asian states , especially turkmenistan , iraq and iran to be the suppliers .
that 's where the actual competition is .
russia does not produce enough from its own oil fields to be able to fulfill the contracts and thus needs new sources .
the eu is also endeavoring to strengthen deliveries from the mediterranean area and norway but here too new methods of conveyance are needed .
in order to guarantee the supply of energy , the eu has to do some homework on its own territory .
europe desperately needs north-south and east-west pipelines in order to be able to smooth out production shortfalls among its member states .
france advocates that the russians should not only be viewed as competitors that one simply has to keep out of the european market .
rather , the eu , russia and turkey should run all the pipelines together .
the happy winner at the moment , thanks to its geographical position , is turkey .
it will become the most important land of transit and is connected via the third pipeline , blue stream , directly with russia .
turkey could not do anything else than sign the contracts with putin , after all , russia supplies two thirds of the gas for the turkish market and thus possesses a virtual supply monopoly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 09.08.2009 russia and the great natural gas balancing act großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia hopes to be able to save on gas use at home so that they can send more of it abroad russia controls the world 's largest gas reserves , but a combination of factors , including power production , climate change and logistics , are keeping it from reaping the greatest benefits . russia is running out of natural gas - or at least it 's running out of easily accessible natural gas .
according to the oil and gas journal 's 2008 survey , russia holds the world 's largest natural gas reserves , with 1,680 trillion cubic feet -lrb- 47.5 trillion cubic meters -rrb- , which is nearly twice the reserves in the next largest country , iran .
most of the known reserves , roughly 80 percent , are located in western siberia and are concentrated in giant or super-giant gas fields .
since the early 1970s , the amount of new fields discovered has been on the decline and output from the country 's core super-giant fields has been steadily decreasing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , left , successfully convinced erdogan to agree to allow russia access to turkish territorial waters according to claudia kemfert , director of the energy , transportation and environment at the german institute for economic research , there are new fields that potentially could be tapped , but they pose specific problems .
massive reserves are said to exist to the northwest of russia 's northern border , but those fields lie under the barents sea , which is covered in ice for much of the year .
fields further to the east also exist , but there the problem becomes one of transport .
most of russia 's gas customers are in europe , on the other side of the continent .
the second dilemma is currently being taken care of by a set of pipelines that will supply europe with gas , known as south stream and nord stream .
south stream will run from the beregovaya compressor station at dzhubga on the russia 's black sea coast to bulgaria 's city of varna , and would eventually supply gas to eastern europe and italy and austria .
russian prime minister vladimir putin was in ankara on thursday to persuade his turkish counterpart , recep tayyip erdogan , to sign up to the agreement .
the main reason behind south stream is russia 's desire to bypass ukraine - which is the transit route for almost 80 percent of russian gas to europe - at all costs .
the only way to do that is to route the pipeline through turkish territorial waters .
the other pipeline , nord stream , is currently being laid between russia and germany across the baltic sea , entering swedish , finnish and danish territorial waters .
germany is russia 's biggest gas customer in the eu and its second-biggest overall , after ukraine , which has had a notoriously rocky relationship with moscow since becoming independent following the fall of the soviet union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nord stream pipeline will connect russia directly with germany , its biggest european customer up until now , russia has had no way of turning off the gas to ukraine without also depriving its european customers .
these two pipelines make the issue moot and will have the effect of completely isolating kiev , at least when it comes to gas and energy economics .
switching to coal russia has had a long and difficult relationship with its gas and oil supplies .
according to the united states department of energy statistics , a slight majority , or 55 percent , of russian power stations run on natural gas , which by law has to be supplied at a severely reduced rate .
during the 1990s , when post-soviet russia was struggling to get back on its feet , the country found itself with an excess of natural gas on their hands .
that excess was pawned off on other countries and , due to lengthy agreements , will continue to be so for the foreseeable future .
this puts russia in a tricky position .
by forcing national gas company gazprom to sell gas to power plants at a reduced rate , the government is actually missing out on millions of dollars in tax money .
gazprom is russia 's largest tax payer , contributing up to 25 percent of the total amount added to the coffers each year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia gets 55 percent of its energy from natural gas , which is supplied to power plants at a reduced cost but russia also relies on natural gas for 55 percent of its energy needs .
the country is home to the world 's second-largest coal reserves , after the united states , but after restructuring over the last couple of years , 80 percent of coal production in the country comes from independent producers .
this makes russia the only place in the world where it 's cheaper to run power plants on gas than coal , so they are reluctant to turn to the black stuff .
any economist would tell you that the smart thing for russia to do would be to switch all the gas-fired power plants to coal , and then send all that unused gas to europe at regular market prices . however , coal-fired power plants emit enormous amounts of carbon dioxide into the environment , and as a signatory to the kytoto protocol , russia is obligated to reduce its carbon output .
so russia has started to go another way and has begun to lean a little on renewable energy like hydropower .
according to alexi kokorin , climate expert at the russian branch or the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , this is not a move to be more climate friendly , but only to look more climate friendly .
kokorin said that russian gas fields are being pushed further and further into the arctic , making it more difficult and more expensive to extract .
" russia does n't have the technology to extract the gas and it 's becoming more and more expensive to get enough gas to send to europe and china , therefore the government has decided that they have to save gas in the country , " he said .
upcoming climate treaty in a recently released g8 climate scorecard , russia was listed in seventh place , only beating out canada , which is quite significant since both countries are kyoto signatories .
this comes just five months ahead of a crucial meeting in copenhagen which is intended to hammer out a new climate agreement .
government officials begin another round of climate talks in bonn on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international feathers were ruffled two years ago when a russian submarine planted a flag on the sea floor of the north pole given its geographical location , the argument could be made that russia would be one of the very few countries that would benefit from global warming melting huge swaths of ice , providing better access to oil and gas reserves buried deep beneath arctic waters .
kokorin both agrees and disagrees with the assessment .
yes , he admitted , less ice would make extraction of gas and oil from the barents sea much easier .
however , melting permafrost would make it more difficult and expensive to extract current known reserves in siberia .
claudia kemfert says there are many voices within russia , especially scientists , saying that climate change is positive for russia and that they would benefit because the ice would decrease and then the access would be improved .
russia signed the kyoto protocol , said kemfert , because in the mid-90s it was still an emerging nation trying to get back on its feet after the fall of the soviet union .
the russians were treated much the same way as india and china are being treated in relation to the copenhagen agreement .
now that they 're among the world eight richest nations , they ca n't exactly claim that they need to be handled with kid gloves .
there is also the small matter of who actually owns the gas and oil reserves in the arctic .
with just over 24,000 kilometers -lrb- 15,000 miles -rrb- of arctic coastline , russia certainly has a claim .
but so do the united states , canada , norway , and denmark .
rough estimates put the amount of oil and gas in the arctic at 20 percent of the total global reserves on the planet .
with that kind of potential , said kemfert , it wo n't matter to russia if the ice is there or not .
" of course they 'll try and sell it to the rest of the world , even if the ice is there , " she said .
" it 's much more expensive to drill into the sea with the ice , but they 've already been doing it in parts of siberia . "
