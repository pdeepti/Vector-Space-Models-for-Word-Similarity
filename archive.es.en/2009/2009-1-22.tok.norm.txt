22 , that he evaded 966,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in taxes related to inherited funds he had hidden in the alpine principality of liechtenstein .
german tax authorities had accused zumwinkel , 65 , of concealing the money in trust funds managed by the ltg bank in liechtenstein .
he was detained in february 2008 after prosecutors obtained evidence from germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service on trusts administered by the bank on behalf of wealthy tax-evading europeans .
released on bail after a search of his villa , zumwinkel resigned shortly afterwards as head of deutsche post , one of the world 's leading logistics companies with a global workforce of more 350,000 .
later , he stepped down from positions on the boards of other leading german companies such as deutsche telekom , lufthansa and retailer arcandor .
prosectors say zumwinkel set up a trust for himself in liechtenstein in 1986 but failed to disclose earnings and dividends from it to german tax authorities , as required by law .
if convicted he could face jail and a hefty fine .
unconfirmed reports ahead of the trial said zumwinkel would enter a plea of guilty in return for a reduced sentence .
the verdict is expected on monday .
zumwinkel was one of hundreds of wealthy germans exposed when a liechtenstein bank employee betrayed them by selling a stolen dvd with details of their accounts to the bnd for about 5 million euros .
since then , german prosecutors have recovered more than 150 million euros in arrears from repentant taxpayers hoping to ward off trials . dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 22.01.2009 opinion : tax evasion trial no mere slap on the wrist großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the much-anticipated tax evasion trial is underway of a former top manager who hid money in lichtenstein .
deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky says that the million-euro fine is only the beginning . the case is fairly cut and dry , meaning the trial will likely be short .
as former head of postal giant deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel was germany 's best-known top manager , a man with an irreproachable reputation .
soon after zumwinkel 's spectacular arrest outside his villa in a posh suburb of cologne , he made a complete confession and quickly transferred the money he owed to the tax office in cologne .
the court in bochum has set aside two days for the case , but the trial could come to end even more quickly .
zumwinkel 's defense lawyer and the prosecutor 's office in bochum have reached an agreement for the court to adopt .
not only that , but a legal overhaul for prosecuting tax fraud cases similar to zumwinkel 's , which involves undeclared interest income from private foundations in lichtenstein , has already been agreed to .
the result : if the defendant offers up a guilty plea and shows remorse , he or she can expect a hefty fine and up to a two year suspended sentence .
this setup keeps offenders from facing time behind bars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky while it bothers many citizens ' delicate sense of justice , such outcomes are almost always the norm when it comes to economic crimes .
one reason is that the justice system is hopelessly overloaded .
for example , there are approximately 700 pending cases against tax cheats in bochum alone .
in all cases , people stashed money and interest earnings in lichtenstein in order to conceal it from the local tax authorities .
another reason is that jails would have to be expanded if all tax cheats were given the maximum penalty allowed by law .
the state would rather get money for the misdeeds of the past and honesty in the future .
a first liechtenstein tax evasion case against a multi-millionaire from bad homburg resulted in a penalty of 7.5 million euros -lrb- $ 9.8 million -rrb- as well as a two year sentence .
klaus zumwinkel will not face as harsh a penalty since his tax fraud was less than 1 million euros .
as a young man , before heading up the post , he and his brother inherited 10 department stores and 50 discount stores .
they sold this small empire in 1971 and with the 12 million euros in proceedings , zumwinkel started the private “ devotion family foundation ” in liechtenstein , which he used to conceal interest income from tax authorities .
yet the current court case only covers earnings from the last four years .
it appears that during the time in question , the prosecutor 's office in bochum was absorbed in internal office intrigues and power struggles which resulted in the office falling behind schedule in its day-to-day task of handling files .
for zumwinkel , this means that his tax evasion case will remain just under the 1 million euro mark .
the federal court of justice recently mandated an obligatory prison sentences for amounts over 1 million euros .
you could say that zumwinkel has fortune in injustice .
in the past , many other tax evaders have profited from the government 's practice of handing out high fines and suspended sentences .
the government is more interested in money than in filling its jails .
the moral of the story : earthly justice is relative .
a multi-millionaire like klaus zumwinkel can get over a million-euro fine .
but much more difficult for him was being forced out of deutsche post and his loss of many board of director positions and honorary posts .
he has also faced social ostracism and an empty appointment calendar .
in the meantime , part of the tour program for visitors to cologne includes a stop outside zumwinkel 's villa where he was arrested about one year ago in front of television cameras .
not surprisingly , the erstwhile top manager has retreated with increasing frequency to his castle in south tyrol .

the forecast was slightly more pessimistic than the german government 's , but both expect the weakest economic performance by far since world war ii .
germany faces a recession that is expected to be " sizeable and extended , " according to the imf . only two months ago , the washington based institution which oversees the world financial system , had said that germany would contract just 0.8 percent this year .
next year , germany can a expect an incremental recovery after the gloomy downward projection , but the imf warned that " risks remain tilted to the downside . "
in 2010 , germany , one of the world 's biggest exporters , can expect the economy to grow by just 0.1 percent , according to the fund 's projections .
berlin publishes bleak economic assessment on wednesday , the german government 's annual economics report predicted rising unemployment as a result of the global economic slowdown .
the number of people out of work is expected to climb by 500,000 to 3.5 million before the end of the year .
that would push the german unemployment rate back up to 8.4 percent , according to the report .
reflecting the slump in germany 's export-oriented economy , carmaker audi on thursday said it would stop production for five days in february at its biggest german plant as orders for new cars plummet .
" we do not know yet whether we will move to cut working hours , which would be a first for audi , or whether to put in place a time-savings account , " a spokesman told news agency afp .
the move follows a similar announcement by europe 's leading auto maker volkswagen , which said on tuesday it would idle about two thirds of its 92,000 german workforce for one week next month as it cuts production .
imf : germany needs to take lead the imf however did praise europe 's largest economy for its efforts to stave off the impact of a recession with stimulus measures and bank bailouts .
last week the german authorities approved a 50 billion euro -lrb- $ 65 billion -rrb- package that would boost government spending for road projects , public transport , school and hospitals , and would include tax cuts to encourage spending .
" global policy actions and measures to contain the risk of a costly global self-reinforcing slump should preferably be co-ordinated regionally and internationally for maximum effect .

its goal will be to speed the development and use of alternative energy sources , german environment minister sigmar gabriel told news organizations on wednesday , jan .

but he added that there is still a lot of work to be done in order to spread their use .
important political support is needed .
germany 's undersecretary of state for development , erich stather , said poor countries in particular are in need of a " sea change " when it comes to energy resources .
more than two billion people around the world have no access to modern energy sources , and improved use of renewable energy can help those countries develop , he said over 60 percent of the conference participants will come from developing countries .

germany is pushing for it to be based in bonn - also the home of the secretariat of the un framework convention on climate change , the body tasked with crafting a new global climate deal in copenhagen in december .
representatives from the united states , china and japan would attend the conference , but are not expected to sign the founding document immediately , gabriel said .
the eu is aiming for use renewable sources for 20 percent of its energy needs by 2020 .
in germany , 15 percent of electricity consumption comes from renewable sources of energy and the government aims to double this by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a compromise suggested by the finance ministry , luxury limousines , rather than being taxed at a higher-rate for their high fuel consumption , would in fact be given a break .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is supposed to be lowering co2 emissions the news has sparked an outraged response from some politicians and environmentalists .
green party objects to plan instead of promoting outdated gas-guzzlers , the government should be making sure germany is producing greener cars , green party parliamentary group leader baerbel hoehn told the web site of news magazine der spiegel . currently , owners of energy-inefficient cars are penalized because they are taxed based on co2 output .
but the new arrangement calls for a limit on taxes based on engine capacity .
that in turn would be advantageous to drivers of heavy cars .
according to news reports , the plans are almost finalized , and no big changes to the reform are expected .
however , a spokesman for the finance ministry said nothing had been definitively decided yet , german newspaper die zeit reported .
environment minister sigmar gabriel was said to be opposed to the plan , and said he would n't approve it in its current state , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .
the parliamentary party vice chairman of the social democratic party , ulrich kelber , complained to reporters that " it would be a joke to call this an environmentally-oriented co2 tax . "
car-wrecking hotline is swamped meanwhile , german car owners swamped a hotline with calls this week after the government invited applications for a big cash handout to anyone crushing an old car and buying a new one . berlin officials said the hotline registered 270,000 calls on the first day , monday , far more than telephonists at the trade agency bafa could answer .
on tuesday , the rush ebbed a little to 150,000 . the government has promised 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,250 -rrb- to anyone owning a car more than nine years old who takes it to the wreckers and buys a new low-pollution car . the payouts will continue until the budgeted 1.5 billion euros has been used up .
part of the sum will be for administrative costs , but the scheme is expected to bring nearly 600,000 new cars on the roads . # b # although the aim is to help germany 's troubled car manufacturing industry , imported cars will be treated the same as german-made ones . the " free " handout has been the talk of germany for days .
a free-for-all is expected next tuesday when the application form is to be offered on the bafa website to download .
some predict the budget may be used up within a week . even owners of late-model cars have wondered if they might benefit .
to curb abuse , the applicant must have owned the old car for at least one year and become the registered owner of the new car . bafa said thursday it was confident there would be enough money for all applicants , at least for the first few days . the old cars must be destroyed by wreckers , who remove all useful parts , glass and plastic and put the steel remains in a metal press . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

people in the former east of the country are especially worse off , says the study , which compared personal assets in 2002 and 2007 . the richest 10 percent of germans in 2007 owned around 61 percent of the country 's privately held assets , up from 58 percent five years earlier , a report from berlin economic institute diw showed .
the poorest 70 percent owned just under nine percent of the country 's wealth and 27 percent either own nothing or are in debt , according to the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty among the elderly could become a problem germans ' total assets were valued at 6.6 trillion euros -lrb- $ 8.5 trillion -rrb- , which amounts to an average 88,000 euros for each adult .
that is a 10 percent increase over 2002 , according to the poll commissioned by the hans boeckler foundation , which is close to trade unions .
total assets increased but the median level , the midway point between the highest and the lowest , stayed stuck at 15,000 euros - indicating that the rich got richer .
the wealth gap between what was once east and west germany also widened , the study showed .
in the west , assets rose almost 11 percent between 2002 and 2007 , but in the east they fell by just under 10 percent .
adjusted for inflation the fall was 17 percent .
" if politicians fail to act , poverty among the elderly in eastern germany will grow sharply in the future , " the report 's authors joachim frick and markus grabka said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

important political support is needed .
germany 's undersecretary of state for development , erich stather , said poor countries in particular are in need of a " sea change " when it comes to energy resources .
more than two billion people around the world have no access to modern energy sources , and improved use of renewable energy can help those countries develop , he said over 60 percent of the conference participants will come from developing countries .

representatives from the united states , china and japan would attend the conference , but are not expected to sign the founding document immediately , gabriel said .
the eu is aiming for use renewable sources for 20 percent of its energy needs by 2020 .

21 , to hold talks with eu foreign ministers .
" in order to help in answering the humanitarian need in the gaza strip , we are willing to cooperate in this as far as it is needed , " livni told reporters on wednesday .
she maintained that " the right of israel to defend itself includes not only defending itself against the firing of missiles , but also in terms of smuggling of weapons . "
humanitarian aid in focus wednesday evening 's talks were called by the eu in a bid to secure the immediate access of humanitarian aid into gaza and to start discussions on reviving the stalled middle east peace process .
foreign minister karel schwarzenberg of the czech republic , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , measured the meeting 's success by livni 's assurances that " everything will be done from the israeli side to have an effective humanitarian aid into the gaza strip . "

she dismissed calls for international prosecutors to try israeli military officers for war crimes .
" the israeli army works according to international values , " said livni , insisting that a distinction had to be made between those who are " killed by mistake " and terrorists who " aim and fire at civilians . "
the meeting in brussels took place amid tight security , with police in riot gear keeping about 100 pro-palestinian protesters well away from the building where the talks were held .
eu seeks common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon visited gaza - and wants action livni arrived about an hour after the rest of the attendees to give her eu counterparts time to forge a common position .
prior to the meeting , differences had emerged among eu members about the need to hold direct talks with hamas .
" there is no possibility of reaching a permanent peace without everyone getting around the same table , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb .
" no comprehensive solution can be taken without hamas . "
schwarzenberg had told the european parliament as recently as tuesday that no formal contacts should be held with hamas until the organization renounced terrorism .
the talks in brussels came a day after un secretary general ban ki-moon became the highest-ranking foreign official to visit gaza and assess first hand the damage caused by the three-week conflict with israel .
further talks planned back at united nations headquarters wednesday in new york , ban told the security council that a thorough investigation should be made of israeli attacks that struck several un facilities in gaza during the conflict .

21 , to hold talks with eu foreign ministers .
" in order to help in answering the humanitarian need in the gaza strip , we are willing to cooperate in this as far as it is needed , " livni told reporters on wednesday .
she maintained that " the right of israel to defend itself includes not only defending itself against the firing of missiles , but also in terms of smuggling of weapons . "
humanitarian aid in focus wednesday evening 's talks were called by the eu in a bid to secure the immediate access of humanitarian aid into gaza and to start discussions on reviving the stalled middle east peace process .
foreign minister karel schwarzenberg of the czech republic , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , measured the meeting 's success by livni 's assurances that " everything will be done from the israeli side to have an effective humanitarian aid into the gaza strip . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni insists israel 's must defend itself against smuggled weapons livni focused on the need to stop the alleged armament of hamas by iran via egyptian territory .
" from our perspective , we achieved ... an understanding about the need to give an answer to the smuggling of weapons to the gaza strip , " she said .
monitors still await entry no deal was believed to have been reached on how many crossings should be reopened , for how long or how they should be monitored .
the eu maintained a small monitoring team at the rafah crossing from 2005-07 , when the monitors had to be withdrawn after hamas violently seized control of the coastal enclave .
some 40 eu monitors are now on standby in nearby ashkelon , israel , waiting to be redeployed to the gaza border .
while eu foreign policy chief javier solana said that his office would spare no effort to bring aid to gaza civilians , none of the participants at wednesday 's meeting announced the monitors ' imminent return to rafah .
' international values ' livni said that the ceasefire was still being " tested " and again rejected direct talks with hamas .
she dismissed calls for international prosecutors to try israeli military officers for war crimes .
" the israeli army works according to international values , " said livni , insisting that a distinction had to be made between those who are " killed by mistake " and terrorists who " aim and fire at civilians . "
the meeting in brussels took place amid tight security , with police in riot gear keeping about 100 pro-palestinian protesters well away from the building where the talks were held .
eu seeks common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon visited gaza - and wants action livni arrived about an hour after the rest of the attendees to give her eu counterparts time to forge a common position .
prior to the meeting , differences had emerged among eu members about the need to hold direct talks with hamas .
" there is no possibility of reaching a permanent peace without everyone getting around the same table , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb .
" no comprehensive solution can be taken without hamas . "
schwarzenberg had told the european parliament as recently as tuesday that no formal contacts should be held with hamas until the organization renounced terrorism .
the talks in brussels came a day after un secretary general ban ki-moon became the highest-ranking foreign official to visit gaza and assess first hand the damage caused by the three-week conflict with israel .
further talks planned back at united nations headquarters wednesday in new york , ban told the security council that a thorough investigation should be made of israeli attacks that struck several un facilities in gaza during the conflict .
the responsible parties must be held accountable , he said .
brussels diplomats said they were in close contact with new us president barack obama , who earlier wednesday - his first full day in office - called four key middle east leaders to promise his immediate engagement in the israeli-palestinian peace process .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 22.01.2009 opinion : tax evasion trial no mere slap on the wrist großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the much-anticipated tax evasion trial is underway of a former top manager who hid money in lichtenstein .
deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky says that the million-euro fine is only the beginning . the case is fairly cut and dry , meaning the trial will likely be short .
as former head of postal giant deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel was germany 's best-known top manager , a man with an irreproachable reputation .
soon after zumwinkel 's spectacular arrest outside his villa in a posh suburb of cologne , he made a complete confession and quickly transferred the money he owed to the tax office in cologne .
the court in bochum has set aside two days for the case , but the trial could come to end even more quickly .
zumwinkel 's defense lawyer and the prosecutor 's office in bochum have reached an agreement for the court to adopt .
not only that , but a legal overhaul for prosecuting tax fraud cases similar to zumwinkel 's , which involves undeclared interest income from private foundations in lichtenstein , has already been agreed to .
the result : if the defendant offers up a guilty plea and shows remorse , he or she can expect a hefty fine and up to a two year suspended sentence .
this setup keeps offenders from facing time behind bars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky while it bothers many citizens ' delicate sense of justice , such outcomes are almost always the norm when it comes to economic crimes .
one reason is that the justice system is hopelessly overloaded .
for example , there are approximately 700 pending cases against tax cheats in bochum alone .
in all cases , people stashed money and interest earnings in lichtenstein in order to conceal it from the local tax authorities .
another reason is that jails would have to be expanded if all tax cheats were given the maximum penalty allowed by law .
the state would rather get money for the misdeeds of the past and honesty in the future .
a first liechtenstein tax evasion case against a multi-millionaire from bad homburg resulted in a penalty of 7.5 million euros -lrb- $ 9.8 million -rrb- as well as a two year sentence .
klaus zumwinkel will not face as harsh a penalty since his tax fraud was less than 1 million euros .
as a young man , before heading up the post , he and his brother inherited 10 department stores and 50 discount stores .
they sold this small empire in 1971 and with the 12 million euros in proceedings , zumwinkel started the private “ devotion family foundation ” in liechtenstein , which he used to conceal interest income from tax authorities .
yet the current court case only covers earnings from the last four years .
it appears that during the time in question , the prosecutor 's office in bochum was absorbed in internal office intrigues and power struggles which resulted in the office falling behind schedule in its day-to-day task of handling files .
for zumwinkel , this means that his tax evasion case will remain just under the 1 million euro mark .
the federal court of justice recently mandated an obligatory prison sentences for amounts over 1 million euros .
you could say that zumwinkel has fortune in injustice .
in the past , many other tax evaders have profited from the government 's practice of handing out high fines and suspended sentences .
the government is more interested in money than in filling its jails .
the moral of the story : earthly justice is relative .
a multi-millionaire like klaus zumwinkel can get over a million-euro fine .
but much more difficult for him was being forced out of deutsche post and his loss of many board of director positions and honorary posts .
he has also faced social ostracism and an empty appointment calendar .
in the meantime , part of the tour program for visitors to cologne includes a stop outside zumwinkel 's villa where he was arrested about one year ago in front of television cameras .
not surprisingly , the erstwhile top manager has retreated with increasing frequency to his castle in south tyrol .

the forecast was slightly more pessimistic than the german government 's , but both expect the weakest economic performance by far since world war ii .
germany faces a recession that is expected to be " sizeable and extended , " according to the imf . only two months ago , the washington based institution which oversees the world financial system , had said that germany would contract just 0.8 percent this year .
next year , germany can a expect an incremental recovery after the gloomy downward projection , but the imf warned that " risks remain tilted to the downside . "
in 2010 , germany , one of the world 's biggest exporters , can expect the economy to grow by just 0.1 percent , according to the fund 's projections .
berlin publishes bleak economic assessment on wednesday , the german government 's annual economics report predicted rising unemployment as a result of the global economic slowdown .
the number of people out of work is expected to climb by 500,000 to 3.5 million before the end of the year .
that would push the german unemployment rate back up to 8.4 percent , according to the report .
reflecting the slump in germany 's export-oriented economy , carmaker audi on thursday said it would stop production for five days in february at its biggest german plant as orders for new cars plummet .
" we do not know yet whether we will move to cut working hours , which would be a first for audi , or whether to put in place a time-savings account , " a spokesman told news agency afp .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 22.01.2009 opinion : tax evasion trial no mere slap on the wrist großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the much-anticipated tax evasion trial is underway of a former top manager who hid money in lichtenstein .
deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky says that the million-euro fine is only the beginning . the case is fairly cut and dry , meaning the trial will likely be short .
as former head of postal giant deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel was germany 's best-known top manager , a man with an irreproachable reputation .
soon after zumwinkel 's spectacular arrest outside his villa in a posh suburb of cologne , he made a complete confession and quickly transferred the money he owed to the tax office in cologne .
the court in bochum has set aside two days for the case , but the trial could come to end even more quickly .
zumwinkel 's defense lawyer and the prosecutor 's office in bochum have reached an agreement for the court to adopt .
not only that , but a legal overhaul for prosecuting tax fraud cases similar to zumwinkel 's , which involves undeclared interest income from private foundations in lichtenstein , has already been agreed to .
the result : if the defendant offers up a guilty plea and shows remorse , he or she can expect a hefty fine and up to a two year suspended sentence .
this setup keeps offenders from facing time behind bars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky while it bothers many citizens ' delicate sense of justice , such outcomes are almost always the norm when it comes to economic crimes .
one reason is that the justice system is hopelessly overloaded .
for example , there are approximately 700 pending cases against tax cheats in bochum alone .
in all cases , people stashed money and interest earnings in lichtenstein in order to conceal it from the local tax authorities .
another reason is that jails would have to be expanded if all tax cheats were given the maximum penalty allowed by law .
the state would rather get money for the misdeeds of the past and honesty in the future .
a first liechtenstein tax evasion case against a multi-millionaire from bad homburg resulted in a penalty of 7.5 million euros -lrb- $ 9.8 million -rrb- as well as a two year sentence .
klaus zumwinkel will not face as harsh a penalty since his tax fraud was less than 1 million euros .
as a young man , before heading up the post , he and his brother inherited 10 department stores and 50 discount stores .
they sold this small empire in 1971 and with the 12 million euros in proceedings , zumwinkel started the private “ devotion family foundation ” in liechtenstein , which he used to conceal interest income from tax authorities .
yet the current court case only covers earnings from the last four years .
it appears that during the time in question , the prosecutor 's office in bochum was absorbed in internal office intrigues and power struggles which resulted in the office falling behind schedule in its day-to-day task of handling files .
for zumwinkel , this means that his tax evasion case will remain just under the 1 million euro mark .
the federal court of justice recently mandated an obligatory prison sentences for amounts over 1 million euros .
you could say that zumwinkel has fortune in injustice .
in the past , many other tax evaders have profited from the government 's practice of handing out high fines and suspended sentences .
the government is more interested in money than in filling its jails .
the moral of the story : earthly justice is relative .
a multi-millionaire like klaus zumwinkel can get over a million-euro fine .
but much more difficult for him was being forced out of deutsche post and his loss of many board of director positions and honorary posts .
he has also faced social ostracism and an empty appointment calendar .
in the meantime , part of the tour program for visitors to cologne includes a stop outside zumwinkel 's villa where he was arrested about one year ago in front of television cameras .
not surprisingly , the erstwhile top manager has retreated with increasing frequency to his castle in south tyrol .

people in the former east of the country are especially worse off , says the study , which compared personal assets in 2002 and 2007 . the richest 10 percent of germans in 2007 owned around 61 percent of the country 's privately held assets , up from 58 percent five years earlier , a report from berlin economic institute diw showed .
the poorest 70 percent owned just under nine percent of the country 's wealth and 27 percent either own nothing or are in debt , according to the study .

that is a 10 percent increase over 2002 , according to the poll commissioned by the hans boeckler foundation , which is close to trade unions .
total assets increased but the median level , the midway point between the highest and the lowest , stayed stuck at 15,000 euros - indicating that the rich got richer .
the wealth gap between what was once east and west germany also widened , the study showed .
in the west , assets rose almost 11 percent between 2002 and 2007 , but in the east they fell by just under 10 percent .
adjusted for inflation the fall was 17 percent .

21 , to hold talks with eu foreign ministers .
" in order to help in answering the humanitarian need in the gaza strip , we are willing to cooperate in this as far as it is needed , " livni told reporters on wednesday .
she maintained that " the right of israel to defend itself includes not only defending itself against the firing of missiles , but also in terms of smuggling of weapons . "
humanitarian aid in focus wednesday evening 's talks were called by the eu in a bid to secure the immediate access of humanitarian aid into gaza and to start discussions on reviving the stalled middle east peace process .
foreign minister karel schwarzenberg of the czech republic , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , measured the meeting 's success by livni 's assurances that " everything will be done from the israeli side to have an effective humanitarian aid into the gaza strip . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni insists israel 's must defend itself against smuggled weapons livni focused on the need to stop the alleged armament of hamas by iran via egyptian territory .
" from our perspective , we achieved ... an understanding about the need to give an answer to the smuggling of weapons to the gaza strip , " she said .
monitors still await entry no deal was believed to have been reached on how many crossings should be reopened , for how long or how they should be monitored .
the eu maintained a small monitoring team at the rafah crossing from 2005-07 , when the monitors had to be withdrawn after hamas violently seized control of the coastal enclave .
some 40 eu monitors are now on standby in nearby ashkelon , israel , waiting to be redeployed to the gaza border .
while eu foreign policy chief javier solana said that his office would spare no effort to bring aid to gaza civilians , none of the participants at wednesday 's meeting announced the monitors ' imminent return to rafah .
' international values ' livni said that the ceasefire was still being " tested " and again rejected direct talks with hamas .
she dismissed calls for international prosecutors to try israeli military officers for war crimes .
" the israeli army works according to international values , " said livni , insisting that a distinction had to be made between those who are " killed by mistake " and terrorists who " aim and fire at civilians . "
the meeting in brussels took place amid tight security , with police in riot gear keeping about 100 pro-palestinian protesters well away from the building where the talks were held .
eu seeks common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon visited gaza - and wants action livni arrived about an hour after the rest of the attendees to give her eu counterparts time to forge a common position .
prior to the meeting , differences had emerged among eu members about the need to hold direct talks with hamas .
" there is no possibility of reaching a permanent peace without everyone getting around the same table , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb .
" no comprehensive solution can be taken without hamas . "
schwarzenberg had told the european parliament as recently as tuesday that no formal contacts should be held with hamas until the organization renounced terrorism .
the talks in brussels came a day after un secretary general ban ki-moon became the highest-ranking foreign official to visit gaza and assess first hand the damage caused by the three-week conflict with israel .
further talks planned back at united nations headquarters wednesday in new york , ban told the security council that a thorough investigation should be made of israeli attacks that struck several un facilities in gaza during the conflict .
the responsible parties must be held accountable , he said .
brussels diplomats said they were in close contact with new us president barack obama , who earlier wednesday - his first full day in office - called four key middle east leaders to promise his immediate engagement in the israeli-palestinian peace process .
eu foreign ministers were to hold a separate talks sunday in brussels with representatives from egypt , jordan , turkey and the palestinian authority . dpa news agency -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

people in the former east of the country are especially worse off , says the study , which compared personal assets in 2002 and 2007 . the richest 10 percent of germans in 2007 owned around 61 percent of the country 's privately held assets , up from 58 percent five years earlier , a report from berlin economic institute diw showed .
the poorest 70 percent owned just under nine percent of the country 's wealth and 27 percent either own nothing or are in debt , according to the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty among the elderly could become a problem germans ' total assets were valued at 6.6 trillion euros -lrb- $ 8.5 trillion -rrb- , which amounts to an average 88,000 euros for each adult .
that is a 10 percent increase over 2002 , according to the poll commissioned by the hans boeckler foundation , which is close to trade unions .
total assets increased but the median level , the midway point between the highest and the lowest , stayed stuck at 15,000 euros - indicating that the rich got richer .
the wealth gap between what was once east and west germany also widened , the study showed .
in the west , assets rose almost 11 percent between 2002 and 2007 , but in the east they fell by just under 10 percent .
adjusted for inflation the fall was 17 percent .
" if politicians fail to act , poverty among the elderly in eastern germany will grow sharply in the future , " the report 's authors joachim frick and markus grabka said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 22.01.2009 report : germany 's revised car-tax could benefit gas guzzlers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thirsty cars with a high co2 output could be the winners of the tax reform germany may give a break to drivers of big cars , turning an attempt at an ecologically oriented tax reform into a boon for gas guzzlers , one newspaper reported . some german lawmakers have moved to alter plans for a car tax , resulting in favorable conditions for cars that burn a lot of fuel , the sueddeutsche zeitung reported .
in a compromise suggested by the finance ministry , luxury limousines , rather than being taxed at a higher-rate for their high fuel consumption , would in fact be given a break .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is supposed to be lowering co2 emissions the news has sparked an outraged response from some politicians and environmentalists .
green party objects to plan instead of promoting outdated gas-guzzlers , the government should be making sure germany is producing greener cars , green party parliamentary group leader baerbel hoehn told the web site of news magazine der spiegel . currently , owners of energy-inefficient cars are penalized because they are taxed based on co2 output .
but the new arrangement calls for a limit on taxes based on engine capacity .
that in turn would be advantageous to drivers of heavy cars .
according to news reports , the plans are almost finalized , and no big changes to the reform are expected .
however , a spokesman for the finance ministry said nothing had been definitively decided yet , german newspaper die zeit reported .
environment minister sigmar gabriel was said to be opposed to the plan , and said he would n't approve it in its current state , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .
the parliamentary party vice chairman of the social democratic party , ulrich kelber , complained to reporters that " it would be a joke to call this an environmentally-oriented co2 tax . "
car-wrecking hotline is swamped meanwhile , german car owners swamped a hotline with calls this week after the government invited applications for a big cash handout to anyone crushing an old car and buying a new one . berlin officials said the hotline registered 270,000 calls on the first day , monday , far more than telephonists at the trade agency bafa could answer .
on tuesday , the rush ebbed a little to 150,000 . the government has promised 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,250 -rrb- to anyone owning a car more than nine years old who takes it to the wreckers and buys a new low-pollution car . the payouts will continue until the budgeted 1.5 billion euros has been used up .
part of the sum will be for administrative costs , but the scheme is expected to bring nearly 600,000 new cars on the roads . # b # although the aim is to help germany 's troubled car manufacturing industry , imported cars will be treated the same as german-made ones . the " free " handout has been the talk of germany for days .
a free-for-all is expected next tuesday when the application form is to be offered on the bafa website to download .
some predict the budget may be used up within a week . even owners of late-model cars have wondered if they might benefit .
to curb abuse , the applicant must have owned the old car for at least one year and become the registered owner of the new car . bafa said thursday it was confident there would be enough money for all applicants , at least for the first few days . the old cars must be destroyed by wreckers , who remove all useful parts , glass and plastic and put the steel remains in a metal press . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

former senator and northern ireland peace mediator george mitchell was appointed to bring peace between the palestinians and israelis in the middle east .
ambassador richard holbrooke , the architect of the dayton accords which ended the bosnian war , was charged with implementing us policy towards afghanistan and pakistan . barack obama told a press conference he would send mitchell to the region " as soon as possible " to ensure a " durable " and " sustainable " ceasefire in gaza .
germany to work with us on mideast , iran steinmeier 's office said thursday the german foreign minister had telephoned with clinton and agreed to meet soon .
steinmeier " thanked his american counterpart for her government 's determination to quickly engage itself in the middle east conflict , " the german foreign ministry said in a statement .
earlier , in a letter of congratulations to the new secretary of state , steinmeier said he intended to build on strong us-german ties .
" let us work together to find solutions for the great challenges of our time starting from the solid german-american relationship that has closely and amicably connected us , " steinmeier wrote . he said important points for cooperation will be conflict in the middle east , climate change , iran ’ s nuclear programme and the financial crisis .
clinton took her place in barack obama 's new cabinet , a day after he was sworn in as us president .
on thursday , a beaming clinton greeted her new colleagues at the us state department , promising a change in how the united states deals with the rest of the world .
clinton was president barack obama 's democratic rival .
after his win in november of 2008 , clinton became obama 's surprise choice to oversee the 20,000-strong us state department .
" i believe with all my heart that this is a new era for america , " clinton told a crowd of state department employees who had gathered to welcome the former democratic senator from new york to her first day as america 's top diplomat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , seen here with israeli president shimon peres , is pushing for a lasting solution to the mideast conflict in his letter , steinmeier reminded clinton of the long friendship between germany and the united states and said he expected the relationship to be further strengthened under obama .
he said that he supported clinton 's goal of creating a world " with more friends and fewer opponents " and overcoming " hate , violence , lawlessness and despair . "
" i would like to offer you my full support for this policy , " he wrote .
clinton has said she will advocate the use of " smart power " - which combines diplomatic and economic influence with military strength - to reach us objectives in the world .
clinton , whose husband is former us president bill clinton , took over the state department reigns from outgoing us secretary of state condoleezza rice .
us mum on whether it will talk with iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants the us to directly talk with iran germany is one of six countries working together in a bid to persuade iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions .
steinmeier has long called on washington to consider direct talks with the leadership in tehran .
at her confirmation hearing last week , clinton told the senate foreign relations committee that the obama administration would pursue " an attitude toward engagement -lrb- with iran -rrb- that might bear fruit . "
but she did not mention whether washington would set conditions for such a change in us policy after nearly 30 years of official silence with tehran .
us wants to lead on climate change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton said the us wants to take a lead role in climate protection clinton also made it clear that the obama administration planned to make climate change a priority . " we will pursue an energy policy that reduces our carbon emissions while reducing our dependence on foreign oil and gas , fighting climate change and enhancing our economic and energy security , " clinton said .
she told her audience that the obama administration wanted the us to be " a leader in developing and implementing a global and coordinated response to climate change . "
middle east remains a top concern as for the recent conflict between israel and palestine , clinton said the new administration will commit itself to reaching " a just and lasting peace agreement . "
other foreign relations priorities for clinton will be the unfinished wars in iraq and afghanistan , conflicts in africa and efforts to revamp the tarnished us image overseas . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a compromise suggested by the finance ministry , luxury limousines , rather than being taxed at a higher-rate for their high fuel consumption , would in fact be given a break .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is supposed to be lowering co2 emissions the news has sparked an outraged response from some politicians and environmentalists .
green party objects to plan instead of promoting outdated gas-guzzlers , the government should be making sure germany is producing greener cars , green party parliamentary group leader baerbel hoehn told the web site of news magazine der spiegel . currently , owners of energy-inefficient cars are penalized because they are taxed based on co2 output .
but the new arrangement calls for a limit on taxes based on engine capacity .
that in turn would be advantageous to drivers of heavy cars .
according to news reports , the plans are almost finalized , and no big changes to the reform are expected .
however , a spokesman for the finance ministry said nothing had been definitively decided yet , german newspaper die zeit reported .
environment minister sigmar gabriel was said to be opposed to the plan , and said he would n't approve it in its current state , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .
the parliamentary party vice chairman of the social democratic party , ulrich kelber , complained to reporters that " it would be a joke to call this an environmentally-oriented co2 tax . "
car-wrecking hotline is swamped meanwhile , german car owners swamped a hotline with calls this week after the government invited applications for a big cash handout to anyone crushing an old car and buying a new one . berlin officials said the hotline registered 270,000 calls on the first day , monday , far more than telephonists at the trade agency bafa could answer .
on tuesday , the rush ebbed a little to 150,000 . the government has promised 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,250 -rrb- to anyone owning a car more than nine years old who takes it to the wreckers and buys a new low-pollution car . the payouts will continue until the budgeted 1.5 billion euros has been used up .
part of the sum will be for administrative costs , but the scheme is expected to bring nearly 600,000 new cars on the roads . # b # although the aim is to help germany 's troubled car manufacturing industry , imported cars will be treated the same as german-made ones . the " free " handout has been the talk of germany for days .
a free-for-all is expected next tuesday when the application form is to be offered on the bafa website to download .
some predict the budget may be used up within a week . even owners of late-model cars have wondered if they might benefit .
to curb abuse , the applicant must have owned the old car for at least one year and become the registered owner of the new car . bafa said thursday it was confident there would be enough money for all applicants , at least for the first few days . the old cars must be destroyed by wreckers , who remove all useful parts , glass and plastic and put the steel remains in a metal press . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is supposed to be lowering co2 emissions the news has sparked an outraged response from some politicians and environmentalists .
green party objects to plan instead of promoting outdated gas-guzzlers , the government should be making sure germany is producing greener cars , green party parliamentary group leader baerbel hoehn told the web site of news magazine der spiegel . currently , owners of energy-inefficient cars are penalized because they are taxed based on co2 output .
but the new arrangement calls for a limit on taxes based on engine capacity .
that in turn would be advantageous to drivers of heavy cars .
according to news reports , the plans are almost finalized , and no big changes to the reform are expected .
however , a spokesman for the finance ministry said nothing had been definitively decided yet , german newspaper die zeit reported .
environment minister sigmar gabriel was said to be opposed to the plan , and said he would n't approve it in its current state , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .

part of the sum will be for administrative costs , but the scheme is expected to bring nearly 600,000 new cars on the roads . # b # although the aim is to help germany 's troubled car manufacturing industry , imported cars will be treated the same as german-made ones . the " free " handout has been the talk of germany for days .
a free-for-all is expected next tuesday when the application form is to be offered on the bafa website to download .
some predict the budget may be used up within a week . even owners of late-model cars have wondered if they might benefit .

22 , that he evaded 966,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in taxes related to inherited funds he had hidden in the alpine principality of liechtenstein .
german tax authorities had accused zumwinkel , 65 , of concealing the money in trust funds managed by the ltg bank in liechtenstein .
he was detained in february 2008 after prosecutors obtained evidence from germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service on trusts administered by the bank on behalf of wealthy tax-evading europeans .
released on bail after a search of his villa , zumwinkel resigned shortly afterwards as head of deutsche post , one of the world 's leading logistics companies with a global workforce of more 350,000 .
later , he stepped down from positions on the boards of other leading german companies such as deutsche telekom , lufthansa and retailer arcandor .
prosectors say zumwinkel set up a trust for himself in liechtenstein in 1986 but failed to disclose earnings and dividends from it to german tax authorities , as required by law .
if convicted he could face jail and a hefty fine .
unconfirmed reports ahead of the trial said zumwinkel would enter a plea of guilty in return for a reduced sentence .
the verdict is expected on monday .
zumwinkel was one of hundreds of wealthy germans exposed when a liechtenstein bank employee betrayed them by selling a stolen dvd with details of their accounts to the bnd for about 5 million euros .
since then , german prosecutors have recovered more than 150 million euros in arrears from repentant taxpayers hoping to ward off trials . dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 , that he evaded 966,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in taxes related to inherited funds he had hidden in the alpine principality of liechtenstein .
german tax authorities had accused zumwinkel , 65 , of concealing the money in trust funds managed by the ltg bank in liechtenstein .
he was detained in february 2008 after prosecutors obtained evidence from germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service on trusts administered by the bank on behalf of wealthy tax-evading europeans .
released on bail after a search of his villa , zumwinkel resigned shortly afterwards as head of deutsche post , one of the world 's leading logistics companies with a global workforce of more 350,000 .
later , he stepped down from positions on the boards of other leading german companies such as deutsche telekom , lufthansa and retailer arcandor .
prosectors say zumwinkel set up a trust for himself in liechtenstein in 1986 but failed to disclose earnings and dividends from it to german tax authorities , as required by law .
if convicted he could face jail and a hefty fine .
unconfirmed reports ahead of the trial said zumwinkel would enter a plea of guilty in return for a reduced sentence .
the verdict is expected on monday .
zumwinkel was one of hundreds of wealthy germans exposed when a liechtenstein bank employee betrayed them by selling a stolen dvd with details of their accounts to the bnd for about 5 million euros .
since then , german prosecutors have recovered more than 150 million euros in arrears from repentant taxpayers hoping to ward off trials . dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 , to hold talks with eu foreign ministers .
" in order to help in answering the humanitarian need in the gaza strip , we are willing to cooperate in this as far as it is needed , " livni told reporters on wednesday .
she maintained that " the right of israel to defend itself includes not only defending itself against the firing of missiles , but also in terms of smuggling of weapons . "
humanitarian aid in focus wednesday evening 's talks were called by the eu in a bid to secure the immediate access of humanitarian aid into gaza and to start discussions on reviving the stalled middle east peace process .
foreign minister karel schwarzenberg of the czech republic , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , measured the meeting 's success by livni 's assurances that " everything will be done from the israeli side to have an effective humanitarian aid into the gaza strip . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni insists israel 's must defend itself against smuggled weapons livni focused on the need to stop the alleged armament of hamas by iran via egyptian territory .
" from our perspective , we achieved ... an understanding about the need to give an answer to the smuggling of weapons to the gaza strip , " she said .
monitors still await entry no deal was believed to have been reached on how many crossings should be reopened , for how long or how they should be monitored .
the eu maintained a small monitoring team at the rafah crossing from 2005-07 , when the monitors had to be withdrawn after hamas violently seized control of the coastal enclave .
some 40 eu monitors are now on standby in nearby ashkelon , israel , waiting to be redeployed to the gaza border .
while eu foreign policy chief javier solana said that his office would spare no effort to bring aid to gaza civilians , none of the participants at wednesday 's meeting announced the monitors ' imminent return to rafah .
' international values ' livni said that the ceasefire was still being " tested " and again rejected direct talks with hamas .
she dismissed calls for international prosecutors to try israeli military officers for war crimes .
" the israeli army works according to international values , " said livni , insisting that a distinction had to be made between those who are " killed by mistake " and terrorists who " aim and fire at civilians . "
the meeting in brussels took place amid tight security , with police in riot gear keeping about 100 pro-palestinian protesters well away from the building where the talks were held .
eu seeks common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon visited gaza - and wants action livni arrived about an hour after the rest of the attendees to give her eu counterparts time to forge a common position .
prior to the meeting , differences had emerged among eu members about the need to hold direct talks with hamas .
" there is no possibility of reaching a permanent peace without everyone getting around the same table , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb .
" no comprehensive solution can be taken without hamas . "
schwarzenberg had told the european parliament as recently as tuesday that no formal contacts should be held with hamas until the organization renounced terrorism .
the talks in brussels came a day after un secretary general ban ki-moon became the highest-ranking foreign official to visit gaza and assess first hand the damage caused by the three-week conflict with israel .
further talks planned back at united nations headquarters wednesday in new york , ban told the security council that a thorough investigation should be made of israeli attacks that struck several un facilities in gaza during the conflict .
the responsible parties must be held accountable , he said .
brussels diplomats said they were in close contact with new us president barack obama , who earlier wednesday - his first full day in office - called four key middle east leaders to promise his immediate engagement in the israeli-palestinian peace process .

22 , that he evaded 966,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in taxes related to inherited funds he had hidden in the alpine principality of liechtenstein .
german tax authorities had accused zumwinkel , 65 , of concealing the money in trust funds managed by the ltg bank in liechtenstein .
he was detained in february 2008 after prosecutors obtained evidence from germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service on trusts administered by the bank on behalf of wealthy tax-evading europeans .
released on bail after a search of his villa , zumwinkel resigned shortly afterwards as head of deutsche post , one of the world 's leading logistics companies with a global workforce of more 350,000 .
later , he stepped down from positions on the boards of other leading german companies such as deutsche telekom , lufthansa and retailer arcandor .
prosectors say zumwinkel set up a trust for himself in liechtenstein in 1986 but failed to disclose earnings and dividends from it to german tax authorities , as required by law .

people in the former east of the country are especially worse off , says the study , which compared personal assets in 2002 and 2007 . the richest 10 percent of germans in 2007 owned around 61 percent of the country 's privately held assets , up from 58 percent five years earlier , a report from berlin economic institute diw showed .
the poorest 70 percent owned just under nine percent of the country 's wealth and 27 percent either own nothing or are in debt , according to the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty among the elderly could become a problem germans ' total assets were valued at 6.6 trillion euros -lrb- $ 8.5 trillion -rrb- , which amounts to an average 88,000 euros for each adult .
that is a 10 percent increase over 2002 , according to the poll commissioned by the hans boeckler foundation , which is close to trade unions .
total assets increased but the median level , the midway point between the highest and the lowest , stayed stuck at 15,000 euros - indicating that the rich got richer .
the wealth gap between what was once east and west germany also widened , the study showed .
in the west , assets rose almost 11 percent between 2002 and 2007 , but in the east they fell by just under 10 percent .
adjusted for inflation the fall was 17 percent .
" if politicians fail to act , poverty among the elderly in eastern germany will grow sharply in the future , " the report 's authors joachim frick and markus grabka said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 22.01.2009 opinion : tax evasion trial no mere slap on the wrist großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the much-anticipated tax evasion trial is underway of a former top manager who hid money in lichtenstein .
deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky says that the million-euro fine is only the beginning . the case is fairly cut and dry , meaning the trial will likely be short .
as former head of postal giant deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel was germany 's best-known top manager , a man with an irreproachable reputation .
soon after zumwinkel 's spectacular arrest outside his villa in a posh suburb of cologne , he made a complete confession and quickly transferred the money he owed to the tax office in cologne .
the court in bochum has set aside two days for the case , but the trial could come to end even more quickly .
zumwinkel 's defense lawyer and the prosecutor 's office in bochum have reached an agreement for the court to adopt .
not only that , but a legal overhaul for prosecuting tax fraud cases similar to zumwinkel 's , which involves undeclared interest income from private foundations in lichtenstein , has already been agreed to .
the result : if the defendant offers up a guilty plea and shows remorse , he or she can expect a hefty fine and up to a two year suspended sentence .
this setup keeps offenders from facing time behind bars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky while it bothers many citizens ' delicate sense of justice , such outcomes are almost always the norm when it comes to economic crimes .
one reason is that the justice system is hopelessly overloaded .
for example , there are approximately 700 pending cases against tax cheats in bochum alone .
in all cases , people stashed money and interest earnings in lichtenstein in order to conceal it from the local tax authorities .
another reason is that jails would have to be expanded if all tax cheats were given the maximum penalty allowed by law .
the state would rather get money for the misdeeds of the past and honesty in the future .
a first liechtenstein tax evasion case against a multi-millionaire from bad homburg resulted in a penalty of 7.5 million euros -lrb- $ 9.8 million -rrb- as well as a two year sentence .
klaus zumwinkel will not face as harsh a penalty since his tax fraud was less than 1 million euros .
as a young man , before heading up the post , he and his brother inherited 10 department stores and 50 discount stores .
they sold this small empire in 1971 and with the 12 million euros in proceedings , zumwinkel started the private “ devotion family foundation ” in liechtenstein , which he used to conceal interest income from tax authorities .
yet the current court case only covers earnings from the last four years .
it appears that during the time in question , the prosecutor 's office in bochum was absorbed in internal office intrigues and power struggles which resulted in the office falling behind schedule in its day-to-day task of handling files .
for zumwinkel , this means that his tax evasion case will remain just under the 1 million euro mark .
the federal court of justice recently mandated an obligatory prison sentences for amounts over 1 million euros .
you could say that zumwinkel has fortune in injustice .
in the past , many other tax evaders have profited from the government 's practice of handing out high fines and suspended sentences .
the government is more interested in money than in filling its jails .
the moral of the story : earthly justice is relative .
a multi-millionaire like klaus zumwinkel can get over a million-euro fine .
but much more difficult for him was being forced out of deutsche post and his loss of many board of director positions and honorary posts .
he has also faced social ostracism and an empty appointment calendar .
in the meantime , part of the tour program for visitors to cologne includes a stop outside zumwinkel 's villa where he was arrested about one year ago in front of television cameras .
not surprisingly , the erstwhile top manager has retreated with increasing frequency to his castle in south tyrol .

but he added that there is still a lot of work to be done in order to spread their use .
important political support is needed .
germany 's undersecretary of state for development , erich stather , said poor countries in particular are in need of a " sea change " when it comes to energy resources .
more than two billion people around the world have no access to modern energy sources , and improved use of renewable energy can help those countries develop , he said over 60 percent of the conference participants will come from developing countries .

representatives from the united states , china and japan would attend the conference , but are not expected to sign the founding document immediately , gabriel said .
the eu is aiming for use renewable sources for 20 percent of its energy needs by 2020 .
in germany , 15 percent of electricity consumption comes from renewable sources of energy and the government aims to double this by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

former senator and northern ireland peace mediator george mitchell was appointed to bring peace between the palestinians and israelis in the middle east .
ambassador richard holbrooke , the architect of the dayton accords which ended the bosnian war , was charged with implementing us policy towards afghanistan and pakistan . barack obama told a press conference he would send mitchell to the region " as soon as possible " to ensure a " durable " and " sustainable " ceasefire in gaza .
germany to work with us on mideast , iran steinmeier 's office said thursday the german foreign minister had telephoned with clinton and agreed to meet soon .
steinmeier " thanked his american counterpart for her government 's determination to quickly engage itself in the middle east conflict , " the german foreign ministry said in a statement .
earlier , in a letter of congratulations to the new secretary of state , steinmeier said he intended to build on strong us-german ties .
" let us work together to find solutions for the great challenges of our time starting from the solid german-american relationship that has closely and amicably connected us , " steinmeier wrote . he said important points for cooperation will be conflict in the middle east , climate change , iran ’ s nuclear programme and the financial crisis .

" i believe with all my heart that this is a new era for america , " clinton told a crowd of state department employees who had gathered to welcome the former democratic senator from new york to her first day as america 's top diplomat .

he said that he supported clinton 's goal of creating a world " with more friends and fewer opponents " and overcoming " hate , violence , lawlessness and despair . "
" i would like to offer you my full support for this policy , " he wrote .
clinton has said she will advocate the use of " smart power " - which combines diplomatic and economic influence with military strength - to reach us objectives in the world .

at her confirmation hearing last week , clinton told the senate foreign relations committee that the obama administration would pursue " an attitude toward engagement -lrb- with iran -rrb- that might bear fruit . "
but she did not mention whether washington would set conditions for such a change in us policy after nearly 30 years of official silence with tehran .
us wants to lead on climate change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton said the us wants to take a lead role in climate protection clinton also made it clear that the obama administration planned to make climate change a priority . " we will pursue an energy policy that reduces our carbon emissions while reducing our dependence on foreign oil and gas , fighting climate change and enhancing our economic and energy security , " clinton said .
she told her audience that the obama administration wanted the us to be " a leader in developing and implementing a global and coordinated response to climate change . "
middle east remains a top concern as for the recent conflict between israel and palestine , clinton said the new administration will commit itself to reaching " a just and lasting peace agreement . "
other foreign relations priorities for clinton will be the unfinished wars in iraq and afghanistan , conflicts in africa and efforts to revamp the tarnished us image overseas . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 , to hold talks with eu foreign ministers .
" in order to help in answering the humanitarian need in the gaza strip , we are willing to cooperate in this as far as it is needed , " livni told reporters on wednesday .
she maintained that " the right of israel to defend itself includes not only defending itself against the firing of missiles , but also in terms of smuggling of weapons . "
humanitarian aid in focus wednesday evening 's talks were called by the eu in a bid to secure the immediate access of humanitarian aid into gaza and to start discussions on reviving the stalled middle east peace process .
foreign minister karel schwarzenberg of the czech republic , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , measured the meeting 's success by livni 's assurances that " everything will be done from the israeli side to have an effective humanitarian aid into the gaza strip . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni insists israel 's must defend itself against smuggled weapons livni focused on the need to stop the alleged armament of hamas by iran via egyptian territory .
" from our perspective , we achieved ... an understanding about the need to give an answer to the smuggling of weapons to the gaza strip , " she said .
monitors still await entry no deal was believed to have been reached on how many crossings should be reopened , for how long or how they should be monitored .
the eu maintained a small monitoring team at the rafah crossing from 2005-07 , when the monitors had to be withdrawn after hamas violently seized control of the coastal enclave .
some 40 eu monitors are now on standby in nearby ashkelon , israel , waiting to be redeployed to the gaza border .
while eu foreign policy chief javier solana said that his office would spare no effort to bring aid to gaza civilians , none of the participants at wednesday 's meeting announced the monitors ' imminent return to rafah .
' international values ' livni said that the ceasefire was still being " tested " and again rejected direct talks with hamas .
she dismissed calls for international prosecutors to try israeli military officers for war crimes .
" the israeli army works according to international values , " said livni , insisting that a distinction had to be made between those who are " killed by mistake " and terrorists who " aim and fire at civilians . "
the meeting in brussels took place amid tight security , with police in riot gear keeping about 100 pro-palestinian protesters well away from the building where the talks were held .
eu seeks common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon visited gaza - and wants action livni arrived about an hour after the rest of the attendees to give her eu counterparts time to forge a common position .
prior to the meeting , differences had emerged among eu members about the need to hold direct talks with hamas .
" there is no possibility of reaching a permanent peace without everyone getting around the same table , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb .
" no comprehensive solution can be taken without hamas . "
schwarzenberg had told the european parliament as recently as tuesday that no formal contacts should be held with hamas until the organization renounced terrorism .
the talks in brussels came a day after un secretary general ban ki-moon became the highest-ranking foreign official to visit gaza and assess first hand the damage caused by the three-week conflict with israel .
further talks planned back at united nations headquarters wednesday in new york , ban told the security council that a thorough investigation should be made of israeli attacks that struck several un facilities in gaza during the conflict .
the responsible parties must be held accountable , he said .
brussels diplomats said they were in close contact with new us president barack obama , who earlier wednesday - his first full day in office - called four key middle east leaders to promise his immediate engagement in the israeli-palestinian peace process .
eu foreign ministers were to hold a separate talks sunday in brussels with representatives from egypt , jordan , turkey and the palestinian authority . dpa news agency -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 22.01.2009 opinion : tax evasion trial no mere slap on the wrist großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the much-anticipated tax evasion trial is underway of a former top manager who hid money in lichtenstein .
deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky says that the million-euro fine is only the beginning . the case is fairly cut and dry , meaning the trial will likely be short .
as former head of postal giant deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel was germany 's best-known top manager , a man with an irreproachable reputation .
soon after zumwinkel 's spectacular arrest outside his villa in a posh suburb of cologne , he made a complete confession and quickly transferred the money he owed to the tax office in cologne .
the court in bochum has set aside two days for the case , but the trial could come to end even more quickly .
zumwinkel 's defense lawyer and the prosecutor 's office in bochum have reached an agreement for the court to adopt .
not only that , but a legal overhaul for prosecuting tax fraud cases similar to zumwinkel 's , which involves undeclared interest income from private foundations in lichtenstein , has already been agreed to .
the result : if the defendant offers up a guilty plea and shows remorse , he or she can expect a hefty fine and up to a two year suspended sentence .
this setup keeps offenders from facing time behind bars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky while it bothers many citizens ' delicate sense of justice , such outcomes are almost always the norm when it comes to economic crimes .
one reason is that the justice system is hopelessly overloaded .
for example , there are approximately 700 pending cases against tax cheats in bochum alone .
in all cases , people stashed money and interest earnings in lichtenstein in order to conceal it from the local tax authorities .
another reason is that jails would have to be expanded if all tax cheats were given the maximum penalty allowed by law .
the state would rather get money for the misdeeds of the past and honesty in the future .
a first liechtenstein tax evasion case against a multi-millionaire from bad homburg resulted in a penalty of 7.5 million euros -lrb- $ 9.8 million -rrb- as well as a two year sentence .
klaus zumwinkel will not face as harsh a penalty since his tax fraud was less than 1 million euros .
as a young man , before heading up the post , he and his brother inherited 10 department stores and 50 discount stores .
they sold this small empire in 1971 and with the 12 million euros in proceedings , zumwinkel started the private “ devotion family foundation ” in liechtenstein , which he used to conceal interest income from tax authorities .
yet the current court case only covers earnings from the last four years .
it appears that during the time in question , the prosecutor 's office in bochum was absorbed in internal office intrigues and power struggles which resulted in the office falling behind schedule in its day-to-day task of handling files .
for zumwinkel , this means that his tax evasion case will remain just under the 1 million euro mark .
the federal court of justice recently mandated an obligatory prison sentences for amounts over 1 million euros .
you could say that zumwinkel has fortune in injustice .
in the past , many other tax evaders have profited from the government 's practice of handing out high fines and suspended sentences .
the government is more interested in money than in filling its jails .
the moral of the story : earthly justice is relative .
a multi-millionaire like klaus zumwinkel can get over a million-euro fine .
but much more difficult for him was being forced out of deutsche post and his loss of many board of director positions and honorary posts .
he has also faced social ostracism and an empty appointment calendar .
in the meantime , part of the tour program for visitors to cologne includes a stop outside zumwinkel 's villa where he was arrested about one year ago in front of television cameras .
not surprisingly , the erstwhile top manager has retreated with increasing frequency to his castle in south tyrol .

the accused were found to have adulterated baby milk formula with the toxic industrial chemical melamine in order to make the milk appear to contain more protein .
but it is unlikely that the trial in the sanlu company case is going to end the discussion about china ’ s worst food scandal in recent times . a court in shijiazhuang in china ’ s hebei province , where the sanlu group is based , has sentenced two men to death and several other of the accused to prison terms ranging up to a life sentence .
sanlu was the dairy company which had sold the largest amount of tainted milk and had continued to do so after the first children had developed kidney ailments and even died .
tian wenhua , the former general manager of sanlu , was given a life sentence together with a fine of two and a half million euros .
li fangping is one of the lawyers representing the victims ’ parents .
he is not fully satisfied with the verdict : " in the case of the sanlu company , production had been going on for many years .
from this it is obvious that the state authorities which control food safety didn ’ t fulfil their responsibilities .
in this sense i find something is missing in the court ruling .
if only these men are held accountable , it ’ s not really being fair to them , especially if they get such harsh sentences ! "
only scapegoats ?
the two men sentenced to death are zhang yujun , who produced and distributed the highest amount of fake protein powder laced with melamine in the country , over 600 tonnes , and geng jinping , one of the middlemen who played an important role in mixing this powder with watered-down milk from farmers and selling this deadly cocktail to dairy companies such as sanlu .
but many chinese wonder if these local criminals are not merely scapegoats in a case which has much larger dimensions .
" i personally think it won ’ t solve the problems of the public health system , " says lawyer li fangping .
" we wonder if those responsible for controlling food safety should not also be held accountable , including the local government . "
call for structural reforms li fangping believes that without thorough reforms in different fields , similar food scandals can happen again in china : " one area is improving the system by which officials are held accountable .
the second is that we should strengthen the role of ngos including consumer associations .
and the third would be to establish a system of punishment and compensation . "
dozens of further accused are still awaiting trial .
in any case , the legal battle about the melamine scandal is far from over , as several affected parents have appealed against compensation arrangements which they regard as insufficient .

the two men sentenced to death are zhang yujun , who produced and distributed the highest amount of fake protein powder laced with melamine in the country , over 600 tonnes , and geng jinping , one of the middlemen who played an important role in mixing this powder with watered-down milk from farmers and selling this deadly cocktail to dairy companies such as sanlu .
but many chinese wonder if these local criminals are not merely scapegoats in a case which has much larger dimensions .
" i personally think it won ’ t solve the problems of the public health system , " says lawyer li fangping .
" we wonder if those responsible for controlling food safety should not also be held accountable , including the local government . "

the second is that we should strengthen the role of ngos including consumer associations .
and the third would be to establish a system of punishment and compensation . "
dozens of further accused are still awaiting trial .

the accused were found to have adulterated baby milk formula with the toxic industrial chemical melamine in order to make the milk appear to contain more protein .
but it is unlikely that the trial in the sanlu company case is going to end the discussion about china ’ s worst food scandal in recent times . a court in shijiazhuang in china ’ s hebei province , where the sanlu group is based , has sentenced two men to death and several other of the accused to prison terms ranging up to a life sentence .
sanlu was the dairy company which had sold the largest amount of tainted milk and had continued to do so after the first children had developed kidney ailments and even died .

the accused were found to have adulterated baby milk formula with the toxic industrial chemical melamine in order to make the milk appear to contain more protein .
but it is unlikely that the trial in the sanlu company case is going to end the discussion about china ’ s worst food scandal in recent times . a court in shijiazhuang in china ’ s hebei province , where the sanlu group is based , has sentenced two men to death and several other of the accused to prison terms ranging up to a life sentence .
sanlu was the dairy company which had sold the largest amount of tainted milk and had continued to do so after the first children had developed kidney ailments and even died .
tian wenhua , the former general manager of sanlu , was given a life sentence together with a fine of two and a half million euros .
li fangping is one of the lawyers representing the victims ’ parents .
he is not fully satisfied with the verdict : " in the case of the sanlu company , production had been going on for many years .
from this it is obvious that the state authorities which control food safety didn ’ t fulfil their responsibilities .
in this sense i find something is missing in the court ruling .
if only these men are held accountable , it ’ s not really being fair to them , especially if they get such harsh sentences ! "
only scapegoats ?
the two men sentenced to death are zhang yujun , who produced and distributed the highest amount of fake protein powder laced with melamine in the country , over 600 tonnes , and geng jinping , one of the middlemen who played an important role in mixing this powder with watered-down milk from farmers and selling this deadly cocktail to dairy companies such as sanlu .
but many chinese wonder if these local criminals are not merely scapegoats in a case which has much larger dimensions .
" i personally think it won ’ t solve the problems of the public health system , " says lawyer li fangping .
" we wonder if those responsible for controlling food safety should not also be held accountable , including the local government . "
call for structural reforms li fangping believes that without thorough reforms in different fields , similar food scandals can happen again in china : " one area is improving the system by which officials are held accountable .
the second is that we should strengthen the role of ngos including consumer associations .
and the third would be to establish a system of punishment and compensation . "
dozens of further accused are still awaiting trial .

the accused were found to have adulterated baby milk formula with the toxic industrial chemical melamine in order to make the milk appear to contain more protein .
but it is unlikely that the trial in the sanlu company case is going to end the discussion about china ’ s worst food scandal in recent times . a court in shijiazhuang in china ’ s hebei province , where the sanlu group is based , has sentenced two men to death and several other of the accused to prison terms ranging up to a life sentence .
sanlu was the dairy company which had sold the largest amount of tainted milk and had continued to do so after the first children had developed kidney ailments and even died .
tian wenhua , the former general manager of sanlu , was given a life sentence together with a fine of two and a half million euros .
li fangping is one of the lawyers representing the victims ’ parents .
he is not fully satisfied with the verdict : " in the case of the sanlu company , production had been going on for many years .
from this it is obvious that the state authorities which control food safety didn ’ t fulfil their responsibilities .
in this sense i find something is missing in the court ruling .
if only these men are held accountable , it ’ s not really being fair to them , especially if they get such harsh sentences ! "
only scapegoats ?
the two men sentenced to death are zhang yujun , who produced and distributed the highest amount of fake protein powder laced with melamine in the country , over 600 tonnes , and geng jinping , one of the middlemen who played an important role in mixing this powder with watered-down milk from farmers and selling this deadly cocktail to dairy companies such as sanlu .
but many chinese wonder if these local criminals are not merely scapegoats in a case which has much larger dimensions .
" i personally think it won ’ t solve the problems of the public health system , " says lawyer li fangping .
" we wonder if those responsible for controlling food safety should not also be held accountable , including the local government . "
call for structural reforms li fangping believes that without thorough reforms in different fields , similar food scandals can happen again in china : " one area is improving the system by which officials are held accountable .
the second is that we should strengthen the role of ngos including consumer associations .
and the third would be to establish a system of punishment and compensation . "
dozens of further accused are still awaiting trial .
in any case , the legal battle about the melamine scandal is far from over , as several affected parents have appealed against compensation arrangements which they regard as insufficient .

22 , that he evaded 966,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in taxes related to inherited funds he had hidden in the alpine principality of liechtenstein .
german tax authorities had accused zumwinkel , 65 , of concealing the money in trust funds managed by the ltg bank in liechtenstein .
he was detained in february 2008 after prosecutors obtained evidence from germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service on trusts administered by the bank on behalf of wealthy tax-evading europeans .
released on bail after a search of his villa , zumwinkel resigned shortly afterwards as head of deutsche post , one of the world 's leading logistics companies with a global workforce of more 350,000 .
later , he stepped down from positions on the boards of other leading german companies such as deutsche telekom , lufthansa and retailer arcandor .
prosectors say zumwinkel set up a trust for himself in liechtenstein in 1986 but failed to disclose earnings and dividends from it to german tax authorities , as required by law .
if convicted he could face jail and a hefty fine .
unconfirmed reports ahead of the trial said zumwinkel would enter a plea of guilty in return for a reduced sentence .
the verdict is expected on monday .
zumwinkel was one of hundreds of wealthy germans exposed when a liechtenstein bank employee betrayed them by selling a stolen dvd with details of their accounts to the bnd for about 5 million euros .

in a compromise suggested by the finance ministry , luxury limousines , rather than being taxed at a higher-rate for their high fuel consumption , would in fact be given a break .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is supposed to be lowering co2 emissions the news has sparked an outraged response from some politicians and environmentalists .
green party objects to plan instead of promoting outdated gas-guzzlers , the government should be making sure germany is producing greener cars , green party parliamentary group leader baerbel hoehn told the web site of news magazine der spiegel . currently , owners of energy-inefficient cars are penalized because they are taxed based on co2 output .
but the new arrangement calls for a limit on taxes based on engine capacity .
that in turn would be advantageous to drivers of heavy cars .
according to news reports , the plans are almost finalized , and no big changes to the reform are expected .
however , a spokesman for the finance ministry said nothing had been definitively decided yet , german newspaper die zeit reported .
environment minister sigmar gabriel was said to be opposed to the plan , and said he would n't approve it in its current state , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .
the parliamentary party vice chairman of the social democratic party , ulrich kelber , complained to reporters that " it would be a joke to call this an environmentally-oriented co2 tax . "
car-wrecking hotline is swamped meanwhile , german car owners swamped a hotline with calls this week after the government invited applications for a big cash handout to anyone crushing an old car and buying a new one . berlin officials said the hotline registered 270,000 calls on the first day , monday , far more than telephonists at the trade agency bafa could answer .
on tuesday , the rush ebbed a little to 150,000 . the government has promised 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,250 -rrb- to anyone owning a car more than nine years old who takes it to the wreckers and buys a new low-pollution car . the payouts will continue until the budgeted 1.5 billion euros has been used up .
part of the sum will be for administrative costs , but the scheme is expected to bring nearly 600,000 new cars on the roads . # b # although the aim is to help germany 's troubled car manufacturing industry , imported cars will be treated the same as german-made ones . the " free " handout has been the talk of germany for days .
a free-for-all is expected next tuesday when the application form is to be offered on the bafa website to download .
some predict the budget may be used up within a week . even owners of late-model cars have wondered if they might benefit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 22.01.2009 report : germany 's revised car-tax could benefit gas guzzlers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thirsty cars with a high co2 output could be the winners of the tax reform germany may give a break to drivers of big cars , turning an attempt at an ecologically oriented tax reform into a boon for gas guzzlers , one newspaper reported . some german lawmakers have moved to alter plans for a car tax , resulting in favorable conditions for cars that burn a lot of fuel , the sueddeutsche zeitung reported .
in a compromise suggested by the finance ministry , luxury limousines , rather than being taxed at a higher-rate for their high fuel consumption , would in fact be given a break .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is supposed to be lowering co2 emissions the news has sparked an outraged response from some politicians and environmentalists .
green party objects to plan instead of promoting outdated gas-guzzlers , the government should be making sure germany is producing greener cars , green party parliamentary group leader baerbel hoehn told the web site of news magazine der spiegel . currently , owners of energy-inefficient cars are penalized because they are taxed based on co2 output .
but the new arrangement calls for a limit on taxes based on engine capacity .
that in turn would be advantageous to drivers of heavy cars .
according to news reports , the plans are almost finalized , and no big changes to the reform are expected .
however , a spokesman for the finance ministry said nothing had been definitively decided yet , german newspaper die zeit reported .
environment minister sigmar gabriel was said to be opposed to the plan , and said he would n't approve it in its current state , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .
the parliamentary party vice chairman of the social democratic party , ulrich kelber , complained to reporters that " it would be a joke to call this an environmentally-oriented co2 tax . "
car-wrecking hotline is swamped meanwhile , german car owners swamped a hotline with calls this week after the government invited applications for a big cash handout to anyone crushing an old car and buying a new one . berlin officials said the hotline registered 270,000 calls on the first day , monday , far more than telephonists at the trade agency bafa could answer .
on tuesday , the rush ebbed a little to 150,000 . the government has promised 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,250 -rrb- to anyone owning a car more than nine years old who takes it to the wreckers and buys a new low-pollution car . the payouts will continue until the budgeted 1.5 billion euros has been used up .
part of the sum will be for administrative costs , but the scheme is expected to bring nearly 600,000 new cars on the roads . # b # although the aim is to help germany 's troubled car manufacturing industry , imported cars will be treated the same as german-made ones . the " free " handout has been the talk of germany for days .
a free-for-all is expected next tuesday when the application form is to be offered on the bafa website to download .
some predict the budget may be used up within a week . even owners of late-model cars have wondered if they might benefit .
to curb abuse , the applicant must have owned the old car for at least one year and become the registered owner of the new car . bafa said thursday it was confident there would be enough money for all applicants , at least for the first few days . the old cars must be destroyed by wreckers , who remove all useful parts , glass and plastic and put the steel remains in a metal press . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the parliamentary party vice chairman of the social democratic party , ulrich kelber , complained to reporters that " it would be a joke to call this an environmentally-oriented co2 tax . "
car-wrecking hotline is swamped meanwhile , german car owners swamped a hotline with calls this week after the government invited applications for a big cash handout to anyone crushing an old car and buying a new one . berlin officials said the hotline registered 270,000 calls on the first day , monday , far more than telephonists at the trade agency bafa could answer .
on tuesday , the rush ebbed a little to 150,000 . the government has promised 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,250 -rrb- to anyone owning a car more than nine years old who takes it to the wreckers and buys a new low-pollution car . the payouts will continue until the budgeted 1.5 billion euros has been used up .
part of the sum will be for administrative costs , but the scheme is expected to bring nearly 600,000 new cars on the roads . # b # although the aim is to help germany 's troubled car manufacturing industry , imported cars will be treated the same as german-made ones . the " free " handout has been the talk of germany for days .
a free-for-all is expected next tuesday when the application form is to be offered on the bafa website to download .
some predict the budget may be used up within a week . even owners of late-model cars have wondered if they might benefit .
to curb abuse , the applicant must have owned the old car for at least one year and become the registered owner of the new car . bafa said thursday it was confident there would be enough money for all applicants , at least for the first few days . the old cars must be destroyed by wreckers , who remove all useful parts , glass and plastic and put the steel remains in a metal press . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 , to hold talks with eu foreign ministers .
" in order to help in answering the humanitarian need in the gaza strip , we are willing to cooperate in this as far as it is needed , " livni told reporters on wednesday .
she maintained that " the right of israel to defend itself includes not only defending itself against the firing of missiles , but also in terms of smuggling of weapons . "
humanitarian aid in focus wednesday evening 's talks were called by the eu in a bid to secure the immediate access of humanitarian aid into gaza and to start discussions on reviving the stalled middle east peace process .
foreign minister karel schwarzenberg of the czech republic , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , measured the meeting 's success by livni 's assurances that " everything will be done from the israeli side to have an effective humanitarian aid into the gaza strip . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni insists israel 's must defend itself against smuggled weapons livni focused on the need to stop the alleged armament of hamas by iran via egyptian territory .
" from our perspective , we achieved ... an understanding about the need to give an answer to the smuggling of weapons to the gaza strip , " she said .
monitors still await entry no deal was believed to have been reached on how many crossings should be reopened , for how long or how they should be monitored .
the eu maintained a small monitoring team at the rafah crossing from 2005-07 , when the monitors had to be withdrawn after hamas violently seized control of the coastal enclave .
some 40 eu monitors are now on standby in nearby ashkelon , israel , waiting to be redeployed to the gaza border .
while eu foreign policy chief javier solana said that his office would spare no effort to bring aid to gaza civilians , none of the participants at wednesday 's meeting announced the monitors ' imminent return to rafah .
' international values ' livni said that the ceasefire was still being " tested " and again rejected direct talks with hamas .
she dismissed calls for international prosecutors to try israeli military officers for war crimes .
" the israeli army works according to international values , " said livni , insisting that a distinction had to be made between those who are " killed by mistake " and terrorists who " aim and fire at civilians . "
the meeting in brussels took place amid tight security , with police in riot gear keeping about 100 pro-palestinian protesters well away from the building where the talks were held .
eu seeks common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon visited gaza - and wants action livni arrived about an hour after the rest of the attendees to give her eu counterparts time to forge a common position .

" in order to help in answering the humanitarian need in the gaza strip , we are willing to cooperate in this as far as it is needed , " livni told reporters on wednesday .
she maintained that " the right of israel to defend itself includes not only defending itself against the firing of missiles , but also in terms of smuggling of weapons . "
humanitarian aid in focus wednesday evening 's talks were called by the eu in a bid to secure the immediate access of humanitarian aid into gaza and to start discussions on reviving the stalled middle east peace process .
foreign minister karel schwarzenberg of the czech republic , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , measured the meeting 's success by livni 's assurances that " everything will be done from the israeli side to have an effective humanitarian aid into the gaza strip . "

the meeting in brussels took place amid tight security , with police in riot gear keeping about 100 pro-palestinian protesters well away from the building where the talks were held .

" in may 2008 , citizens supported eu integration in greater numbers but , back then , expectations were higher as major investments had come to our country , " said milica delevic , director of serbia 's european integration office .
after the arrest of war-time bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic last july , serbia was expecting a positive assessment from brussels and ratification of the pre-accession stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with the eu .
serbians unhappy with speed of eu integration the netherlands however froze the saa , demanding full cooperation with the war crimes tribunal in the hague and the arrest of remaining fugitives ratko mladic and goran hadzic .
in addition , the global financial crisis caused a drop in foreign investment that hit serbia especially hard .
the poll showed that the country 's citizens are unhappy with the speed of serbia 's eu integration and that 49 percent believe that " constant political conditions and blackmail " of serbia by the eu is the greatest obstacle to serbia 's eu entry , while 20 percent blamed it on the " incompetence of the domestic government . "
europe has support among youth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbs thought europe would embrace them after karadzic was arrested delevic however said serbians realized that integration is a long process and that 51 percent of them see eu membership as a path to a better future for the country 's youth .
she added that young people have a more positive perception of the eu and that those aged 18 to 29 expect to have the greatest benefits from eu integration .
serbia aims to become a candidate for eu membership in 2009 and has repeatedly stressed that eu membership is one of its primary goals .

its goal will be to speed the development and use of alternative energy sources , german environment minister sigmar gabriel told news organizations on wednesday , jan .

political support is needed gabriel stressed the enormous economic potential offered by renewable energies , saying : " the potential for solar , wind , hydro and biomass energy is so big that we could supply energy to more than nine billion people on earth . "
but he added that there is still a lot of work to be done in order to spread their use .
important political support is needed .
germany 's undersecretary of state for development , erich stather , said poor countries in particular are in need of a " sea change " when it comes to energy resources .
more than two billion people around the world have no access to modern energy sources , and improved use of renewable energy can help those countries develop , he said over 60 percent of the conference participants will come from developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more global warming is in nobody 's interest decision on a headquarters the founding members of irena will decide in june 2009 where the agency will be located .
germany is pushing for it to be based in bonn - also the home of the secretariat of the un framework convention on climate change , the body tasked with crafting a new global climate deal in copenhagen in december .
representatives from the united states , china and japan would attend the conference , but are not expected to sign the founding document immediately , gabriel said .
the eu is aiming for use renewable sources for 20 percent of its energy needs by 2020 .
in germany , 15 percent of electricity consumption comes from renewable sources of energy and the government aims to double this by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in order to help in answering the humanitarian need in the gaza strip , we are willing to cooperate in this as far as it is needed , " livni told reporters on wednesday .
she maintained that " the right of israel to defend itself includes not only defending itself against the firing of missiles , but also in terms of smuggling of weapons . "
humanitarian aid in focus wednesday evening 's talks were called by the eu in a bid to secure the immediate access of humanitarian aid into gaza and to start discussions on reviving the stalled middle east peace process .

monitors still await entry no deal was believed to have been reached on how many crossings should be reopened , for how long or how they should be monitored .
the eu maintained a small monitoring team at the rafah crossing from 2005-07 , when the monitors had to be withdrawn after hamas violently seized control of the coastal enclave .
some 40 eu monitors are now on standby in nearby ashkelon , israel , waiting to be redeployed to the gaza border .

she dismissed calls for international prosecutors to try israeli military officers for war crimes .
" the israeli army works according to international values , " said livni , insisting that a distinction had to be made between those who are " killed by mistake " and terrorists who " aim and fire at civilians . "
the meeting in brussels took place amid tight security , with police in riot gear keeping about 100 pro-palestinian protesters well away from the building where the talks were held .
eu seeks common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon visited gaza - and wants action livni arrived about an hour after the rest of the attendees to give her eu counterparts time to forge a common position .
prior to the meeting , differences had emerged among eu members about the need to hold direct talks with hamas .
" there is no possibility of reaching a permanent peace without everyone getting around the same table , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb .
" no comprehensive solution can be taken without hamas . "
schwarzenberg had told the european parliament as recently as tuesday that no formal contacts should be held with hamas until the organization renounced terrorism .
the talks in brussels came a day after un secretary general ban ki-moon became the highest-ranking foreign official to visit gaza and assess first hand the damage caused by the three-week conflict with israel .
further talks planned back at united nations headquarters wednesday in new york , ban told the security council that a thorough investigation should be made of israeli attacks that struck several un facilities in gaza during the conflict .
the responsible parties must be held accountable , he said .
brussels diplomats said they were in close contact with new us president barack obama , who earlier wednesday - his first full day in office - called four key middle east leaders to promise his immediate engagement in the israeli-palestinian peace process .

people in the former east of the country are especially worse off , says the study , which compared personal assets in 2002 and 2007 . the richest 10 percent of germans in 2007 owned around 61 percent of the country 's privately held assets , up from 58 percent five years earlier , a report from berlin economic institute diw showed .
the poorest 70 percent owned just under nine percent of the country 's wealth and 27 percent either own nothing or are in debt , according to the study .

that is a 10 percent increase over 2002 , according to the poll commissioned by the hans boeckler foundation , which is close to trade unions .
total assets increased but the median level , the midway point between the highest and the lowest , stayed stuck at 15,000 euros - indicating that the rich got richer .
the wealth gap between what was once east and west germany also widened , the study showed .
in the west , assets rose almost 11 percent between 2002 and 2007 , but in the east they fell by just under 10 percent .
adjusted for inflation the fall was 17 percent .

its goal will be to speed the development and use of alternative energy sources , german environment minister sigmar gabriel told news organizations on wednesday , jan .

political support is needed gabriel stressed the enormous economic potential offered by renewable energies , saying : " the potential for solar , wind , hydro and biomass energy is so big that we could supply energy to more than nine billion people on earth . "
but he added that there is still a lot of work to be done in order to spread their use .
important political support is needed .
germany 's undersecretary of state for development , erich stather , said poor countries in particular are in need of a " sea change " when it comes to energy resources .
more than two billion people around the world have no access to modern energy sources , and improved use of renewable energy can help those countries develop , he said over 60 percent of the conference participants will come from developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more global warming is in nobody 's interest decision on a headquarters the founding members of irena will decide in june 2009 where the agency will be located .
germany is pushing for it to be based in bonn - also the home of the secretariat of the un framework convention on climate change , the body tasked with crafting a new global climate deal in copenhagen in december .
representatives from the united states , china and japan would attend the conference , but are not expected to sign the founding document immediately , gabriel said .
the eu is aiming for use renewable sources for 20 percent of its energy needs by 2020 .
in germany , 15 percent of electricity consumption comes from renewable sources of energy and the government aims to double this by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 22.01.2009 opinion : tax evasion trial no mere slap on the wrist großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the much-anticipated tax evasion trial is underway of a former top manager who hid money in lichtenstein .
deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky says that the million-euro fine is only the beginning . the case is fairly cut and dry , meaning the trial will likely be short .
as former head of postal giant deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel was germany 's best-known top manager , a man with an irreproachable reputation .
soon after zumwinkel 's spectacular arrest outside his villa in a posh suburb of cologne , he made a complete confession and quickly transferred the money he owed to the tax office in cologne .
the court in bochum has set aside two days for the case , but the trial could come to end even more quickly .
zumwinkel 's defense lawyer and the prosecutor 's office in bochum have reached an agreement for the court to adopt .
not only that , but a legal overhaul for prosecuting tax fraud cases similar to zumwinkel 's , which involves undeclared interest income from private foundations in lichtenstein , has already been agreed to .
the result : if the defendant offers up a guilty plea and shows remorse , he or she can expect a hefty fine and up to a two year suspended sentence .
this setup keeps offenders from facing time behind bars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky while it bothers many citizens ' delicate sense of justice , such outcomes are almost always the norm when it comes to economic crimes .
one reason is that the justice system is hopelessly overloaded .
for example , there are approximately 700 pending cases against tax cheats in bochum alone .
in all cases , people stashed money and interest earnings in lichtenstein in order to conceal it from the local tax authorities .
another reason is that jails would have to be expanded if all tax cheats were given the maximum penalty allowed by law .
the state would rather get money for the misdeeds of the past and honesty in the future .
a first liechtenstein tax evasion case against a multi-millionaire from bad homburg resulted in a penalty of 7.5 million euros -lrb- $ 9.8 million -rrb- as well as a two year sentence .
klaus zumwinkel will not face as harsh a penalty since his tax fraud was less than 1 million euros .
as a young man , before heading up the post , he and his brother inherited 10 department stores and 50 discount stores .
they sold this small empire in 1971 and with the 12 million euros in proceedings , zumwinkel started the private “ devotion family foundation ” in liechtenstein , which he used to conceal interest income from tax authorities .
yet the current court case only covers earnings from the last four years .
it appears that during the time in question , the prosecutor 's office in bochum was absorbed in internal office intrigues and power struggles which resulted in the office falling behind schedule in its day-to-day task of handling files .
for zumwinkel , this means that his tax evasion case will remain just under the 1 million euro mark .
the federal court of justice recently mandated an obligatory prison sentences for amounts over 1 million euros .
you could say that zumwinkel has fortune in injustice .
in the past , many other tax evaders have profited from the government 's practice of handing out high fines and suspended sentences .
the government is more interested in money than in filling its jails .
the moral of the story : earthly justice is relative .
a multi-millionaire like klaus zumwinkel can get over a million-euro fine .
but much more difficult for him was being forced out of deutsche post and his loss of many board of director positions and honorary posts .
he has also faced social ostracism and an empty appointment calendar .
in the meantime , part of the tour program for visitors to cologne includes a stop outside zumwinkel 's villa where he was arrested about one year ago in front of television cameras .
not surprisingly , the erstwhile top manager has retreated with increasing frequency to his castle in south tyrol .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 22.01.2009 opinion : tax evasion trial no mere slap on the wrist großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the much-anticipated tax evasion trial is underway of a former top manager who hid money in lichtenstein .
deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky says that the million-euro fine is only the beginning . the case is fairly cut and dry , meaning the trial will likely be short .
as former head of postal giant deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel was germany 's best-known top manager , a man with an irreproachable reputation .
soon after zumwinkel 's spectacular arrest outside his villa in a posh suburb of cologne , he made a complete confession and quickly transferred the money he owed to the tax office in cologne .
the court in bochum has set aside two days for the case , but the trial could come to end even more quickly .
zumwinkel 's defense lawyer and the prosecutor 's office in bochum have reached an agreement for the court to adopt .
not only that , but a legal overhaul for prosecuting tax fraud cases similar to zumwinkel 's , which involves undeclared interest income from private foundations in lichtenstein , has already been agreed to .
the result : if the defendant offers up a guilty plea and shows remorse , he or she can expect a hefty fine and up to a two year suspended sentence .
this setup keeps offenders from facing time behind bars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky while it bothers many citizens ' delicate sense of justice , such outcomes are almost always the norm when it comes to economic crimes .
one reason is that the justice system is hopelessly overloaded .
for example , there are approximately 700 pending cases against tax cheats in bochum alone .
in all cases , people stashed money and interest earnings in lichtenstein in order to conceal it from the local tax authorities .
another reason is that jails would have to be expanded if all tax cheats were given the maximum penalty allowed by law .
the state would rather get money for the misdeeds of the past and honesty in the future .
a first liechtenstein tax evasion case against a multi-millionaire from bad homburg resulted in a penalty of 7.5 million euros -lrb- $ 9.8 million -rrb- as well as a two year sentence .
klaus zumwinkel will not face as harsh a penalty since his tax fraud was less than 1 million euros .
as a young man , before heading up the post , he and his brother inherited 10 department stores and 50 discount stores .
they sold this small empire in 1971 and with the 12 million euros in proceedings , zumwinkel started the private “ devotion family foundation ” in liechtenstein , which he used to conceal interest income from tax authorities .
yet the current court case only covers earnings from the last four years .
it appears that during the time in question , the prosecutor 's office in bochum was absorbed in internal office intrigues and power struggles which resulted in the office falling behind schedule in its day-to-day task of handling files .
for zumwinkel , this means that his tax evasion case will remain just under the 1 million euro mark .
the federal court of justice recently mandated an obligatory prison sentences for amounts over 1 million euros .
you could say that zumwinkel has fortune in injustice .
in the past , many other tax evaders have profited from the government 's practice of handing out high fines and suspended sentences .
the government is more interested in money than in filling its jails .
the moral of the story : earthly justice is relative .
a multi-millionaire like klaus zumwinkel can get over a million-euro fine .
but much more difficult for him was being forced out of deutsche post and his loss of many board of director positions and honorary posts .
he has also faced social ostracism and an empty appointment calendar .
in the meantime , part of the tour program for visitors to cologne includes a stop outside zumwinkel 's villa where he was arrested about one year ago in front of television cameras .
not surprisingly , the erstwhile top manager has retreated with increasing frequency to his castle in south tyrol .

it appears that during the time in question , the prosecutor 's office in bochum was absorbed in internal office intrigues and power struggles which resulted in the office falling behind schedule in its day-to-day task of handling files .

deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky says that the million-euro fine is only the beginning . the case is fairly cut and dry , meaning the trial will likely be short .
as former head of postal giant deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel was germany 's best-known top manager , a man with an irreproachable reputation .
soon after zumwinkel 's spectacular arrest outside his villa in a posh suburb of cologne , he made a complete confession and quickly transferred the money he owed to the tax office in cologne .
the court in bochum has set aside two days for the case , but the trial could come to end even more quickly .
zumwinkel 's defense lawyer and the prosecutor 's office in bochum have reached an agreement for the court to adopt .
not only that , but a legal overhaul for prosecuting tax fraud cases similar to zumwinkel 's , which involves undeclared interest income from private foundations in lichtenstein , has already been agreed to .
the result : if the defendant offers up a guilty plea and shows remorse , he or she can expect a hefty fine and up to a two year suspended sentence .
this setup keeps offenders from facing time behind bars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky while it bothers many citizens ' delicate sense of justice , such outcomes are almost always the norm when it comes to economic crimes .
one reason is that the justice system is hopelessly overloaded .
for example , there are approximately 700 pending cases against tax cheats in bochum alone .
in all cases , people stashed money and interest earnings in lichtenstein in order to conceal it from the local tax authorities .
another reason is that jails would have to be expanded if all tax cheats were given the maximum penalty allowed by law .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 22.01.2009 report : germany 's revised car-tax could benefit gas guzzlers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thirsty cars with a high co2 output could be the winners of the tax reform germany may give a break to drivers of big cars , turning an attempt at an ecologically oriented tax reform into a boon for gas guzzlers , one newspaper reported . some german lawmakers have moved to alter plans for a car tax , resulting in favorable conditions for cars that burn a lot of fuel , the sueddeutsche zeitung reported .
in a compromise suggested by the finance ministry , luxury limousines , rather than being taxed at a higher-rate for their high fuel consumption , would in fact be given a break .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is supposed to be lowering co2 emissions the news has sparked an outraged response from some politicians and environmentalists .
green party objects to plan instead of promoting outdated gas-guzzlers , the government should be making sure germany is producing greener cars , green party parliamentary group leader baerbel hoehn told the web site of news magazine der spiegel . currently , owners of energy-inefficient cars are penalized because they are taxed based on co2 output .
but the new arrangement calls for a limit on taxes based on engine capacity .
that in turn would be advantageous to drivers of heavy cars .
according to news reports , the plans are almost finalized , and no big changes to the reform are expected .
however , a spokesman for the finance ministry said nothing had been definitively decided yet , german newspaper die zeit reported .
environment minister sigmar gabriel was said to be opposed to the plan , and said he would n't approve it in its current state , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .
the parliamentary party vice chairman of the social democratic party , ulrich kelber , complained to reporters that " it would be a joke to call this an environmentally-oriented co2 tax . "
car-wrecking hotline is swamped meanwhile , german car owners swamped a hotline with calls this week after the government invited applications for a big cash handout to anyone crushing an old car and buying a new one . berlin officials said the hotline registered 270,000 calls on the first day , monday , far more than telephonists at the trade agency bafa could answer .
on tuesday , the rush ebbed a little to 150,000 . the government has promised 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,250 -rrb- to anyone owning a car more than nine years old who takes it to the wreckers and buys a new low-pollution car . the payouts will continue until the budgeted 1.5 billion euros has been used up .
part of the sum will be for administrative costs , but the scheme is expected to bring nearly 600,000 new cars on the roads . # b # although the aim is to help germany 's troubled car manufacturing industry , imported cars will be treated the same as german-made ones . the " free " handout has been the talk of germany for days .
a free-for-all is expected next tuesday when the application form is to be offered on the bafa website to download .
some predict the budget may be used up within a week . even owners of late-model cars have wondered if they might benefit .
to curb abuse , the applicant must have owned the old car for at least one year and become the registered owner of the new car . bafa said thursday it was confident there would be enough money for all applicants , at least for the first few days . the old cars must be destroyed by wreckers , who remove all useful parts , glass and plastic and put the steel remains in a metal press . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a compromise suggested by the finance ministry , luxury limousines , rather than being taxed at a higher-rate for their high fuel consumption , would in fact be given a break .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is supposed to be lowering co2 emissions the news has sparked an outraged response from some politicians and environmentalists .
green party objects to plan instead of promoting outdated gas-guzzlers , the government should be making sure germany is producing greener cars , green party parliamentary group leader baerbel hoehn told the web site of news magazine der spiegel . currently , owners of energy-inefficient cars are penalized because they are taxed based on co2 output .
but the new arrangement calls for a limit on taxes based on engine capacity .
that in turn would be advantageous to drivers of heavy cars .
according to news reports , the plans are almost finalized , and no big changes to the reform are expected .
however , a spokesman for the finance ministry said nothing had been definitively decided yet , german newspaper die zeit reported .
environment minister sigmar gabriel was said to be opposed to the plan , and said he would n't approve it in its current state , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .
the parliamentary party vice chairman of the social democratic party , ulrich kelber , complained to reporters that " it would be a joke to call this an environmentally-oriented co2 tax . "

on tuesday , the rush ebbed a little to 150,000 . the government has promised 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,250 -rrb- to anyone owning a car more than nine years old who takes it to the wreckers and buys a new low-pollution car . the payouts will continue until the budgeted 1.5 billion euros has been used up .
part of the sum will be for administrative costs , but the scheme is expected to bring nearly 600,000 new cars on the roads . # b # although the aim is to help germany 's troubled car manufacturing industry , imported cars will be treated the same as german-made ones . the " free " handout has been the talk of germany for days .
a free-for-all is expected next tuesday when the application form is to be offered on the bafa website to download .
some predict the budget may be used up within a week . even owners of late-model cars have wondered if they might benefit .
to curb abuse , the applicant must have owned the old car for at least one year and become the registered owner of the new car . bafa said thursday it was confident there would be enough money for all applicants , at least for the first few days . the old cars must be destroyed by wreckers , who remove all useful parts , glass and plastic and put the steel remains in a metal press . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 , that he evaded 966,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in taxes related to inherited funds he had hidden in the alpine principality of liechtenstein .
german tax authorities had accused zumwinkel , 65 , of concealing the money in trust funds managed by the ltg bank in liechtenstein .
he was detained in february 2008 after prosecutors obtained evidence from germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service on trusts administered by the bank on behalf of wealthy tax-evading europeans .
released on bail after a search of his villa , zumwinkel resigned shortly afterwards as head of deutsche post , one of the world 's leading logistics companies with a global workforce of more 350,000 .
later , he stepped down from positions on the boards of other leading german companies such as deutsche telekom , lufthansa and retailer arcandor .
prosectors say zumwinkel set up a trust for himself in liechtenstein in 1986 but failed to disclose earnings and dividends from it to german tax authorities , as required by law .
if convicted he could face jail and a hefty fine .
unconfirmed reports ahead of the trial said zumwinkel would enter a plea of guilty in return for a reduced sentence .
the verdict is expected on monday .
zumwinkel was one of hundreds of wealthy germans exposed when a liechtenstein bank employee betrayed them by selling a stolen dvd with details of their accounts to the bnd for about 5 million euros .
since then , german prosecutors have recovered more than 150 million euros in arrears from repentant taxpayers hoping to ward off trials . dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 , that he evaded 966,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in taxes related to inherited funds he had hidden in the alpine principality of liechtenstein .
german tax authorities had accused zumwinkel , 65 , of concealing the money in trust funds managed by the ltg bank in liechtenstein .
he was detained in february 2008 after prosecutors obtained evidence from germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service on trusts administered by the bank on behalf of wealthy tax-evading europeans .
released on bail after a search of his villa , zumwinkel resigned shortly afterwards as head of deutsche post , one of the world 's leading logistics companies with a global workforce of more 350,000 .
later , he stepped down from positions on the boards of other leading german companies such as deutsche telekom , lufthansa and retailer arcandor .
prosectors say zumwinkel set up a trust for himself in liechtenstein in 1986 but failed to disclose earnings and dividends from it to german tax authorities , as required by law .
if convicted he could face jail and a hefty fine .
unconfirmed reports ahead of the trial said zumwinkel would enter a plea of guilty in return for a reduced sentence .
the verdict is expected on monday .
zumwinkel was one of hundreds of wealthy germans exposed when a liechtenstein bank employee betrayed them by selling a stolen dvd with details of their accounts to the bnd for about 5 million euros .

the accused were found to have adulterated baby milk formula with the toxic industrial chemical melamine in order to make the milk appear to contain more protein .
but it is unlikely that the trial in the sanlu company case is going to end the discussion about china ’ s worst food scandal in recent times . a court in shijiazhuang in china ’ s hebei province , where the sanlu group is based , has sentenced two men to death and several other of the accused to prison terms ranging up to a life sentence .
sanlu was the dairy company which had sold the largest amount of tainted milk and had continued to do so after the first children had developed kidney ailments and even died .
tian wenhua , the former general manager of sanlu , was given a life sentence together with a fine of two and a half million euros .
li fangping is one of the lawyers representing the victims ’ parents .
he is not fully satisfied with the verdict : " in the case of the sanlu company , production had been going on for many years .
from this it is obvious that the state authorities which control food safety didn ’ t fulfil their responsibilities .
in this sense i find something is missing in the court ruling .
if only these men are held accountable , it ’ s not really being fair to them , especially if they get such harsh sentences ! "
only scapegoats ?
the two men sentenced to death are zhang yujun , who produced and distributed the highest amount of fake protein powder laced with melamine in the country , over 600 tonnes , and geng jinping , one of the middlemen who played an important role in mixing this powder with watered-down milk from farmers and selling this deadly cocktail to dairy companies such as sanlu .
but many chinese wonder if these local criminals are not merely scapegoats in a case which has much larger dimensions .
" i personally think it won ’ t solve the problems of the public health system , " says lawyer li fangping .
" we wonder if those responsible for controlling food safety should not also be held accountable , including the local government . "
call for structural reforms li fangping believes that without thorough reforms in different fields , similar food scandals can happen again in china : " one area is improving the system by which officials are held accountable .
the second is that we should strengthen the role of ngos including consumer associations .
and the third would be to establish a system of punishment and compensation . "
dozens of further accused are still awaiting trial .
in any case , the legal battle about the melamine scandal is far from over , as several affected parents have appealed against compensation arrangements which they regard as insufficient .

former senator and northern ireland peace mediator george mitchell was appointed to bring peace between the palestinians and israelis in the middle east .
ambassador richard holbrooke , the architect of the dayton accords which ended the bosnian war , was charged with implementing us policy towards afghanistan and pakistan . barack obama told a press conference he would send mitchell to the region " as soon as possible " to ensure a " durable " and " sustainable " ceasefire in gaza .
germany to work with us on mideast , iran steinmeier 's office said thursday the german foreign minister had telephoned with clinton and agreed to meet soon .
steinmeier " thanked his american counterpart for her government 's determination to quickly engage itself in the middle east conflict , " the german foreign ministry said in a statement .
earlier , in a letter of congratulations to the new secretary of state , steinmeier said he intended to build on strong us-german ties .
" let us work together to find solutions for the great challenges of our time starting from the solid german-american relationship that has closely and amicably connected us , " steinmeier wrote . he said important points for cooperation will be conflict in the middle east , climate change , iran ’ s nuclear programme and the financial crisis .
clinton took her place in barack obama 's new cabinet , a day after he was sworn in as us president .
on thursday , a beaming clinton greeted her new colleagues at the us state department , promising a change in how the united states deals with the rest of the world .
clinton was president barack obama 's democratic rival .
after his win in november of 2008 , clinton became obama 's surprise choice to oversee the 20,000-strong us state department .
" i believe with all my heart that this is a new era for america , " clinton told a crowd of state department employees who had gathered to welcome the former democratic senator from new york to her first day as america 's top diplomat .

he said that he supported clinton 's goal of creating a world " with more friends and fewer opponents " and overcoming " hate , violence , lawlessness and despair . "
" i would like to offer you my full support for this policy , " he wrote .
clinton has said she will advocate the use of " smart power " - which combines diplomatic and economic influence with military strength - to reach us objectives in the world .

at her confirmation hearing last week , clinton told the senate foreign relations committee that the obama administration would pursue " an attitude toward engagement -lrb- with iran -rrb- that might bear fruit . "
but she did not mention whether washington would set conditions for such a change in us policy after nearly 30 years of official silence with tehran .
us wants to lead on climate change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton said the us wants to take a lead role in climate protection clinton also made it clear that the obama administration planned to make climate change a priority . " we will pursue an energy policy that reduces our carbon emissions while reducing our dependence on foreign oil and gas , fighting climate change and enhancing our economic and energy security , " clinton said .
she told her audience that the obama administration wanted the us to be " a leader in developing and implementing a global and coordinated response to climate change . "
middle east remains a top concern as for the recent conflict between israel and palestine , clinton said the new administration will commit itself to reaching " a just and lasting peace agreement . "
other foreign relations priorities for clinton will be the unfinished wars in iraq and afghanistan , conflicts in africa and efforts to revamp the tarnished us image overseas . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 22.01.2009 opinion : tax evasion trial no mere slap on the wrist großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the much-anticipated tax evasion trial is underway of a former top manager who hid money in lichtenstein .
deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky says that the million-euro fine is only the beginning . the case is fairly cut and dry , meaning the trial will likely be short .
as former head of postal giant deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel was germany 's best-known top manager , a man with an irreproachable reputation .
soon after zumwinkel 's spectacular arrest outside his villa in a posh suburb of cologne , he made a complete confession and quickly transferred the money he owed to the tax office in cologne .
the court in bochum has set aside two days for the case , but the trial could come to end even more quickly .
zumwinkel 's defense lawyer and the prosecutor 's office in bochum have reached an agreement for the court to adopt .
not only that , but a legal overhaul for prosecuting tax fraud cases similar to zumwinkel 's , which involves undeclared interest income from private foundations in lichtenstein , has already been agreed to .
the result : if the defendant offers up a guilty plea and shows remorse , he or she can expect a hefty fine and up to a two year suspended sentence .
this setup keeps offenders from facing time behind bars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky while it bothers many citizens ' delicate sense of justice , such outcomes are almost always the norm when it comes to economic crimes .
one reason is that the justice system is hopelessly overloaded .
for example , there are approximately 700 pending cases against tax cheats in bochum alone .
in all cases , people stashed money and interest earnings in lichtenstein in order to conceal it from the local tax authorities .
another reason is that jails would have to be expanded if all tax cheats were given the maximum penalty allowed by law .
the state would rather get money for the misdeeds of the past and honesty in the future .
a first liechtenstein tax evasion case against a multi-millionaire from bad homburg resulted in a penalty of 7.5 million euros -lrb- $ 9.8 million -rrb- as well as a two year sentence .
klaus zumwinkel will not face as harsh a penalty since his tax fraud was less than 1 million euros .
as a young man , before heading up the post , he and his brother inherited 10 department stores and 50 discount stores .
they sold this small empire in 1971 and with the 12 million euros in proceedings , zumwinkel started the private “ devotion family foundation ” in liechtenstein , which he used to conceal interest income from tax authorities .
yet the current court case only covers earnings from the last four years .
it appears that during the time in question , the prosecutor 's office in bochum was absorbed in internal office intrigues and power struggles which resulted in the office falling behind schedule in its day-to-day task of handling files .
for zumwinkel , this means that his tax evasion case will remain just under the 1 million euro mark .
the federal court of justice recently mandated an obligatory prison sentences for amounts over 1 million euros .
you could say that zumwinkel has fortune in injustice .
in the past , many other tax evaders have profited from the government 's practice of handing out high fines and suspended sentences .
the government is more interested in money than in filling its jails .
the moral of the story : earthly justice is relative .
a multi-millionaire like klaus zumwinkel can get over a million-euro fine .
but much more difficult for him was being forced out of deutsche post and his loss of many board of director positions and honorary posts .
he has also faced social ostracism and an empty appointment calendar .
in the meantime , part of the tour program for visitors to cologne includes a stop outside zumwinkel 's villa where he was arrested about one year ago in front of television cameras .
not surprisingly , the erstwhile top manager has retreated with increasing frequency to his castle in south tyrol .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 22.01.2009 opinion : tax evasion trial no mere slap on the wrist großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the much-anticipated tax evasion trial is underway of a former top manager who hid money in lichtenstein .
deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky says that the million-euro fine is only the beginning . the case is fairly cut and dry , meaning the trial will likely be short .
as former head of postal giant deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel was germany 's best-known top manager , a man with an irreproachable reputation .
soon after zumwinkel 's spectacular arrest outside his villa in a posh suburb of cologne , he made a complete confession and quickly transferred the money he owed to the tax office in cologne .
the court in bochum has set aside two days for the case , but the trial could come to end even more quickly .
zumwinkel 's defense lawyer and the prosecutor 's office in bochum have reached an agreement for the court to adopt .
not only that , but a legal overhaul for prosecuting tax fraud cases similar to zumwinkel 's , which involves undeclared interest income from private foundations in lichtenstein , has already been agreed to .
the result : if the defendant offers up a guilty plea and shows remorse , he or she can expect a hefty fine and up to a two year suspended sentence .
this setup keeps offenders from facing time behind bars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky while it bothers many citizens ' delicate sense of justice , such outcomes are almost always the norm when it comes to economic crimes .
one reason is that the justice system is hopelessly overloaded .
for example , there are approximately 700 pending cases against tax cheats in bochum alone .
in all cases , people stashed money and interest earnings in lichtenstein in order to conceal it from the local tax authorities .
another reason is that jails would have to be expanded if all tax cheats were given the maximum penalty allowed by law .
the state would rather get money for the misdeeds of the past and honesty in the future .
a first liechtenstein tax evasion case against a multi-millionaire from bad homburg resulted in a penalty of 7.5 million euros -lrb- $ 9.8 million -rrb- as well as a two year sentence .
klaus zumwinkel will not face as harsh a penalty since his tax fraud was less than 1 million euros .
as a young man , before heading up the post , he and his brother inherited 10 department stores and 50 discount stores .
they sold this small empire in 1971 and with the 12 million euros in proceedings , zumwinkel started the private “ devotion family foundation ” in liechtenstein , which he used to conceal interest income from tax authorities .
yet the current court case only covers earnings from the last four years .
it appears that during the time in question , the prosecutor 's office in bochum was absorbed in internal office intrigues and power struggles which resulted in the office falling behind schedule in its day-to-day task of handling files .
for zumwinkel , this means that his tax evasion case will remain just under the 1 million euro mark .
the federal court of justice recently mandated an obligatory prison sentences for amounts over 1 million euros .
you could say that zumwinkel has fortune in injustice .
in the past , many other tax evaders have profited from the government 's practice of handing out high fines and suspended sentences .
the government is more interested in money than in filling its jails .
the moral of the story : earthly justice is relative .
a multi-millionaire like klaus zumwinkel can get over a million-euro fine .
but much more difficult for him was being forced out of deutsche post and his loss of many board of director positions and honorary posts .
he has also faced social ostracism and an empty appointment calendar .
in the meantime , part of the tour program for visitors to cologne includes a stop outside zumwinkel 's villa where he was arrested about one year ago in front of television cameras .
not surprisingly , the erstwhile top manager has retreated with increasing frequency to his castle in south tyrol .

ambassador richard holbrooke , the architect of the dayton accords which ended the bosnian war , was charged with implementing us policy towards afghanistan and pakistan . barack obama told a press conference he would send mitchell to the region " as soon as possible " to ensure a " durable " and " sustainable " ceasefire in gaza .
germany to work with us on mideast , iran steinmeier 's office said thursday the german foreign minister had telephoned with clinton and agreed to meet soon .
steinmeier " thanked his american counterpart for her government 's determination to quickly engage itself in the middle east conflict , " the german foreign ministry said in a statement .
earlier , in a letter of congratulations to the new secretary of state , steinmeier said he intended to build on strong us-german ties .
" let us work together to find solutions for the great challenges of our time starting from the solid german-american relationship that has closely and amicably connected us , " steinmeier wrote . he said important points for cooperation will be conflict in the middle east , climate change , iran ’ s nuclear programme and the financial crisis .
clinton took her place in barack obama 's new cabinet , a day after he was sworn in as us president .
on thursday , a beaming clinton greeted her new colleagues at the us state department , promising a change in how the united states deals with the rest of the world .
clinton was president barack obama 's democratic rival .
after his win in november of 2008 , clinton became obama 's surprise choice to oversee the 20,000-strong us state department .
" i believe with all my heart that this is a new era for america , " clinton told a crowd of state department employees who had gathered to welcome the former democratic senator from new york to her first day as america 's top diplomat .

he said that he supported clinton 's goal of creating a world " with more friends and fewer opponents " and overcoming " hate , violence , lawlessness and despair . "
" i would like to offer you my full support for this policy , " he wrote .
clinton has said she will advocate the use of " smart power " - which combines diplomatic and economic influence with military strength - to reach us objectives in the world .

at her confirmation hearing last week , clinton told the senate foreign relations committee that the obama administration would pursue " an attitude toward engagement -lrb- with iran -rrb- that might bear fruit . "
but she did not mention whether washington would set conditions for such a change in us policy after nearly 30 years of official silence with tehran .
us wants to lead on climate change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton said the us wants to take a lead role in climate protection clinton also made it clear that the obama administration planned to make climate change a priority . " we will pursue an energy policy that reduces our carbon emissions while reducing our dependence on foreign oil and gas , fighting climate change and enhancing our economic and energy security , " clinton said .
she told her audience that the obama administration wanted the us to be " a leader in developing and implementing a global and coordinated response to climate change . "
middle east remains a top concern as for the recent conflict between israel and palestine , clinton said the new administration will commit itself to reaching " a just and lasting peace agreement . "
other foreign relations priorities for clinton will be the unfinished wars in iraq and afghanistan , conflicts in africa and efforts to revamp the tarnished us image overseas . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

important political support is needed .
germany 's undersecretary of state for development , erich stather , said poor countries in particular are in need of a " sea change " when it comes to energy resources .
more than two billion people around the world have no access to modern energy sources , and improved use of renewable energy can help those countries develop , he said over 60 percent of the conference participants will come from developing countries .

germany is pushing for it to be based in bonn - also the home of the secretariat of the un framework convention on climate change , the body tasked with crafting a new global climate deal in copenhagen in december .
representatives from the united states , china and japan would attend the conference , but are not expected to sign the founding document immediately , gabriel said .
the eu is aiming for use renewable sources for 20 percent of its energy needs by 2020 .
in germany , 15 percent of electricity consumption comes from renewable sources of energy and the government aims to double this by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 , that he evaded 966,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in taxes related to inherited funds he had hidden in the alpine principality of liechtenstein .
german tax authorities had accused zumwinkel , 65 , of concealing the money in trust funds managed by the ltg bank in liechtenstein .
he was detained in february 2008 after prosecutors obtained evidence from germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service on trusts administered by the bank on behalf of wealthy tax-evading europeans .
released on bail after a search of his villa , zumwinkel resigned shortly afterwards as head of deutsche post , one of the world 's leading logistics companies with a global workforce of more 350,000 .
later , he stepped down from positions on the boards of other leading german companies such as deutsche telekom , lufthansa and retailer arcandor .
prosectors say zumwinkel set up a trust for himself in liechtenstein in 1986 but failed to disclose earnings and dividends from it to german tax authorities , as required by law .
if convicted he could face jail and a hefty fine .
unconfirmed reports ahead of the trial said zumwinkel would enter a plea of guilty in return for a reduced sentence .
the verdict is expected on monday .
zumwinkel was one of hundreds of wealthy germans exposed when a liechtenstein bank employee betrayed them by selling a stolen dvd with details of their accounts to the bnd for about 5 million euros .
since then , german prosecutors have recovered more than 150 million euros in arrears from repentant taxpayers hoping to ward off trials . dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after the arrest of war-time bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic last july , serbia was expecting a positive assessment from brussels and ratification of the pre-accession stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with the eu .

in addition , the global financial crisis caused a drop in foreign investment that hit serbia especially hard .
the poll showed that the country 's citizens are unhappy with the speed of serbia 's eu integration and that 49 percent believe that " constant political conditions and blackmail " of serbia by the eu is the greatest obstacle to serbia 's eu entry , while 20 percent blamed it on the " incompetence of the domestic government .

" in may 2008 , citizens supported eu integration in greater numbers but , back then , expectations were higher as major investments had come to our country , " said milica delevic , director of serbia 's european integration office .
after the arrest of war-time bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic last july , serbia was expecting a positive assessment from brussels and ratification of the pre-accession stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with the eu .
serbians unhappy with speed of eu integration the netherlands however froze the saa , demanding full cooperation with the war crimes tribunal in the hague and the arrest of remaining fugitives ratko mladic and goran hadzic .
in addition , the global financial crisis caused a drop in foreign investment that hit serbia especially hard .
the poll showed that the country 's citizens are unhappy with the speed of serbia 's eu integration and that 49 percent believe that " constant political conditions and blackmail " of serbia by the eu is the greatest obstacle to serbia 's eu entry , while 20 percent blamed it on the " incompetence of the domestic government . "
europe has support among youth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbs thought europe would embrace them after karadzic was arrested delevic however said serbians realized that integration is a long process and that 51 percent of them see eu membership as a path to a better future for the country 's youth .
she added that young people have a more positive perception of the eu and that those aged 18 to 29 expect to have the greatest benefits from eu integration .
serbia aims to become a candidate for eu membership in 2009 and has repeatedly stressed that eu membership is one of its primary goals .

the forecast was slightly more pessimistic than the german government 's , but both expect the weakest economic performance by far since world war ii .
germany faces a recession that is expected to be " sizeable and extended , " according to the imf . only two months ago , the washington based institution which oversees the world financial system , had said that germany would contract just 0.8 percent this year .
next year , germany can a expect an incremental recovery after the gloomy downward projection , but the imf warned that " risks remain tilted to the downside . "
in 2010 , germany , one of the world 's biggest exporters , can expect the economy to grow by just 0.1 percent , according to the fund 's projections .
berlin publishes bleak economic assessment on wednesday , the german government 's annual economics report predicted rising unemployment as a result of the global economic slowdown .
the number of people out of work is expected to climb by 500,000 to 3.5 million before the end of the year .
that would push the german unemployment rate back up to 8.4 percent , according to the report .
reflecting the slump in germany 's export-oriented economy , carmaker audi on thursday said it would stop production for five days in february at its biggest german plant as orders for new cars plummet .
" we do not know yet whether we will move to cut working hours , which would be a first for audi , or whether to put in place a time-savings account , " a spokesman told news agency afp .
the move follows a similar announcement by europe 's leading auto maker volkswagen , which said on tuesday it would idle about two thirds of its 92,000 german workforce for one week next month as it cuts production .
imf : germany needs to take lead the imf however did praise europe 's largest economy for its efforts to stave off the impact of a recession with stimulus measures and bank bailouts .
last week the german authorities approved a 50 billion euro -lrb- $ 65 billion -rrb- package that would boost government spending for road projects , public transport , school and hospitals , and would include tax cuts to encourage spending .
" global policy actions and measures to contain the risk of a costly global self-reinforcing slump should preferably be co-ordinated regionally and internationally for maximum effect .

in a compromise suggested by the finance ministry , luxury limousines , rather than being taxed at a higher-rate for their high fuel consumption , would in fact be given a break .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is supposed to be lowering co2 emissions the news has sparked an outraged response from some politicians and environmentalists .
green party objects to plan instead of promoting outdated gas-guzzlers , the government should be making sure germany is producing greener cars , green party parliamentary group leader baerbel hoehn told the web site of news magazine der spiegel . currently , owners of energy-inefficient cars are penalized because they are taxed based on co2 output .
but the new arrangement calls for a limit on taxes based on engine capacity .
that in turn would be advantageous to drivers of heavy cars .
according to news reports , the plans are almost finalized , and no big changes to the reform are expected .
however , a spokesman for the finance ministry said nothing had been definitively decided yet , german newspaper die zeit reported .
environment minister sigmar gabriel was said to be opposed to the plan , and said he would n't approve it in its current state , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .
the parliamentary party vice chairman of the social democratic party , ulrich kelber , complained to reporters that " it would be a joke to call this an environmentally-oriented co2 tax . "
car-wrecking hotline is swamped meanwhile , german car owners swamped a hotline with calls this week after the government invited applications for a big cash handout to anyone crushing an old car and buying a new one . berlin officials said the hotline registered 270,000 calls on the first day , monday , far more than telephonists at the trade agency bafa could answer .
on tuesday , the rush ebbed a little to 150,000 . the government has promised 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,250 -rrb- to anyone owning a car more than nine years old who takes it to the wreckers and buys a new low-pollution car . the payouts will continue until the budgeted 1.5 billion euros has been used up .
part of the sum will be for administrative costs , but the scheme is expected to bring nearly 600,000 new cars on the roads . # b # although the aim is to help germany 's troubled car manufacturing industry , imported cars will be treated the same as german-made ones . the " free " handout has been the talk of germany for days .
a free-for-all is expected next tuesday when the application form is to be offered on the bafa website to download .
some predict the budget may be used up within a week . even owners of late-model cars have wondered if they might benefit .
to curb abuse , the applicant must have owned the old car for at least one year and become the registered owner of the new car . bafa said thursday it was confident there would be enough money for all applicants , at least for the first few days . the old cars must be destroyed by wreckers , who remove all useful parts , glass and plastic and put the steel remains in a metal press . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

environment minister sigmar gabriel was said to be opposed to the plan , and said he would n't approve it in its current state , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .
the parliamentary party vice chairman of the social democratic party , ulrich kelber , complained to reporters that " it would be a joke to call this an environmentally-oriented co2 tax . "
car-wrecking hotline is swamped meanwhile , german car owners swamped a hotline with calls this week after the government invited applications for a big cash handout to anyone crushing an old car and buying a new one . berlin officials said the hotline registered 270,000 calls on the first day , monday , far more than telephonists at the trade agency bafa could answer .
on tuesday , the rush ebbed a little to 150,000 . the government has promised 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,250 -rrb- to anyone owning a car more than nine years old who takes it to the wreckers and buys a new low-pollution car . the payouts will continue until the budgeted 1.5 billion euros has been used up .
part of the sum will be for administrative costs , but the scheme is expected to bring nearly 600,000 new cars on the roads . # b # although the aim is to help germany 's troubled car manufacturing industry , imported cars will be treated the same as german-made ones . the " free " handout has been the talk of germany for days .
a free-for-all is expected next tuesday when the application form is to be offered on the bafa website to download .
some predict the budget may be used up within a week . even owners of late-model cars have wondered if they might benefit .
to curb abuse , the applicant must have owned the old car for at least one year and become the registered owner of the new car . bafa said thursday it was confident there would be enough money for all applicants , at least for the first few days . the old cars must be destroyed by wreckers , who remove all useful parts , glass and plastic and put the steel remains in a metal press . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the forecast was slightly more pessimistic than the german government 's , but both expect the weakest economic performance by far since world war ii .
germany faces a recession that is expected to be " sizeable and extended , " according to the imf . only two months ago , the washington based institution which oversees the world financial system , had said that germany would contract just 0.8 percent this year .
next year , germany can a expect an incremental recovery after the gloomy downward projection , but the imf warned that " risks remain tilted to the downside . "
in 2010 , germany , one of the world 's biggest exporters , can expect the economy to grow by just 0.1 percent , according to the fund 's projections .
berlin publishes bleak economic assessment on wednesday , the german government 's annual economics report predicted rising unemployment as a result of the global economic slowdown .
the number of people out of work is expected to climb by 500,000 to 3.5 million before the end of the year .
that would push the german unemployment rate back up to 8.4 percent , according to the report .
reflecting the slump in germany 's export-oriented economy , carmaker audi on thursday said it would stop production for five days in february at its biggest german plant as orders for new cars plummet .
" we do not know yet whether we will move to cut working hours , which would be a first for audi , or whether to put in place a time-savings account , " a spokesman told news agency afp .
the move follows a similar announcement by europe 's leading auto maker volkswagen , which said on tuesday it would idle about two thirds of its 92,000 german workforce for one week next month as it cuts production .
imf : germany needs to take lead the imf however did praise europe 's largest economy for its efforts to stave off the impact of a recession with stimulus measures and bank bailouts .
last week the german authorities approved a 50 billion euro -lrb- $ 65 billion -rrb- package that would boost government spending for road projects , public transport , school and hospitals , and would include tax cuts to encourage spending .
" global policy actions and measures to contain the risk of a costly global self-reinforcing slump should preferably be co-ordinated regionally and internationally for maximum effect .
germany has a special leadership role to play in this process , " according to the report . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 22.01.2009 opinion : tax evasion trial no mere slap on the wrist großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the much-anticipated tax evasion trial is underway of a former top manager who hid money in lichtenstein .
deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky says that the million-euro fine is only the beginning . the case is fairly cut and dry , meaning the trial will likely be short .
as former head of postal giant deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel was germany 's best-known top manager , a man with an irreproachable reputation .
soon after zumwinkel 's spectacular arrest outside his villa in a posh suburb of cologne , he made a complete confession and quickly transferred the money he owed to the tax office in cologne .
the court in bochum has set aside two days for the case , but the trial could come to end even more quickly .
zumwinkel 's defense lawyer and the prosecutor 's office in bochum have reached an agreement for the court to adopt .
not only that , but a legal overhaul for prosecuting tax fraud cases similar to zumwinkel 's , which involves undeclared interest income from private foundations in lichtenstein , has already been agreed to .
the result : if the defendant offers up a guilty plea and shows remorse , he or she can expect a hefty fine and up to a two year suspended sentence .
this setup keeps offenders from facing time behind bars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky while it bothers many citizens ' delicate sense of justice , such outcomes are almost always the norm when it comes to economic crimes .
one reason is that the justice system is hopelessly overloaded .
for example , there are approximately 700 pending cases against tax cheats in bochum alone .
in all cases , people stashed money and interest earnings in lichtenstein in order to conceal it from the local tax authorities .
another reason is that jails would have to be expanded if all tax cheats were given the maximum penalty allowed by law .
the state would rather get money for the misdeeds of the past and honesty in the future .
a first liechtenstein tax evasion case against a multi-millionaire from bad homburg resulted in a penalty of 7.5 million euros -lrb- $ 9.8 million -rrb- as well as a two year sentence .
klaus zumwinkel will not face as harsh a penalty since his tax fraud was less than 1 million euros .
as a young man , before heading up the post , he and his brother inherited 10 department stores and 50 discount stores .
they sold this small empire in 1971 and with the 12 million euros in proceedings , zumwinkel started the private “ devotion family foundation ” in liechtenstein , which he used to conceal interest income from tax authorities .
yet the current court case only covers earnings from the last four years .
it appears that during the time in question , the prosecutor 's office in bochum was absorbed in internal office intrigues and power struggles which resulted in the office falling behind schedule in its day-to-day task of handling files .
for zumwinkel , this means that his tax evasion case will remain just under the 1 million euro mark .
the federal court of justice recently mandated an obligatory prison sentences for amounts over 1 million euros .
you could say that zumwinkel has fortune in injustice .
in the past , many other tax evaders have profited from the government 's practice of handing out high fines and suspended sentences .
the government is more interested in money than in filling its jails .
the moral of the story : earthly justice is relative .
a multi-millionaire like klaus zumwinkel can get over a million-euro fine .
but much more difficult for him was being forced out of deutsche post and his loss of many board of director positions and honorary posts .
he has also faced social ostracism and an empty appointment calendar .
in the meantime , part of the tour program for visitors to cologne includes a stop outside zumwinkel 's villa where he was arrested about one year ago in front of television cameras .
not surprisingly , the erstwhile top manager has retreated with increasing frequency to his castle in south tyrol .

the forecast was slightly more pessimistic than the german government 's , but both expect the weakest economic performance by far since world war ii .
germany faces a recession that is expected to be " sizeable and extended , " according to the imf . only two months ago , the washington based institution which oversees the world financial system , had said that germany would contract just 0.8 percent this year .
next year , germany can a expect an incremental recovery after the gloomy downward projection , but the imf warned that " risks remain tilted to the downside . "
in 2010 , germany , one of the world 's biggest exporters , can expect the economy to grow by just 0.1 percent , according to the fund 's projections .
berlin publishes bleak economic assessment on wednesday , the german government 's annual economics report predicted rising unemployment as a result of the global economic slowdown .
the number of people out of work is expected to climb by 500,000 to 3.5 million before the end of the year .
that would push the german unemployment rate back up to 8.4 percent , according to the report .
reflecting the slump in germany 's export-oriented economy , carmaker audi on thursday said it would stop production for five days in february at its biggest german plant as orders for new cars plummet .
" we do not know yet whether we will move to cut working hours , which would be a first for audi , or whether to put in place a time-savings account , " a spokesman told news agency afp .
the move follows a similar announcement by europe 's leading auto maker volkswagen , which said on tuesday it would idle about two thirds of its 92,000 german workforce for one week next month as it cuts production .
imf : germany needs to take lead the imf however did praise europe 's largest economy for its efforts to stave off the impact of a recession with stimulus measures and bank bailouts .
last week the german authorities approved a 50 billion euro -lrb- $ 65 billion -rrb- package that would boost government spending for road projects , public transport , school and hospitals , and would include tax cuts to encourage spending .
" global policy actions and measures to contain the risk of a costly global self-reinforcing slump should preferably be co-ordinated regionally and internationally for maximum effect .
germany has a special leadership role to play in this process , " according to the report . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 , that he evaded 966,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in taxes related to inherited funds he had hidden in the alpine principality of liechtenstein .
german tax authorities had accused zumwinkel , 65 , of concealing the money in trust funds managed by the ltg bank in liechtenstein .
he was detained in february 2008 after prosecutors obtained evidence from germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service on trusts administered by the bank on behalf of wealthy tax-evading europeans .
released on bail after a search of his villa , zumwinkel resigned shortly afterwards as head of deutsche post , one of the world 's leading logistics companies with a global workforce of more 350,000 .
later , he stepped down from positions on the boards of other leading german companies such as deutsche telekom , lufthansa and retailer arcandor .
prosectors say zumwinkel set up a trust for himself in liechtenstein in 1986 but failed to disclose earnings and dividends from it to german tax authorities , as required by law .
if convicted he could face jail and a hefty fine .
unconfirmed reports ahead of the trial said zumwinkel would enter a plea of guilty in return for a reduced sentence .
the verdict is expected on monday .
zumwinkel was one of hundreds of wealthy germans exposed when a liechtenstein bank employee betrayed them by selling a stolen dvd with details of their accounts to the bnd for about 5 million euros .
since then , german prosecutors have recovered more than 150 million euros in arrears from repentant taxpayers hoping to ward off trials . dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

representatives from the united states , china and japan would attend the conference , but are not expected to sign the founding document immediately , gabriel said .
the eu is aiming for use renewable sources for 20 percent of its energy needs by 2020 .

in a compromise suggested by the finance ministry , luxury limousines , rather than being taxed at a higher-rate for their high fuel consumption , would in fact be given a break .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is supposed to be lowering co2 emissions the news has sparked an outraged response from some politicians and environmentalists .
green party objects to plan instead of promoting outdated gas-guzzlers , the government should be making sure germany is producing greener cars , green party parliamentary group leader baerbel hoehn told the web site of news magazine der spiegel . currently , owners of energy-inefficient cars are penalized because they are taxed based on co2 output .
but the new arrangement calls for a limit on taxes based on engine capacity .
that in turn would be advantageous to drivers of heavy cars .
according to news reports , the plans are almost finalized , and no big changes to the reform are expected .
however , a spokesman for the finance ministry said nothing had been definitively decided yet , german newspaper die zeit reported .
environment minister sigmar gabriel was said to be opposed to the plan , and said he would n't approve it in its current state , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .
the parliamentary party vice chairman of the social democratic party , ulrich kelber , complained to reporters that " it would be a joke to call this an environmentally-oriented co2 tax . "
car-wrecking hotline is swamped meanwhile , german car owners swamped a hotline with calls this week after the government invited applications for a big cash handout to anyone crushing an old car and buying a new one . berlin officials said the hotline registered 270,000 calls on the first day , monday , far more than telephonists at the trade agency bafa could answer .
on tuesday , the rush ebbed a little to 150,000 . the government has promised 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,250 -rrb- to anyone owning a car more than nine years old who takes it to the wreckers and buys a new low-pollution car . the payouts will continue until the budgeted 1.5 billion euros has been used up .
part of the sum will be for administrative costs , but the scheme is expected to bring nearly 600,000 new cars on the roads . # b # although the aim is to help germany 's troubled car manufacturing industry , imported cars will be treated the same as german-made ones . the " free " handout has been the talk of germany for days .
a free-for-all is expected next tuesday when the application form is to be offered on the bafa website to download .
some predict the budget may be used up within a week . even owners of late-model cars have wondered if they might benefit .
to curb abuse , the applicant must have owned the old car for at least one year and become the registered owner of the new car . bafa said thursday it was confident there would be enough money for all applicants , at least for the first few days . the old cars must be destroyed by wreckers , who remove all useful parts , glass and plastic and put the steel remains in a metal press . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 , that he evaded 966,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in taxes related to inherited funds he had hidden in the alpine principality of liechtenstein .
german tax authorities had accused zumwinkel , 65 , of concealing the money in trust funds managed by the ltg bank in liechtenstein .
he was detained in february 2008 after prosecutors obtained evidence from germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service on trusts administered by the bank on behalf of wealthy tax-evading europeans .
released on bail after a search of his villa , zumwinkel resigned shortly afterwards as head of deutsche post , one of the world 's leading logistics companies with a global workforce of more 350,000 .
later , he stepped down from positions on the boards of other leading german companies such as deutsche telekom , lufthansa and retailer arcandor .
prosectors say zumwinkel set up a trust for himself in liechtenstein in 1986 but failed to disclose earnings and dividends from it to german tax authorities , as required by law .
if convicted he could face jail and a hefty fine .
unconfirmed reports ahead of the trial said zumwinkel would enter a plea of guilty in return for a reduced sentence .
the verdict is expected on monday .
zumwinkel was one of hundreds of wealthy germans exposed when a liechtenstein bank employee betrayed them by selling a stolen dvd with details of their accounts to the bnd for about 5 million euros .

he suggested a more british-scandinavian-mediterranean outlook . germany could use a dose of british common sense mixed with scandinavian pragmatism and rounded off with a little bit of the mediterranean 's easy-going spirit , germany 's finance minister told the country 's powerful automotive association .
finance minister peer steinbrueck said the government 's 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 66 billion -rrb- stimulus package is just what the country needs .
" i 'd wish for two things now , " steinbrueck reportedly said .
" first , that we watch out for the psychological impact and not ruin everything .
we germans have a tendency to see the glass as always half empty . "
pessimism " makes things worse " in the past , that pessimism has " sometimes caused us more problems than warranted by the actual situation , " steinbrueck said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck says pessimism will only make the crisis worse steinbrueck said berlin had been unfairly criticized at the beginning of the crisis for not doing enough while now facing the complaint that it had done too much , reuters news agency reported .
" and secondly , we need to let go of that certain german melancholy we sometimes have .
we need a mixture of british common sense , scandinavian pragmatism , and some of the ' twinkle-toed ' mediterranean style to get past the problems , " steinbrueck said .
deep recession predicted just hours before steinbrueck 's speech on wednesday , jan .
21 , the government announced that it expects the economy to contract by 2.25 percent in 2009 .
the collapse in demand for german exports means that europe 's biggest economy is facing its deepest recession since world war ii .
steinbrueck said that the recession can not be avoided , but that the government 's measure will help ease the downturn .
" i believe the measures we 've taken will put us on the right track , " he said .

political support is needed gabriel stressed the enormous economic potential offered by renewable energies , saying : " the potential for solar , wind , hydro and biomass energy is so big that we could supply energy to more than nine billion people on earth . "

important political support is needed .
germany 's undersecretary of state for development , erich stather , said poor countries in particular are in need of a " sea change " when it comes to energy resources .
more than two billion people around the world have no access to modern energy sources , and improved use of renewable energy can help those countries develop , he said over 60 percent of the conference participants will come from developing countries .

germany is pushing for it to be based in bonn - also the home of the secretariat of the un framework convention on climate change , the body tasked with crafting a new global climate deal in copenhagen in december .
representatives from the united states , china and japan would attend the conference , but are not expected to sign the founding document immediately , gabriel said .
the eu is aiming for use renewable sources for 20 percent of its energy needs by 2020 .
in germany , 15 percent of electricity consumption comes from renewable sources of energy and the government aims to double this by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 , to hold talks with eu foreign ministers .
" in order to help in answering the humanitarian need in the gaza strip , we are willing to cooperate in this as far as it is needed , " livni told reporters on wednesday .
she maintained that " the right of israel to defend itself includes not only defending itself against the firing of missiles , but also in terms of smuggling of weapons . "
humanitarian aid in focus wednesday evening 's talks were called by the eu in a bid to secure the immediate access of humanitarian aid into gaza and to start discussions on reviving the stalled middle east peace process .
foreign minister karel schwarzenberg of the czech republic , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , measured the meeting 's success by livni 's assurances that " everything will be done from the israeli side to have an effective humanitarian aid into the gaza strip . "

' international values ' livni said that the ceasefire was still being " tested " and again rejected direct talks with hamas .
she dismissed calls for international prosecutors to try israeli military officers for war crimes .
" the israeli army works according to international values , " said livni , insisting that a distinction had to be made between those who are " killed by mistake " and terrorists who " aim and fire at civilians . "
the meeting in brussels took place amid tight security , with police in riot gear keeping about 100 pro-palestinian protesters well away from the building where the talks were held .
eu seeks common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon visited gaza - and wants action livni arrived about an hour after the rest of the attendees to give her eu counterparts time to forge a common position .
prior to the meeting , differences had emerged among eu members about the need to hold direct talks with hamas .
" there is no possibility of reaching a permanent peace without everyone getting around the same table , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb .
" no comprehensive solution can be taken without hamas . "
schwarzenberg had told the european parliament as recently as tuesday that no formal contacts should be held with hamas until the organization renounced terrorism .
the talks in brussels came a day after un secretary general ban ki-moon became the highest-ranking foreign official to visit gaza and assess first hand the damage caused by the three-week conflict with israel .
further talks planned back at united nations headquarters wednesday in new york , ban told the security council that a thorough investigation should be made of israeli attacks that struck several un facilities in gaza during the conflict .
the responsible parties must be held accountable , he said .
brussels diplomats said they were in close contact with new us president barack obama , who earlier wednesday - his first full day in office - called four key middle east leaders to promise his immediate engagement in the israeli-palestinian peace process .

the accused were found to have adulterated baby milk formula with the toxic industrial chemical melamine in order to make the milk appear to contain more protein .
but it is unlikely that the trial in the sanlu company case is going to end the discussion about china ’ s worst food scandal in recent times . a court in shijiazhuang in china ’ s hebei province , where the sanlu group is based , has sentenced two men to death and several other of the accused to prison terms ranging up to a life sentence .
sanlu was the dairy company which had sold the largest amount of tainted milk and had continued to do so after the first children had developed kidney ailments and even died .
tian wenhua , the former general manager of sanlu , was given a life sentence together with a fine of two and a half million euros .
li fangping is one of the lawyers representing the victims ’ parents .
he is not fully satisfied with the verdict : " in the case of the sanlu company , production had been going on for many years .
from this it is obvious that the state authorities which control food safety didn ’ t fulfil their responsibilities .
in this sense i find something is missing in the court ruling .
if only these men are held accountable , it ’ s not really being fair to them , especially if they get such harsh sentences ! "
only scapegoats ?
the two men sentenced to death are zhang yujun , who produced and distributed the highest amount of fake protein powder laced with melamine in the country , over 600 tonnes , and geng jinping , one of the middlemen who played an important role in mixing this powder with watered-down milk from farmers and selling this deadly cocktail to dairy companies such as sanlu .
but many chinese wonder if these local criminals are not merely scapegoats in a case which has much larger dimensions .
" i personally think it won ’ t solve the problems of the public health system , " says lawyer li fangping .
" we wonder if those responsible for controlling food safety should not also be held accountable , including the local government . "
call for structural reforms li fangping believes that without thorough reforms in different fields , similar food scandals can happen again in china : " one area is improving the system by which officials are held accountable .
the second is that we should strengthen the role of ngos including consumer associations .
and the third would be to establish a system of punishment and compensation . "
dozens of further accused are still awaiting trial .
in any case , the legal battle about the melamine scandal is far from over , as several affected parents have appealed against compensation arrangements which they regard as insufficient .

the accused were found to have adulterated baby milk formula with the toxic industrial chemical melamine in order to make the milk appear to contain more protein .
but it is unlikely that the trial in the sanlu company case is going to end the discussion about china ’ s worst food scandal in recent times . a court in shijiazhuang in china ’ s hebei province , where the sanlu group is based , has sentenced two men to death and several other of the accused to prison terms ranging up to a life sentence .
sanlu was the dairy company which had sold the largest amount of tainted milk and had continued to do so after the first children had developed kidney ailments and even died .
tian wenhua , the former general manager of sanlu , was given a life sentence together with a fine of two and a half million euros .
li fangping is one of the lawyers representing the victims ’ parents .
he is not fully satisfied with the verdict : " in the case of the sanlu company , production had been going on for many years .
from this it is obvious that the state authorities which control food safety didn ’ t fulfil their responsibilities .
in this sense i find something is missing in the court ruling .
if only these men are held accountable , it ’ s not really being fair to them , especially if they get such harsh sentences ! "
only scapegoats ?
the two men sentenced to death are zhang yujun , who produced and distributed the highest amount of fake protein powder laced with melamine in the country , over 600 tonnes , and geng jinping , one of the middlemen who played an important role in mixing this powder with watered-down milk from farmers and selling this deadly cocktail to dairy companies such as sanlu .
but many chinese wonder if these local criminals are not merely scapegoats in a case which has much larger dimensions .
" i personally think it won ’ t solve the problems of the public health system , " says lawyer li fangping .
" we wonder if those responsible for controlling food safety should not also be held accountable , including the local government . "
call for structural reforms li fangping believes that without thorough reforms in different fields , similar food scandals can happen again in china : " one area is improving the system by which officials are held accountable .
the second is that we should strengthen the role of ngos including consumer associations .
and the third would be to establish a system of punishment and compensation . "
dozens of further accused are still awaiting trial .
in any case , the legal battle about the melamine scandal is far from over , as several affected parents have appealed against compensation arrangements which they regard as insufficient .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 22.01.2009 report : germany 's revised car-tax could benefit gas guzzlers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thirsty cars with a high co2 output could be the winners of the tax reform germany may give a break to drivers of big cars , turning an attempt at an ecologically oriented tax reform into a boon for gas guzzlers , one newspaper reported . some german lawmakers have moved to alter plans for a car tax , resulting in favorable conditions for cars that burn a lot of fuel , the sueddeutsche zeitung reported .
in a compromise suggested by the finance ministry , luxury limousines , rather than being taxed at a higher-rate for their high fuel consumption , would in fact be given a break .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is supposed to be lowering co2 emissions the news has sparked an outraged response from some politicians and environmentalists .
green party objects to plan instead of promoting outdated gas-guzzlers , the government should be making sure germany is producing greener cars , green party parliamentary group leader baerbel hoehn told the web site of news magazine der spiegel . currently , owners of energy-inefficient cars are penalized because they are taxed based on co2 output .
but the new arrangement calls for a limit on taxes based on engine capacity .
that in turn would be advantageous to drivers of heavy cars .
according to news reports , the plans are almost finalized , and no big changes to the reform are expected .
however , a spokesman for the finance ministry said nothing had been definitively decided yet , german newspaper die zeit reported .
environment minister sigmar gabriel was said to be opposed to the plan , and said he would n't approve it in its current state , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .
the parliamentary party vice chairman of the social democratic party , ulrich kelber , complained to reporters that " it would be a joke to call this an environmentally-oriented co2 tax . "
car-wrecking hotline is swamped meanwhile , german car owners swamped a hotline with calls this week after the government invited applications for a big cash handout to anyone crushing an old car and buying a new one . berlin officials said the hotline registered 270,000 calls on the first day , monday , far more than telephonists at the trade agency bafa could answer .
on tuesday , the rush ebbed a little to 150,000 . the government has promised 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,250 -rrb- to anyone owning a car more than nine years old who takes it to the wreckers and buys a new low-pollution car . the payouts will continue until the budgeted 1.5 billion euros has been used up .
part of the sum will be for administrative costs , but the scheme is expected to bring nearly 600,000 new cars on the roads . # b # although the aim is to help germany 's troubled car manufacturing industry , imported cars will be treated the same as german-made ones . the " free " handout has been the talk of germany for days .
a free-for-all is expected next tuesday when the application form is to be offered on the bafa website to download .
some predict the budget may be used up within a week . even owners of late-model cars have wondered if they might benefit .
to curb abuse , the applicant must have owned the old car for at least one year and become the registered owner of the new car . bafa said thursday it was confident there would be enough money for all applicants , at least for the first few days . the old cars must be destroyed by wreckers , who remove all useful parts , glass and plastic and put the steel remains in a metal press . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the forecast was slightly more pessimistic than the german government 's , but both expect the weakest economic performance by far since world war ii .
germany faces a recession that is expected to be " sizeable and extended , " according to the imf . only two months ago , the washington based institution which oversees the world financial system , had said that germany would contract just 0.8 percent this year .
next year , germany can a expect an incremental recovery after the gloomy downward projection , but the imf warned that " risks remain tilted to the downside . "
in 2010 , germany , one of the world 's biggest exporters , can expect the economy to grow by just 0.1 percent , according to the fund 's projections .
berlin publishes bleak economic assessment on wednesday , the german government 's annual economics report predicted rising unemployment as a result of the global economic slowdown .
the number of people out of work is expected to climb by 500,000 to 3.5 million before the end of the year .
that would push the german unemployment rate back up to 8.4 percent , according to the report .
reflecting the slump in germany 's export-oriented economy , carmaker audi on thursday said it would stop production for five days in february at its biggest german plant as orders for new cars plummet .
" we do not know yet whether we will move to cut working hours , which would be a first for audi , or whether to put in place a time-savings account , " a spokesman told news agency afp .
the move follows a similar announcement by europe 's leading auto maker volkswagen , which said on tuesday it would idle about two thirds of its 92,000 german workforce for one week next month as it cuts production .
imf : germany needs to take lead the imf however did praise europe 's largest economy for its efforts to stave off the impact of a recession with stimulus measures and bank bailouts .
last week the german authorities approved a 50 billion euro -lrb- $ 65 billion -rrb- package that would boost government spending for road projects , public transport , school and hospitals , and would include tax cuts to encourage spending .
" global policy actions and measures to contain the risk of a costly global self-reinforcing slump should preferably be co-ordinated regionally and internationally for maximum effect .
germany has a special leadership role to play in this process , " according to the report . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in may 2008 , citizens supported eu integration in greater numbers but , back then , expectations were higher as major investments had come to our country , " said milica delevic , director of serbia 's european integration office .
after the arrest of war-time bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic last july , serbia was expecting a positive assessment from brussels and ratification of the pre-accession stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with the eu .
serbians unhappy with speed of eu integration the netherlands however froze the saa , demanding full cooperation with the war crimes tribunal in the hague and the arrest of remaining fugitives ratko mladic and goran hadzic .
in addition , the global financial crisis caused a drop in foreign investment that hit serbia especially hard .
the poll showed that the country 's citizens are unhappy with the speed of serbia 's eu integration and that 49 percent believe that " constant political conditions and blackmail " of serbia by the eu is the greatest obstacle to serbia 's eu entry , while 20 percent blamed it on the " incompetence of the domestic government . "

she added that young people have a more positive perception of the eu and that those aged 18 to 29 expect to have the greatest benefits from eu integration .
serbia aims to become a candidate for eu membership in 2009 and has repeatedly stressed that eu membership is one of its primary goals .

former senator and northern ireland peace mediator george mitchell was appointed to bring peace between the palestinians and israelis in the middle east .
ambassador richard holbrooke , the architect of the dayton accords which ended the bosnian war , was charged with implementing us policy towards afghanistan and pakistan . barack obama told a press conference he would send mitchell to the region " as soon as possible " to ensure a " durable " and " sustainable " ceasefire in gaza .
germany to work with us on mideast , iran steinmeier 's office said thursday the german foreign minister had telephoned with clinton and agreed to meet soon .
steinmeier " thanked his american counterpart for her government 's determination to quickly engage itself in the middle east conflict , " the german foreign ministry said in a statement .
earlier , in a letter of congratulations to the new secretary of state , steinmeier said he intended to build on strong us-german ties .
" let us work together to find solutions for the great challenges of our time starting from the solid german-american relationship that has closely and amicably connected us , " steinmeier wrote . he said important points for cooperation will be conflict in the middle east , climate change , iran ’ s nuclear programme and the financial crisis .
clinton took her place in barack obama 's new cabinet , a day after he was sworn in as us president .
on thursday , a beaming clinton greeted her new colleagues at the us state department , promising a change in how the united states deals with the rest of the world .
clinton was president barack obama 's democratic rival .
after his win in november of 2008 , clinton became obama 's surprise choice to oversee the 20,000-strong us state department .
" i believe with all my heart that this is a new era for america , " clinton told a crowd of state department employees who had gathered to welcome the former democratic senator from new york to her first day as america 's top diplomat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , seen here with israeli president shimon peres , is pushing for a lasting solution to the mideast conflict in his letter , steinmeier reminded clinton of the long friendship between germany and the united states and said he expected the relationship to be further strengthened under obama .
he said that he supported clinton 's goal of creating a world " with more friends and fewer opponents " and overcoming " hate , violence , lawlessness and despair . "
" i would like to offer you my full support for this policy , " he wrote .
clinton has said she will advocate the use of " smart power " - which combines diplomatic and economic influence with military strength - to reach us objectives in the world .
clinton , whose husband is former us president bill clinton , took over the state department reigns from outgoing us secretary of state condoleezza rice .

steinmeier has long called on washington to consider direct talks with the leadership in tehran .
at her confirmation hearing last week , clinton told the senate foreign relations committee that the obama administration would pursue " an attitude toward engagement -lrb- with iran -rrb- that might bear fruit . "
but she did not mention whether washington would set conditions for such a change in us policy after nearly 30 years of official silence with tehran .
us wants to lead on climate change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton said the us wants to take a lead role in climate protection clinton also made it clear that the obama administration planned to make climate change a priority . " we will pursue an energy policy that reduces our carbon emissions while reducing our dependence on foreign oil and gas , fighting climate change and enhancing our economic and energy security , " clinton said .

" in may 2008 , citizens supported eu integration in greater numbers but , back then , expectations were higher as major investments had come to our country , " said milica delevic , director of serbia 's european integration office .
after the arrest of war-time bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic last july , serbia was expecting a positive assessment from brussels and ratification of the pre-accession stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with the eu .

in addition , the global financial crisis caused a drop in foreign investment that hit serbia especially hard .
the poll showed that the country 's citizens are unhappy with the speed of serbia 's eu integration and that 49 percent believe that " constant political conditions and blackmail " of serbia by the eu is the greatest obstacle to serbia 's eu entry , while 20 percent blamed it on the " incompetence of the domestic government . "

she added that young people have a more positive perception of the eu and that those aged 18 to 29 expect to have the greatest benefits from eu integration .

former senator and northern ireland peace mediator george mitchell was appointed to bring peace between the palestinians and israelis in the middle east .
ambassador richard holbrooke , the architect of the dayton accords which ended the bosnian war , was charged with implementing us policy towards afghanistan and pakistan . barack obama told a press conference he would send mitchell to the region " as soon as possible " to ensure a " durable " and " sustainable " ceasefire in gaza .
germany to work with us on mideast , iran steinmeier 's office said thursday the german foreign minister had telephoned with clinton and agreed to meet soon .
steinmeier " thanked his american counterpart for her government 's determination to quickly engage itself in the middle east conflict , " the german foreign ministry said in a statement .
earlier , in a letter of congratulations to the new secretary of state , steinmeier said he intended to build on strong us-german ties .
" let us work together to find solutions for the great challenges of our time starting from the solid german-american relationship that has closely and amicably connected us , " steinmeier wrote . he said important points for cooperation will be conflict in the middle east , climate change , iran ’ s nuclear programme and the financial crisis .
clinton took her place in barack obama 's new cabinet , a day after he was sworn in as us president .
on thursday , a beaming clinton greeted her new colleagues at the us state department , promising a change in how the united states deals with the rest of the world .
clinton was president barack obama 's democratic rival .
after his win in november of 2008 , clinton became obama 's surprise choice to oversee the 20,000-strong us state department .
" i believe with all my heart that this is a new era for america , " clinton told a crowd of state department employees who had gathered to welcome the former democratic senator from new york to her first day as america 's top diplomat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , seen here with israeli president shimon peres , is pushing for a lasting solution to the mideast conflict in his letter , steinmeier reminded clinton of the long friendship between germany and the united states and said he expected the relationship to be further strengthened under obama .
he said that he supported clinton 's goal of creating a world " with more friends and fewer opponents " and overcoming " hate , violence , lawlessness and despair . "
" i would like to offer you my full support for this policy , " he wrote .
clinton has said she will advocate the use of " smart power " - which combines diplomatic and economic influence with military strength - to reach us objectives in the world .
clinton , whose husband is former us president bill clinton , took over the state department reigns from outgoing us secretary of state condoleezza rice .
us mum on whether it will talk with iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants the us to directly talk with iran germany is one of six countries working together in a bid to persuade iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions .
steinmeier has long called on washington to consider direct talks with the leadership in tehran .
at her confirmation hearing last week , clinton told the senate foreign relations committee that the obama administration would pursue " an attitude toward engagement -lrb- with iran -rrb- that might bear fruit . "
but she did not mention whether washington would set conditions for such a change in us policy after nearly 30 years of official silence with tehran .
us wants to lead on climate change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton said the us wants to take a lead role in climate protection clinton also made it clear that the obama administration planned to make climate change a priority . " we will pursue an energy policy that reduces our carbon emissions while reducing our dependence on foreign oil and gas , fighting climate change and enhancing our economic and energy security , " clinton said .

the forecast was slightly more pessimistic than the german government 's , but both expect the weakest economic performance by far since world war ii .
germany faces a recession that is expected to be " sizeable and extended , " according to the imf . only two months ago , the washington based institution which oversees the world financial system , had said that germany would contract just 0.8 percent this year .
next year , germany can a expect an incremental recovery after the gloomy downward projection , but the imf warned that " risks remain tilted to the downside . "
in 2010 , germany , one of the world 's biggest exporters , can expect the economy to grow by just 0.1 percent , according to the fund 's projections .
berlin publishes bleak economic assessment on wednesday , the german government 's annual economics report predicted rising unemployment as a result of the global economic slowdown .
the number of people out of work is expected to climb by 500,000 to 3.5 million before the end of the year .
that would push the german unemployment rate back up to 8.4 percent , according to the report .
reflecting the slump in germany 's export-oriented economy , carmaker audi on thursday said it would stop production for five days in february at its biggest german plant as orders for new cars plummet .
" we do not know yet whether we will move to cut working hours , which would be a first for audi , or whether to put in place a time-savings account , " a spokesman told news agency afp .
the move follows a similar announcement by europe 's leading auto maker volkswagen , which said on tuesday it would idle about two thirds of its 92,000 german workforce for one week next month as it cuts production .
imf : germany needs to take lead the imf however did praise europe 's largest economy for its efforts to stave off the impact of a recession with stimulus measures and bank bailouts .
last week the german authorities approved a 50 billion euro -lrb- $ 65 billion -rrb- package that would boost government spending for road projects , public transport , school and hospitals , and would include tax cuts to encourage spending .
" global policy actions and measures to contain the risk of a costly global self-reinforcing slump should preferably be co-ordinated regionally and internationally for maximum effect .
germany has a special leadership role to play in this process , " according to the report . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a compromise suggested by the finance ministry , luxury limousines , rather than being taxed at a higher-rate for their high fuel consumption , would in fact be given a break .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is supposed to be lowering co2 emissions the news has sparked an outraged response from some politicians and environmentalists .
green party objects to plan instead of promoting outdated gas-guzzlers , the government should be making sure germany is producing greener cars , green party parliamentary group leader baerbel hoehn told the web site of news magazine der spiegel . currently , owners of energy-inefficient cars are penalized because they are taxed based on co2 output .
but the new arrangement calls for a limit on taxes based on engine capacity .
that in turn would be advantageous to drivers of heavy cars .
according to news reports , the plans are almost finalized , and no big changes to the reform are expected .
however , a spokesman for the finance ministry said nothing had been definitively decided yet , german newspaper die zeit reported .
environment minister sigmar gabriel was said to be opposed to the plan , and said he would n't approve it in its current state , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .
the parliamentary party vice chairman of the social democratic party , ulrich kelber , complained to reporters that " it would be a joke to call this an environmentally-oriented co2 tax . "
car-wrecking hotline is swamped meanwhile , german car owners swamped a hotline with calls this week after the government invited applications for a big cash handout to anyone crushing an old car and buying a new one . berlin officials said the hotline registered 270,000 calls on the first day , monday , far more than telephonists at the trade agency bafa could answer .
on tuesday , the rush ebbed a little to 150,000 . the government has promised 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,250 -rrb- to anyone owning a car more than nine years old who takes it to the wreckers and buys a new low-pollution car . the payouts will continue until the budgeted 1.5 billion euros has been used up .
part of the sum will be for administrative costs , but the scheme is expected to bring nearly 600,000 new cars on the roads . # b # although the aim is to help germany 's troubled car manufacturing industry , imported cars will be treated the same as german-made ones . the " free " handout has been the talk of germany for days .
a free-for-all is expected next tuesday when the application form is to be offered on the bafa website to download .
some predict the budget may be used up within a week . even owners of late-model cars have wondered if they might benefit .
to curb abuse , the applicant must have owned the old car for at least one year and become the registered owner of the new car . bafa said thursday it was confident there would be enough money for all applicants , at least for the first few days . the old cars must be destroyed by wreckers , who remove all useful parts , glass and plastic and put the steel remains in a metal press . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 , to hold talks with eu foreign ministers .
" in order to help in answering the humanitarian need in the gaza strip , we are willing to cooperate in this as far as it is needed , " livni told reporters on wednesday .
she maintained that " the right of israel to defend itself includes not only defending itself against the firing of missiles , but also in terms of smuggling of weapons . "
humanitarian aid in focus wednesday evening 's talks were called by the eu in a bid to secure the immediate access of humanitarian aid into gaza and to start discussions on reviving the stalled middle east peace process .
foreign minister karel schwarzenberg of the czech republic , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , measured the meeting 's success by livni 's assurances that " everything will be done from the israeli side to have an effective humanitarian aid into the gaza strip . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni insists israel 's must defend itself against smuggled weapons livni focused on the need to stop the alleged armament of hamas by iran via egyptian territory .
" from our perspective , we achieved ... an understanding about the need to give an answer to the smuggling of weapons to the gaza strip , " she said .
monitors still await entry no deal was believed to have been reached on how many crossings should be reopened , for how long or how they should be monitored .
the eu maintained a small monitoring team at the rafah crossing from 2005-07 , when the monitors had to be withdrawn after hamas violently seized control of the coastal enclave .
some 40 eu monitors are now on standby in nearby ashkelon , israel , waiting to be redeployed to the gaza border .
while eu foreign policy chief javier solana said that his office would spare no effort to bring aid to gaza civilians , none of the participants at wednesday 's meeting announced the monitors ' imminent return to rafah .
' international values ' livni said that the ceasefire was still being " tested " and again rejected direct talks with hamas .
she dismissed calls for international prosecutors to try israeli military officers for war crimes .
" the israeli army works according to international values , " said livni , insisting that a distinction had to be made between those who are " killed by mistake " and terrorists who " aim and fire at civilians . "
the meeting in brussels took place amid tight security , with police in riot gear keeping about 100 pro-palestinian protesters well away from the building where the talks were held .
eu seeks common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon visited gaza - and wants action livni arrived about an hour after the rest of the attendees to give her eu counterparts time to forge a common position .
prior to the meeting , differences had emerged among eu members about the need to hold direct talks with hamas .
" there is no possibility of reaching a permanent peace without everyone getting around the same table , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb .
" no comprehensive solution can be taken without hamas . "
schwarzenberg had told the european parliament as recently as tuesday that no formal contacts should be held with hamas until the organization renounced terrorism .
the talks in brussels came a day after un secretary general ban ki-moon became the highest-ranking foreign official to visit gaza and assess first hand the damage caused by the three-week conflict with israel .
further talks planned back at united nations headquarters wednesday in new york , ban told the security council that a thorough investigation should be made of israeli attacks that struck several un facilities in gaza during the conflict .
the responsible parties must be held accountable , he said .
brussels diplomats said they were in close contact with new us president barack obama , who earlier wednesday - his first full day in office - called four key middle east leaders to promise his immediate engagement in the israeli-palestinian peace process .

21 , to hold talks with eu foreign ministers .
" in order to help in answering the humanitarian need in the gaza strip , we are willing to cooperate in this as far as it is needed , " livni told reporters on wednesday .
she maintained that " the right of israel to defend itself includes not only defending itself against the firing of missiles , but also in terms of smuggling of weapons . "
humanitarian aid in focus wednesday evening 's talks were called by the eu in a bid to secure the immediate access of humanitarian aid into gaza and to start discussions on reviving the stalled middle east peace process .
foreign minister karel schwarzenberg of the czech republic , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , measured the meeting 's success by livni 's assurances that " everything will be done from the israeli side to have an effective humanitarian aid into the gaza strip . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni insists israel 's must defend itself against smuggled weapons livni focused on the need to stop the alleged armament of hamas by iran via egyptian territory .
" from our perspective , we achieved ... an understanding about the need to give an answer to the smuggling of weapons to the gaza strip , " she said .
monitors still await entry no deal was believed to have been reached on how many crossings should be reopened , for how long or how they should be monitored .
the eu maintained a small monitoring team at the rafah crossing from 2005-07 , when the monitors had to be withdrawn after hamas violently seized control of the coastal enclave .
some 40 eu monitors are now on standby in nearby ashkelon , israel , waiting to be redeployed to the gaza border .
while eu foreign policy chief javier solana said that his office would spare no effort to bring aid to gaza civilians , none of the participants at wednesday 's meeting announced the monitors ' imminent return to rafah .
' international values ' livni said that the ceasefire was still being " tested " and again rejected direct talks with hamas .
she dismissed calls for international prosecutors to try israeli military officers for war crimes .
" the israeli army works according to international values , " said livni , insisting that a distinction had to be made between those who are " killed by mistake " and terrorists who " aim and fire at civilians . "
the meeting in brussels took place amid tight security , with police in riot gear keeping about 100 pro-palestinian protesters well away from the building where the talks were held .
eu seeks common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon visited gaza - and wants action livni arrived about an hour after the rest of the attendees to give her eu counterparts time to forge a common position .
prior to the meeting , differences had emerged among eu members about the need to hold direct talks with hamas .
" there is no possibility of reaching a permanent peace without everyone getting around the same table , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb .
" no comprehensive solution can be taken without hamas . "

that is a 10 percent increase over 2002 , according to the poll commissioned by the hans boeckler foundation , which is close to trade unions .
total assets increased but the median level , the midway point between the highest and the lowest , stayed stuck at 15,000 euros - indicating that the rich got richer .
the wealth gap between what was once east and west germany also widened , the study showed .
in the west , assets rose almost 11 percent between 2002 and 2007 , but in the east they fell by just under 10 percent .
adjusted for inflation the fall was 17 percent .
" if politicians fail to act , poverty among the elderly in eastern germany will grow sharply in the future , " the report 's authors joachim frick and markus grabka said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar cells store the sun 's energy : no carbon needed the participants hope to sign a founding agreement at the conference , which is slated to take place on monday , jan .
26 .
political support is needed gabriel stressed the enormous economic potential offered by renewable energies , saying : " the potential for solar , wind , hydro and biomass energy is so big that we could supply energy to more than nine billion people on earth . "
but he added that there is still a lot of work to be done in order to spread their use .
important political support is needed .
germany 's undersecretary of state for development , erich stather , said poor countries in particular are in need of a " sea change " when it comes to energy resources .
more than two billion people around the world have no access to modern energy sources , and improved use of renewable energy can help those countries develop , he said over 60 percent of the conference participants will come from developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more global warming is in nobody 's interest decision on a headquarters the founding members of irena will decide in june 2009 where the agency will be located .
germany is pushing for it to be based in bonn - also the home of the secretariat of the un framework convention on climate change , the body tasked with crafting a new global climate deal in copenhagen in december .
representatives from the united states , china and japan would attend the conference , but are not expected to sign the founding document immediately , gabriel said .
the eu is aiming for use renewable sources for 20 percent of its energy needs by 2020 .
in germany , 15 percent of electricity consumption comes from renewable sources of energy and the government aims to double this by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky says that the million-euro fine is only the beginning . the case is fairly cut and dry , meaning the trial will likely be short .
as former head of postal giant deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel was germany 's best-known top manager , a man with an irreproachable reputation .
soon after zumwinkel 's spectacular arrest outside his villa in a posh suburb of cologne , he made a complete confession and quickly transferred the money he owed to the tax office in cologne .
the court in bochum has set aside two days for the case , but the trial could come to end even more quickly .
zumwinkel 's defense lawyer and the prosecutor 's office in bochum have reached an agreement for the court to adopt .
not only that , but a legal overhaul for prosecuting tax fraud cases similar to zumwinkel 's , which involves undeclared interest income from private foundations in lichtenstein , has already been agreed to .
the result : if the defendant offers up a guilty plea and shows remorse , he or she can expect a hefty fine and up to a two year suspended sentence .
this setup keeps offenders from facing time behind bars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky while it bothers many citizens ' delicate sense of justice , such outcomes are almost always the norm when it comes to economic crimes .
one reason is that the justice system is hopelessly overloaded .
for example , there are approximately 700 pending cases against tax cheats in bochum alone .
in all cases , people stashed money and interest earnings in lichtenstein in order to conceal it from the local tax authorities .
another reason is that jails would have to be expanded if all tax cheats were given the maximum penalty allowed by law .
the state would rather get money for the misdeeds of the past and honesty in the future .
a first liechtenstein tax evasion case against a multi-millionaire from bad homburg resulted in a penalty of 7.5 million euros -lrb- $ 9.8 million -rrb- as well as a two year sentence .
klaus zumwinkel will not face as harsh a penalty since his tax fraud was less than 1 million euros .
as a young man , before heading up the post , he and his brother inherited 10 department stores and 50 discount stores .
they sold this small empire in 1971 and with the 12 million euros in proceedings , zumwinkel started the private “ devotion family foundation ” in liechtenstein , which he used to conceal interest income from tax authorities .
yet the current court case only covers earnings from the last four years .
it appears that during the time in question , the prosecutor 's office in bochum was absorbed in internal office intrigues and power struggles which resulted in the office falling behind schedule in its day-to-day task of handling files .
for zumwinkel , this means that his tax evasion case will remain just under the 1 million euro mark .
the federal court of justice recently mandated an obligatory prison sentences for amounts over 1 million euros .
you could say that zumwinkel has fortune in injustice .
in the past , many other tax evaders have profited from the government 's practice of handing out high fines and suspended sentences .
the government is more interested in money than in filling its jails .
the moral of the story : earthly justice is relative .
a multi-millionaire like klaus zumwinkel can get over a million-euro fine .
but much more difficult for him was being forced out of deutsche post and his loss of many board of director positions and honorary posts .
he has also faced social ostracism and an empty appointment calendar .
in the meantime , part of the tour program for visitors to cologne includes a stop outside zumwinkel 's villa where he was arrested about one year ago in front of television cameras .
not surprisingly , the erstwhile top manager has retreated with increasing frequency to his castle in south tyrol .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 22.01.2009 opinion : tax evasion trial no mere slap on the wrist großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the much-anticipated tax evasion trial is underway of a former top manager who hid money in lichtenstein .
deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky says that the million-euro fine is only the beginning . the case is fairly cut and dry , meaning the trial will likely be short .
as former head of postal giant deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel was germany 's best-known top manager , a man with an irreproachable reputation .
soon after zumwinkel 's spectacular arrest outside his villa in a posh suburb of cologne , he made a complete confession and quickly transferred the money he owed to the tax office in cologne .
the court in bochum has set aside two days for the case , but the trial could come to end even more quickly .
zumwinkel 's defense lawyer and the prosecutor 's office in bochum have reached an agreement for the court to adopt .
not only that , but a legal overhaul for prosecuting tax fraud cases similar to zumwinkel 's , which involves undeclared interest income from private foundations in lichtenstein , has already been agreed to .
the result : if the defendant offers up a guilty plea and shows remorse , he or she can expect a hefty fine and up to a two year suspended sentence .
this setup keeps offenders from facing time behind bars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky while it bothers many citizens ' delicate sense of justice , such outcomes are almost always the norm when it comes to economic crimes .
one reason is that the justice system is hopelessly overloaded .
for example , there are approximately 700 pending cases against tax cheats in bochum alone .
in all cases , people stashed money and interest earnings in lichtenstein in order to conceal it from the local tax authorities .
another reason is that jails would have to be expanded if all tax cheats were given the maximum penalty allowed by law .
the state would rather get money for the misdeeds of the past and honesty in the future .
a first liechtenstein tax evasion case against a multi-millionaire from bad homburg resulted in a penalty of 7.5 million euros -lrb- $ 9.8 million -rrb- as well as a two year sentence .
klaus zumwinkel will not face as harsh a penalty since his tax fraud was less than 1 million euros .
as a young man , before heading up the post , he and his brother inherited 10 department stores and 50 discount stores .
they sold this small empire in 1971 and with the 12 million euros in proceedings , zumwinkel started the private “ devotion family foundation ” in liechtenstein , which he used to conceal interest income from tax authorities .
yet the current court case only covers earnings from the last four years .
it appears that during the time in question , the prosecutor 's office in bochum was absorbed in internal office intrigues and power struggles which resulted in the office falling behind schedule in its day-to-day task of handling files .
for zumwinkel , this means that his tax evasion case will remain just under the 1 million euro mark .
the federal court of justice recently mandated an obligatory prison sentences for amounts over 1 million euros .
you could say that zumwinkel has fortune in injustice .
in the past , many other tax evaders have profited from the government 's practice of handing out high fines and suspended sentences .
the government is more interested in money than in filling its jails .
the moral of the story : earthly justice is relative .
a multi-millionaire like klaus zumwinkel can get over a million-euro fine .
but much more difficult for him was being forced out of deutsche post and his loss of many board of director positions and honorary posts .
he has also faced social ostracism and an empty appointment calendar .
in the meantime , part of the tour program for visitors to cologne includes a stop outside zumwinkel 's villa where he was arrested about one year ago in front of television cameras .
not surprisingly , the erstwhile top manager has retreated with increasing frequency to his castle in south tyrol .

22 , that he evaded 966,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in taxes related to inherited funds he had hidden in the alpine principality of liechtenstein .
german tax authorities had accused zumwinkel , 65 , of concealing the money in trust funds managed by the ltg bank in liechtenstein .
he was detained in february 2008 after prosecutors obtained evidence from germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service on trusts administered by the bank on behalf of wealthy tax-evading europeans .
released on bail after a search of his villa , zumwinkel resigned shortly afterwards as head of deutsche post , one of the world 's leading logistics companies with a global workforce of more 350,000 .
later , he stepped down from positions on the boards of other leading german companies such as deutsche telekom , lufthansa and retailer arcandor .
prosectors say zumwinkel set up a trust for himself in liechtenstein in 1986 but failed to disclose earnings and dividends from it to german tax authorities , as required by law .
if convicted he could face jail and a hefty fine .
unconfirmed reports ahead of the trial said zumwinkel would enter a plea of guilty in return for a reduced sentence .
the verdict is expected on monday .
zumwinkel was one of hundreds of wealthy germans exposed when a liechtenstein bank employee betrayed them by selling a stolen dvd with details of their accounts to the bnd for about 5 million euros .
since then , german prosecutors have recovered more than 150 million euros in arrears from repentant taxpayers hoping to ward off trials . dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 , that he evaded 966,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in taxes related to inherited funds he had hidden in the alpine principality of liechtenstein .
german tax authorities had accused zumwinkel , 65 , of concealing the money in trust funds managed by the ltg bank in liechtenstein .
he was detained in february 2008 after prosecutors obtained evidence from germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service on trusts administered by the bank on behalf of wealthy tax-evading europeans .
released on bail after a search of his villa , zumwinkel resigned shortly afterwards as head of deutsche post , one of the world 's leading logistics companies with a global workforce of more 350,000 .
later , he stepped down from positions on the boards of other leading german companies such as deutsche telekom , lufthansa and retailer arcandor .
prosectors say zumwinkel set up a trust for himself in liechtenstein in 1986 but failed to disclose earnings and dividends from it to german tax authorities , as required by law .
if convicted he could face jail and a hefty fine .
unconfirmed reports ahead of the trial said zumwinkel would enter a plea of guilty in return for a reduced sentence .
the verdict is expected on monday .
zumwinkel was one of hundreds of wealthy germans exposed when a liechtenstein bank employee betrayed them by selling a stolen dvd with details of their accounts to the bnd for about 5 million euros .

" in may 2008 , citizens supported eu integration in greater numbers but , back then , expectations were higher as major investments had come to our country , " said milica delevic , director of serbia 's european integration office .
after the arrest of war-time bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic last july , serbia was expecting a positive assessment from brussels and ratification of the pre-accession stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with the eu .
serbians unhappy with speed of eu integration the netherlands however froze the saa , demanding full cooperation with the war crimes tribunal in the hague and the arrest of remaining fugitives ratko mladic and goran hadzic .
in addition , the global financial crisis caused a drop in foreign investment that hit serbia especially hard .
the poll showed that the country 's citizens are unhappy with the speed of serbia 's eu integration and that 49 percent believe that " constant political conditions and blackmail " of serbia by the eu is the greatest obstacle to serbia 's eu entry , while 20 percent blamed it on the " incompetence of the domestic government . "
europe has support among youth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbs thought europe would embrace them after karadzic was arrested delevic however said serbians realized that integration is a long process and that 51 percent of them see eu membership as a path to a better future for the country 's youth .
she added that young people have a more positive perception of the eu and that those aged 18 to 29 expect to have the greatest benefits from eu integration .
serbia aims to become a candidate for eu membership in 2009 and has repeatedly stressed that eu membership is one of its primary goals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 22.01.2009 report : germany 's revised car-tax could benefit gas guzzlers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thirsty cars with a high co2 output could be the winners of the tax reform germany may give a break to drivers of big cars , turning an attempt at an ecologically oriented tax reform into a boon for gas guzzlers , one newspaper reported . some german lawmakers have moved to alter plans for a car tax , resulting in favorable conditions for cars that burn a lot of fuel , the sueddeutsche zeitung reported .
in a compromise suggested by the finance ministry , luxury limousines , rather than being taxed at a higher-rate for their high fuel consumption , would in fact be given a break .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is supposed to be lowering co2 emissions the news has sparked an outraged response from some politicians and environmentalists .
green party objects to plan instead of promoting outdated gas-guzzlers , the government should be making sure germany is producing greener cars , green party parliamentary group leader baerbel hoehn told the web site of news magazine der spiegel . currently , owners of energy-inefficient cars are penalized because they are taxed based on co2 output .
but the new arrangement calls for a limit on taxes based on engine capacity .
that in turn would be advantageous to drivers of heavy cars .
according to news reports , the plans are almost finalized , and no big changes to the reform are expected .
however , a spokesman for the finance ministry said nothing had been definitively decided yet , german newspaper die zeit reported .
environment minister sigmar gabriel was said to be opposed to the plan , and said he would n't approve it in its current state , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .
the parliamentary party vice chairman of the social democratic party , ulrich kelber , complained to reporters that " it would be a joke to call this an environmentally-oriented co2 tax . "
car-wrecking hotline is swamped meanwhile , german car owners swamped a hotline with calls this week after the government invited applications for a big cash handout to anyone crushing an old car and buying a new one . berlin officials said the hotline registered 270,000 calls on the first day , monday , far more than telephonists at the trade agency bafa could answer .
on tuesday , the rush ebbed a little to 150,000 . the government has promised 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,250 -rrb- to anyone owning a car more than nine years old who takes it to the wreckers and buys a new low-pollution car . the payouts will continue until the budgeted 1.5 billion euros has been used up .
part of the sum will be for administrative costs , but the scheme is expected to bring nearly 600,000 new cars on the roads . # b # although the aim is to help germany 's troubled car manufacturing industry , imported cars will be treated the same as german-made ones . the " free " handout has been the talk of germany for days .
a free-for-all is expected next tuesday when the application form is to be offered on the bafa website to download .
some predict the budget may be used up within a week . even owners of late-model cars have wondered if they might benefit .
to curb abuse , the applicant must have owned the old car for at least one year and become the registered owner of the new car . bafa said thursday it was confident there would be enough money for all applicants , at least for the first few days . the old cars must be destroyed by wreckers , who remove all useful parts , glass and plastic and put the steel remains in a metal press . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he suggested a more british-scandinavian-mediterranean outlook . germany could use a dose of british common sense mixed with scandinavian pragmatism and rounded off with a little bit of the mediterranean 's easy-going spirit , germany 's finance minister told the country 's powerful automotive association .
finance minister peer steinbrueck said the government 's 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 66 billion -rrb- stimulus package is just what the country needs .
" i 'd wish for two things now , " steinbrueck reportedly said .
" first , that we watch out for the psychological impact and not ruin everything .
we germans have a tendency to see the glass as always half empty . "
pessimism " makes things worse " in the past , that pessimism has " sometimes caused us more problems than warranted by the actual situation , " steinbrueck said .

" and secondly , we need to let go of that certain german melancholy we sometimes have .
we need a mixture of british common sense , scandinavian pragmatism , and some of the ' twinkle-toed ' mediterranean style to get past the problems , " steinbrueck said .
deep recession predicted just hours before steinbrueck 's speech on wednesday , jan .

the collapse in demand for german exports means that europe 's biggest economy is facing its deepest recession since world war ii .
steinbrueck said that the recession can not be avoided , but that the government 's measure will help ease the downturn .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 22.01.2009 opinion : tax evasion trial no mere slap on the wrist großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the much-anticipated tax evasion trial is underway of a former top manager who hid money in lichtenstein .
deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky says that the million-euro fine is only the beginning . the case is fairly cut and dry , meaning the trial will likely be short .
as former head of postal giant deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel was germany 's best-known top manager , a man with an irreproachable reputation .
soon after zumwinkel 's spectacular arrest outside his villa in a posh suburb of cologne , he made a complete confession and quickly transferred the money he owed to the tax office in cologne .
the court in bochum has set aside two days for the case , but the trial could come to end even more quickly .
zumwinkel 's defense lawyer and the prosecutor 's office in bochum have reached an agreement for the court to adopt .
not only that , but a legal overhaul for prosecuting tax fraud cases similar to zumwinkel 's , which involves undeclared interest income from private foundations in lichtenstein , has already been agreed to .
the result : if the defendant offers up a guilty plea and shows remorse , he or she can expect a hefty fine and up to a two year suspended sentence .
this setup keeps offenders from facing time behind bars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky while it bothers many citizens ' delicate sense of justice , such outcomes are almost always the norm when it comes to economic crimes .
one reason is that the justice system is hopelessly overloaded .
for example , there are approximately 700 pending cases against tax cheats in bochum alone .
in all cases , people stashed money and interest earnings in lichtenstein in order to conceal it from the local tax authorities .
another reason is that jails would have to be expanded if all tax cheats were given the maximum penalty allowed by law .
the state would rather get money for the misdeeds of the past and honesty in the future .
a first liechtenstein tax evasion case against a multi-millionaire from bad homburg resulted in a penalty of 7.5 million euros -lrb- $ 9.8 million -rrb- as well as a two year sentence .
klaus zumwinkel will not face as harsh a penalty since his tax fraud was less than 1 million euros .
as a young man , before heading up the post , he and his brother inherited 10 department stores and 50 discount stores .
they sold this small empire in 1971 and with the 12 million euros in proceedings , zumwinkel started the private “ devotion family foundation ” in liechtenstein , which he used to conceal interest income from tax authorities .
yet the current court case only covers earnings from the last four years .
it appears that during the time in question , the prosecutor 's office in bochum was absorbed in internal office intrigues and power struggles which resulted in the office falling behind schedule in its day-to-day task of handling files .
for zumwinkel , this means that his tax evasion case will remain just under the 1 million euro mark .
the federal court of justice recently mandated an obligatory prison sentences for amounts over 1 million euros .
you could say that zumwinkel has fortune in injustice .
in the past , many other tax evaders have profited from the government 's practice of handing out high fines and suspended sentences .
the government is more interested in money than in filling its jails .
the moral of the story : earthly justice is relative .
a multi-millionaire like klaus zumwinkel can get over a million-euro fine .
but much more difficult for him was being forced out of deutsche post and his loss of many board of director positions and honorary posts .
he has also faced social ostracism and an empty appointment calendar .
in the meantime , part of the tour program for visitors to cologne includes a stop outside zumwinkel 's villa where he was arrested about one year ago in front of television cameras .
not surprisingly , the erstwhile top manager has retreated with increasing frequency to his castle in south tyrol .

people in the former east of the country are especially worse off , says the study , which compared personal assets in 2002 and 2007 . the richest 10 percent of germans in 2007 owned around 61 percent of the country 's privately held assets , up from 58 percent five years earlier , a report from berlin economic institute diw showed .
the poorest 70 percent owned just under nine percent of the country 's wealth and 27 percent either own nothing or are in debt , according to the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty among the elderly could become a problem germans ' total assets were valued at 6.6 trillion euros -lrb- $ 8.5 trillion -rrb- , which amounts to an average 88,000 euros for each adult .
that is a 10 percent increase over 2002 , according to the poll commissioned by the hans boeckler foundation , which is close to trade unions .
total assets increased but the median level , the midway point between the highest and the lowest , stayed stuck at 15,000 euros - indicating that the rich got richer .
the wealth gap between what was once east and west germany also widened , the study showed .
in the west , assets rose almost 11 percent between 2002 and 2007 , but in the east they fell by just under 10 percent .
adjusted for inflation the fall was 17 percent .

" in order to help in answering the humanitarian need in the gaza strip , we are willing to cooperate in this as far as it is needed , " livni told reporters on wednesday .
she maintained that " the right of israel to defend itself includes not only defending itself against the firing of missiles , but also in terms of smuggling of weapons . "
humanitarian aid in focus wednesday evening 's talks were called by the eu in a bid to secure the immediate access of humanitarian aid into gaza and to start discussions on reviving the stalled middle east peace process .
foreign minister karel schwarzenberg of the czech republic , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , measured the meeting 's success by livni 's assurances that " everything will be done from the israeli side to have an effective humanitarian aid into the gaza strip . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni insists israel 's must defend itself against smuggled weapons livni focused on the need to stop the alleged armament of hamas by iran via egyptian territory .

monitors still await entry no deal was believed to have been reached on how many crossings should be reopened , for how long or how they should be monitored .
the eu maintained a small monitoring team at the rafah crossing from 2005-07 , when the monitors had to be withdrawn after hamas violently seized control of the coastal enclave .
some 40 eu monitors are now on standby in nearby ashkelon , israel , waiting to be redeployed to the gaza border .
while eu foreign policy chief javier solana said that his office would spare no effort to bring aid to gaza civilians , none of the participants at wednesday 's meeting announced the monitors ' imminent return to rafah .
' international values ' livni said that the ceasefire was still being " tested " and again rejected direct talks with hamas .
she dismissed calls for international prosecutors to try israeli military officers for war crimes .
" the israeli army works according to international values , " said livni , insisting that a distinction had to be made between those who are " killed by mistake " and terrorists who " aim and fire at civilians . "
the meeting in brussels took place amid tight security , with police in riot gear keeping about 100 pro-palestinian protesters well away from the building where the talks were held .
eu seeks common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon visited gaza - and wants action livni arrived about an hour after the rest of the attendees to give her eu counterparts time to forge a common position .
prior to the meeting , differences had emerged among eu members about the need to hold direct talks with hamas .
" there is no possibility of reaching a permanent peace without everyone getting around the same table , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb .
" no comprehensive solution can be taken without hamas . "
schwarzenberg had told the european parliament as recently as tuesday that no formal contacts should be held with hamas until the organization renounced terrorism .
the talks in brussels came a day after un secretary general ban ki-moon became the highest-ranking foreign official to visit gaza and assess first hand the damage caused by the three-week conflict with israel .
further talks planned back at united nations headquarters wednesday in new york , ban told the security council that a thorough investigation should be made of israeli attacks that struck several un facilities in gaza during the conflict .
the responsible parties must be held accountable , he said .
brussels diplomats said they were in close contact with new us president barack obama , who earlier wednesday - his first full day in office - called four key middle east leaders to promise his immediate engagement in the israeli-palestinian peace process .

21 , to hold talks with eu foreign ministers .
" in order to help in answering the humanitarian need in the gaza strip , we are willing to cooperate in this as far as it is needed , " livni told reporters on wednesday .
she maintained that " the right of israel to defend itself includes not only defending itself against the firing of missiles , but also in terms of smuggling of weapons . "
humanitarian aid in focus wednesday evening 's talks were called by the eu in a bid to secure the immediate access of humanitarian aid into gaza and to start discussions on reviving the stalled middle east peace process .
foreign minister karel schwarzenberg of the czech republic , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , measured the meeting 's success by livni 's assurances that " everything will be done from the israeli side to have an effective humanitarian aid into the gaza strip . "

monitors still await entry no deal was believed to have been reached on how many crossings should be reopened , for how long or how they should be monitored .

some 40 eu monitors are now on standby in nearby ashkelon , israel , waiting to be redeployed to the gaza border .
while eu foreign policy chief javier solana said that his office would spare no effort to bring aid to gaza civilians , none of the participants at wednesday 's meeting announced the monitors ' imminent return to rafah .
' international values ' livni said that the ceasefire was still being " tested " and again rejected direct talks with hamas .
she dismissed calls for international prosecutors to try israeli military officers for war crimes .
" the israeli army works according to international values , " said livni , insisting that a distinction had to be made between those who are " killed by mistake " and terrorists who " aim and fire at civilians . "
the meeting in brussels took place amid tight security , with police in riot gear keeping about 100 pro-palestinian protesters well away from the building where the talks were held .
eu seeks common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon visited gaza - and wants action livni arrived about an hour after the rest of the attendees to give her eu counterparts time to forge a common position .

" there is no possibility of reaching a permanent peace without everyone getting around the same table , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb .
" no comprehensive solution can be taken without hamas . "
schwarzenberg had told the european parliament as recently as tuesday that no formal contacts should be held with hamas until the organization renounced terrorism .
the talks in brussels came a day after un secretary general ban ki-moon became the highest-ranking foreign official to visit gaza and assess first hand the damage caused by the three-week conflict with israel .
further talks planned back at united nations headquarters wednesday in new york , ban told the security council that a thorough investigation should be made of israeli attacks that struck several un facilities in gaza during the conflict .
the responsible parties must be held accountable , he said .
brussels diplomats said they were in close contact with new us president barack obama , who earlier wednesday - his first full day in office - called four key middle east leaders to promise his immediate engagement in the israeli-palestinian peace process .

but he added that there is still a lot of work to be done in order to spread their use .
important political support is needed .
germany 's undersecretary of state for development , erich stather , said poor countries in particular are in need of a " sea change " when it comes to energy resources .
more than two billion people around the world have no access to modern energy sources , and improved use of renewable energy can help those countries develop , he said over 60 percent of the conference participants will come from developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more global warming is in nobody 's interest decision on a headquarters the founding members of irena will decide in june 2009 where the agency will be located .
germany is pushing for it to be based in bonn - also the home of the secretariat of the un framework convention on climate change , the body tasked with crafting a new global climate deal in copenhagen in december .
representatives from the united states , china and japan would attend the conference , but are not expected to sign the founding document immediately , gabriel said .
the eu is aiming for use renewable sources for 20 percent of its energy needs by 2020 .
in germany , 15 percent of electricity consumption comes from renewable sources of energy and the government aims to double this by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 , that he evaded 966,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in taxes related to inherited funds he had hidden in the alpine principality of liechtenstein .
german tax authorities had accused zumwinkel , 65 , of concealing the money in trust funds managed by the ltg bank in liechtenstein .
he was detained in february 2008 after prosecutors obtained evidence from germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service on trusts administered by the bank on behalf of wealthy tax-evading europeans .
released on bail after a search of his villa , zumwinkel resigned shortly afterwards as head of deutsche post , one of the world 's leading logistics companies with a global workforce of more 350,000 .
later , he stepped down from positions on the boards of other leading german companies such as deutsche telekom , lufthansa and retailer arcandor .
prosectors say zumwinkel set up a trust for himself in liechtenstein in 1986 but failed to disclose earnings and dividends from it to german tax authorities , as required by law .
if convicted he could face jail and a hefty fine .
unconfirmed reports ahead of the trial said zumwinkel would enter a plea of guilty in return for a reduced sentence .
the verdict is expected on monday .
zumwinkel was one of hundreds of wealthy germans exposed when a liechtenstein bank employee betrayed them by selling a stolen dvd with details of their accounts to the bnd for about 5 million euros .

the accused were found to have adulterated baby milk formula with the toxic industrial chemical melamine in order to make the milk appear to contain more protein .
but it is unlikely that the trial in the sanlu company case is going to end the discussion about china ’ s worst food scandal in recent times . a court in shijiazhuang in china ’ s hebei province , where the sanlu group is based , has sentenced two men to death and several other of the accused to prison terms ranging up to a life sentence .
sanlu was the dairy company which had sold the largest amount of tainted milk and had continued to do so after the first children had developed kidney ailments and even died .
tian wenhua , the former general manager of sanlu , was given a life sentence together with a fine of two and a half million euros .
li fangping is one of the lawyers representing the victims ’ parents .
he is not fully satisfied with the verdict : " in the case of the sanlu company , production had been going on for many years .
from this it is obvious that the state authorities which control food safety didn ’ t fulfil their responsibilities .
in this sense i find something is missing in the court ruling .
if only these men are held accountable , it ’ s not really being fair to them , especially if they get such harsh sentences ! "
only scapegoats ?
the two men sentenced to death are zhang yujun , who produced and distributed the highest amount of fake protein powder laced with melamine in the country , over 600 tonnes , and geng jinping , one of the middlemen who played an important role in mixing this powder with watered-down milk from farmers and selling this deadly cocktail to dairy companies such as sanlu .
but many chinese wonder if these local criminals are not merely scapegoats in a case which has much larger dimensions .
" i personally think it won ’ t solve the problems of the public health system , " says lawyer li fangping .
" we wonder if those responsible for controlling food safety should not also be held accountable , including the local government . "
call for structural reforms li fangping believes that without thorough reforms in different fields , similar food scandals can happen again in china : " one area is improving the system by which officials are held accountable .
the second is that we should strengthen the role of ngos including consumer associations .
and the third would be to establish a system of punishment and compensation . "
dozens of further accused are still awaiting trial .
in any case , the legal battle about the melamine scandal is far from over , as several affected parents have appealed against compensation arrangements which they regard as insufficient .
some parents had travelled to shijiazhuang for the trial , but the session where the verdicts were announced was off limits to the public . dw staff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic april asia quiz quiz of the month listen to asia compact the latest from asia , monday to friday asia compact 12.04.11 bric is becoming brics resentment against the us in pakistan india 's textile hub facing crisis podcast for itunes users click here if you 're an itunes user podcast via rss-feed copy this link into your favorite podcast program listen to asia live live , mobile , online global media forum human rights in a globalized world - challenges for the media newsletter and rss-feed if you had a subscription to our old rss feed , please re-subscribe here !

the accused were found to have adulterated baby milk formula with the toxic industrial chemical melamine in order to make the milk appear to contain more protein .
but it is unlikely that the trial in the sanlu company case is going to end the discussion about china ’ s worst food scandal in recent times . a court in shijiazhuang in china ’ s hebei province , where the sanlu group is based , has sentenced two men to death and several other of the accused to prison terms ranging up to a life sentence .
sanlu was the dairy company which had sold the largest amount of tainted milk and had continued to do so after the first children had developed kidney ailments and even died .
tian wenhua , the former general manager of sanlu , was given a life sentence together with a fine of two and a half million euros .
li fangping is one of the lawyers representing the victims ’ parents .
he is not fully satisfied with the verdict : " in the case of the sanlu company , production had been going on for many years .
from this it is obvious that the state authorities which control food safety didn ’ t fulfil their responsibilities .
in this sense i find something is missing in the court ruling .
if only these men are held accountable , it ’ s not really being fair to them , especially if they get such harsh sentences ! "
only scapegoats ?
the two men sentenced to death are zhang yujun , who produced and distributed the highest amount of fake protein powder laced with melamine in the country , over 600 tonnes , and geng jinping , one of the middlemen who played an important role in mixing this powder with watered-down milk from farmers and selling this deadly cocktail to dairy companies such as sanlu .

21 , to hold talks with eu foreign ministers .
" in order to help in answering the humanitarian need in the gaza strip , we are willing to cooperate in this as far as it is needed , " livni told reporters on wednesday .
she maintained that " the right of israel to defend itself includes not only defending itself against the firing of missiles , but also in terms of smuggling of weapons . "
humanitarian aid in focus wednesday evening 's talks were called by the eu in a bid to secure the immediate access of humanitarian aid into gaza and to start discussions on reviving the stalled middle east peace process .
foreign minister karel schwarzenberg of the czech republic , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , measured the meeting 's success by livni 's assurances that " everything will be done from the israeli side to have an effective humanitarian aid into the gaza strip . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni insists israel 's must defend itself against smuggled weapons livni focused on the need to stop the alleged armament of hamas by iran via egyptian territory .
" from our perspective , we achieved ... an understanding about the need to give an answer to the smuggling of weapons to the gaza strip , " she said .
monitors still await entry no deal was believed to have been reached on how many crossings should be reopened , for how long or how they should be monitored .
the eu maintained a small monitoring team at the rafah crossing from 2005-07 , when the monitors had to be withdrawn after hamas violently seized control of the coastal enclave .
some 40 eu monitors are now on standby in nearby ashkelon , israel , waiting to be redeployed to the gaza border .
while eu foreign policy chief javier solana said that his office would spare no effort to bring aid to gaza civilians , none of the participants at wednesday 's meeting announced the monitors ' imminent return to rafah .
' international values ' livni said that the ceasefire was still being " tested " and again rejected direct talks with hamas .
she dismissed calls for international prosecutors to try israeli military officers for war crimes .
" the israeli army works according to international values , " said livni , insisting that a distinction had to be made between those who are " killed by mistake " and terrorists who " aim and fire at civilians . "
the meeting in brussels took place amid tight security , with police in riot gear keeping about 100 pro-palestinian protesters well away from the building where the talks were held .
eu seeks common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon visited gaza - and wants action livni arrived about an hour after the rest of the attendees to give her eu counterparts time to forge a common position .
prior to the meeting , differences had emerged among eu members about the need to hold direct talks with hamas .
" there is no possibility of reaching a permanent peace without everyone getting around the same table , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb .
" no comprehensive solution can be taken without hamas . "
schwarzenberg had told the european parliament as recently as tuesday that no formal contacts should be held with hamas until the organization renounced terrorism .
the talks in brussels came a day after un secretary general ban ki-moon became the highest-ranking foreign official to visit gaza and assess first hand the damage caused by the three-week conflict with israel .
further talks planned back at united nations headquarters wednesday in new york , ban told the security council that a thorough investigation should be made of israeli attacks that struck several un facilities in gaza during the conflict .
the responsible parties must be held accountable , he said .
brussels diplomats said they were in close contact with new us president barack obama , who earlier wednesday - his first full day in office - called four key middle east leaders to promise his immediate engagement in the israeli-palestinian peace process .
eu foreign ministers were to hold a separate talks sunday in brussels with representatives from egypt , jordan , turkey and the palestinian authority . dpa news agency -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in may 2008 , citizens supported eu integration in greater numbers but , back then , expectations were higher as major investments had come to our country , " said milica delevic , director of serbia 's european integration office .
after the arrest of war-time bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic last july , serbia was expecting a positive assessment from brussels and ratification of the pre-accession stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with the eu .

car-wrecking hotline is swamped meanwhile , german car owners swamped a hotline with calls this week after the government invited applications for a big cash handout to anyone crushing an old car and buying a new one . berlin officials said the hotline registered 270,000 calls on the first day , monday , far more than telephonists at the trade agency bafa could answer .
on tuesday , the rush ebbed a little to 150,000 . the government has promised 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,250 -rrb- to anyone owning a car more than nine years old who takes it to the wreckers and buys a new low-pollution car . the payouts will continue until the budgeted 1.5 billion euros has been used up .
part of the sum will be for administrative costs , but the scheme is expected to bring nearly 600,000 new cars on the roads . # b # although the aim is to help germany 's troubled car manufacturing industry , imported cars will be treated the same as german-made ones . the " free " handout has been the talk of germany for days .
a free-for-all is expected next tuesday when the application form is to be offered on the bafa website to download .
some predict the budget may be used up within a week . even owners of late-model cars have wondered if they might benefit .
to curb abuse , the applicant must have owned the old car for at least one year and become the registered owner of the new car . bafa said thursday it was confident there would be enough money for all applicants , at least for the first few days . the old cars must be destroyed by wreckers , who remove all useful parts , glass and plastic and put the steel remains in a metal press . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 , that he evaded 966,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in taxes related to inherited funds he had hidden in the alpine principality of liechtenstein .
german tax authorities had accused zumwinkel , 65 , of concealing the money in trust funds managed by the ltg bank in liechtenstein .
he was detained in february 2008 after prosecutors obtained evidence from germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service on trusts administered by the bank on behalf of wealthy tax-evading europeans .
released on bail after a search of his villa , zumwinkel resigned shortly afterwards as head of deutsche post , one of the world 's leading logistics companies with a global workforce of more 350,000 .
later , he stepped down from positions on the boards of other leading german companies such as deutsche telekom , lufthansa and retailer arcandor .
prosectors say zumwinkel set up a trust for himself in liechtenstein in 1986 but failed to disclose earnings and dividends from it to german tax authorities , as required by law .
if convicted he could face jail and a hefty fine .
unconfirmed reports ahead of the trial said zumwinkel would enter a plea of guilty in return for a reduced sentence .
the verdict is expected on monday .
zumwinkel was one of hundreds of wealthy germans exposed when a liechtenstein bank employee betrayed them by selling a stolen dvd with details of their accounts to the bnd for about 5 million euros .
since then , german prosecutors have recovered more than 150 million euros in arrears from repentant taxpayers hoping to ward off trials . dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 , that he evaded 966,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in taxes related to inherited funds he had hidden in the alpine principality of liechtenstein .
german tax authorities had accused zumwinkel , 65 , of concealing the money in trust funds managed by the ltg bank in liechtenstein .
he was detained in february 2008 after prosecutors obtained evidence from germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service on trusts administered by the bank on behalf of wealthy tax-evading europeans .
released on bail after a search of his villa , zumwinkel resigned shortly afterwards as head of deutsche post , one of the world 's leading logistics companies with a global workforce of more 350,000 .
later , he stepped down from positions on the boards of other leading german companies such as deutsche telekom , lufthansa and retailer arcandor .
prosectors say zumwinkel set up a trust for himself in liechtenstein in 1986 but failed to disclose earnings and dividends from it to german tax authorities , as required by law .
if convicted he could face jail and a hefty fine .
unconfirmed reports ahead of the trial said zumwinkel would enter a plea of guilty in return for a reduced sentence .
the verdict is expected on monday .
zumwinkel was one of hundreds of wealthy germans exposed when a liechtenstein bank employee betrayed them by selling a stolen dvd with details of their accounts to the bnd for about 5 million euros .
since then , german prosecutors have recovered more than 150 million euros in arrears from repentant taxpayers hoping to ward off trials . dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

people in the former east of the country are especially worse off , says the study , which compared personal assets in 2002 and 2007 . the richest 10 percent of germans in 2007 owned around 61 percent of the country 's privately held assets , up from 58 percent five years earlier , a report from berlin economic institute diw showed .
the poorest 70 percent owned just under nine percent of the country 's wealth and 27 percent either own nothing or are in debt , according to the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty among the elderly could become a problem germans ' total assets were valued at 6.6 trillion euros -lrb- $ 8.5 trillion -rrb- , which amounts to an average 88,000 euros for each adult .
that is a 10 percent increase over 2002 , according to the poll commissioned by the hans boeckler foundation , which is close to trade unions .
total assets increased but the median level , the midway point between the highest and the lowest , stayed stuck at 15,000 euros - indicating that the rich got richer .
the wealth gap between what was once east and west germany also widened , the study showed .
in the west , assets rose almost 11 percent between 2002 and 2007 , but in the east they fell by just under 10 percent .
adjusted for inflation the fall was 17 percent .
" if politicians fail to act , poverty among the elderly in eastern germany will grow sharply in the future , " the report 's authors joachim frick and markus grabka said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 22.01.2009 opinion : tax evasion trial no mere slap on the wrist großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the much-anticipated tax evasion trial is underway of a former top manager who hid money in lichtenstein .
deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky says that the million-euro fine is only the beginning . the case is fairly cut and dry , meaning the trial will likely be short .
as former head of postal giant deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel was germany 's best-known top manager , a man with an irreproachable reputation .
soon after zumwinkel 's spectacular arrest outside his villa in a posh suburb of cologne , he made a complete confession and quickly transferred the money he owed to the tax office in cologne .
the court in bochum has set aside two days for the case , but the trial could come to end even more quickly .
zumwinkel 's defense lawyer and the prosecutor 's office in bochum have reached an agreement for the court to adopt .
not only that , but a legal overhaul for prosecuting tax fraud cases similar to zumwinkel 's , which involves undeclared interest income from private foundations in lichtenstein , has already been agreed to .
the result : if the defendant offers up a guilty plea and shows remorse , he or she can expect a hefty fine and up to a two year suspended sentence .
this setup keeps offenders from facing time behind bars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky while it bothers many citizens ' delicate sense of justice , such outcomes are almost always the norm when it comes to economic crimes .
one reason is that the justice system is hopelessly overloaded .
for example , there are approximately 700 pending cases against tax cheats in bochum alone .
in all cases , people stashed money and interest earnings in lichtenstein in order to conceal it from the local tax authorities .
another reason is that jails would have to be expanded if all tax cheats were given the maximum penalty allowed by law .
the state would rather get money for the misdeeds of the past and honesty in the future .
a first liechtenstein tax evasion case against a multi-millionaire from bad homburg resulted in a penalty of 7.5 million euros -lrb- $ 9.8 million -rrb- as well as a two year sentence .
klaus zumwinkel will not face as harsh a penalty since his tax fraud was less than 1 million euros .
as a young man , before heading up the post , he and his brother inherited 10 department stores and 50 discount stores .
they sold this small empire in 1971 and with the 12 million euros in proceedings , zumwinkel started the private “ devotion family foundation ” in liechtenstein , which he used to conceal interest income from tax authorities .
yet the current court case only covers earnings from the last four years .
it appears that during the time in question , the prosecutor 's office in bochum was absorbed in internal office intrigues and power struggles which resulted in the office falling behind schedule in its day-to-day task of handling files .
for zumwinkel , this means that his tax evasion case will remain just under the 1 million euro mark .
the federal court of justice recently mandated an obligatory prison sentences for amounts over 1 million euros .
you could say that zumwinkel has fortune in injustice .
in the past , many other tax evaders have profited from the government 's practice of handing out high fines and suspended sentences .
the government is more interested in money than in filling its jails .
the moral of the story : earthly justice is relative .
a multi-millionaire like klaus zumwinkel can get over a million-euro fine .
but much more difficult for him was being forced out of deutsche post and his loss of many board of director positions and honorary posts .
he has also faced social ostracism and an empty appointment calendar .
in the meantime , part of the tour program for visitors to cologne includes a stop outside zumwinkel 's villa where he was arrested about one year ago in front of television cameras .
not surprisingly , the erstwhile top manager has retreated with increasing frequency to his castle in south tyrol .

people in the former east of the country are especially worse off , says the study , which compared personal assets in 2002 and 2007 . the richest 10 percent of germans in 2007 owned around 61 percent of the country 's privately held assets , up from 58 percent five years earlier , a report from berlin economic institute diw showed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 22.01.2009 opinion : tax evasion trial no mere slap on the wrist großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the much-anticipated tax evasion trial is underway of a former top manager who hid money in lichtenstein .
deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky says that the million-euro fine is only the beginning . the case is fairly cut and dry , meaning the trial will likely be short .
as former head of postal giant deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel was germany 's best-known top manager , a man with an irreproachable reputation .
soon after zumwinkel 's spectacular arrest outside his villa in a posh suburb of cologne , he made a complete confession and quickly transferred the money he owed to the tax office in cologne .
the court in bochum has set aside two days for the case , but the trial could come to end even more quickly .
zumwinkel 's defense lawyer and the prosecutor 's office in bochum have reached an agreement for the court to adopt .
not only that , but a legal overhaul for prosecuting tax fraud cases similar to zumwinkel 's , which involves undeclared interest income from private foundations in lichtenstein , has already been agreed to .
the result : if the defendant offers up a guilty plea and shows remorse , he or she can expect a hefty fine and up to a two year suspended sentence .
this setup keeps offenders from facing time behind bars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky while it bothers many citizens ' delicate sense of justice , such outcomes are almost always the norm when it comes to economic crimes .
one reason is that the justice system is hopelessly overloaded .
for example , there are approximately 700 pending cases against tax cheats in bochum alone .
in all cases , people stashed money and interest earnings in lichtenstein in order to conceal it from the local tax authorities .
another reason is that jails would have to be expanded if all tax cheats were given the maximum penalty allowed by law .
the state would rather get money for the misdeeds of the past and honesty in the future .
a first liechtenstein tax evasion case against a multi-millionaire from bad homburg resulted in a penalty of 7.5 million euros -lrb- $ 9.8 million -rrb- as well as a two year sentence .
klaus zumwinkel will not face as harsh a penalty since his tax fraud was less than 1 million euros .
as a young man , before heading up the post , he and his brother inherited 10 department stores and 50 discount stores .
they sold this small empire in 1971 and with the 12 million euros in proceedings , zumwinkel started the private “ devotion family foundation ” in liechtenstein , which he used to conceal interest income from tax authorities .
yet the current court case only covers earnings from the last four years .
it appears that during the time in question , the prosecutor 's office in bochum was absorbed in internal office intrigues and power struggles which resulted in the office falling behind schedule in its day-to-day task of handling files .
for zumwinkel , this means that his tax evasion case will remain just under the 1 million euro mark .
the federal court of justice recently mandated an obligatory prison sentences for amounts over 1 million euros .
you could say that zumwinkel has fortune in injustice .
in the past , many other tax evaders have profited from the government 's practice of handing out high fines and suspended sentences .
the government is more interested in money than in filling its jails .
the moral of the story : earthly justice is relative .
a multi-millionaire like klaus zumwinkel can get over a million-euro fine .
but much more difficult for him was being forced out of deutsche post and his loss of many board of director positions and honorary posts .
he has also faced social ostracism and an empty appointment calendar .
in the meantime , part of the tour program for visitors to cologne includes a stop outside zumwinkel 's villa where he was arrested about one year ago in front of television cameras .
not surprisingly , the erstwhile top manager has retreated with increasing frequency to his castle in south tyrol .

former senator and northern ireland peace mediator george mitchell was appointed to bring peace between the palestinians and israelis in the middle east .
ambassador richard holbrooke , the architect of the dayton accords which ended the bosnian war , was charged with implementing us policy towards afghanistan and pakistan . barack obama told a press conference he would send mitchell to the region " as soon as possible " to ensure a " durable " and " sustainable " ceasefire in gaza .

" let us work together to find solutions for the great challenges of our time starting from the solid german-american relationship that has closely and amicably connected us , " steinmeier wrote . he said important points for cooperation will be conflict in the middle east , climate change , iran ’ s nuclear programme and the financial crisis .

clinton was president barack obama 's democratic rival .
after his win in november of 2008 , clinton became obama 's surprise choice to oversee the 20,000-strong us state department .
" i believe with all my heart that this is a new era for america , " clinton told a crowd of state department employees who had gathered to welcome the former democratic senator from new york to her first day as america 's top diplomat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , seen here with israeli president shimon peres , is pushing for a lasting solution to the mideast conflict in his letter , steinmeier reminded clinton of the long friendship between germany and the united states and said he expected the relationship to be further strengthened under obama .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 22.01.2009 opinion : tax evasion trial no mere slap on the wrist großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the much-anticipated tax evasion trial is underway of a former top manager who hid money in lichtenstein .
deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky says that the million-euro fine is only the beginning . the case is fairly cut and dry , meaning the trial will likely be short .
as former head of postal giant deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel was germany 's best-known top manager , a man with an irreproachable reputation .
soon after zumwinkel 's spectacular arrest outside his villa in a posh suburb of cologne , he made a complete confession and quickly transferred the money he owed to the tax office in cologne .
the court in bochum has set aside two days for the case , but the trial could come to end even more quickly .
zumwinkel 's defense lawyer and the prosecutor 's office in bochum have reached an agreement for the court to adopt .
not only that , but a legal overhaul for prosecuting tax fraud cases similar to zumwinkel 's , which involves undeclared interest income from private foundations in lichtenstein , has already been agreed to .
the result : if the defendant offers up a guilty plea and shows remorse , he or she can expect a hefty fine and up to a two year suspended sentence .
this setup keeps offenders from facing time behind bars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky while it bothers many citizens ' delicate sense of justice , such outcomes are almost always the norm when it comes to economic crimes .
one reason is that the justice system is hopelessly overloaded .
for example , there are approximately 700 pending cases against tax cheats in bochum alone .
in all cases , people stashed money and interest earnings in lichtenstein in order to conceal it from the local tax authorities .
another reason is that jails would have to be expanded if all tax cheats were given the maximum penalty allowed by law .
the state would rather get money for the misdeeds of the past and honesty in the future .
a first liechtenstein tax evasion case against a multi-millionaire from bad homburg resulted in a penalty of 7.5 million euros -lrb- $ 9.8 million -rrb- as well as a two year sentence .
klaus zumwinkel will not face as harsh a penalty since his tax fraud was less than 1 million euros .
as a young man , before heading up the post , he and his brother inherited 10 department stores and 50 discount stores .
they sold this small empire in 1971 and with the 12 million euros in proceedings , zumwinkel started the private “ devotion family foundation ” in liechtenstein , which he used to conceal interest income from tax authorities .
yet the current court case only covers earnings from the last four years .
it appears that during the time in question , the prosecutor 's office in bochum was absorbed in internal office intrigues and power struggles which resulted in the office falling behind schedule in its day-to-day task of handling files .
for zumwinkel , this means that his tax evasion case will remain just under the 1 million euro mark .
the federal court of justice recently mandated an obligatory prison sentences for amounts over 1 million euros .
you could say that zumwinkel has fortune in injustice .
in the past , many other tax evaders have profited from the government 's practice of handing out high fines and suspended sentences .
the government is more interested in money than in filling its jails .
the moral of the story : earthly justice is relative .
a multi-millionaire like klaus zumwinkel can get over a million-euro fine .
but much more difficult for him was being forced out of deutsche post and his loss of many board of director positions and honorary posts .
he has also faced social ostracism and an empty appointment calendar .
in the meantime , part of the tour program for visitors to cologne includes a stop outside zumwinkel 's villa where he was arrested about one year ago in front of television cameras .
not surprisingly , the erstwhile top manager has retreated with increasing frequency to his castle in south tyrol .

the accused were found to have adulterated baby milk formula with the toxic industrial chemical melamine in order to make the milk appear to contain more protein .
but it is unlikely that the trial in the sanlu company case is going to end the discussion about china ’ s worst food scandal in recent times . a court in shijiazhuang in china ’ s hebei province , where the sanlu group is based , has sentenced two men to death and several other of the accused to prison terms ranging up to a life sentence .
sanlu was the dairy company which had sold the largest amount of tainted milk and had continued to do so after the first children had developed kidney ailments and even died .
tian wenhua , the former general manager of sanlu , was given a life sentence together with a fine of two and a half million euros .
li fangping is one of the lawyers representing the victims ’ parents .
he is not fully satisfied with the verdict : " in the case of the sanlu company , production had been going on for many years .
from this it is obvious that the state authorities which control food safety didn ’ t fulfil their responsibilities .
in this sense i find something is missing in the court ruling .
if only these men are held accountable , it ’ s not really being fair to them , especially if they get such harsh sentences ! "
only scapegoats ?
the two men sentenced to death are zhang yujun , who produced and distributed the highest amount of fake protein powder laced with melamine in the country , over 600 tonnes , and geng jinping , one of the middlemen who played an important role in mixing this powder with watered-down milk from farmers and selling this deadly cocktail to dairy companies such as sanlu .
but many chinese wonder if these local criminals are not merely scapegoats in a case which has much larger dimensions .
" i personally think it won ’ t solve the problems of the public health system , " says lawyer li fangping .
" we wonder if those responsible for controlling food safety should not also be held accountable , including the local government . "
call for structural reforms li fangping believes that without thorough reforms in different fields , similar food scandals can happen again in china : " one area is improving the system by which officials are held accountable .
the second is that we should strengthen the role of ngos including consumer associations .
and the third would be to establish a system of punishment and compensation . "
dozens of further accused are still awaiting trial .
in any case , the legal battle about the melamine scandal is far from over , as several affected parents have appealed against compensation arrangements which they regard as insufficient .

the accused were found to have adulterated baby milk formula with the toxic industrial chemical melamine in order to make the milk appear to contain more protein .
but it is unlikely that the trial in the sanlu company case is going to end the discussion about china ’ s worst food scandal in recent times . a court in shijiazhuang in china ’ s hebei province , where the sanlu group is based , has sentenced two men to death and several other of the accused to prison terms ranging up to a life sentence .
sanlu was the dairy company which had sold the largest amount of tainted milk and had continued to do so after the first children had developed kidney ailments and even died .
tian wenhua , the former general manager of sanlu , was given a life sentence together with a fine of two and a half million euros .
li fangping is one of the lawyers representing the victims ’ parents .
he is not fully satisfied with the verdict : " in the case of the sanlu company , production had been going on for many years .
from this it is obvious that the state authorities which control food safety didn ’ t fulfil their responsibilities .
in this sense i find something is missing in the court ruling .
if only these men are held accountable , it ’ s not really being fair to them , especially if they get such harsh sentences ! "
only scapegoats ?
the two men sentenced to death are zhang yujun , who produced and distributed the highest amount of fake protein powder laced with melamine in the country , over 600 tonnes , and geng jinping , one of the middlemen who played an important role in mixing this powder with watered-down milk from farmers and selling this deadly cocktail to dairy companies such as sanlu .
but many chinese wonder if these local criminals are not merely scapegoats in a case which has much larger dimensions .
" i personally think it won ’ t solve the problems of the public health system , " says lawyer li fangping .
" we wonder if those responsible for controlling food safety should not also be held accountable , including the local government . "
call for structural reforms li fangping believes that without thorough reforms in different fields , similar food scandals can happen again in china : " one area is improving the system by which officials are held accountable .
the second is that we should strengthen the role of ngos including consumer associations .
and the third would be to establish a system of punishment and compensation . "
dozens of further accused are still awaiting trial .
in any case , the legal battle about the melamine scandal is far from over , as several affected parents have appealed against compensation arrangements which they regard as insufficient .

people in the former east of the country are especially worse off , says the study , which compared personal assets in 2002 and 2007 . the richest 10 percent of germans in 2007 owned around 61 percent of the country 's privately held assets , up from 58 percent five years earlier , a report from berlin economic institute diw showed .
the poorest 70 percent owned just under nine percent of the country 's wealth and 27 percent either own nothing or are in debt , according to the study .

total assets increased but the median level , the midway point between the highest and the lowest , stayed stuck at 15,000 euros - indicating that the rich got richer .
the wealth gap between what was once east and west germany also widened , the study showed .
in the west , assets rose almost 11 percent between 2002 and 2007 , but in the east they fell by just under 10 percent .
adjusted for inflation the fall was 17 percent .

in a new document , david miliband says the uk will be " candid " when it disagrees with china , but will build a relationship based on co-operation .
the paper , published on thursday , will stress the importance of economic ties between the two countries .
chinese premier wen jiabao is due to visit european capitals soon .
the 20-page framework document launched by mr miliband stresses the importance of economic ties between the two countries and emphasises china 's growing role in international affairs .
it represents a sort of stock-taking of ties between london and beijing .
and it sets out a lengthy series of aspirations for the direction and way in which sino-uk ties should develop over the next four years .
in a foreword the british prime minister , gordon brown , says that " britain , europe and the rest of the world can benefit from china 's rise " .
britain 's experience of " creating a society based on accountability , rule of law , and human rights " , he says , is relevant to china as it goes through massive social change . "
and he urges beijing " to make progress in these areas " .
sales pitch ?
but why a document like this and why now ?
clearly its publication just ahead of a visit to european capitals , including london , by the chinese premier wen jiabao is probably no accident .
it is hard to disguise the obvious economic sales pitch to beijing .
as gordon brown notes , over the next decade , china will present more opportunities for british businesses " than any other country " .
there is extensive mention of china 's growing role in the world , its potential contribution to easing global warming , and the importance - to use the american formulation - of making it a responsible stake-holder in international society .
the explicit criticisms of china 's human rights record are couched again in aspirational terms : the hope being that in four years china " abolishes or at least greatly reduces detention without trial " ; that it " substantially reduces the application of the death penalty " and so on .
the problem is that these formulations may be so bland as to offend human rights activists , while still being written off as an unwarranted intrusion into its domestic affairs by the authorities in beijing .

the orchestra , which performs gala concerts on thursday and friday , will also have a base for community work .
bbc wales controller menna richards said the purpose-built bbc hoddinott hall was an " acknowledgement " that music and arts played an important role in how wales defined itself as a nation .
if there is one small sadness , it is that the composer alun hoddinott ... will not be with us david murray , orchestra director " since the bbc national orchestra of wales was formed 80 years ago , it has brought not only the classics to wales but given a platform to its emerging composers , " she said .
" it is a great occasion , not only for the bbc national orchestra of wales , but for music in wales - an acknowledgement that music and the arts sit at the centre of what wales is about and how we define ourselves as a nation . "
mr hoddinott formed a partnership with the bbc national orchestra of wales which spanned seven decades .
he played a major role in the development of music in wales not just as a composer , but also as professor of music at cardiff university and as an organiser of festivals and concerts .

orchestra director david murray , said : " if there is one small sadness , it is that the composer alun hoddinott , who died last march and would have celebrated his 80th birthday in 2009 , will not be with us .
" i knew alun well during his last years , and his passion for excellence and belief in an international place for wales in the musical world is , i hope , also reflected in our own hopes and aspirations for the future . "
the orchestra , which tours around the world , will continue to perform major concerts at st david 's hall in cardiff and swansea 's brangwyn hall .
bbc hoddinott hall will be used to perform more " intimate " concerts , while the grace williams studio at the wales millennium centre will provide the base for the orchestra 's community work .
tim green of architects capital architecture said the exterior of the building was designed to be in keeping with the existing wales millennium centre while the interior had a theme all of its own .
" we went for a sort of chapel feel - the choral traditions of wales just seemed to ring true .
as you will see , in this space it is those sort of proportions , shoebox proportions , " he said .
" the timber treatment at low level is very reminiscent of victorian chapels and the masonry above .
the stonework you would normally get in a stone chapel has been replaced by concrete . "

however , the gap between supply and demand for organs is still growing and 1,000 people are expected to die this year while waiting for a transplant .
the nhs figures show people in scotland and the south-west of england are the most willing to become donors .
it is thought the debate on presumed consent may have boosted numbers .
regional donation rates scotland : 32 % north-east : 24 % north west : 25 % north west : 25 % yorkshire and humberside : 25 % east midlands : 25 % west midlands : 22 % east of england : 28 % south central : 27 % london : 22 % south west : 32 % wales : 27 % northern ireland : 27 % the idea of introducing presumed consent , under which people would be placed on the organ donor register automatically unless they " opted out " , was rejected last year by a panel of experts appointed by the government .
they said such a move was unlikely to increase donor numbers and posed a significant risk of eroding patient trust .
instead , a £ 4.5m public awareness campaign is to be launched in england aimed at boosting voluntary donor numbers .
more than one in four people in the uk are now on the donor register .
but , despite the rise in numbers , the uk still has one of the lowest organ donation rates in europe .
' challenging target ' since 2001 , nearly 24,000 transplants have been carried out using donor organs , but at least 4,500 people have died while waiting for a suitable organ to become available .
this year , about 1,000 people are expected to die waiting for an organ .
there is a particular shortage of organs for black and asian patients , who on average wait about three or four times longer for an organ than white patients , according to nhs blood and transplant -lrb- nhsbt -rrb- .
organ donor register rates are , at 32 % , highest in the health regions that cover scotland and south-west england , followed by the south-east coastal area of england at 30 % , according to figures collated by nhsbt .

melissa bell has been waiting for a kidney transplant for a year lynda hamlyn , the body 's chief executive , said : " reaching 16 million on the nhs organ donor register a year before planned is testament to the support that exists for donation in the uk .
" more than a quarter of the population have demonstrated their commitment by signing the register .
" but , with almost 8,000 people in the uk currently waiting for a life-saving organ transplant , we need to do more . "
nhsbt said it was looking at draft plans to try to increase the number of organ donors by a further nine million by 2013 .
a spokesman said this was " a challenging target that we can not achieve without a huge amount of public support " .

there is a particular shortage of organs for black and asian patients , who on average wait about three or four times longer for an organ than white patients , according to nhs blood and transplant -lrb- nhsbt -rrb- .
organ donor register rates are , at 32 % , highest in the health regions that cover scotland and south-west england , followed by the south-east coastal area of england at 30 % , according to figures collated by nhsbt .

melissa bell has been waiting for a kidney transplant for a year lynda hamlyn , the body 's chief executive , said : " reaching 16 million on the nhs organ donor register a year before planned is testament to the support that exists for donation in the uk .
" more than a quarter of the population have demonstrated their commitment by signing the register .
" but , with almost 8,000 people in the uk currently waiting for a life-saving organ transplant , we need to do more . "
nhsbt said it was looking at draft plans to try to increase the number of organ donors by a further nine million by 2013 .
a spokesman said this was " a challenging target that we can not achieve without a huge amount of public support " .

but car manufacturing is n't the only thing the company is good at .
last year it made six times as much on the stock market as it did making cars .
industry insiders are only half joking when they call it a hedge fund with a carmaker attached .
porsche says its stock market trades are only for one reason : to take it towards its long term goal , the takeover of car making giant , volkswagen .
in october 2008 , porsche 's takeover moves triggered an unprecedented stock market squeeze when it suddenly revealed it owned or had positions on more than 74 % of volkswagen shares .
the value of volkswagen stock rocketed to more than 1,000 euros , briefly making it the most valuable company in the world .
hedge funds , who had gambled that the value of volkswagen shares would fall are said to have lost between 10bn and 40bn euros .
porsche denies any wrongdoing and says that it made no profit from the squeeze , but some hedge funds are crying foul .
now the german financial regulator , bafin , is conducting an investigation into what it calls " suspected market abuse . "
the back story the stories of porsche and volkswagen have long been intertwined .
wiedeking took the decisions , the risky decisions , to come up with new models arndt ellinghorst , head of european automotive research at credit suisse ferdinand porsche designed the iconic volkswagen beetle in the 1930s , a car that became an emblem of germany 's economic success throughout the world .
he then founded his own company , which became famous for making superfast sports cars .
the porsche family still owns the company their grandfather founded and now wants to own volkswagen itself , a company 14 times the size of porsche .
volkswagen owns some of the biggest names in european motoring ; seat , audi , lamborghini , bugatti and bentley .
the personalities the recession of the early 1990s hit porsche hard and some questioned if the company would survive .
then , in 1993 , wendelin wiedeking was appointed chief executive .
together with chief financial officer holger haerter they are credited with turning the company around .
" wiedeking took the decisions , the risky decisions , to come up with new models , " says arndt ellinghorst , head of european automotive research at credit suisse .
they also slashed production costs , but most importantly , mr haerter used porsche 's cash to enter the financial markets .
he had little experience of car making , but he did bring expertise in investment management .
through currency hedging he developed a mastery of the markets that he eventually turned towards porsche 's end goal ; the take over of volkswagen .
" porsche does not have the research and development budget to come up with really the key innovations of the industry , " says mr ellinghorst .
a takeover of volkswagen would mean access to its huge production facilities , its technology and , most importantly , its cash .
vw law in 2005 , porsche quietly started to increase its stake in volkswagen .
porsche has been accused of speculating in volkswagen shares by september 2008 it had acquired 35.14 % of volkswagen shares .
whilst porsche stated publicly its long term goal was a takeover , insiders knew this goal was stymied by a peculiar anomaly : the vw law .
the vw law essentially protects volkswagen from hostile take over .
it means that an 80 % majority is needed to make " significant decisions " at annual meetings .
this gives the local state government of lower saxony , owning 20.1 % of the shares , a blocking majority .
porsche needs to overturn this law before it can reach its ambitious goal .
it is applying the pressure on both the eu and the german government to do this .
while the vw law is still in place there is consensus among market insiders that there is little point in porsche increasing its stake in volkswagen , but sometimes things are not quite what they seem .
short selling by july 2008 the credit crunch was hitting the car industry hard and car company share values were plummeting around the world .
but volkswagen 's were remaining stubbornly high .
porsche would gain from volkswagen 's expertise and finances hedge fund managers calculated that volkswagen shares could not remain so high indefinitely and believed there was an opportunity to make some cash by short selling the shares - borrowing volkswagen shares off a third party in the expectation that the price would fall so they would be able to buy them back cheaper , later and pocketing the difference .
volkswagen shares became some of the most " shorted " stocks in europe .
but despite the downturn , by the end of the summer it was clear there was something peculiar about volkswagen shares .
the price was not dropping and the reason was about to be revealed .
the bombshell on sunday 26 october 2008 , porsche dropped a bombshell .
it announced it had increased its stake in volkswagen to 42.6 % and held cash settled options on a further 31.5 % - meaning it had positions on up to 74.1 % of all volkswagen shares .
it seemed it had effectively cornered the market and short sellers who needed to buy back shares to close their positions were forced to fight over the remaining available stock .
how did it happen ?
porsche was able to build its secret holding by using financial instruments called cash settled call options .
call options essentially give the buyer the option to buy shares at a competitive price at a future fixed date .
a cash settled call option enables the buyer to either take delivery of the share , or the difference between the strike price agreed when the option was bought and the market price when deal is settled .
the buyer can then use this money to purchase the share on the open market .
porsche proved to be masters at this type of transaction , which , as long as it got the bets right and volkswagen prices continued to rise , let it buy volkswagen shares at favourable prices .
in the uk , any increase in share holdings to more than a 30 % stake in a company has to be disclosed , whether you do it through cash settled call options or not .
this is not the case in germany and this enabled porsche to build up its position in secret .
winners and losers investors who were caught short have questioned porsche 's behaviour and the timing of its announcement of its secret positions in volkswagen shares .
this is now being investigated by the german regulator , bafin .
porsche denies all wrongdoing and says its strategy was driven by its goal of taking over volkswagen , not the wish to make profits from financial speculation .
it says it has invested the profits it made from the squeeze into purchasing more volkswagen shares outright .

call options essentially give the buyer the option to buy shares at a competitive price at a future fixed date .
a cash settled call option enables the buyer to either take delivery of the share , or the difference between the strike price agreed when the option was bought and the market price when deal is settled .
the buyer can then use this money to purchase the share on the open market .
porsche proved to be masters at this type of transaction , which , as long as it got the bets right and volkswagen prices continued to rise , let it buy volkswagen shares at favourable prices .
in the uk , any increase in share holdings to more than a 30 % stake in a company has to be disclosed , whether you do it through cash settled call options or not .
this is not the case in germany and this enabled porsche to build up its position in secret .
winners and losers investors who were caught short have questioned porsche 's behaviour and the timing of its announcement of its secret positions in volkswagen shares .
this is now being investigated by the german regulator , bafin .
porsche denies all wrongdoing and says its strategy was driven by its goal of taking over volkswagen , not the wish to make profits from financial speculation .
it says it has invested the profits it made from the squeeze into purchasing more volkswagen shares outright .

but car manufacturing is n't the only thing the company is good at .
last year it made six times as much on the stock market as it did making cars .
industry insiders are only half joking when they call it a hedge fund with a carmaker attached .
porsche says its stock market trades are only for one reason : to take it towards its long term goal , the takeover of car making giant , volkswagen .
in october 2008 , porsche 's takeover moves triggered an unprecedented stock market squeeze when it suddenly revealed it owned or had positions on more than 74 % of volkswagen shares .
the value of volkswagen stock rocketed to more than 1,000 euros , briefly making it the most valuable company in the world .
hedge funds , who had gambled that the value of volkswagen shares would fall are said to have lost between 10bn and 40bn euros .
porsche denies any wrongdoing and says that it made no profit from the squeeze , but some hedge funds are crying foul .
now the german financial regulator , bafin , is conducting an investigation into what it calls " suspected market abuse . "
the back story the stories of porsche and volkswagen have long been intertwined .
wiedeking took the decisions , the risky decisions , to come up with new models arndt ellinghorst , head of european automotive research at credit suisse ferdinand porsche designed the iconic volkswagen beetle in the 1930s , a car that became an emblem of germany 's economic success throughout the world .
he then founded his own company , which became famous for making superfast sports cars .
the porsche family still owns the company their grandfather founded and now wants to own volkswagen itself , a company 14 times the size of porsche .
volkswagen owns some of the biggest names in european motoring ; seat , audi , lamborghini , bugatti and bentley .
the personalities the recession of the early 1990s hit porsche hard and some questioned if the company would survive .
then , in 1993 , wendelin wiedeking was appointed chief executive .
together with chief financial officer holger haerter they are credited with turning the company around .
" wiedeking took the decisions , the risky decisions , to come up with new models , " says arndt ellinghorst , head of european automotive research at credit suisse .
they also slashed production costs , but most importantly , mr haerter used porsche 's cash to enter the financial markets .
he had little experience of car making , but he did bring expertise in investment management .
through currency hedging he developed a mastery of the markets that he eventually turned towards porsche 's end goal ; the take over of volkswagen .
" porsche does not have the research and development budget to come up with really the key innovations of the industry , " says mr ellinghorst .
a takeover of volkswagen would mean access to its huge production facilities , its technology and , most importantly , its cash .
vw law in 2005 , porsche quietly started to increase its stake in volkswagen .
porsche has been accused of speculating in volkswagen shares by september 2008 it had acquired 35.14 % of volkswagen shares .
whilst porsche stated publicly its long term goal was a takeover , insiders knew this goal was stymied by a peculiar anomaly : the vw law .
the vw law essentially protects volkswagen from hostile take over .
it means that an 80 % majority is needed to make " significant decisions " at annual meetings .
this gives the local state government of lower saxony , owning 20.1 % of the shares , a blocking majority .
porsche needs to overturn this law before it can reach its ambitious goal .
it is applying the pressure on both the eu and the german government to do this .
while the vw law is still in place there is consensus among market insiders that there is little point in porsche increasing its stake in volkswagen , but sometimes things are not quite what they seem .
short selling by july 2008 the credit crunch was hitting the car industry hard and car company share values were plummeting around the world .
but volkswagen 's were remaining stubbornly high .
porsche would gain from volkswagen 's expertise and finances hedge fund managers calculated that volkswagen shares could not remain so high indefinitely and believed there was an opportunity to make some cash by short selling the shares - borrowing volkswagen shares off a third party in the expectation that the price would fall so they would be able to buy them back cheaper , later and pocketing the difference .
volkswagen shares became some of the most " shorted " stocks in europe .
but despite the downturn , by the end of the summer it was clear there was something peculiar about volkswagen shares .
the price was not dropping and the reason was about to be revealed .
the bombshell on sunday 26 october 2008 , porsche dropped a bombshell .
it announced it had increased its stake in volkswagen to 42.6 % and held cash settled options on a further 31.5 % - meaning it had positions on up to 74.1 % of all volkswagen shares .
it seemed it had effectively cornered the market and short sellers who needed to buy back shares to close their positions were forced to fight over the remaining available stock .
how did it happen ?
porsche was able to build its secret holding by using financial instruments called cash settled call options .
call options essentially give the buyer the option to buy shares at a competitive price at a future fixed date .

the current school system is skewed in favour of giving more opportunities to middle class children , the report by the runnymede trust says .
it says white working class children are considered more likely to fail and face more barriers to high achievement .
the government says it is increasing targeted support for poorer white boys and giving them more one-to-one help .
the report says class and economics are still central to aspiration in britain .
working class children still do not have access to the material or psychological support that better off children have , the report says .
and it says class , rather than being white or non-white , makes discrimination more likely .
the experiences of white working class children are influenced by those of previous generations , who are likely to have felt marginalised and under-achieved at school , say researchers . "
current patterns of testing in schools may be entrenching inequalities which have always been there , as failure may make young people feel less worthwhile " dr robert berkeley , runnymede trust they studied the treatment of white working class people across a range of sectors and concluded that they are discriminated against in several areas .
new labour 's " respect " agenda could give a negative expectation of working class behaviour , while the government also tried to encourage higher aspirations , they said .
the report suggests that the white working classes are losing out in areas from housing to health .
housing is distributed unequally , it says , with the richer taking more of the stocks of good quality housing .
' lagging behind ' dr robert berkeley , of the runnymede trust , said it was important to have a progressive debate about class and race in the 21st century , but that that had not happened so far .
he said it was not justified to stop targeting resources at the inequalities experienced by ethnic minorities .
" it would be fair to say that resources should also be targeted at white working classes , who face discrimination , " he said .
" current patterns of testing in schools may be entrenching inequalities which have always been there , as failure may make young people feel less worthwhile , " he added .
the research , commissioned by the department for communities and local government , says state schools have bred a sense of inferiority among the working classes .
middle class children learn that " failure is intolerable " , it says , but working class children find they are permanently associated with failure .
poor white boys still lag behind at school .
this year , five out of six did not achieve five good gcses at grades a * -c , including english and maths .
this compares with 25 % of black boys and 32 % of asian boys of similar backgrounds .
only gypsy and romany pupils entitled to free school meals performed worse at gcse level .
a spokesman for the department for education and skills said the government was committed to enabling every child to achieve its potential , regardless of background , and that its focus on early years education would help prevent certain children falling behind .
" we know that through the personalisation agenda , teachers are identifying those in the most need and giving them one to one tuition and catch up classes , " he said .

the current school system is skewed in favour of giving more opportunities to middle class children , the report by the runnymede trust says .
it says white working class children are considered more likely to fail and face more barriers to high achievement .
the government says it is increasing targeted support for poorer white boys and giving them more one-to-one help .
the report says class and economics are still central to aspiration in britain .
working class children still do not have access to the material or psychological support that better off children have , the report says .
and it says class , rather than being white or non-white , makes discrimination more likely .
the experiences of white working class children are influenced by those of previous generations , who are likely to have felt marginalised and under-achieved at school , say researchers .
current patterns of testing in schools may be entrenching inequalities which have always been there , as failure may make young people feel less worthwhile dr robert berkeley , runnymede trust they studied the treatment of white working class people across a range of sectors and concluded that they are discriminated against in several areas .
new labour 's " respect " agenda could give a negative expectation of working class behaviour , while the government also tried to encourage higher aspirations , they said .
the report suggests that the white working classes are losing out in areas from housing to health .
housing is distributed unequally , it says , with the richer taking more of the stocks of good quality housing .
' lagging behind ' dr robert berkeley , of the runnymede trust , said it was important to have a progressive debate about class and race in the 21st century , but that that had not happened so far .
he said it was not justified to stop targeting resources at the inequalities experienced by ethnic minorities .
" it would be fair to say that resources should also be targeted at white working classes , who face discrimination , " he said .
" current patterns of testing in schools may be entrenching inequalities which have always been there , as failure may make young people feel less worthwhile , " he added .
the research , commissioned by the department for communities and local government , says state schools have bred a sense of inferiority among the working classes .
middle class children learn that " failure is intolerable " , it says , but working class children find they are permanently associated with failure .
poor white boys still lag behind at school .
this year , five out of six did not achieve five good gcses at grades a * -c , including english and maths .
this compares with 25 % of black boys and 32 % of asian boys of similar backgrounds .
only gypsy and romany pupils entitled to free school meals performed worse at gcse level .
a spokesman for the department for education and skills said the government was committed to enabling every child to achieve its potential , regardless of background , and that its focus on early years education would help prevent certain children falling behind .
" we know that through the personalisation agenda , teachers are identifying those in the most need and giving them one to one tuition and catch up classes , " he said .

what has president obama said so far concerning guantanamo ?
closing the controversial the camp at the us naval base in guantanamo and ending the use of what have been termed " enhanced interrogation techniques " are central planks of his security agenda .
president obama told time magazine that if his administration had not " closed down guantanamo in a responsible way , put a clear end to torture and restored a balance between the demands of our security and our constitution " within two years of taking office , then it would have failed .
so what steps is president obama going to take ?
one of his first acts as president was to request the suspension of all military tribunals there .
a motion filed jointly by the white house and the us department of defense sought a 120-day suspension of trials .
the judges at guantanamo quickly agreed to halt the cases of a canadian accused of killing a us soldier in afghanistan and five men charged in the 11 september attacks .
similar decisions are expected in the other 13 pending cases .
so if military tribunals are suspended , what happens then ?
it gives the obama administration time to work out exactly how it will proceed in a highly complicated situation .
this includes reviewing the much-criticised system of military commissions , evaluating whether there is a case for prosecution of those detainees not approved for release or transfer , and if so where they should be tried .
the broad plan seems to be to close guantanamo and move the trial process to the united states , but this is far from straightforward .
for example , some of the evidence admissible in a military tribunal would not be accepted in a us civilian court .
so a hybrid system combining civilian court rules with courts martial procedures is being examined .
there will also be a new push to get countries to accept those prisoners already cleared for release .
another problem is that some prisoners can not be sent back to their home countries because they run the risk of being tortured .
how many prisoners were facing a military tribunal ?
the bush administration had plans to try about 60 to 80 of the 245 foreign inmates still being held at guantanamo .
the camp once had some 750 prisoners .
as they stand , how do the current tribunals / commissions work ?
they were established in 2006 by the bush administration to try terror suspects under separate rules from regular civilian or military courts .
they are made up of between five and 12 us armed forces officers .
however , if the death penalty is sought , then at least 12 members have to be on the commission .
a qualified military judge presides over the hearing .
to get a conviction , at least two-thirds of the commission members have to be in favour .
for a sentence of death , which can be sought if death occurred as a result of a defendant 's action , all 12 commission members have to agree .
the final decision on carrying out a death sentence is taken by the us president .
are the tribunals held in public ?
the commissions are in public though the " public " is defined as members of the press and national or international organisations , agreed to by the secretary for defence .
the tribunal can be closed if the safety of individuals or the protection of intelligence is required .
what safeguards are there for the defendant ?
in a 12 june 2008 decision , the us supreme court ruled that foreign suspects at guantanamo had the right to seek a full judicial review of their detention in civilian courts .
the court accepted arguments by lawyers for two prisoners , lakhdar boumediene and fawzi al-odah , that the military commissions act -lrb- mca -rrb- unlawfully deprived them of their right under the principle of habeas corpus .
habeas corpus is an ancient right acquired from english law under which a prisoner has to be brought before a court to have his / her detention justified .
what did the bush administration say about habeas corpus ?
it argued that habeas corpus did not extend to guantanamo bay as it was not us sovereign territory and that the system it had set up itself provided adequate safeguards .
these are that the accused will have the presumption of innocence and proof of guilt will have to be " beyond reasonable doubt " .
he can not be forced to testify against himself .
he will have a military lawyer and can also have a civilian one .
also , the accused is able to be present for the proceedings unless he is ruled disruptive , to present evidence and witnesses in his defence and to cross-examine any witnesses against him .
he has the right to be shown the evidence against him , though this will be in summary form if the judge decides that sources are kept secret for security reasons .
mr obama 's choice for attorney general , eric holder , has said the commissions do not provide enough legal protections for defendants .
can a defendant appeal ?
if convicted , a defendant can appeal to a court of military commission review and then to the united states court of appeal , a civilian court .
from there , an appeal might go to the us supreme court itself .
what drawbacks are there for the defendant ?
there are some serious differences between the commissions and normal us law .
the decision to convict is by two-thirds vote , not unanimity as in a us jury trial .
the commission itself , in effect the jury , is made up of military officers not members of the public .
a key difference is that any evidence , including hearsay -lrb- in which a witness says he / she was told or heard something from someone else -rrb- , and some obtained by coercion , is allowed , " if the military judge determines that the evidence would have probative value to a reasonable person " .
evidence that contains classified information will be summarised to protect its sources , so the accused will not have a complete picture of the case against him .
what about evidence obtained by torture or coercion ?
evidence obtained under torture is not permitted , but evidence obtained by coercion can be .
the interrogation technique of " waterboarding " was not classified as torture by the bush administration .
however , the obama administration seems set to take the opposite view .
eric holder has said categorically that " waterboarding is torture " .
what is currently happening at guantanamo ?
alleged 9/11 mastermind khalid sheikh mohammed and his co-accused ali abd al-aziz ali , ramzi binalshibh , mustafa ahmad al-hawsawi and walid bin attash appeared at a pre-trial hearing on 19 january .
the proceedings went ahead despite a request by both the defence and prosecution teams for a delay .
the defendants , who face charges including terrorism , hijacking and murder , have all said they do not want to be represented by us military lawyers .
their previous appearance was at a hearing in december when they came face to face with relatives of those killed in the 11 september attacks .
in may 2008 , the pentagon dropped charges against saudi citizen mohammad al-qahtani - the man alleged to have been the " 20th hijacker " in the 11 september 2001 attacks .
the official overseeing the trials , susan crawford , said in january 2009 that mr qahtani , who remains at guantanamo , had been tortured .
has anyone been convicted ?
in march 2007 an australian , david hicks , pleaded guilty to helping the taleban and was sent back home to serve a nine-month sentence .
on 6 august 2008 , a six-member military jury convicted osama bin laden 's former driver , salim hamdan , of supporting terrorism .
he was sentenced to 66 months .
as he had spent time in pre-trial detention , his 66-month sentence was completed in november 2008 and he was returned to his home country of yemen .

the camp once had some 750 prisoners .
as they stand , how do the current tribunals / commissions work ?
they were established in 2006 by the bush administration to try terror suspects under separate rules from regular civilian or military courts .
they are made up of between five and 12 us armed forces officers .
however , if the death penalty is sought , then at least 12 members have to be on the commission .
a qualified military judge presides over the hearing .
to get a conviction , at least two-thirds of the commission members have to be in favour .
for a sentence of death , which can be sought if death occurred as a result of a defendant 's action , all 12 commission members have to agree .
the final decision on carrying out a death sentence is taken by the us president .
are the tribunals held in public ?
the commissions are in public though the " public " is defined as members of the press and national or international organisations , agreed to by the secretary for defence .
the tribunal can be closed if the safety of individuals or the protection of intelligence is required .
what safeguards are there for the defendant ?
in a 12 june 2008 decision , the us supreme court ruled that foreign suspects at guantanamo had the right to seek a full judicial review of their detention in civilian courts .
the court accepted arguments by lawyers for two prisoners , lakhdar boumediene and fawzi al-odah , that the military commissions act -lrb- mca -rrb- unlawfully deprived them of their right under the principle of habeas corpus .
habeas corpus is an ancient right acquired from english law under which a prisoner has to be brought before a court to have his / her detention justified .
what did the bush administration say about habeas corpus ?
it argued that habeas corpus did not extend to guantanamo bay as it was not us sovereign territory and that the system it had set up itself provided adequate safeguards .
these are that the accused will have the presumption of innocence and proof of guilt will have to be " beyond reasonable doubt " .
he can not be forced to testify against himself .
he will have a military lawyer and can also have a civilian one .
also , the accused is able to be present for the proceedings unless he is ruled disruptive , to present evidence and witnesses in his defence and to cross-examine any witnesses against him .
he has the right to be shown the evidence against him , though this will be in summary form if the judge decides that sources are kept secret for security reasons .
mr obama 's choice for attorney general , eric holder , has said the commissions do not provide enough legal protections for defendants .
can a defendant appeal ?
if convicted , a defendant can appeal to a court of military commission review and then to the united states court of appeal , a civilian court .
from there , an appeal might go to the us supreme court itself .
what drawbacks are there for the defendant ?
there are some serious differences between the commissions and normal us law .
the decision to convict is by two-thirds vote , not unanimity as in a us jury trial .
the commission itself , in effect the jury , is made up of military officers not members of the public .
a key difference is that any evidence , including hearsay -lrb- in which a witness says he / she was told or heard something from someone else -rrb- , and some obtained by coercion , is allowed , " if the military judge determines that the evidence would have probative value to a reasonable person " .
evidence that contains classified information will be summarised to protect its sources , so the accused will not have a complete picture of the case against him .
what about evidence obtained by torture or coercion ?
evidence obtained under torture is not permitted , but evidence obtained by coercion can be .
the interrogation technique of " waterboarding " was not classified as torture by the bush administration .
however , the obama administration seems set to take the opposite view .
eric holder has said categorically that " waterboarding is torture " .
what is currently happening at guantanamo ?
alleged 9/11 mastermind khalid sheikh mohammed and his co-accused ali abd al-aziz ali , ramzi binalshibh , mustafa ahmad al-hawsawi and walid bin attash appeared at a pre-trial hearing on 19 january .
the proceedings went ahead despite a request by both the defence and prosecution teams for a delay .
the defendants , who face charges including terrorism , hijacking and murder , have all said they do not want to be represented by us military lawyers .
their previous appearance was at a hearing in december when they came face to face with relatives of those killed in the 11 september attacks .
in may 2008 , the pentagon dropped charges against saudi citizen mohammad al-qahtani - the man alleged to have been the " 20th hijacker " in the 11 september 2001 attacks .
the official overseeing the trials , susan crawford , said in january 2009 that mr qahtani , who remains at guantanamo , had been tortured .
has anyone been convicted ?
in march 2007 an australian , david hicks , pleaded guilty to helping the taleban and was sent back home to serve a nine-month sentence .
on 6 august 2008 , a six-member military jury convicted osama bin laden 's former driver , salim hamdan , of supporting terrorism .
he was sentenced to 66 months .
as he had spent time in pre-trial detention , his 66-month sentence was completed in november 2008 and he was returned to his home country of yemen .

what has president obama said so far concerning guantanamo ?
closing the controversial the camp at the us naval base in guantanamo and ending the use of what have been termed " enhanced interrogation techniques " are central planks of his security agenda .
president obama told time magazine that if his administration had not " closed down guantanamo in a responsible way , put a clear end to torture and restored a balance between the demands of our security and our constitution " within two years of taking office , then it would have failed .
so what steps is president obama going to take ?
one of his first acts as president was to request the suspension of all military tribunals there .
a motion filed jointly by the white house and the us department of defense sought a 120-day suspension of trials .
the judges at guantanamo quickly agreed to halt the cases of a canadian accused of killing a us soldier in afghanistan and five men charged in the 11 september attacks .
similar decisions are expected in the other 13 pending cases .
so if military tribunals are suspended , what happens then ?
it gives the obama administration time to work out exactly how it will proceed in a highly complicated situation .
this includes reviewing the much-criticised system of military commissions , evaluating whether there is a case for prosecution of those detainees not approved for release or transfer , and if so where they should be tried .
the broad plan seems to be to close guantanamo and move the trial process to the united states , but this is far from straightforward .
for example , some of the evidence admissible in a military tribunal would not be accepted in a us civilian court .
so a hybrid system combining civilian court rules with courts martial procedures is being examined .
there will also be a new push to get countries to accept those prisoners already cleared for release .
another problem is that some prisoners can not be sent back to their home countries because they run the risk of being tortured .
how many prisoners were facing a military tribunal ?
the bush administration had plans to try about 60 to 80 of the 245 foreign inmates still being held at guantanamo .

advertisement harry nicolaides says his jailing " feels like a bad dream " the australian government has asked thailand 's royal family to pardon an australian author who was jailed for three years for defaming the monarchy .
harry nicolaides was sentenced by bangkok 's criminal court on monday for defaming the king and crown prince in a 2005 novel .
the court said a passage about the book 's fictional prince caused " dishonour " to the royals .
thailand is a constitutional monarchy but has severe lese majeste laws .
among the australian public , the imprisonment of the author harry nicolaides appears to have violated a basic sense of fair play , not to mention a strong belief in the freedom of speech .
newspapers here had featured a front-page picture of the author jailed behind bars , with a tear running down his cheek .
king bhumibol is revered in thailand now the australian government has weighed in by issuing a statement saying it " strongly supports " harry nicolaides 's plea for a pardon from the king of thailand .
the country 's foreign minister , stephen smith , has also written to his thai counterpart , outlining australia 's " firm " backing for the author 's pardon application .
only 50 copies of mr nicolaides novel were ever printed .
of those , only seven were ever sold .

media requires javascript to play .
advertisement the bbc 's medical correspondent fergus walsh talks about the drama when dr anne turner chose to end her own life in a swiss clinic it was front-page news .
the retired doctor had a degenerative neurological condition called progressive supranuclear palsy -lrb- psp -rrb- .
she knew she faced a slow death , becoming less and less able to communicate with her carers and loved ones .
this weekend her story ' a short stay in switzerland ' is brought to the small screen by award winning writer frank mcguiness and starring julie walters , as anne .
assisted suicide writer frank mcguinness said : " as a doctor anne turner lived and worked by her principles , and she chose to die by them .
this film recognises that rare courage . "
julie walters said taking on the role had been a challenge .
" i felt a great deal of responsibility to get the character of anne right .
but the script was fantastic and her personality just jumped off the page .
anne was clearly a remarkable woman who was determined not to be a victim . "
dr turner 's son , edward , said his mother had been determined to die , but that because of uk law had been unable to do so at home .
he and his family are now campaigning for a change in the law to allow physician-assisted suicide in the uk .
but he stressed the programme was not a polemic for assisted suicide and that he hoped that it would be watched by people with a broad spectrum of beliefs , allowing them to make up their own minds while exploring the concept of death .
i hope it will help people talk about death edward turner the bbc 's fergus walsh recounts his nerve-wracking role " if you were writing a polemic you would not chose all the details of this story , " he said .
" our mother was relatively able-bodied when she went off to switzerland and would never have been able to have an assisted death in the uk .
also the final death scene was not easy .
" she was choking a bit because the barbiturates went down the wrong way .
" it is not a really peaceful ending .
" it is traumatic and difficult . "
but he said : " the audience will make up their own mind whether assisted dying is right or wrong .
" it does show the desperation people have when faced with terrible symptoms .
i hope it will help people talk about death .
if we do n't , we are going to condemn ourselves to bad deaths , " my mum would be delighted that people are talking about the issue , but embarrassed that she had become a key figure in the debate about assisted dying . "
reluctant to help edward , a board member of the campaign group dignity in dying , which supports assisted suicide , said that as a doctor his mother had been very well aware of how her illness would progress and that having nursed her husband through a similar terminal condition she knew she wanted to end her own life .
" my immediate reaction was to say ' i am so sorry and of course you will have my full support ' .
" well that 's what i said , but what i thought was that there was absolutely no way i was going to let my mother take her own life .
" she is the most precious thing to me and it is just not going to happen .
" but i do think psp is one of the worst things you can get .
dr turner had a degenerative neurological condition " i think when you look at what happens she would have lost the ability to move any muscle in her body .
" she would have just been lying in her bed waiting for death , but her brain would have been ok .
" it was incredibly difficult for the family because we are all selfish human beings and want the people we love to hang around as long as possible no matter what condition they are in , but the only person that benefits is us . "
suicide attempt his sister sophie said that it was their mum 's attempted suicide in 2006 that convinced them that she was serious .
" i could not face her trying that again or trying something similar depending on how desperate she would get so we talked about dignitas .
" i called them when she was unconscious and by the time she woke up i wanted her to have an alternative in place . "
she said she hoped the film would give people a little taste of their experiences .
dr turner went to switzerland to die " i thought if people can just get a snapshot of what we went through then maybe it will help people understand a bit better why we supported our mother and what she went through , and what my father went through .
" we do everything throughout life to relieve suffering all the way through life and when it comes to neurological illnesses when you could end up with a fully functioning brain and a useless body .
" no amount of palliative care is going to relieve those symptoms , so i think that is why they should be given the option to die if they want to - and a lot of people do n't want to .

advertisement the bbc 's medical correspondent fergus walsh talks about the drama when dr anne turner chose to end her own life in a swiss clinic it was front-page news .
the retired doctor had a degenerative neurological condition called progressive supranuclear palsy -lrb- psp -rrb- .
she knew she faced a slow death , becoming less and less able to communicate with her carers and loved ones .
this weekend her story ' a short stay in switzerland ' is brought to the small screen by award winning writer frank mcguiness and starring julie walters , as anne .
assisted suicide writer frank mcguinness said : " as a doctor anne turner lived and worked by her principles , and she chose to die by them .
this film recognises that rare courage . "
julie walters said taking on the role had been a challenge .
" i felt a great deal of responsibility to get the character of anne right .
but the script was fantastic and her personality just jumped off the page .
anne was clearly a remarkable woman who was determined not to be a victim . "
dr turner 's son , edward , said his mother had been determined to die , but that because of uk law had been unable to do so at home .
he and his family are now campaigning for a change in the law to allow physician-assisted suicide in the uk .
but he stressed the programme was not a polemic for assisted suicide and that he hoped that it would be watched by people with a broad spectrum of beliefs , allowing them to make up their own minds while exploring the concept of death .
i hope it will help people talk about death edward turner the bbc 's fergus walsh recounts his nerve-wracking role " if you were writing a polemic you would not chose all the details of this story , " he said .
" our mother was relatively able-bodied when she went off to switzerland and would never have been able to have an assisted death in the uk .
also the final death scene was not easy .
" she was choking a bit because the barbiturates went down the wrong way .
" it is not a really peaceful ending .
" it is traumatic and difficult . "
but he said : " the audience will make up their own mind whether assisted dying is right or wrong .
" it does show the desperation people have when faced with terrible symptoms .
i hope it will help people talk about death .
if we do n't , we are going to condemn ourselves to bad deaths , " my mum would be delighted that people are talking about the issue , but embarrassed that she had become a key figure in the debate about assisted dying . "
reluctant to help edward , a board member of the campaign group dignity in dying , which supports assisted suicide , said that as a doctor his mother had been very well aware of how her illness would progress and that having nursed her husband through a similar terminal condition she knew she wanted to end her own life .
" my immediate reaction was to say ' i am so sorry and of course you will have my full support ' .
" well that 's what i said , but what i thought was that there was absolutely no way i was going to let my mother take her own life .
" she is the most precious thing to me and it is just not going to happen .
" but i do think psp is one of the worst things you can get .
dr turner had a degenerative neurological condition " i think when you look at what happens she would have lost the ability to move any muscle in her body .
" she would have just been lying in her bed waiting for death , but her brain would have been ok .
" it was incredibly difficult for the family because we are all selfish human beings and want the people we love to hang around as long as possible no matter what condition they are in , but the only person that benefits is us . "
suicide attempt his sister sophie said that it was their mum 's attempted suicide in 2006 that convinced them that she was serious .
" i could not face her trying that again or trying something similar depending on how desperate she would get so we talked about dignitas .
" i called them when she was unconscious and by the time she woke up i wanted her to have an alternative in place . "
she said she hoped the film would give people a little taste of their experiences .
dr turner went to switzerland to die " i thought if people can just get a snapshot of what we went through then maybe it will help people understand a bit better why we supported our mother and what she went through , and what my father went through .
" we do everything throughout life to relieve suffering all the way through life and when it comes to neurological illnesses when you could end up with a fully functioning brain and a useless body .
" no amount of palliative care is going to relieve those symptoms , so i think that is why they should be given the option to die if they want to - and a lot of people do n't want to .
" my mother 's life was cut short because she was worried that she would not be well enough to leave the country that she left while she had some quality of life left .

advertisement the bbc 's medical correspondent fergus walsh talks about the drama when dr anne turner chose to end her own life in a swiss clinic it was front-page news .
the retired doctor had a degenerative neurological condition called progressive supranuclear palsy -lrb- psp -rrb- .
she knew she faced a slow death , becoming less and less able to communicate with her carers and loved ones .
this weekend her story ' a short stay in switzerland ' is brought to the small screen by award winning writer frank mcguiness and starring julie walters , as anne .
assisted suicide writer frank mcguinness said : " as a doctor anne turner lived and worked by her principles , and she chose to die by them .
this film recognises that rare courage . "
julie walters said taking on the role had been a challenge .
" i felt a great deal of responsibility to get the character of anne right .
but the script was fantastic and her personality just jumped off the page .
anne was clearly a remarkable woman who was determined not to be a victim . "
dr turner 's son , edward , said his mother had been determined to die , but that because of uk law had been unable to do so at home .
he and his family are now campaigning for a change in the law to allow physician-assisted suicide in the uk .
but he stressed the programme was not a polemic for assisted suicide and that he hoped that it would be watched by people with a broad spectrum of beliefs , allowing them to make up their own minds while exploring the concept of death .
i hope it will help people talk about death edward turner the bbc 's fergus walsh recounts his nerve-wracking role " if you were writing a polemic you would not chose all the details of this story , " he said .
" our mother was relatively able-bodied when she went off to switzerland and would never have been able to have an assisted death in the uk .
also the final death scene was not easy .
" she was choking a bit because the barbiturates went down the wrong way .
" it is not a really peaceful ending .
" it is traumatic and difficult . "
but he said : " the audience will make up their own mind whether assisted dying is right or wrong .
" it does show the desperation people have when faced with terrible symptoms .
i hope it will help people talk about death .
if we do n't , we are going to condemn ourselves to bad deaths , " my mum would be delighted that people are talking about the issue , but embarrassed that she had become a key figure in the debate about assisted dying . "
reluctant to help edward , a board member of the campaign group dignity in dying , which supports assisted suicide , said that as a doctor his mother had been very well aware of how her illness would progress and that having nursed her husband through a similar terminal condition she knew she wanted to end her own life .
" my immediate reaction was to say ' i am so sorry and of course you will have my full support ' .
" well that 's what i said , but what i thought was that there was absolutely no way i was going to let my mother take her own life .
" she is the most precious thing to me and it is just not going to happen .
" but i do think psp is one of the worst things you can get .
dr turner had a degenerative neurological condition " i think when you look at what happens she would have lost the ability to move any muscle in her body .
" she would have just been lying in her bed waiting for death , but her brain would have been ok .
" it was incredibly difficult for the family because we are all selfish human beings and want the people we love to hang around as long as possible no matter what condition they are in , but the only person that benefits is us . "
suicide attempt his sister sophie said that it was their mum 's attempted suicide in 2006 that convinced them that she was serious .
" i could not face her trying that again or trying something similar depending on how desperate she would get so we talked about dignitas .
" i called them when she was unconscious and by the time she woke up i wanted her to have an alternative in place . "
she said she hoped the film would give people a little taste of their experiences .

he had covered the story of dr anne turner 's assisted death in switzerland and had got to know the family reasonably well .
he had even accompanied them to switzerland when dr turner took her life and his filming played an important role in shaping the drama .
so when writer frank mcguiness came to creating his play he included fergus ' role .
sensitive handling " i had lunch with them and pretty much became convinced that they were going to do something in a sensitive way , " said fergus .
" they had contacted the family so i agreed to give them the rushes of my interviews with anne some of which had not been seen . "
i think though it is the most nerve wracking thing i have done " fergus walsh " anne 's decision to get the bbc involved was a key part of her final days .
she had made her mind up that she was going to commit suicide , or assisted dying .
with the help of dignitas and she wanted to make a statement by doing that .
" she did not want to just do it quietly , she wanted to campaign at the same time .
" i talked about it with frank and the producer and saw a number of screen plays and then they said ' would you like to play yourself ? '
i thought they were joking .
" the day of the read-through we met in a church in bloomsbury , in london , with the entire cast .
" up until then , i thought they would probably still get someone else .
my daughters wanted david tennant to play me . "
but he said he " passed muster " and took part .
true to life fergus said it was important his role was true to life , ensuring that he maintained his integrity and independence as a bbc correspondent .
but he said it had been a nerve-wracking experience to have an acting debut with such screen legends as julie walters , who plays anne .
" although i did not meet anne very often she was a very determined person with a wicked sense of humour very sparky lady and julie walters captured that , " he said .
" it is a very powerful piece of drama and sets out anne 's particular situation and her approach to her illness particularly well .
" i think though it is the most nerve wracking thing i have done .
i felt very responsible to all the other people involved .
" i really enjoyed doing it though , meeting the actors and seeing how they work and working with a crew of 20-30 people was impressive . "
and does he think it is the start of a new career ?
" i think not .
i am not waiting for the phone to ring . "

he had covered the story of dr anne turner 's assisted death in switzerland and had got to know the family reasonably well .
he had even accompanied them to switzerland when dr turner took her life and his filming played an important role in shaping the drama .
so when writer frank mcguiness came to creating his play he included fergus ' role .
sensitive handling " i had lunch with them and pretty much became convinced that they were going to do something in a sensitive way , " said fergus .
" they had contacted the family so i agreed to give them the rushes of my interviews with anne some of which had not been seen .
i think though it is the most nerve wracking thing i have done fergus walsh " anne 's decision to get the bbc involved was a key part of her final days .
she had made her mind up that she was going to commit suicide , or assisted dying .
with the help of dignitas and she wanted to make a statement by doing that .
" she did not want to just do it quietly , she wanted to campaign at the same time .
" i talked about it with frank and the producer and saw a number of screen plays and then they said ' would you like to play yourself ? '
i thought they were joking .
" the day of the read-through we met in a church in bloomsbury , in london , with the entire cast .
" up until then , i thought they would probably still get someone else .
my daughters wanted david tennant to play me . "
but he said he " passed muster " and took part .

advertisement anne turner travelled to the dignitas clinic in switzerland in january 2006 fergus said it was important his role was true to life , ensuring that he maintained his integrity and independence as a bbc correspondent .
but he said it had been a nerve-wracking experience to have an acting debut with such screen legends as julie walters , who plays anne .
" although i did not meet anne very often she was a very determined person with a wicked sense of humour very sparky lady and julie walters captured that , " he said .
" it is a very powerful piece of drama and sets out anne 's particular situation and her approach to her illness particularly well .
" i think though it is the most nerve wracking thing i have done .
i felt very responsible to all the other people involved .
" i really enjoyed doing it though , meeting the actors and seeing how they work and working with a crew of 20-30 people was impressive . "
and does he think it is the start of a new career ?
" i think not .
i am not waiting for the phone to ring . "

prestwick airport in ayrshire has been hit by the economic downturn and management have refused to rule out job cuts as part of a business review .
the company has started a 90-day process to look at reducing costs and boosting revenue .
airport chief executive mark rodwell said : " we are running at a loss at the moment . "
workers at prestwick have been informed about the review , which has just begun .
however , management said long-term prospects remained " optimistic " and job cuts were not " a foregone conclusion " . "
there is a determination to explore all possible avenues in an effort to minimise any job losses and to secure the long term-future of the airport and its workforce " john scott msp scottish conservatives mr rodwell told bbc radio 's good morning scotland programme that the airport had been running at a loss for the last couple of months .
" the intention is certainly to stay open and the 90 days is not linked to the decision to stay open or not , " he said .
" we have entered into a review process to look for ways to deliver efficiencies , cost savings and revenue improvements .
" our business development team is working hard to offset the recent loss of freight and charter traffic by exploring a number of opportunities with potential new airlines .
" while these are difficult times we are optimistic about the long-term future of the airport and the aviation industry as a whole , which has always recovered well in the past . "
mr rodwell said passenger services had been " strong " during 2008 but he anticipated a " difficult year with many challenges " ahead .
he said it was too early to say what the impact would be on staff but the aim would be " to avoid job losses where possible " .
scottish conservative msp for ayr , john scott , said he was concerned about the possibility of job losses at prestwick .
he said : " i have been in touch with the airport to discuss the current situation and to offer my support and assistance .
" there is no doubt that prestwick airport is suffering the effects of the economic downturn and that this has hit passenger numbers and therefore the airport 's overall operations .
" nevertheless , i am reassured by my discussions with the airport that there is a determination to explore all possible avenues in an effort to minimise any job losses and to secure the long term-future of the airport and its workforce . "
