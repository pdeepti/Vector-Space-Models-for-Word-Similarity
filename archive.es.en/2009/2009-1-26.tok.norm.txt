26 .
the ministers also expressed concern over the cholera outbreak ravaging the country , saying that it viewed the humanitarian situation in zimbabwe with " particular distress . "
and they called for closer international cooperation to bring about democratic change in zimbabwe and to crack down on the flow of illicitly-traded diamonds which provides mugabe 's regime with a financial lifeline .
differences remain on guantanamo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is under pressure to accept former guantanamo detainees it 's been a busy few days for european union foreign ministers , who are also grappling on whether to offer a home to released guantanamo detainees who might face abuse if sent back to their country of origin .
the eu has said it will consider taking the detainees , but will leave the final decision up to individual member countries .
the eu has long called for the closure of the detention center in guantanamo bay , cuba , and welcomed the decision by new us president barack obama to prepare the jail 's closure on his first day in office .
" we have not received any demand from our american friends .
this is an american problem that they have to solve , but we will be ready to help if necessary , " the eu 's top foreign policy official , javier solana , said .

europe hosted israel 's foreign minister tzipi livni last week and will send solana to the middle east on monday in a bid to bolster the gaza ceasefire .

the assault 's goal was to stop hamas militants from firing rockets at israeli civilians .
hamas " essential to peace process " though the eu lists hamas as a terrorist organization , some eu ministers say no peace can be achieved in the middle east unless hamas - which governs the gaza strip - is also brought into the equation .

but according to the report , merkel has instructed the economics ministry to put the brakes on this practice after statistics showed that exports had risen 10.5 percent on an annual basis to 3.58 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.63 billion -rrb- through november 2008 .
some 75 percent of all medium and small businesses in iran use german-made equipment . business and banking trade elements are not specifically forbidden under un security council sanctions , which only limit the sale of technology that could be used in the weapons industry . merkel has repeatedly insisted that germany is only obliged to obey the un sanctions and said earlier this month that germany was not planning to undertake any further unilateral action against iran at this time .

a recent commentary by editorial writer dan schwammenthal in the wall street journal was titled : " germany loves iran . "

the economics ministry said a year ago that new guarantees for iran fell to 503.4 million euros in 2007 from 1.16 billion in 2006 . half-year numbers for last year show a sharp decline in new guarantees to 73.4 million euros , compared to 387 million in the first half of 2007 with full figures for 2008 to be published in the coming weeks . western powers believe iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons under the cover of a civilian atomic program .

but according to the report , merkel has instructed the economics ministry to put the brakes on this practice after statistics showed that exports had risen 10.5 percent on an annual basis to 3.58 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.63 billion -rrb- through november 2008 .
some 75 percent of all medium and small businesses in iran use german-made equipment . business and banking trade elements are not specifically forbidden under un security council sanctions , which only limit the sale of technology that could be used in the weapons industry . merkel has repeatedly insisted that germany is only obliged to obey the un sanctions and said earlier this month that germany was not planning to undertake any further unilateral action against iran at this time .
but pressure from within the western powers working towards a nuclear-free iran may have persuaded her otherwise . germany has also come under fire from sections of the us media for its policy towards trade with iran .
a recent commentary by editorial writer dan schwammenthal in the wall street journal was titled : " germany loves iran . "
schwammenthal wrote that germany was less worried about an iranian nuclear bomb than it was about tightening sanctions that could negatively affect trade between the two countries . as the new us administration under president barack obama prepares to break with the previous administration and talk with iran about its nuclear program , germany now appears more comfortable with applying more pressure of its own . germany steps up restrictions on trade guarantees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's move increases the pressure on german firms the announcement to issue trade guarantees only in exceptional cases is actually the next logical step in a policy germany has been executing in increments ever since the nuclear stand-off between the west and iran began . germany , traditionally one of the top exporters to iran , has been gradually reducing the numbers of export guarantees for the past three years . german businesses have seen a significant fall in export guarantees for trade with the islamic republic since last year .
the economics ministry said a year ago that new guarantees for iran fell to 503.4 million euros in 2007 from 1.16 billion in 2006 . half-year numbers for last year show a sharp decline in new guarantees to 73.4 million euros , compared to 387 million in the first half of 2007 with full figures for 2008 to be published in the coming weeks . western powers believe iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons under the cover of a civilian atomic program .
tehran says it wants to master nuclear technology for peaceful power generation purposes . reports in recent weeks have said european countries , including britain , france and germany , could seek to pass new sanctions against iran , which has rejected repeated calls from the u.n. security council for it to suspend uranium enrichment . germany 's decision to limit its trade guarantees could herald the start of a new set of restrictions on iran by western powers . eu removes iranian organization from terror list in other developments , european union foreign ministers removed the people 's mujahedin of iran -lrb- pmoi -rrb- from their list of terrorist organizations on monday , despite public protests in tehran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pmoi 's case has been heard before but ignored the widely expected move follows a ruling by the european court in luxembourg , which in december said the eu was wrong to keep the pmoi 's assets frozen after it was taken off a british list of terrorist organizations . " what we are doing today is abiding by the resolution of the european court .
there 's nothing we can do about that resolution , " eu foreign-policy chief javier solana said . founded in 1965 , the pmoi operated a military wing in its early years , but says it renounced violence in june 2001 and now advocates the political overthrow of iran 's current government . reports of the eu 's planned decision prompted street protests outside eu embassies in tehran over the weekend by hundreds of iranian students and relatives of veterans of the iran-iraq war -lrb- 1980-88 -rrb- . iran regards pmoi as a terrorist group owing to its involvement in the assassinations of several high-ranking iranian officials , including the president and prime minister in 1980 . after the group was expelled from france in the 1980s , former iraqi president saddam hussein allocated a military base to the pmoi near the border with iran . before the ouster of saddam , the pmoi frequently infiltrated iranian territory , leading to clashes with iranian forces and casualties on both sides . solana said the eu decision could only be reversed if new evidence against the pmoi was presented to the european courts . " if there is something new that may be presented in front of the court , we 'll see , " solana said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

former deutsche post head klaus zumwinkel will face a 1 million euro fine , but will avoid jail time . zumwinkel , 65 , confessed last week to using a liechtenstein bank to evade 966,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in taxes .
on monday , jan .
26 , a court found him guilty and handed down a two year suspended sentence and a fine of just under 1 million euros .
zumwinkel 's arrest for tax evasion in 2008 sent shockwaves through germany 's close-knit business world .
authorities made an example of zumwinkel , leading him out of his posh villa near cologne as television cameras rolled .
arrest rattled german tax scofflaws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel 's arrest caused many others to turn themselves in zumwinkel was one of hundreds of wealthy germans executives , sports stars and entertainers exposed when a liechtenstein bank employee betrayed them by selling a stolen dvd with details of their accounts to germany 's foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
since then , german prosecutors have recovered more than 150 million euros -lrb- $ 194 million -rrb- from taxpayers hoping to avoid being taken to trial .
german tax authorities believe that more than 4 billion euros was being hidden in liechtenstein .
prosecutors said zumwinkel concealed money in trust funds managed by the ltg bank in liechtenstein .
he set up a trust fund for himself in liechtenstein in 1986 with money he inherited , but failed to disclose earnings and dividends from it to german tax authorities , as required by law .
zumwinkel fell hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leichtenstein is a favorite tax haven released on bail after a search of his villa , zumwinkel resigned shortly afterwards as head of deutsche post , one of the world 's leading logistics companies with a global workforce of more than 350,000 .
later , he stepped down from positions on the boards of other leading german companies such as deutsche telekom , lufthansa and retailer arcandor .
zumwinkel , named manager magazine 's 2003 " executive of the year " for his work at transforming deutsche post from a bloated state monopoly into one of the world 's largest logistics companies , admitted that he had made the " biggest mistake of my life . "
" i am not going to beat around the bush : i am guilty of what i am accused of , " zumwinkel told the court on the trial 's first day .
" my career had a bitter end .
my job was my life . "
zumwinkel barely avoided jail .
in december , the federal court of justice ruled that tax crimes of more than 1 million euros would automatically land an offender in jail .
zumwinkel was originally accused of hiding 1.2 million euros , but the court in bochum announced it would only bring charges on activities since 2002 , meaning the sum involved came in just under the one-million euro mark .
liechtenstein under scrutiny germany reportedly paid 4.5 million euros for the dvd .
the brouhaha also caused britain and the united states to launch their own investigations .
it also brought liechtenstein and other tax havens under heavy international criticism .

they finished bottom of the table behind immigrants from the former yugoslavia and africa -lrb- 3.2 -rrb- , the middle east -lrb- 4.1 -rrb- , southern europe -lrb- 4.4 -rrb- and the far east -lrb- 4.6 -rrb- .
the most integrated group in germany , according to the berlin institute , is immigrants from other eu countries who score 5.5 on the institute 's index .
the report 's assessment is based on results from several criteria including education , assimilation into society and employment to make up its index .
turks failing in education , assimilation and employment areas in the area of education , the study shows that 30 percent of students of turkish origin do not have a school leaving certificate and only 14 percent pass their final secondary school examinations .
in the state of saarland , 45 percent of turkish immigrants have failed to complete their high school education .
in terms of assimilation into society , turkish immigrants are marked down due to the fact that less than a third of turks born in germany have chosen to obtain german citizenship and 93 percent have married within the turkish community .
unemployment among turkish immigrants is high and many survive on state benefits while the reports shows a large number of turkish women remain in the home to manage the family .

attempts by environmental groups to stop the project have failed . germany gave the green light on monday to a controversial plan with india to drop six tons of iron dust in the south atlantic .
the experiment is the biggest trial ever of iron fertilization , a technology which could theoretically help stop global warming at very little cost .
but following complaints by environmentalists , germany 's science ministry ordered the plan suspended while it conducted an urgent review .
" after careful a study of expert reports , i am convinced there are no scientific or legal objections to the german-indian marine research project , " research minister annette schavan said on monday , jan .
26 .
" i have therefore decided … to begin the experiment . "
opponents of the plan fear that the results could be catastrophic , worring that it would cause the sea to become more acidic or trigger algae blooms that would deprive large areas of the ocean of oxygen .
environment minister sigmar gabriel told schavan in a letter recently that the experiment " destroys germany 's credibility and its vanguard role in protecting biodiversity . "
massive carbon sink under the plan , the iron dust is to be sprinkled over an area of 300 square kilometers from a german research vessel , the polarstern .
it is hoped that algae living at the ocean surface will soak up the iron and reproduce rapidly , absorbing carbon dioxide from the surface water .
at the end of their life cycle the algae die and sink .
most of the carbon ends up in deep water or on the sea bottom .
the ocean absorbs more carbon dioxide from the air , reducing the greenhouse effect .
sequestering carbon this way might stop global warming .

it ’ s breaking up in space , though experts are confident it poses no risk . a german space expert has rejected concerns about an old nuclear-powered soviet satellite which is breaking up in space , saying its orbit appears stable and the fuel on board is not very radioactive anymore .
us space watchers highlighted the fate of cosmos 1818 two weeks ago .
a article in the january issue of orbital debris quarterly news , published by the us national aeronautics and space administration -lrb- nasa -rrb- , revealed it was strewing parts .
heiner klinkrad , a specialist in space junk at the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- office in darmstadt , germany , said in an interview with the dpa news agency that he saw no danger .
" the satellite is still in a stable orbit , " said klinkrad , who heads the esa department tracking orbital debris .
he said nasa 's space surveillance network was keeping it under observation .
no indication of an explosion the fragments were only moving away slowly from the satellite , which indicated there had not been any explosion on board .
" only a high-energy explosion would be capable of destabilizing its orbital path , " said klinkrad .
he suggested paint or other surface material was coming free , or a coolant system had sprung a leak , perhaps after impact by a piece of high-speed space junk .
launched by the former soviet union in february 1987 , the satellite was intended to evaluate a nuclear-reactor power supply .
it was still at an altitude of 800 kilometres and its orbit had not slowed , klinkrad said , adding that even if cosmos 1818 were to slow down and tumble to earth , this would be no disaster .
" the reactor on the satellite was shut down 20 years ago , " he said .
" in that time , the radioactivity in the idle reactor would have declined to less than one-thousandth of its original level . " dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it ’ s breaking up in space , though experts are confident it poses no risk . a german space expert has rejected concerns about an old nuclear-powered soviet satellite which is breaking up in space , saying its orbit appears stable and the fuel on board is not very radioactive anymore .
us space watchers highlighted the fate of cosmos 1818 two weeks ago .
a article in the january issue of orbital debris quarterly news , published by the us national aeronautics and space administration -lrb- nasa -rrb- , revealed it was strewing parts .
heiner klinkrad , a specialist in space junk at the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- office in darmstadt , germany , said in an interview with the dpa news agency that he saw no danger .
" the satellite is still in a stable orbit , " said klinkrad , who heads the esa department tracking orbital debris .
he said nasa 's space surveillance network was keeping it under observation .
no indication of an explosion the fragments were only moving away slowly from the satellite , which indicated there had not been any explosion on board .
" only a high-energy explosion would be capable of destabilizing its orbital path , " said klinkrad .
he suggested paint or other surface material was coming free , or a coolant system had sprung a leak , perhaps after impact by a piece of high-speed space junk .
launched by the former soviet union in february 1987 , the satellite was intended to evaluate a nuclear-reactor power supply .
it was still at an altitude of 800 kilometres and its orbit had not slowed , klinkrad said , adding that even if cosmos 1818 were to slow down and tumble to earth , this would be no disaster .
" the reactor on the satellite was shut down 20 years ago , " he said .
" in that time , the radioactivity in the idle reactor would have declined to less than one-thousandth of its original level . " dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

former deutsche post head klaus zumwinkel will face a 1 million euro fine , but will avoid jail time . zumwinkel , 65 , confessed last week to using a liechtenstein bank to evade 966,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in taxes .
on monday , jan .
26 , a court found him guilty and handed down a two year suspended sentence and a fine of just under 1 million euros .
zumwinkel 's arrest for tax evasion in 2008 sent shockwaves through germany 's close-knit business world .
authorities made an example of zumwinkel , leading him out of his posh villa near cologne as television cameras rolled .
arrest rattled german tax scofflaws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel 's arrest caused many others to turn themselves in zumwinkel was one of hundreds of wealthy germans executives , sports stars and entertainers exposed when a liechtenstein bank employee betrayed them by selling a stolen dvd with details of their accounts to germany 's foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
since then , german prosecutors have recovered more than 150 million euros -lrb- $ 194 million -rrb- from taxpayers hoping to avoid being taken to trial .
german tax authorities believe that more than 4 billion euros was being hidden in liechtenstein .
prosecutors said zumwinkel concealed money in trust funds managed by the ltg bank in liechtenstein .
he set up a trust fund for himself in liechtenstein in 1986 with money he inherited , but failed to disclose earnings and dividends from it to german tax authorities , as required by law .
zumwinkel fell hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leichtenstein is a favorite tax haven released on bail after a search of his villa , zumwinkel resigned shortly afterwards as head of deutsche post , one of the world 's leading logistics companies with a global workforce of more than 350,000 .
later , he stepped down from positions on the boards of other leading german companies such as deutsche telekom , lufthansa and retailer arcandor .
zumwinkel , named manager magazine 's 2003 " executive of the year " for his work at transforming deutsche post from a bloated state monopoly into one of the world 's largest logistics companies , admitted that he had made the " biggest mistake of my life . "
" i am not going to beat around the bush : i am guilty of what i am accused of , " zumwinkel told the court on the trial 's first day .
" my career had a bitter end .
my job was my life . "
zumwinkel barely avoided jail .
in december , the federal court of justice ruled that tax crimes of more than 1 million euros would automatically land an offender in jail .
zumwinkel was originally accused of hiding 1.2 million euros , but the court in bochum announced it would only bring charges on activities since 2002 , meaning the sum involved came in just under the one-million euro mark .
liechtenstein under scrutiny germany reportedly paid 4.5 million euros for the dvd .
the brouhaha also caused britain and the united states to launch their own investigations .
it also brought liechtenstein and other tax havens under heavy international criticism .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck vowed to " to put the screws " on liechtenstein , while chancellor angela merkel threatened to isolate it from the rest of europe unless it cooperated on ending banking secrecy .
liechtenstein is considered an " un-cooperative tax haven " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , that it was providing 58 million euros -lrb- $ 74.3 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid to vulnerable palestinians this year . in a statement , eu aid commissioner louis michel said around 32 million euros would be earmarked for gaza , which suffered massive damage during a three-week bombing campaign by israel .
an additional 20 million euros are to go to the west bank , with the remaining six million destined for palestinian refugees in lebanon .
" this funding package of 58 million euros will contribute substantially to the international effort on behalf of these suffering people and will also sustain our ongoing solidarity with the entire palestinian population , " michel said .
calling the situation in gaza " catastrophic , " he said the strip 's civilian population of nearly 1.5 million had faced " terrible and unprecedented " suffering compared to past times of violence in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
" destruction on such a massive scale saddens me deeply , " michel said during a fact-finding visit to the gaza strip .
eu commissioner distributes responsibility equally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's michel blamed israel and hamas equally michel sharply criticized israel for the massive destruction he saw around him , but said also hamas bore an " overwhelming " part of the blame .
" we have to also recall the overwhelming responsibility of hamas , " michel told local reporters as he toured jabaliya , a crowded refugee camp north of gaza city which was hit hard in israel 's 22-day offensive .
" firing rockets at civilians is a terrorist action , " he said .
" i intentionally say this here , hamas is a terrorist movement and it has to be denounced as such , " he said .
he earlier strongly condemned israel for its destruction of the civilian infrastructure , as he inspected buildings in gaza destroyed in the israeli assault , including an ice-cream , a cookie and a soft-drink factory .
he said the destruction pointed at an obvious violation of international humanitarian law .
but the 61-year-old belgian , normally known as a staunch critic of israel , added that for progress in the peace process to be possible , hamas had to accept two " small conditions " - recognize israel 's right to exist and to abandon armed struggle .
eu offering to help stop smuggling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to help stop hamas rearming after the war meanwhile , eu foreign ministers met in brussels to discuss ways of helping israel counter arms smuggling destined for hamas into the gaza strip and ensure that the fragile ceasefire between israel and hamas holds .
ministers were expected to call on hamas to halt its rocket launches , ask israel to reopen border crossings into gaza and discuss an " effective mechanism to prevent the smuggling of arms and ammunition " to the strip , diplomats said .
france on friday announced that it was dispatching a helicopter- carrying frigate to the gaza coast , while britain has said its royal navy would also be prepared to help .
meanwhile , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in brussels that his country would send five experts with special equipment to help egypt uncover the tunnels allegedly used to smuggle arms into gaza .
however , egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit said in brussels late sunday that most of the arms smuggling was taking place by sea and not through his territory .
abul gheit was attending talks with eu foreign ministers and counterparts from the palestinian authority , turkey , jordan and norway as part of a diplomatic push by the eu to make its voice heard in the region .
on wednesday , eu diplomats held separate talks with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni , who insisted on the need to stop weapons being smuggled into the strip .
eu foreign-policy chief javier solana has also offered to redeploy monitors which used to patrol the rafah crossing between 2005 and 2007 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , that it was providing 58 million euros -lrb- $ 74.3 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid to vulnerable palestinians this year . in a statement , eu aid commissioner louis michel said around 32 million euros would be earmarked for gaza , which suffered massive damage during a three-week bombing campaign by israel .
an additional 20 million euros are to go to the west bank , with the remaining six million destined for palestinian refugees in lebanon .
" this funding package of 58 million euros will contribute substantially to the international effort on behalf of these suffering people and will also sustain our ongoing solidarity with the entire palestinian population , " michel said .
calling the situation in gaza " catastrophic , " he said the strip 's civilian population of nearly 1.5 million had faced " terrible and unprecedented " suffering compared to past times of violence in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
" destruction on such a massive scale saddens me deeply , " michel said during a fact-finding visit to the gaza strip .
eu commissioner distributes responsibility equally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's michel blamed israel and hamas equally michel sharply criticized israel for the massive destruction he saw around him , but said also hamas bore an " overwhelming " part of the blame .
" we have to also recall the overwhelming responsibility of hamas , " michel told local reporters as he toured jabaliya , a crowded refugee camp north of gaza city which was hit hard in israel 's 22-day offensive .
" firing rockets at civilians is a terrorist action , " he said .
" i intentionally say this here , hamas is a terrorist movement and it has to be denounced as such , " he said .
he earlier strongly condemned israel for its destruction of the civilian infrastructure , as he inspected buildings in gaza destroyed in the israeli assault , including an ice-cream , a cookie and a soft-drink factory .
he said the destruction pointed at an obvious violation of international humanitarian law .
but the 61-year-old belgian , normally known as a staunch critic of israel , added that for progress in the peace process to be possible , hamas had to accept two " small conditions " - recognize israel 's right to exist and to abandon armed struggle .
eu offering to help stop smuggling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to help stop hamas rearming after the war meanwhile , eu foreign ministers met in brussels to discuss ways of helping israel counter arms smuggling destined for hamas into the gaza strip and ensure that the fragile ceasefire between israel and hamas holds .
ministers were expected to call on hamas to halt its rocket launches , ask israel to reopen border crossings into gaza and discuss an " effective mechanism to prevent the smuggling of arms and ammunition " to the strip , diplomats said .
france on friday announced that it was dispatching a helicopter- carrying frigate to the gaza coast , while britain has said its royal navy would also be prepared to help .
meanwhile , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in brussels that his country would send five experts with special equipment to help egypt uncover the tunnels allegedly used to smuggle arms into gaza .
however , egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit said in brussels late sunday that most of the arms smuggling was taking place by sea and not through his territory .
abul gheit was attending talks with eu foreign ministers and counterparts from the palestinian authority , turkey , jordan and norway as part of a diplomatic push by the eu to make its voice heard in the region .
on wednesday , eu diplomats held separate talks with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni , who insisted on the need to stop weapons being smuggled into the strip .
eu foreign-policy chief javier solana has also offered to redeploy monitors which used to patrol the rafah crossing between 2005 and 2007 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu commissioner distributes responsibility equally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's michel blamed israel and hamas equally michel sharply criticized israel for the massive destruction he saw around him , but said also hamas bore an " overwhelming " part of the blame .
" we have to also recall the overwhelming responsibility of hamas , " michel told local reporters as he toured jabaliya , a crowded refugee camp north of gaza city which was hit hard in israel 's 22-day offensive .
" firing rockets at civilians is a terrorist action , " he said .
" i intentionally say this here , hamas is a terrorist movement and it has to be denounced as such , " he said .
he earlier strongly condemned israel for its destruction of the civilian infrastructure , as he inspected buildings in gaza destroyed in the israeli assault , including an ice-cream , a cookie and a soft-drink factory .
he said the destruction pointed at an obvious violation of international humanitarian law .
but the 61-year-old belgian , normally known as a staunch critic of israel , added that for progress in the peace process to be possible , hamas had to accept two " small conditions " - recognize israel 's right to exist and to abandon armed struggle .
eu offering to help stop smuggling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to help stop hamas rearming after the war meanwhile , eu foreign ministers met in brussels to discuss ways of helping israel counter arms smuggling destined for hamas into the gaza strip and ensure that the fragile ceasefire between israel and hamas holds .
ministers were expected to call on hamas to halt its rocket launches , ask israel to reopen border crossings into gaza and discuss an " effective mechanism to prevent the smuggling of arms and ammunition " to the strip , diplomats said .
france on friday announced that it was dispatching a helicopter- carrying frigate to the gaza coast , while britain has said its royal navy would also be prepared to help .
meanwhile , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in brussels that his country would send five experts with special equipment to help egypt uncover the tunnels allegedly used to smuggle arms into gaza .
however , egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit said in brussels late sunday that most of the arms smuggling was taking place by sea and not through his territory .
abul gheit was attending talks with eu foreign ministers and counterparts from the palestinian authority , turkey , jordan and norway as part of a diplomatic push by the eu to make its voice heard in the region .
on wednesday , eu diplomats held separate talks with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni , who insisted on the need to stop weapons being smuggled into the strip .
eu foreign-policy chief javier solana has also offered to redeploy monitors which used to patrol the rafah crossing between 2005 and 2007 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the most integrated group in germany , according to the berlin institute , is immigrants from other eu countries who score 5.5 on the institute 's index .
the report 's assessment is based on results from several criteria including education , assimilation into society and employment to make up its index .
turks failing in education , assimilation and employment areas in the area of education , the study shows that 30 percent of students of turkish origin do not have a school leaving certificate and only 14 percent pass their final secondary school examinations .
in the state of saarland , 45 percent of turkish immigrants have failed to complete their high school education .
in terms of assimilation into society , turkish immigrants are marked down due to the fact that less than a third of turks born in germany have chosen to obtain german citizenship and 93 percent have married within the turkish community .
unemployment among turkish immigrants is high and many survive on state benefits while the reports shows a large number of turkish women remain in the home to manage the family .

" if we play consistently from the first match onwards then we will become german champions and will go a long way in the champions league , " klinsmann said in an interview with the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- website published on monday .
" if every player gives it all he has and contributes to the team we will win a title or two .
the team plays faster and more attractive football -lrb- than last season -rrb- and we believe that it can do even better .
the buildup gives us reason for hope . "
title holders bayern are tied on points with league leaders hoffenheim as the second half of the season opens this week .
munich visit vfb stuttgart for a german cup tie on tuesday and open bundesliga action on friday night at third-placed sv hamburg .
their next champions league date is a knock-out round tie in february with portugal 's sporting lisbon , with the club seeking to recapture europe 's top prize it last won in 2001 .
klinsmann said he did n't mind such tough domestic tests after the seven-week hibernation period .
" of course things could be easier but such games are a good indicator because we will know where we stand .
i am convinced that we can have a successful start if all players are fit . "
munich had a stuttering start into the season but improved in the final weeks before the winter break .
klinsmann confident despite podolski departure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery has been an inspiration since joining bayern looking at the team led by french star franck ribery , klinsmann expressed his disappointment with germany forward lukas podolski who returns to cologne in summer after never being able to challenge first-choice players luca toni and miroslav klose .
" it 's a fact that lukas could n't deal with the situation in munich of being the forward number three , " said klinsmann , who nonetheless expressed his hope that podolski will regain his form in cologne .
the former germany coach klinsmann recharged his batteries during a two-week family holiday in california as he admitted his first months as club coach had been very demanding .
" it was very intense .
the life of a club coach is very different to that of a national team coach .
but i can say after half a year that my decision to go to munich was the right one , " he said .
it could be worse .
klinsmann could be coach at werder bremen .
after starting the season in barn-storming form , the northern german team have slipped down to eighth in the league , embroiled in scandals and arguments involving former squeaky-clean star diego .
they now face a lawsuit by former player ivan klasnic .
legal action over kidneys klasnic is to sue two doctors at bremen over his treatment for kidney problems that eventually led to two organ transplants , the news magazine der spiegel reported monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bremen favorite klasnic is suing the club the striker , who joined french side nantes this season , underwent two kidney transplant operations in early 2007 while still at bremen and accuses the club 's doctors of negligent treatment and medical mistakes .
the doctors reject the allegations .
according to the report , made available ahead of publication , attempts in the previous nine months to reach an out-of-court settlement have failed .
the 28-year-old forward is now looking for two million euros -lrb- $ 2.6 million -rrb- in compensation with the case due to be heard in a bremen court on april 17 .
croatian international klasnic scored 49 league goals for bremen between 2001 and 2007 for bremen as well as netting 20 times in the champions league .
diego gets club backing meanwhile bremen seem to be maintaining their patience with unsettled brazilian diego .
this season the modest 23-year-old playmaker has been finding himself increasingly in the headlines for reasons which have often had little to do with his prowess on the field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego ran out on bremen for the beijing olympics right at the beginning of the season diego ruffled a few bremen feathers by insisting on playing for brazil at the olympics in beijing , much against the will of the club who wanted him back for the bundesliga start .
there then followed some late training appearances and a loss of control on the pitch in december when he grabbed a karlsruhe player around the neck - an act which earned him a hefty club fine and sees him banned for four matches up to february 21 .
much has also been made in the german tabloid press of an alleged affair with pop singer sarah connor , although the player says the two are " just good friends . "
then last week began with headlines of a police car chase , with diego made to take a breathalyser test in bremen .
brazilian faces ban bremen sports director klaus allofs says the incident should not be blown out of proportion .
" diego is sorry .
he knows that he committed an offense and will have to live with the consequences that the test brings with it .
i do n't know if he will receive a driving ban or a fine , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's new wayward image comes with a ruffled look diego said he had to take a breath test , but denied reports of a car chase or that he drove through a red light .
" i came to a police control stop where i followed the orders of the authorities .
i was a bit shocked that there were three cars with blue lights flashing .
but the policemen were very nice to me , " he said .
german media reports said diego was over the legal alcohol limit of 50 milligrams of alcohol per liter of blood and could lose his driving license for a month , although diego insists he was not intoxicated , but had just had some wine .
allofs said : " he made a mistake in a part of his private life from which he will learn .
we were not pleased about the headlines and we discouraged his behavior .
but that has nothing to do with the debate about discipline within the team .
allofs says the recent negative headlines were also to do with the increased media attention in bremen , especially since diego 's liaison with sarah connor has put him in the paparazzi 's focus .
" nevertheless , our players naturally have a function as a role model , " he said .
" and fundamentally , this should apply to everyone , even for diego : stay away from driving after enjoying alcohol . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

former deutsche post head klaus zumwinkel will face a 1 million euro fine , but will avoid jail time . zumwinkel , 65 , confessed last week to using a liechtenstein bank to evade 966,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in taxes .
on monday , jan .
26 , a court found him guilty and handed down a two year suspended sentence and a fine of just under 1 million euros .
zumwinkel 's arrest for tax evasion in 2008 sent shockwaves through germany 's close-knit business world .
authorities made an example of zumwinkel , leading him out of his posh villa near cologne as television cameras rolled .
arrest rattled german tax scofflaws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel 's arrest caused many others to turn themselves in zumwinkel was one of hundreds of wealthy germans executives , sports stars and entertainers exposed when a liechtenstein bank employee betrayed them by selling a stolen dvd with details of their accounts to germany 's foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
since then , german prosecutors have recovered more than 150 million euros -lrb- $ 194 million -rrb- from taxpayers hoping to avoid being taken to trial .
german tax authorities believe that more than 4 billion euros was being hidden in liechtenstein .
prosecutors said zumwinkel concealed money in trust funds managed by the ltg bank in liechtenstein .
he set up a trust fund for himself in liechtenstein in 1986 with money he inherited , but failed to disclose earnings and dividends from it to german tax authorities , as required by law .
zumwinkel fell hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leichtenstein is a favorite tax haven released on bail after a search of his villa , zumwinkel resigned shortly afterwards as head of deutsche post , one of the world 's leading logistics companies with a global workforce of more than 350,000 .
later , he stepped down from positions on the boards of other leading german companies such as deutsche telekom , lufthansa and retailer arcandor .
zumwinkel , named manager magazine 's 2003 " executive of the year " for his work at transforming deutsche post from a bloated state monopoly into one of the world 's largest logistics companies , admitted that he had made the " biggest mistake of my life . "
" i am not going to beat around the bush : i am guilty of what i am accused of , " zumwinkel told the court on the trial 's first day .
" my career had a bitter end .
my job was my life . "
zumwinkel barely avoided jail .
in december , the federal court of justice ruled that tax crimes of more than 1 million euros would automatically land an offender in jail .
zumwinkel was originally accused of hiding 1.2 million euros , but the court in bochum announced it would only bring charges on activities since 2002 , meaning the sum involved came in just under the one-million euro mark .
liechtenstein under scrutiny germany reportedly paid 4.5 million euros for the dvd .
the brouhaha also caused britain and the united states to launch their own investigations .
it also brought liechtenstein and other tax havens under heavy international criticism .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck vowed to " to put the screws " on liechtenstein , while chancellor angela merkel threatened to isolate it from the rest of europe unless it cooperated on ending banking secrecy .
liechtenstein is considered an " un-cooperative tax haven " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if we play consistently from the first match onwards then we will become german champions and will go a long way in the champions league , " klinsmann said in an interview with the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- website published on monday .
" if every player gives it all he has and contributes to the team we will win a title or two .
the team plays faster and more attractive football -lrb- than last season -rrb- and we believe that it can do even better .
the buildup gives us reason for hope . "
title holders bayern are tied on points with league leaders hoffenheim as the second half of the season opens this week .
munich visit vfb stuttgart for a german cup tie on tuesday and open bundesliga action on friday night at third-placed sv hamburg .
their next champions league date is a knock-out round tie in february with portugal 's sporting lisbon , with the club seeking to recapture europe 's top prize it last won in 2001 .
klinsmann said he did n't mind such tough domestic tests after the seven-week hibernation period .
" of course things could be easier but such games are a good indicator because we will know where we stand .
i am convinced that we can have a successful start if all players are fit . "
munich had a stuttering start into the season but improved in the final weeks before the winter break .
klinsmann confident despite podolski departure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery has been an inspiration since joining bayern looking at the team led by french star franck ribery , klinsmann expressed his disappointment with germany forward lukas podolski who returns to cologne in summer after never being able to challenge first-choice players luca toni and miroslav klose .
" it 's a fact that lukas could n't deal with the situation in munich of being the forward number three , " said klinsmann , who nonetheless expressed his hope that podolski will regain his form in cologne .
the former germany coach klinsmann recharged his batteries during a two-week family holiday in california as he admitted his first months as club coach had been very demanding .
" it was very intense .
the life of a club coach is very different to that of a national team coach .
but i can say after half a year that my decision to go to munich was the right one , " he said .
it could be worse .
klinsmann could be coach at werder bremen .
after starting the season in barn-storming form , the northern german team have slipped down to eighth in the league , embroiled in scandals and arguments involving former squeaky-clean star diego .
they now face a lawsuit by former player ivan klasnic .
legal action over kidneys klasnic is to sue two doctors at bremen over his treatment for kidney problems that eventually led to two organ transplants , the news magazine der spiegel reported monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bremen favorite klasnic is suing the club the striker , who joined french side nantes this season , underwent two kidney transplant operations in early 2007 while still at bremen and accuses the club 's doctors of negligent treatment and medical mistakes .
the doctors reject the allegations .
according to the report , made available ahead of publication , attempts in the previous nine months to reach an out-of-court settlement have failed .
the 28-year-old forward is now looking for two million euros -lrb- $ 2.6 million -rrb- in compensation with the case due to be heard in a bremen court on april 17 .
croatian international klasnic scored 49 league goals for bremen between 2001 and 2007 for bremen as well as netting 20 times in the champions league .
diego gets club backing meanwhile bremen seem to be maintaining their patience with unsettled brazilian diego .
this season the modest 23-year-old playmaker has been finding himself increasingly in the headlines for reasons which have often had little to do with his prowess on the field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego ran out on bremen for the beijing olympics right at the beginning of the season diego ruffled a few bremen feathers by insisting on playing for brazil at the olympics in beijing , much against the will of the club who wanted him back for the bundesliga start .
there then followed some late training appearances and a loss of control on the pitch in december when he grabbed a karlsruhe player around the neck - an act which earned him a hefty club fine and sees him banned for four matches up to february 21 .
much has also been made in the german tabloid press of an alleged affair with pop singer sarah connor , although the player says the two are " just good friends . "
then last week began with headlines of a police car chase , with diego made to take a breathalyser test in bremen .
brazilian faces ban bremen sports director klaus allofs says the incident should not be blown out of proportion .
" diego is sorry .
he knows that he committed an offense and will have to live with the consequences that the test brings with it .
i do n't know if he will receive a driving ban or a fine , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's new wayward image comes with a ruffled look diego said he had to take a breath test , but denied reports of a car chase or that he drove through a red light .
" i came to a police control stop where i followed the orders of the authorities .
i was a bit shocked that there were three cars with blue lights flashing .
but the policemen were very nice to me , " he said .
german media reports said diego was over the legal alcohol limit of 50 milligrams of alcohol per liter of blood and could lose his driving license for a month , although diego insists he was not intoxicated , but had just had some wine .
allofs said : " he made a mistake in a part of his private life from which he will learn .
we were not pleased about the headlines and we discouraged his behavior .
but that has nothing to do with the debate about discipline within the team .
allofs says the recent negative headlines were also to do with the increased media attention in bremen , especially since diego 's liaison with sarah connor has put him in the paparazzi 's focus .
" nevertheless , our players naturally have a function as a role model , " he said .
" and fundamentally , this should apply to everyone , even for diego : stay away from driving after enjoying alcohol . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gaza and guantanamo are also high on the agenda of europe 's foreign ministers . european union foreign ministers extended a travel ban and asset freeze on around 60 people and companies allied to mugabe on monday , jan .
26 .
the ministers also expressed concern over the cholera outbreak ravaging the country , saying that it viewed the humanitarian situation in zimbabwe with " particular distress . "
and they called for closer international cooperation to bring about democratic change in zimbabwe and to crack down on the flow of illicitly-traded diamonds which provides mugabe 's regime with a financial lifeline .
differences remain on guantanamo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is under pressure to accept former guantanamo detainees it 's been a busy few days for european union foreign ministers , who are also grappling on whether to offer a home to released guantanamo detainees who might face abuse if sent back to their country of origin .
the eu has said it will consider taking the detainees , but will leave the final decision up to individual member countries .
the eu has long called for the closure of the detention center in guantanamo bay , cuba , and welcomed the decision by new us president barack obama to prepare the jail 's closure on his first day in office .
" we have not received any demand from our american friends .
this is an american problem that they have to solve , but we will be ready to help if necessary , " the eu 's top foreign policy official , javier solana , said .
so far , portugal is the only eu member state which has said clearly that it will take in former detainees .
germany has welcomed obama 's promise to close the camp , but is still debating whether to take any of the prisoners .
britain , which has already taken in 12 , has said that it will not take in more .
ministers urge united palestine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 4,000 palestinian homes were destroyed in the fighting over the weekend , the eu 's foreign ministers met with palestinians to try and lay the groundwork for a lasting peace in the region .
eu ministers said they want to see hamas and the palestinian authority to forge a consensus government that will re-open border crossings and restart a middle east peace process .
european leaders hosted palestinian , egyptian , jordanian and turkish officials on sunday , jan .
25 , in brussels .
europe hosted israel 's foreign minister tzipi livni last week and will send solana to the middle east on monday in a bid to bolster the gaza ceasefire .
" it is time for the palestinians to start talking to each other , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt said .
" if we ca n't overcome the division in the palestinian society , it will be very difficult to move forward both with gaza and the peace process . "
israel launched an attack against hamas militants in the gaza strip on dec .
27 which lasted 22 days , killing more than 1,300 palestinians and wounded some 5,000 others .
more than 4,000 homes were destroyed and 17,000 damaged .
the assault 's goal was to stop hamas militants from firing rockets at israeli civilians .

" if we play consistently from the first match onwards then we will become german champions and will go a long way in the champions league , " klinsmann said in an interview with the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- website published on monday .
" if every player gives it all he has and contributes to the team we will win a title or two .
the team plays faster and more attractive football -lrb- than last season -rrb- and we believe that it can do even better .
the buildup gives us reason for hope . "
title holders bayern are tied on points with league leaders hoffenheim as the second half of the season opens this week .
munich visit vfb stuttgart for a german cup tie on tuesday and open bundesliga action on friday night at third-placed sv hamburg .
their next champions league date is a knock-out round tie in february with portugal 's sporting lisbon , with the club seeking to recapture europe 's top prize it last won in 2001 .
klinsmann said he did n't mind such tough domestic tests after the seven-week hibernation period .
" of course things could be easier but such games are a good indicator because we will know where we stand .
i am convinced that we can have a successful start if all players are fit . "
munich had a stuttering start into the season but improved in the final weeks before the winter break .
klinsmann confident despite podolski departure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery has been an inspiration since joining bayern looking at the team led by french star franck ribery , klinsmann expressed his disappointment with germany forward lukas podolski who returns to cologne in summer after never being able to challenge first-choice players luca toni and miroslav klose .
" it 's a fact that lukas could n't deal with the situation in munich of being the forward number three , " said klinsmann , who nonetheless expressed his hope that podolski will regain his form in cologne .
the former germany coach klinsmann recharged his batteries during a two-week family holiday in california as he admitted his first months as club coach had been very demanding .
" it was very intense .
the life of a club coach is very different to that of a national team coach .
but i can say after half a year that my decision to go to munich was the right one , " he said .
it could be worse .
klinsmann could be coach at werder bremen .
after starting the season in barn-storming form , the northern german team have slipped down to eighth in the league , embroiled in scandals and arguments involving former squeaky-clean star diego .
they now face a lawsuit by former player ivan klasnic .
legal action over kidneys klasnic is to sue two doctors at bremen over his treatment for kidney problems that eventually led to two organ transplants , the news magazine der spiegel reported monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bremen favorite klasnic is suing the club the striker , who joined french side nantes this season , underwent two kidney transplant operations in early 2007 while still at bremen and accuses the club 's doctors of negligent treatment and medical mistakes .
the doctors reject the allegations .
according to the report , made available ahead of publication , attempts in the previous nine months to reach an out-of-court settlement have failed .
the 28-year-old forward is now looking for two million euros -lrb- $ 2.6 million -rrb- in compensation with the case due to be heard in a bremen court on april 17 .
croatian international klasnic scored 49 league goals for bremen between 2001 and 2007 for bremen as well as netting 20 times in the champions league .
diego gets club backing meanwhile bremen seem to be maintaining their patience with unsettled brazilian diego .
this season the modest 23-year-old playmaker has been finding himself increasingly in the headlines for reasons which have often had little to do with his prowess on the field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego ran out on bremen for the beijing olympics right at the beginning of the season diego ruffled a few bremen feathers by insisting on playing for brazil at the olympics in beijing , much against the will of the club who wanted him back for the bundesliga start .
there then followed some late training appearances and a loss of control on the pitch in december when he grabbed a karlsruhe player around the neck - an act which earned him a hefty club fine and sees him banned for four matches up to february 21 .
much has also been made in the german tabloid press of an alleged affair with pop singer sarah connor , although the player says the two are " just good friends . "
then last week began with headlines of a police car chase , with diego made to take a breathalyser test in bremen .
brazilian faces ban bremen sports director klaus allofs says the incident should not be blown out of proportion .
" diego is sorry .
he knows that he committed an offense and will have to live with the consequences that the test brings with it .
i do n't know if he will receive a driving ban or a fine , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's new wayward image comes with a ruffled look diego said he had to take a breath test , but denied reports of a car chase or that he drove through a red light .
" i came to a police control stop where i followed the orders of the authorities .
i was a bit shocked that there were three cars with blue lights flashing .
but the policemen were very nice to me , " he said .
german media reports said diego was over the legal alcohol limit of 50 milligrams of alcohol per liter of blood and could lose his driving license for a month , although diego insists he was not intoxicated , but had just had some wine .
allofs said : " he made a mistake in a part of his private life from which he will learn .
we were not pleased about the headlines and we discouraged his behavior .
but that has nothing to do with the debate about discipline within the team .
allofs says the recent negative headlines were also to do with the increased media attention in bremen , especially since diego 's liaison with sarah connor has put him in the paparazzi 's focus .
" nevertheless , our players naturally have a function as a role model , " he said .
" and fundamentally , this should apply to everyone , even for diego : stay away from driving after enjoying alcohol . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it 's a fact that lukas could n't deal with the situation in munich of being the forward number three , " said klinsmann , who nonetheless expressed his hope that podolski will regain his form in cologne .
the former germany coach klinsmann recharged his batteries during a two-week family holiday in california as he admitted his first months as club coach had been very demanding .
" it was very intense .
the life of a club coach is very different to that of a national team coach .
but i can say after half a year that my decision to go to munich was the right one , " he said .
it could be worse .
klinsmann could be coach at werder bremen .
after starting the season in barn-storming form , the northern german team have slipped down to eighth in the league , embroiled in scandals and arguments involving former squeaky-clean star diego .
they now face a lawsuit by former player ivan klasnic .
legal action over kidneys klasnic is to sue two doctors at bremen over his treatment for kidney problems that eventually led to two organ transplants , the news magazine der spiegel reported monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bremen favorite klasnic is suing the club the striker , who joined french side nantes this season , underwent two kidney transplant operations in early 2007 while still at bremen and accuses the club 's doctors of negligent treatment and medical mistakes .
the doctors reject the allegations .
according to the report , made available ahead of publication , attempts in the previous nine months to reach an out-of-court settlement have failed .
the 28-year-old forward is now looking for two million euros -lrb- $ 2.6 million -rrb- in compensation with the case due to be heard in a bremen court on april 17 .
croatian international klasnic scored 49 league goals for bremen between 2001 and 2007 for bremen as well as netting 20 times in the champions league .
diego gets club backing meanwhile bremen seem to be maintaining their patience with unsettled brazilian diego .
this season the modest 23-year-old playmaker has been finding himself increasingly in the headlines for reasons which have often had little to do with his prowess on the field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego ran out on bremen for the beijing olympics right at the beginning of the season diego ruffled a few bremen feathers by insisting on playing for brazil at the olympics in beijing , much against the will of the club who wanted him back for the bundesliga start .
there then followed some late training appearances and a loss of control on the pitch in december when he grabbed a karlsruhe player around the neck - an act which earned him a hefty club fine and sees him banned for four matches up to february 21 .
much has also been made in the german tabloid press of an alleged affair with pop singer sarah connor , although the player says the two are " just good friends . "
then last week began with headlines of a police car chase , with diego made to take a breathalyser test in bremen .
brazilian faces ban bremen sports director klaus allofs says the incident should not be blown out of proportion .
" diego is sorry .
he knows that he committed an offense and will have to live with the consequences that the test brings with it .
i do n't know if he will receive a driving ban or a fine , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's new wayward image comes with a ruffled look diego said he had to take a breath test , but denied reports of a car chase or that he drove through a red light .
" i came to a police control stop where i followed the orders of the authorities .
i was a bit shocked that there were three cars with blue lights flashing .
but the policemen were very nice to me , " he said .
german media reports said diego was over the legal alcohol limit of 50 milligrams of alcohol per liter of blood and could lose his driving license for a month , although diego insists he was not intoxicated , but had just had some wine .
allofs said : " he made a mistake in a part of his private life from which he will learn .
we were not pleased about the headlines and we discouraged his behavior .
but that has nothing to do with the debate about discipline within the team .
allofs says the recent negative headlines were also to do with the increased media attention in bremen , especially since diego 's liaison with sarah connor has put him in the paparazzi 's focus .
" nevertheless , our players naturally have a function as a role model , " he said .
" and fundamentally , this should apply to everyone , even for diego : stay away from driving after enjoying alcohol . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gaza and guantanamo are also high on the agenda of europe 's foreign ministers . european union foreign ministers extended a travel ban and asset freeze on around 60 people and companies allied to mugabe on monday , jan .
26 .
the ministers also expressed concern over the cholera outbreak ravaging the country , saying that it viewed the humanitarian situation in zimbabwe with " particular distress . "
and they called for closer international cooperation to bring about democratic change in zimbabwe and to crack down on the flow of illicitly-traded diamonds which provides mugabe 's regime with a financial lifeline .
differences remain on guantanamo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is under pressure to accept former guantanamo detainees it 's been a busy few days for european union foreign ministers , who are also grappling on whether to offer a home to released guantanamo detainees who might face abuse if sent back to their country of origin .
the eu has said it will consider taking the detainees , but will leave the final decision up to individual member countries .
the eu has long called for the closure of the detention center in guantanamo bay , cuba , and welcomed the decision by new us president barack obama to prepare the jail 's closure on his first day in office .
" we have not received any demand from our american friends .
this is an american problem that they have to solve , but we will be ready to help if necessary , " the eu 's top foreign policy official , javier solana , said .
so far , portugal is the only eu member state which has said clearly that it will take in former detainees .

britain , which has already taken in 12 , has said that it will not take in more .
ministers urge united palestine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 4,000 palestinian homes were destroyed in the fighting over the weekend , the eu 's foreign ministers met with palestinians to try and lay the groundwork for a lasting peace in the region .
eu ministers said they want to see hamas and the palestinian authority to forge a consensus government that will re-open border crossings and restart a middle east peace process .
european leaders hosted palestinian , egyptian , jordanian and turkish officials on sunday , jan .
25 , in brussels .
europe hosted israel 's foreign minister tzipi livni last week and will send solana to the middle east on monday in a bid to bolster the gaza ceasefire .
" it is time for the palestinians to start talking to each other , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt said .
" if we ca n't overcome the division in the palestinian society , it will be very difficult to move forward both with gaza and the peace process . "
israel launched an attack against hamas militants in the gaza strip on dec .
27 which lasted 22 days , killing more than 1,300 palestinians and wounded some 5,000 others .
more than 4,000 homes were destroyed and 17,000 damaged .
the assault 's goal was to stop hamas militants from firing rockets at israeli civilians .
hamas " essential to peace process " though the eu lists hamas as a terrorist organization , some eu ministers say no peace can be achieved in the middle east unless hamas - which governs the gaza strip - is also brought into the equation .
europeans are concerned about the divisions between hamas and the more moderate palestinian authority of mahmoud abbas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel is concerned about weapons smuggling into gaza " the reunification of the palestinian people with a single voice to speak to them , to speak for the west bank and for gaza is absolutely essential , " british foreign secretary david miliband told reporters .

in the past , hamas has smuggled arms through a network of tunnels under the gaza border with egypt .
israel claims are moving into the territory from iran .
on sunday egypt closed its rafah crossing point with gaza , fearing that israel may renew its attacks on underground passage ways .
yet european leaders were undaunted by the defiant stand from hamas .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 26.01.2009 german government to crack down on business with iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's status as a major exporter to iran is under threat germany is set to crack down on export credit guarantees to german firms seeking to do business with iran and will only approve them in exceptional cases , according to a report published monday . the article in the german business newspaper handelsblatt cited government and industry sources as saying that chancellor angela merkel had responded to criticism from germany 's partners , including the united states and israel , about the continued strength of german exports to iran despite a tightening of western sanctions over its nuclear program . german firms receive " hermes cover " export credit guarantees when selling goods to markets considered risky .
but according to the report , merkel has instructed the economics ministry to put the brakes on this practice after statistics showed that exports had risen 10.5 percent on an annual basis to 3.58 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.63 billion -rrb- through november 2008 .
some 75 percent of all medium and small businesses in iran use german-made equipment . business and banking trade elements are not specifically forbidden under un security council sanctions , which only limit the sale of technology that could be used in the weapons industry . merkel has repeatedly insisted that germany is only obliged to obey the un sanctions and said earlier this month that germany was not planning to undertake any further unilateral action against iran at this time .
but pressure from within the western powers working towards a nuclear-free iran may have persuaded her otherwise . germany has also come under fire from sections of the us media for its policy towards trade with iran .
a recent commentary by editorial writer dan schwammenthal in the wall street journal was titled : " germany loves iran . "
schwammenthal wrote that germany was less worried about an iranian nuclear bomb than it was about tightening sanctions that could negatively affect trade between the two countries . as the new us administration under president barack obama prepares to break with the previous administration and talk with iran about its nuclear program , germany now appears more comfortable with applying more pressure of its own . germany steps up restrictions on trade guarantees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's move increases the pressure on german firms the announcement to issue trade guarantees only in exceptional cases is actually the next logical step in a policy germany has been executing in increments ever since the nuclear stand-off between the west and iran began . germany , traditionally one of the top exporters to iran , has been gradually reducing the numbers of export guarantees for the past three years . german businesses have seen a significant fall in export guarantees for trade with the islamic republic since last year .
the economics ministry said a year ago that new guarantees for iran fell to 503.4 million euros in 2007 from 1.16 billion in 2006 . half-year numbers for last year show a sharp decline in new guarantees to 73.4 million euros , compared to 387 million in the first half of 2007 with full figures for 2008 to be published in the coming weeks . western powers believe iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons under the cover of a civilian atomic program .
tehran says it wants to master nuclear technology for peaceful power generation purposes . reports in recent weeks have said european countries , including britain , france and germany , could seek to pass new sanctions against iran , which has rejected repeated calls from the u.n. security council for it to suspend uranium enrichment . germany 's decision to limit its trade guarantees could herald the start of a new set of restrictions on iran by western powers . eu removes iranian organization from terror list in other developments , european union foreign ministers removed the people 's mujahedin of iran -lrb- pmoi -rrb- from their list of terrorist organizations on monday , despite public protests in tehran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pmoi 's case has been heard before but ignored the widely expected move follows a ruling by the european court in luxembourg , which in december said the eu was wrong to keep the pmoi 's assets frozen after it was taken off a british list of terrorist organizations . " what we are doing today is abiding by the resolution of the european court .
there 's nothing we can do about that resolution , " eu foreign-policy chief javier solana said . founded in 1965 , the pmoi operated a military wing in its early years , but says it renounced violence in june 2001 and now advocates the political overthrow of iran 's current government . reports of the eu 's planned decision prompted street protests outside eu embassies in tehran over the weekend by hundreds of iranian students and relatives of veterans of the iran-iraq war -lrb- 1980-88 -rrb- . iran regards pmoi as a terrorist group owing to its involvement in the assassinations of several high-ranking iranian officials , including the president and prime minister in 1980 . after the group was expelled from france in the 1980s , former iraqi president saddam hussein allocated a military base to the pmoi near the border with iran . before the ouster of saddam , the pmoi frequently infiltrated iranian territory , leading to clashes with iranian forces and casualties on both sides . solana said the eu decision could only be reversed if new evidence against the pmoi was presented to the european courts . " if there is something new that may be presented in front of the court , we 'll see , " solana said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but according to the report , merkel has instructed the economics ministry to put the brakes on this practice after statistics showed that exports had risen 10.5 percent on an annual basis to 3.58 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.63 billion -rrb- through november 2008 .
some 75 percent of all medium and small businesses in iran use german-made equipment . business and banking trade elements are not specifically forbidden under un security council sanctions , which only limit the sale of technology that could be used in the weapons industry . merkel has repeatedly insisted that germany is only obliged to obey the un sanctions and said earlier this month that germany was not planning to undertake any further unilateral action against iran at this time .

the economics ministry said a year ago that new guarantees for iran fell to 503.4 million euros in 2007 from 1.16 billion in 2006 . half-year numbers for last year show a sharp decline in new guarantees to 73.4 million euros , compared to 387 million in the first half of 2007 with full figures for 2008 to be published in the coming weeks . western powers believe iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons under the cover of a civilian atomic program .
tehran says it wants to master nuclear technology for peaceful power generation purposes . reports in recent weeks have said european countries , including britain , france and germany , could seek to pass new sanctions against iran , which has rejected repeated calls from the u.n. security council for it to suspend uranium enrichment . germany 's decision to limit its trade guarantees could herald the start of a new set of restrictions on iran by western powers . eu removes iranian organization from terror list in other developments , european union foreign ministers removed the people 's mujahedin of iran -lrb- pmoi -rrb- from their list of terrorist organizations on monday , despite public protests in tehran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pmoi 's case has been heard before but ignored the widely expected move follows a ruling by the european court in luxembourg , which in december said the eu was wrong to keep the pmoi 's assets frozen after it was taken off a british list of terrorist organizations .

but according to the report , merkel has instructed the economics ministry to put the brakes on this practice after statistics showed that exports had risen 10.5 percent on an annual basis to 3.58 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.63 billion -rrb- through november 2008 .
some 75 percent of all medium and small businesses in iran use german-made equipment . business and banking trade elements are not specifically forbidden under un security council sanctions , which only limit the sale of technology that could be used in the weapons industry . merkel has repeatedly insisted that germany is only obliged to obey the un sanctions and said earlier this month that germany was not planning to undertake any further unilateral action against iran at this time .
but pressure from within the western powers working towards a nuclear-free iran may have persuaded her otherwise . germany has also come under fire from sections of the us media for its policy towards trade with iran .
a recent commentary by editorial writer dan schwammenthal in the wall street journal was titled : " germany loves iran . "
schwammenthal wrote that germany was less worried about an iranian nuclear bomb than it was about tightening sanctions that could negatively affect trade between the two countries . as the new us administration under president barack obama prepares to break with the previous administration and talk with iran about its nuclear program , germany now appears more comfortable with applying more pressure of its own . germany steps up restrictions on trade guarantees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's move increases the pressure on german firms the announcement to issue trade guarantees only in exceptional cases is actually the next logical step in a policy germany has been executing in increments ever since the nuclear stand-off between the west and iran began . germany , traditionally one of the top exporters to iran , has been gradually reducing the numbers of export guarantees for the past three years . german businesses have seen a significant fall in export guarantees for trade with the islamic republic since last year .
the economics ministry said a year ago that new guarantees for iran fell to 503.4 million euros in 2007 from 1.16 billion in 2006 . half-year numbers for last year show a sharp decline in new guarantees to 73.4 million euros , compared to 387 million in the first half of 2007 with full figures for 2008 to be published in the coming weeks . western powers believe iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons under the cover of a civilian atomic program .
tehran says it wants to master nuclear technology for peaceful power generation purposes . reports in recent weeks have said european countries , including britain , france and germany , could seek to pass new sanctions against iran , which has rejected repeated calls from the u.n. security council for it to suspend uranium enrichment . germany 's decision to limit its trade guarantees could herald the start of a new set of restrictions on iran by western powers . eu removes iranian organization from terror list in other developments , european union foreign ministers removed the people 's mujahedin of iran -lrb- pmoi -rrb- from their list of terrorist organizations on monday , despite public protests in tehran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pmoi 's case has been heard before but ignored the widely expected move follows a ruling by the european court in luxembourg , which in december said the eu was wrong to keep the pmoi 's assets frozen after it was taken off a british list of terrorist organizations . " what we are doing today is abiding by the resolution of the european court .
there 's nothing we can do about that resolution , " eu foreign-policy chief javier solana said . founded in 1965 , the pmoi operated a military wing in its early years , but says it renounced violence in june 2001 and now advocates the political overthrow of iran 's current government . reports of the eu 's planned decision prompted street protests outside eu embassies in tehran over the weekend by hundreds of iranian students and relatives of veterans of the iran-iraq war -lrb- 1980-88 -rrb- . iran regards pmoi as a terrorist group owing to its involvement in the assassinations of several high-ranking iranian officials , including the president and prime minister in 1980 . after the group was expelled from france in the 1980s , former iraqi president saddam hussein allocated a military base to the pmoi near the border with iran . before the ouster of saddam , the pmoi frequently infiltrated iranian territory , leading to clashes with iranian forces and casualties on both sides . solana said the eu decision could only be reversed if new evidence against the pmoi was presented to the european courts . " if there is something new that may be presented in front of the court , we 'll see , " solana said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but will they succeed ? staging an event that has become known at least as much for its elaborate parties as for its deep debates in the middle of the worst economic crisis in recent memory is no small feat .
but the world economic forum has adapted .
according to swiss media , companies have seriously scaled down their party portfolios .
instead of caviar and lobster , it 's now ham and cheese .
at exclusive events , guests now have to toast with ordinary champagne instead of the usual dom perignon .
and at less fancy gatherings , the champagne is scrapped altogether in favor of a good old glass of white wine .
mixed expectations instead of glamour and glitter , substance is supposed to be king at the world economic forum 2009 .
to that end , global business and government leaders will be given the task of sketching a post-crisis world .
still , expectations for davos are mixed .
" actually , we do n't expect very much , " said alexis passadakis from the german section of the anti-globalization group attac .
" those people who meet in davos are those who are responsible for the world economic crisis we are facing now .
the governments and the companies who meet there were responsible for the liberalization of world trade and world finance and are responsible for what 's happening now , " passadakis said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-werner sinn some business experts would beg to differ .
" it 's useful to have this debate , " said hans-werner sinn , head of the ifo institute , one of germany 's major economic think tanks .
" we have lots of countries which are not represented in the g20 or g8 meetings so they have an opportunity to meet now and also raise their voice and there are some important people also coming to this event so i find it basically very fruitful . "
broad range of topics and debate they surely will in davos .
during 57 sessions , participants will tackle issues ranging from climate change and new business models to sustainable development , which are all important and worth talking about .
but probably , by most people 's standards , the world economic forum can only be called a success if it shows ways out of the current global economic crisis . michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

attempts by environmental groups to stop the project have failed . germany gave the green light on monday to a controversial plan with india to drop six tons of iron dust in the south atlantic .
the experiment is the biggest trial ever of iron fertilization , a technology which could theoretically help stop global warming at very little cost .
but following complaints by environmentalists , germany 's science ministry ordered the plan suspended while it conducted an urgent review .
" after careful a study of expert reports , i am convinced there are no scientific or legal objections to the german-indian marine research project , " research minister annette schavan said on monday , jan .
26 .
" i have therefore decided … to begin the experiment . "
opponents of the plan fear that the results could be catastrophic , worring that it would cause the sea to become more acidic or trigger algae blooms that would deprive large areas of the ocean of oxygen .
environment minister sigmar gabriel told schavan in a letter recently that the experiment " destroys germany 's credibility and its vanguard role in protecting biodiversity . "
massive carbon sink under the plan , the iron dust is to be sprinkled over an area of 300 square kilometers from a german research vessel , the polarstern .
it is hoped that algae living at the ocean surface will soak up the iron and reproduce rapidly , absorbing carbon dioxide from the surface water .
at the end of their life cycle the algae die and sink .
most of the carbon ends up in deep water or on the sea bottom .
the ocean absorbs more carbon dioxide from the air , reducing the greenhouse effect .

attempts by environmental groups to stop the project have failed . germany gave the green light on monday to a controversial plan with india to drop six tons of iron dust in the south atlantic .
the experiment is the biggest trial ever of iron fertilization , a technology which could theoretically help stop global warming at very little cost .
but following complaints by environmentalists , germany 's science ministry ordered the plan suspended while it conducted an urgent review .
" after careful a study of expert reports , i am convinced there are no scientific or legal objections to the german-indian marine research project , " research minister annette schavan said on monday , jan .
26 .
" i have therefore decided … to begin the experiment . "
opponents of the plan fear that the results could be catastrophic , worring that it would cause the sea to become more acidic or trigger algae blooms that would deprive large areas of the ocean of oxygen .
environment minister sigmar gabriel told schavan in a letter recently that the experiment " destroys germany 's credibility and its vanguard role in protecting biodiversity . "
massive carbon sink under the plan , the iron dust is to be sprinkled over an area of 300 square kilometers from a german research vessel , the polarstern .
it is hoped that algae living at the ocean surface will soak up the iron and reproduce rapidly , absorbing carbon dioxide from the surface water .
at the end of their life cycle the algae die and sink .
most of the carbon ends up in deep water or on the sea bottom .
the ocean absorbs more carbon dioxide from the air , reducing the greenhouse effect .

26 , that it was providing 58 million euros -lrb- $ 74.3 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid to vulnerable palestinians this year . in a statement , eu aid commissioner louis michel said around 32 million euros would be earmarked for gaza , which suffered massive damage during a three-week bombing campaign by israel .
an additional 20 million euros are to go to the west bank , with the remaining six million destined for palestinian refugees in lebanon .
" this funding package of 58 million euros will contribute substantially to the international effort on behalf of these suffering people and will also sustain our ongoing solidarity with the entire palestinian population , " michel said .
calling the situation in gaza " catastrophic , " he said the strip 's civilian population of nearly 1.5 million had faced " terrible and unprecedented " suffering compared to past times of violence in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
" destruction on such a massive scale saddens me deeply , " michel said during a fact-finding visit to the gaza strip .
eu commissioner distributes responsibility equally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's michel blamed israel and hamas equally michel sharply criticized israel for the massive destruction he saw around him , but said also hamas bore an " overwhelming " part of the blame .
" we have to also recall the overwhelming responsibility of hamas , " michel told local reporters as he toured jabaliya , a crowded refugee camp north of gaza city which was hit hard in israel 's 22-day offensive .
" firing rockets at civilians is a terrorist action , " he said .
" i intentionally say this here , hamas is a terrorist movement and it has to be denounced as such , " he said .
he earlier strongly condemned israel for its destruction of the civilian infrastructure , as he inspected buildings in gaza destroyed in the israeli assault , including an ice-cream , a cookie and a soft-drink factory .
he said the destruction pointed at an obvious violation of international humanitarian law .
but the 61-year-old belgian , normally known as a staunch critic of israel , added that for progress in the peace process to be possible , hamas had to accept two " small conditions " - recognize israel 's right to exist and to abandon armed struggle .
eu offering to help stop smuggling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to help stop hamas rearming after the war meanwhile , eu foreign ministers met in brussels to discuss ways of helping israel counter arms smuggling destined for hamas into the gaza strip and ensure that the fragile ceasefire between israel and hamas holds .
ministers were expected to call on hamas to halt its rocket launches , ask israel to reopen border crossings into gaza and discuss an " effective mechanism to prevent the smuggling of arms and ammunition " to the strip , diplomats said .
france on friday announced that it was dispatching a helicopter- carrying frigate to the gaza coast , while britain has said its royal navy would also be prepared to help .
meanwhile , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in brussels that his country would send five experts with special equipment to help egypt uncover the tunnels allegedly used to smuggle arms into gaza .
however , egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit said in brussels late sunday that most of the arms smuggling was taking place by sea and not through his territory .
abul gheit was attending talks with eu foreign ministers and counterparts from the palestinian authority , turkey , jordan and norway as part of a diplomatic push by the eu to make its voice heard in the region .
on wednesday , eu diplomats held separate talks with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni , who insisted on the need to stop weapons being smuggled into the strip .

26 , that it was providing 58 million euros -lrb- $ 74.3 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid to vulnerable palestinians this year . in a statement , eu aid commissioner louis michel said around 32 million euros would be earmarked for gaza , which suffered massive damage during a three-week bombing campaign by israel .
an additional 20 million euros are to go to the west bank , with the remaining six million destined for palestinian refugees in lebanon .
" this funding package of 58 million euros will contribute substantially to the international effort on behalf of these suffering people and will also sustain our ongoing solidarity with the entire palestinian population , " michel said .
calling the situation in gaza " catastrophic , " he said the strip 's civilian population of nearly 1.5 million had faced " terrible and unprecedented " suffering compared to past times of violence in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
" destruction on such a massive scale saddens me deeply , " michel said during a fact-finding visit to the gaza strip .
eu commissioner distributes responsibility equally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's michel blamed israel and hamas equally michel sharply criticized israel for the massive destruction he saw around him , but said also hamas bore an " overwhelming " part of the blame .
" we have to also recall the overwhelming responsibility of hamas , " michel told local reporters as he toured jabaliya , a crowded refugee camp north of gaza city which was hit hard in israel 's 22-day offensive .
" firing rockets at civilians is a terrorist action , " he said .
" i intentionally say this here , hamas is a terrorist movement and it has to be denounced as such , " he said .
he earlier strongly condemned israel for its destruction of the civilian infrastructure , as he inspected buildings in gaza destroyed in the israeli assault , including an ice-cream , a cookie and a soft-drink factory .

" if we play consistently from the first match onwards then we will become german champions and will go a long way in the champions league , " klinsmann said in an interview with the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- website published on monday .
" if every player gives it all he has and contributes to the team we will win a title or two .
the team plays faster and more attractive football -lrb- than last season -rrb- and we believe that it can do even better .
the buildup gives us reason for hope . "
title holders bayern are tied on points with league leaders hoffenheim as the second half of the season opens this week .
munich visit vfb stuttgart for a german cup tie on tuesday and open bundesliga action on friday night at third-placed sv hamburg .
their next champions league date is a knock-out round tie in february with portugal 's sporting lisbon , with the club seeking to recapture europe 's top prize it last won in 2001 .
klinsmann said he did n't mind such tough domestic tests after the seven-week hibernation period .
" of course things could be easier but such games are a good indicator because we will know where we stand .
i am convinced that we can have a successful start if all players are fit . "
munich had a stuttering start into the season but improved in the final weeks before the winter break .
klinsmann confident despite podolski departure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery has been an inspiration since joining bayern looking at the team led by french star franck ribery , klinsmann expressed his disappointment with germany forward lukas podolski who returns to cologne in summer after never being able to challenge first-choice players luca toni and miroslav klose .
" it 's a fact that lukas could n't deal with the situation in munich of being the forward number three , " said klinsmann , who nonetheless expressed his hope that podolski will regain his form in cologne .
the former germany coach klinsmann recharged his batteries during a two-week family holiday in california as he admitted his first months as club coach had been very demanding .
" it was very intense .
the life of a club coach is very different to that of a national team coach .
but i can say after half a year that my decision to go to munich was the right one , " he said .
it could be worse .
klinsmann could be coach at werder bremen .
after starting the season in barn-storming form , the northern german team have slipped down to eighth in the league , embroiled in scandals and arguments involving former squeaky-clean star diego .
they now face a lawsuit by former player ivan klasnic .
legal action over kidneys klasnic is to sue two doctors at bremen over his treatment for kidney problems that eventually led to two organ transplants , the news magazine der spiegel reported monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bremen favorite klasnic is suing the club the striker , who joined french side nantes this season , underwent two kidney transplant operations in early 2007 while still at bremen and accuses the club 's doctors of negligent treatment and medical mistakes .
the doctors reject the allegations .
according to the report , made available ahead of publication , attempts in the previous nine months to reach an out-of-court settlement have failed .
the 28-year-old forward is now looking for two million euros -lrb- $ 2.6 million -rrb- in compensation with the case due to be heard in a bremen court on april 17 .
croatian international klasnic scored 49 league goals for bremen between 2001 and 2007 for bremen as well as netting 20 times in the champions league .
diego gets club backing meanwhile bremen seem to be maintaining their patience with unsettled brazilian diego .
this season the modest 23-year-old playmaker has been finding himself increasingly in the headlines for reasons which have often had little to do with his prowess on the field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego ran out on bremen for the beijing olympics right at the beginning of the season diego ruffled a few bremen feathers by insisting on playing for brazil at the olympics in beijing , much against the will of the club who wanted him back for the bundesliga start .
there then followed some late training appearances and a loss of control on the pitch in december when he grabbed a karlsruhe player around the neck - an act which earned him a hefty club fine and sees him banned for four matches up to february 21 .
much has also been made in the german tabloid press of an alleged affair with pop singer sarah connor , although the player says the two are " just good friends . "
then last week began with headlines of a police car chase , with diego made to take a breathalyser test in bremen .
brazilian faces ban bremen sports director klaus allofs says the incident should not be blown out of proportion .
" diego is sorry .
he knows that he committed an offense and will have to live with the consequences that the test brings with it .
i do n't know if he will receive a driving ban or a fine , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's new wayward image comes with a ruffled look diego said he had to take a breath test , but denied reports of a car chase or that he drove through a red light .
" i came to a police control stop where i followed the orders of the authorities .
i was a bit shocked that there were three cars with blue lights flashing .
but the policemen were very nice to me , " he said .
german media reports said diego was over the legal alcohol limit of 50 milligrams of alcohol per liter of blood and could lose his driving license for a month , although diego insists he was not intoxicated , but had just had some wine .
allofs said : " he made a mistake in a part of his private life from which he will learn .
we were not pleased about the headlines and we discouraged his behavior .
but that has nothing to do with the debate about discipline within the team .
allofs says the recent negative headlines were also to do with the increased media attention in bremen , especially since diego 's liaison with sarah connor has put him in the paparazzi 's focus .
" nevertheless , our players naturally have a function as a role model , " he said .
" and fundamentally , this should apply to everyone , even for diego : stay away from driving after enjoying alcohol . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the life of a club coach is very different to that of a national team coach .
but i can say after half a year that my decision to go to munich was the right one , " he said .
it could be worse .
klinsmann could be coach at werder bremen .
after starting the season in barn-storming form , the northern german team have slipped down to eighth in the league , embroiled in scandals and arguments involving former squeaky-clean star diego .
they now face a lawsuit by former player ivan klasnic .
legal action over kidneys klasnic is to sue two doctors at bremen over his treatment for kidney problems that eventually led to two organ transplants , the news magazine der spiegel reported monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bremen favorite klasnic is suing the club the striker , who joined french side nantes this season , underwent two kidney transplant operations in early 2007 while still at bremen and accuses the club 's doctors of negligent treatment and medical mistakes .
the doctors reject the allegations .
according to the report , made available ahead of publication , attempts in the previous nine months to reach an out-of-court settlement have failed .
the 28-year-old forward is now looking for two million euros -lrb- $ 2.6 million -rrb- in compensation with the case due to be heard in a bremen court on april 17 .
croatian international klasnic scored 49 league goals for bremen between 2001 and 2007 for bremen as well as netting 20 times in the champions league .
diego gets club backing meanwhile bremen seem to be maintaining their patience with unsettled brazilian diego .
this season the modest 23-year-old playmaker has been finding himself increasingly in the headlines for reasons which have often had little to do with his prowess on the field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego ran out on bremen for the beijing olympics right at the beginning of the season diego ruffled a few bremen feathers by insisting on playing for brazil at the olympics in beijing , much against the will of the club who wanted him back for the bundesliga start .
there then followed some late training appearances and a loss of control on the pitch in december when he grabbed a karlsruhe player around the neck - an act which earned him a hefty club fine and sees him banned for four matches up to february 21 .
much has also been made in the german tabloid press of an alleged affair with pop singer sarah connor , although the player says the two are " just good friends . "
then last week began with headlines of a police car chase , with diego made to take a breathalyser test in bremen .
brazilian faces ban bremen sports director klaus allofs says the incident should not be blown out of proportion .
" diego is sorry .
he knows that he committed an offense and will have to live with the consequences that the test brings with it .
i do n't know if he will receive a driving ban or a fine , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's new wayward image comes with a ruffled look diego said he had to take a breath test , but denied reports of a car chase or that he drove through a red light .
" i came to a police control stop where i followed the orders of the authorities .
i was a bit shocked that there were three cars with blue lights flashing .
but the policemen were very nice to me , " he said .
german media reports said diego was over the legal alcohol limit of 50 milligrams of alcohol per liter of blood and could lose his driving license for a month , although diego insists he was not intoxicated , but had just had some wine .
allofs said : " he made a mistake in a part of his private life from which he will learn .
we were not pleased about the headlines and we discouraged his behavior .
but that has nothing to do with the debate about discipline within the team .
allofs says the recent negative headlines were also to do with the increased media attention in bremen , especially since diego 's liaison with sarah connor has put him in the paparazzi 's focus .
" nevertheless , our players naturally have a function as a role model , " he said .

" if we play consistently from the first match onwards then we will become german champions and will go a long way in the champions league , " klinsmann said in an interview with the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- website published on monday .
" if every player gives it all he has and contributes to the team we will win a title or two .
the team plays faster and more attractive football -lrb- than last season -rrb- and we believe that it can do even better .
the buildup gives us reason for hope . "
title holders bayern are tied on points with league leaders hoffenheim as the second half of the season opens this week .
munich visit vfb stuttgart for a german cup tie on tuesday and open bundesliga action on friday night at third-placed sv hamburg .
their next champions league date is a knock-out round tie in february with portugal 's sporting lisbon , with the club seeking to recapture europe 's top prize it last won in 2001 .
klinsmann said he did n't mind such tough domestic tests after the seven-week hibernation period .
" of course things could be easier but such games are a good indicator because we will know where we stand .
i am convinced that we can have a successful start if all players are fit . "
munich had a stuttering start into the season but improved in the final weeks before the winter break .
klinsmann confident despite podolski departure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery has been an inspiration since joining bayern looking at the team led by french star franck ribery , klinsmann expressed his disappointment with germany forward lukas podolski who returns to cologne in summer after never being able to challenge first-choice players luca toni and miroslav klose .
" it 's a fact that lukas could n't deal with the situation in munich of being the forward number three , " said klinsmann , who nonetheless expressed his hope that podolski will regain his form in cologne .
the former germany coach klinsmann recharged his batteries during a two-week family holiday in california as he admitted his first months as club coach had been very demanding .
" it was very intense .
the life of a club coach is very different to that of a national team coach .
but i can say after half a year that my decision to go to munich was the right one , " he said .
it could be worse .
klinsmann could be coach at werder bremen .
after starting the season in barn-storming form , the northern german team have slipped down to eighth in the league , embroiled in scandals and arguments involving former squeaky-clean star diego .
they now face a lawsuit by former player ivan klasnic .
legal action over kidneys klasnic is to sue two doctors at bremen over his treatment for kidney problems that eventually led to two organ transplants , the news magazine der spiegel reported monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bremen favorite klasnic is suing the club the striker , who joined french side nantes this season , underwent two kidney transplant operations in early 2007 while still at bremen and accuses the club 's doctors of negligent treatment and medical mistakes .
the doctors reject the allegations .
according to the report , made available ahead of publication , attempts in the previous nine months to reach an out-of-court settlement have failed .
the 28-year-old forward is now looking for two million euros -lrb- $ 2.6 million -rrb- in compensation with the case due to be heard in a bremen court on april 17 .
croatian international klasnic scored 49 league goals for bremen between 2001 and 2007 for bremen as well as netting 20 times in the champions league .
diego gets club backing meanwhile bremen seem to be maintaining their patience with unsettled brazilian diego .
this season the modest 23-year-old playmaker has been finding himself increasingly in the headlines for reasons which have often had little to do with his prowess on the field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego ran out on bremen for the beijing olympics right at the beginning of the season diego ruffled a few bremen feathers by insisting on playing for brazil at the olympics in beijing , much against the will of the club who wanted him back for the bundesliga start .
there then followed some late training appearances and a loss of control on the pitch in december when he grabbed a karlsruhe player around the neck - an act which earned him a hefty club fine and sees him banned for four matches up to february 21 .
much has also been made in the german tabloid press of an alleged affair with pop singer sarah connor , although the player says the two are " just good friends . "
then last week began with headlines of a police car chase , with diego made to take a breathalyser test in bremen .
brazilian faces ban bremen sports director klaus allofs says the incident should not be blown out of proportion .
" diego is sorry .
he knows that he committed an offense and will have to live with the consequences that the test brings with it .
i do n't know if he will receive a driving ban or a fine , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's new wayward image comes with a ruffled look diego said he had to take a breath test , but denied reports of a car chase or that he drove through a red light .
" i came to a police control stop where i followed the orders of the authorities .
i was a bit shocked that there were three cars with blue lights flashing .
but the policemen were very nice to me , " he said .
german media reports said diego was over the legal alcohol limit of 50 milligrams of alcohol per liter of blood and could lose his driving license for a month , although diego insists he was not intoxicated , but had just had some wine .
allofs said : " he made a mistake in a part of his private life from which he will learn .

it ’ s breaking up in space , though experts are confident it poses no risk . a german space expert has rejected concerns about an old nuclear-powered soviet satellite which is breaking up in space , saying its orbit appears stable and the fuel on board is not very radioactive anymore .
us space watchers highlighted the fate of cosmos 1818 two weeks ago .
a article in the january issue of orbital debris quarterly news , published by the us national aeronautics and space administration -lrb- nasa -rrb- , revealed it was strewing parts .
heiner klinkrad , a specialist in space junk at the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- office in darmstadt , germany , said in an interview with the dpa news agency that he saw no danger .
" the satellite is still in a stable orbit , " said klinkrad , who heads the esa department tracking orbital debris .
he said nasa 's space surveillance network was keeping it under observation .
no indication of an explosion the fragments were only moving away slowly from the satellite , which indicated there had not been any explosion on board .
" only a high-energy explosion would be capable of destabilizing its orbital path , " said klinkrad .
he suggested paint or other surface material was coming free , or a coolant system had sprung a leak , perhaps after impact by a piece of high-speed space junk .
launched by the former soviet union in february 1987 , the satellite was intended to evaluate a nuclear-reactor power supply .
it was still at an altitude of 800 kilometres and its orbit had not slowed , klinkrad said , adding that even if cosmos 1818 were to slow down and tumble to earth , this would be no disaster .

it ’ s breaking up in space , though experts are confident it poses no risk . a german space expert has rejected concerns about an old nuclear-powered soviet satellite which is breaking up in space , saying its orbit appears stable and the fuel on board is not very radioactive anymore .
us space watchers highlighted the fate of cosmos 1818 two weeks ago .
a article in the january issue of orbital debris quarterly news , published by the us national aeronautics and space administration -lrb- nasa -rrb- , revealed it was strewing parts .
heiner klinkrad , a specialist in space junk at the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- office in darmstadt , germany , said in an interview with the dpa news agency that he saw no danger .
" the satellite is still in a stable orbit , " said klinkrad , who heads the esa department tracking orbital debris .
he said nasa 's space surveillance network was keeping it under observation .
no indication of an explosion the fragments were only moving away slowly from the satellite , which indicated there had not been any explosion on board .
" only a high-energy explosion would be capable of destabilizing its orbital path , " said klinkrad .
he suggested paint or other surface material was coming free , or a coolant system had sprung a leak , perhaps after impact by a piece of high-speed space junk .
launched by the former soviet union in february 1987 , the satellite was intended to evaluate a nuclear-reactor power supply .
it was still at an altitude of 800 kilometres and its orbit had not slowed , klinkrad said , adding that even if cosmos 1818 were to slow down and tumble to earth , this would be no disaster .
" the reactor on the satellite was shut down 20 years ago , " he said .
" in that time , the radioactivity in the idle reactor would have declined to less than one-thousandth of its original level . " dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it ’ s breaking up in space , though experts are confident it poses no risk . a german space expert has rejected concerns about an old nuclear-powered soviet satellite which is breaking up in space , saying its orbit appears stable and the fuel on board is not very radioactive anymore .
us space watchers highlighted the fate of cosmos 1818 two weeks ago .
a article in the january issue of orbital debris quarterly news , published by the us national aeronautics and space administration -lrb- nasa -rrb- , revealed it was strewing parts .
heiner klinkrad , a specialist in space junk at the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- office in darmstadt , germany , said in an interview with the dpa news agency that he saw no danger .
" the satellite is still in a stable orbit , " said klinkrad , who heads the esa department tracking orbital debris .
he said nasa 's space surveillance network was keeping it under observation .
no indication of an explosion the fragments were only moving away slowly from the satellite , which indicated there had not been any explosion on board .
" only a high-energy explosion would be capable of destabilizing its orbital path , " said klinkrad .
he suggested paint or other surface material was coming free , or a coolant system had sprung a leak , perhaps after impact by a piece of high-speed space junk .
launched by the former soviet union in february 1987 , the satellite was intended to evaluate a nuclear-reactor power supply .
it was still at an altitude of 800 kilometres and its orbit had not slowed , klinkrad said , adding that even if cosmos 1818 were to slow down and tumble to earth , this would be no disaster .
" the reactor on the satellite was shut down 20 years ago , " he said .
" in that time , the radioactivity in the idle reactor would have declined to less than one-thousandth of its original level . " dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it ’ s breaking up in space , though experts are confident it poses no risk . a german space expert has rejected concerns about an old nuclear-powered soviet satellite which is breaking up in space , saying its orbit appears stable and the fuel on board is not very radioactive anymore .
us space watchers highlighted the fate of cosmos 1818 two weeks ago .
a article in the january issue of orbital debris quarterly news , published by the us national aeronautics and space administration -lrb- nasa -rrb- , revealed it was strewing parts .
heiner klinkrad , a specialist in space junk at the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- office in darmstadt , germany , said in an interview with the dpa news agency that he saw no danger .
" the satellite is still in a stable orbit , " said klinkrad , who heads the esa department tracking orbital debris .
he said nasa 's space surveillance network was keeping it under observation .
no indication of an explosion the fragments were only moving away slowly from the satellite , which indicated there had not been any explosion on board .
" only a high-energy explosion would be capable of destabilizing its orbital path , " said klinkrad .
he suggested paint or other surface material was coming free , or a coolant system had sprung a leak , perhaps after impact by a piece of high-speed space junk .
launched by the former soviet union in february 1987 , the satellite was intended to evaluate a nuclear-reactor power supply .
it was still at an altitude of 800 kilometres and its orbit had not slowed , klinkrad said , adding that even if cosmos 1818 were to slow down and tumble to earth , this would be no disaster .
" the reactor on the satellite was shut down 20 years ago , " he said .
" in that time , the radioactivity in the idle reactor would have declined to less than one-thousandth of its original level . " dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new eco-energy agency has been created in germany to help nations do just that . a new organization promoting the development and use of renewable energies was launched monday in the former german capital , bonn .
the international renewable energy agency -lrb- irena -rrb- will advise industrialized and developing nations on ways of reducing their dependency on oil , coal and gas .
speaking at the opening event , german environment minister sigmar gabriel said the potential for renewable energies is huge , and needs more help to achieve a global breakthrough .
" irena will be the new mouthpiece for renewable energies , " he said .
around 75 states signed the founding document , while representatives from a further 25 countries were in bonn for the occasion .

irena is intended to provide a counterbalance to the international energy agency and the international atomic energy agency , by becoming a driving force behind renewable technologies such as sun , wind , water and geothermal energy sources .
the organization aims to facilitate the transfer of renewable technologies to developing countries rich in renewable energy resources , such as sunshine .

german deputy foreign minister gernot erler said the development of renewable energies would offer economic opportunities , adding that " germany in particular is well positioned with its outstanding environmental technology . "
thailand energy minister wannarat charnukul , who is attending the opening ceremony , last week welcomed the launch of irena .
" we 've confronted some problems with solar energy development in thailand so we need some technology transfer from irena , " wannaret said .
germany , spain and denmark initially campaigned for the foundation of a renewable energy organisation .
the preliminary framework was drawn up in madrid in october 2008 .
the city of bonn , which has developed into a centre for environment and sustainable development , is bidding to host irena 's headquarters . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

zumwinkel , named manager magazine 's 2003 " executive of the year " for his work at transforming deutsche post from a bloated state monopoly into one of the world 's largest logistics companies , admitted that he had made the " biggest mistake of my life . "
" i am not going to beat around the bush : i am guilty of what i am accused of , " zumwinkel told the court on the trial 's first day .
" my career had a bitter end .
my job was my life . "
zumwinkel barely avoided jail .
in december , the federal court of justice ruled that tax crimes of more than 1 million euros would automatically land an offender in jail .
zumwinkel was originally accused of hiding 1.2 million euros , but the court in bochum announced it would only bring charges on activities since 2002 , meaning the sum involved came in just under the one-million euro mark .
liechtenstein under scrutiny germany reportedly paid 4.5 million euros for the dvd .
the brouhaha also caused britain and the united states to launch their own investigations .
it also brought liechtenstein and other tax havens under heavy international criticism .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck vowed to " to put the screws " on liechtenstein , while chancellor angela merkel threatened to isolate it from the rest of europe unless it cooperated on ending banking secrecy .

attempts by environmental groups to stop the project have failed . germany gave the green light on monday to a controversial plan with india to drop six tons of iron dust in the south atlantic .
the experiment is the biggest trial ever of iron fertilization , a technology which could theoretically help stop global warming at very little cost .
but following complaints by environmentalists , germany 's science ministry ordered the plan suspended while it conducted an urgent review .
" after careful a study of expert reports , i am convinced there are no scientific or legal objections to the german-indian marine research project , " research minister annette schavan said on monday , jan .
26 .
" i have therefore decided … to begin the experiment . "
opponents of the plan fear that the results could be catastrophic , worring that it would cause the sea to become more acidic or trigger algae blooms that would deprive large areas of the ocean of oxygen .
environment minister sigmar gabriel told schavan in a letter recently that the experiment " destroys germany 's credibility and its vanguard role in protecting biodiversity . "
massive carbon sink under the plan , the iron dust is to be sprinkled over an area of 300 square kilometers from a german research vessel , the polarstern .
it is hoped that algae living at the ocean surface will soak up the iron and reproduce rapidly , absorbing carbon dioxide from the surface water .
at the end of their life cycle the algae die and sink .
most of the carbon ends up in deep water or on the sea bottom .
the ocean absorbs more carbon dioxide from the air , reducing the greenhouse effect .
sequestering carbon this way might stop global warming .

attempts by environmental groups to stop the project have failed . germany gave the green light on monday to a controversial plan with india to drop six tons of iron dust in the south atlantic .
the experiment is the biggest trial ever of iron fertilization , a technology which could theoretically help stop global warming at very little cost .
but following complaints by environmentalists , germany 's science ministry ordered the plan suspended while it conducted an urgent review .
" after careful a study of expert reports , i am convinced there are no scientific or legal objections to the german-indian marine research project , " research minister annette schavan said on monday , jan .
26 .
" i have therefore decided … to begin the experiment . "
opponents of the plan fear that the results could be catastrophic , worring that it would cause the sea to become more acidic or trigger algae blooms that would deprive large areas of the ocean of oxygen .
environment minister sigmar gabriel told schavan in a letter recently that the experiment " destroys germany 's credibility and its vanguard role in protecting biodiversity . "
massive carbon sink under the plan , the iron dust is to be sprinkled over an area of 300 square kilometers from a german research vessel , the polarstern .
it is hoped that algae living at the ocean surface will soak up the iron and reproduce rapidly , absorbing carbon dioxide from the surface water .
at the end of their life cycle the algae die and sink .
most of the carbon ends up in deep water or on the sea bottom .
the ocean absorbs more carbon dioxide from the air , reducing the greenhouse effect .
sequestering carbon this way might stop global warming .
thirty indian scientists and 18 from other nations left on board the polarstern from cape town on jan .

it will draw up a road map to ensure the enforcement of the rome agreements to alleviate the suffering caused by soaring food prices and to stimulate agricultural development and food production , according to spanish government sources .

" we have more and more hungry people , while food reserves are the second lowest in 30 years , " diouf said .
about 960 million people are undernourished , and more than 100,000 die daily of causes related to hunger , according to un figures .

26 , attributing the problems to rising food prices in 2008 and to the international financial crisis .
the conference should facilitate " a drastic change in the way we govern hunger , " jacques diouf , general director of the un food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , said in an interview with the daily el pais .
looking for solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these children in haiti only eat one meal a day the meeting bringing together un officials , representatives of international agencies and the civil society was to be closed by un secretary general ban ki-moon and spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero on tuesday .

former deutsche post head klaus zumwinkel will face a 1 million euro fine , but will avoid jail time . zumwinkel , 65 , confessed last week to using a liechtenstein bank to evade 966,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in taxes .
on monday , jan .
26 , a court found him guilty and handed down a two year suspended sentence and a fine of just under 1 million euros .
zumwinkel 's arrest for tax evasion in 2008 sent shockwaves through germany 's close-knit business world .
authorities made an example of zumwinkel , leading him out of his posh villa near cologne as television cameras rolled .
arrest rattled german tax scofflaws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel 's arrest caused many others to turn themselves in zumwinkel was one of hundreds of wealthy germans executives , sports stars and entertainers exposed when a liechtenstein bank employee betrayed them by selling a stolen dvd with details of their accounts to germany 's foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
since then , german prosecutors have recovered more than 150 million euros -lrb- $ 194 million -rrb- from taxpayers hoping to avoid being taken to trial .
german tax authorities believe that more than 4 billion euros was being hidden in liechtenstein .
prosecutors said zumwinkel concealed money in trust funds managed by the ltg bank in liechtenstein .
he set up a trust fund for himself in liechtenstein in 1986 with money he inherited , but failed to disclose earnings and dividends from it to german tax authorities , as required by law .
zumwinkel fell hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leichtenstein is a favorite tax haven released on bail after a search of his villa , zumwinkel resigned shortly afterwards as head of deutsche post , one of the world 's leading logistics companies with a global workforce of more than 350,000 .
later , he stepped down from positions on the boards of other leading german companies such as deutsche telekom , lufthansa and retailer arcandor .
zumwinkel , named manager magazine 's 2003 " executive of the year " for his work at transforming deutsche post from a bloated state monopoly into one of the world 's largest logistics companies , admitted that he had made the " biggest mistake of my life . "
" i am not going to beat around the bush : i am guilty of what i am accused of , " zumwinkel told the court on the trial 's first day .
" my career had a bitter end .
my job was my life . "
zumwinkel barely avoided jail .
in december , the federal court of justice ruled that tax crimes of more than 1 million euros would automatically land an offender in jail .
zumwinkel was originally accused of hiding 1.2 million euros , but the court in bochum announced it would only bring charges on activities since 2002 , meaning the sum involved came in just under the one-million euro mark .
liechtenstein under scrutiny germany reportedly paid 4.5 million euros for the dvd .
the brouhaha also caused britain and the united states to launch their own investigations .
it also brought liechtenstein and other tax havens under heavy international criticism .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck vowed to " to put the screws " on liechtenstein , while chancellor angela merkel threatened to isolate it from the rest of europe unless it cooperated on ending banking secrecy .
liechtenstein is considered an " un-cooperative tax haven " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but according to the report , merkel has instructed the economics ministry to put the brakes on this practice after statistics showed that exports had risen 10.5 percent on an annual basis to 3.58 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.63 billion -rrb- through november 2008 .
some 75 percent of all medium and small businesses in iran use german-made equipment . business and banking trade elements are not specifically forbidden under un security council sanctions , which only limit the sale of technology that could be used in the weapons industry . merkel has repeatedly insisted that germany is only obliged to obey the un sanctions and said earlier this month that germany was not planning to undertake any further unilateral action against iran at this time .
but pressure from within the western powers working towards a nuclear-free iran may have persuaded her otherwise . germany has also come under fire from sections of the us media for its policy towards trade with iran .
a recent commentary by editorial writer dan schwammenthal in the wall street journal was titled : " germany loves iran . "
schwammenthal wrote that germany was less worried about an iranian nuclear bomb than it was about tightening sanctions that could negatively affect trade between the two countries . as the new us administration under president barack obama prepares to break with the previous administration and talk with iran about its nuclear program , germany now appears more comfortable with applying more pressure of its own . germany steps up restrictions on trade guarantees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's move increases the pressure on german firms the announcement to issue trade guarantees only in exceptional cases is actually the next logical step in a policy germany has been executing in increments ever since the nuclear stand-off between the west and iran began . germany , traditionally one of the top exporters to iran , has been gradually reducing the numbers of export guarantees for the past three years . german businesses have seen a significant fall in export guarantees for trade with the islamic republic since last year .
the economics ministry said a year ago that new guarantees for iran fell to 503.4 million euros in 2007 from 1.16 billion in 2006 . half-year numbers for last year show a sharp decline in new guarantees to 73.4 million euros , compared to 387 million in the first half of 2007 with full figures for 2008 to be published in the coming weeks . western powers believe iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons under the cover of a civilian atomic program .
tehran says it wants to master nuclear technology for peaceful power generation purposes . reports in recent weeks have said european countries , including britain , france and germany , could seek to pass new sanctions against iran , which has rejected repeated calls from the u.n. security council for it to suspend uranium enrichment . germany 's decision to limit its trade guarantees could herald the start of a new set of restrictions on iran by western powers . eu removes iranian organization from terror list in other developments , european union foreign ministers removed the people 's mujahedin of iran -lrb- pmoi -rrb- from their list of terrorist organizations on monday , despite public protests in tehran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pmoi 's case has been heard before but ignored the widely expected move follows a ruling by the european court in luxembourg , which in december said the eu was wrong to keep the pmoi 's assets frozen after it was taken off a british list of terrorist organizations . " what we are doing today is abiding by the resolution of the european court .
there 's nothing we can do about that resolution , " eu foreign-policy chief javier solana said . founded in 1965 , the pmoi operated a military wing in its early years , but says it renounced violence in june 2001 and now advocates the political overthrow of iran 's current government . reports of the eu 's planned decision prompted street protests outside eu embassies in tehran over the weekend by hundreds of iranian students and relatives of veterans of the iran-iraq war -lrb- 1980-88 -rrb- . iran regards pmoi as a terrorist group owing to its involvement in the assassinations of several high-ranking iranian officials , including the president and prime minister in 1980 . after the group was expelled from france in the 1980s , former iraqi president saddam hussein allocated a military base to the pmoi near the border with iran . before the ouster of saddam , the pmoi frequently infiltrated iranian territory , leading to clashes with iranian forces and casualties on both sides . solana said the eu decision could only be reversed if new evidence against the pmoi was presented to the european courts . " if there is something new that may be presented in front of the court , we 'll see , " solana said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if we play consistently from the first match onwards then we will become german champions and will go a long way in the champions league , " klinsmann said in an interview with the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- website published on monday .
" if every player gives it all he has and contributes to the team we will win a title or two .
the team plays faster and more attractive football -lrb- than last season -rrb- and we believe that it can do even better .
the buildup gives us reason for hope . "
title holders bayern are tied on points with league leaders hoffenheim as the second half of the season opens this week .
munich visit vfb stuttgart for a german cup tie on tuesday and open bundesliga action on friday night at third-placed sv hamburg .
their next champions league date is a knock-out round tie in february with portugal 's sporting lisbon , with the club seeking to recapture europe 's top prize it last won in 2001 .
klinsmann said he did n't mind such tough domestic tests after the seven-week hibernation period .
" of course things could be easier but such games are a good indicator because we will know where we stand .
i am convinced that we can have a successful start if all players are fit . "
munich had a stuttering start into the season but improved in the final weeks before the winter break .
klinsmann confident despite podolski departure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery has been an inspiration since joining bayern looking at the team led by french star franck ribery , klinsmann expressed his disappointment with germany forward lukas podolski who returns to cologne in summer after never being able to challenge first-choice players luca toni and miroslav klose .
" it 's a fact that lukas could n't deal with the situation in munich of being the forward number three , " said klinsmann , who nonetheless expressed his hope that podolski will regain his form in cologne .
the former germany coach klinsmann recharged his batteries during a two-week family holiday in california as he admitted his first months as club coach had been very demanding .
" it was very intense .
the life of a club coach is very different to that of a national team coach .
but i can say after half a year that my decision to go to munich was the right one , " he said .
it could be worse .
klinsmann could be coach at werder bremen .
after starting the season in barn-storming form , the northern german team have slipped down to eighth in the league , embroiled in scandals and arguments involving former squeaky-clean star diego .
they now face a lawsuit by former player ivan klasnic .
legal action over kidneys klasnic is to sue two doctors at bremen over his treatment for kidney problems that eventually led to two organ transplants , the news magazine der spiegel reported monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bremen favorite klasnic is suing the club the striker , who joined french side nantes this season , underwent two kidney transplant operations in early 2007 while still at bremen and accuses the club 's doctors of negligent treatment and medical mistakes .
the doctors reject the allegations .
according to the report , made available ahead of publication , attempts in the previous nine months to reach an out-of-court settlement have failed .
the 28-year-old forward is now looking for two million euros -lrb- $ 2.6 million -rrb- in compensation with the case due to be heard in a bremen court on april 17 .
croatian international klasnic scored 49 league goals for bremen between 2001 and 2007 for bremen as well as netting 20 times in the champions league .
diego gets club backing meanwhile bremen seem to be maintaining their patience with unsettled brazilian diego .
this season the modest 23-year-old playmaker has been finding himself increasingly in the headlines for reasons which have often had little to do with his prowess on the field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego ran out on bremen for the beijing olympics right at the beginning of the season diego ruffled a few bremen feathers by insisting on playing for brazil at the olympics in beijing , much against the will of the club who wanted him back for the bundesliga start .
there then followed some late training appearances and a loss of control on the pitch in december when he grabbed a karlsruhe player around the neck - an act which earned him a hefty club fine and sees him banned for four matches up to february 21 .
much has also been made in the german tabloid press of an alleged affair with pop singer sarah connor , although the player says the two are " just good friends . "
then last week began with headlines of a police car chase , with diego made to take a breathalyser test in bremen .
brazilian faces ban bremen sports director klaus allofs says the incident should not be blown out of proportion .
" diego is sorry .
he knows that he committed an offense and will have to live with the consequences that the test brings with it .
i do n't know if he will receive a driving ban or a fine , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's new wayward image comes with a ruffled look diego said he had to take a breath test , but denied reports of a car chase or that he drove through a red light .
" i came to a police control stop where i followed the orders of the authorities .
i was a bit shocked that there were three cars with blue lights flashing .
but the policemen were very nice to me , " he said .
german media reports said diego was over the legal alcohol limit of 50 milligrams of alcohol per liter of blood and could lose his driving license for a month , although diego insists he was not intoxicated , but had just had some wine .
allofs said : " he made a mistake in a part of his private life from which he will learn .
we were not pleased about the headlines and we discouraged his behavior .
but that has nothing to do with the debate about discipline within the team .
allofs says the recent negative headlines were also to do with the increased media attention in bremen , especially since diego 's liaison with sarah connor has put him in the paparazzi 's focus .
" nevertheless , our players naturally have a function as a role model , " he said .
" and fundamentally , this should apply to everyone , even for diego : stay away from driving after enjoying alcohol . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if we play consistently from the first match onwards then we will become german champions and will go a long way in the champions league , " klinsmann said in an interview with the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- website published on monday .
" if every player gives it all he has and contributes to the team we will win a title or two .
the team plays faster and more attractive football -lrb- than last season -rrb- and we believe that it can do even better .
the buildup gives us reason for hope . "
title holders bayern are tied on points with league leaders hoffenheim as the second half of the season opens this week .
munich visit vfb stuttgart for a german cup tie on tuesday and open bundesliga action on friday night at third-placed sv hamburg .
their next champions league date is a knock-out round tie in february with portugal 's sporting lisbon , with the club seeking to recapture europe 's top prize it last won in 2001 .
klinsmann said he did n't mind such tough domestic tests after the seven-week hibernation period .
" of course things could be easier but such games are a good indicator because we will know where we stand .
i am convinced that we can have a successful start if all players are fit . "
munich had a stuttering start into the season but improved in the final weeks before the winter break .
klinsmann confident despite podolski departure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery has been an inspiration since joining bayern looking at the team led by french star franck ribery , klinsmann expressed his disappointment with germany forward lukas podolski who returns to cologne in summer after never being able to challenge first-choice players luca toni and miroslav klose .
" it 's a fact that lukas could n't deal with the situation in munich of being the forward number three , " said klinsmann , who nonetheless expressed his hope that podolski will regain his form in cologne .
the former germany coach klinsmann recharged his batteries during a two-week family holiday in california as he admitted his first months as club coach had been very demanding .
" it was very intense .
the life of a club coach is very different to that of a national team coach .
but i can say after half a year that my decision to go to munich was the right one , " he said .
it could be worse .
klinsmann could be coach at werder bremen .
after starting the season in barn-storming form , the northern german team have slipped down to eighth in the league , embroiled in scandals and arguments involving former squeaky-clean star diego .
they now face a lawsuit by former player ivan klasnic .
legal action over kidneys klasnic is to sue two doctors at bremen over his treatment for kidney problems that eventually led to two organ transplants , the news magazine der spiegel reported monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bremen favorite klasnic is suing the club the striker , who joined french side nantes this season , underwent two kidney transplant operations in early 2007 while still at bremen and accuses the club 's doctors of negligent treatment and medical mistakes .
the doctors reject the allegations .
according to the report , made available ahead of publication , attempts in the previous nine months to reach an out-of-court settlement have failed .
the 28-year-old forward is now looking for two million euros -lrb- $ 2.6 million -rrb- in compensation with the case due to be heard in a bremen court on april 17 .
croatian international klasnic scored 49 league goals for bremen between 2001 and 2007 for bremen as well as netting 20 times in the champions league .
diego gets club backing meanwhile bremen seem to be maintaining their patience with unsettled brazilian diego .
this season the modest 23-year-old playmaker has been finding himself increasingly in the headlines for reasons which have often had little to do with his prowess on the field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego ran out on bremen for the beijing olympics right at the beginning of the season diego ruffled a few bremen feathers by insisting on playing for brazil at the olympics in beijing , much against the will of the club who wanted him back for the bundesliga start .
there then followed some late training appearances and a loss of control on the pitch in december when he grabbed a karlsruhe player around the neck - an act which earned him a hefty club fine and sees him banned for four matches up to february 21 .
much has also been made in the german tabloid press of an alleged affair with pop singer sarah connor , although the player says the two are " just good friends . "
then last week began with headlines of a police car chase , with diego made to take a breathalyser test in bremen .
brazilian faces ban bremen sports director klaus allofs says the incident should not be blown out of proportion .
" diego is sorry .
he knows that he committed an offense and will have to live with the consequences that the test brings with it .
i do n't know if he will receive a driving ban or a fine , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's new wayward image comes with a ruffled look diego said he had to take a breath test , but denied reports of a car chase or that he drove through a red light .
" i came to a police control stop where i followed the orders of the authorities .
i was a bit shocked that there were three cars with blue lights flashing .
but the policemen were very nice to me , " he said .
german media reports said diego was over the legal alcohol limit of 50 milligrams of alcohol per liter of blood and could lose his driving license for a month , although diego insists he was not intoxicated , but had just had some wine .
allofs said : " he made a mistake in a part of his private life from which he will learn .
we were not pleased about the headlines and we discouraged his behavior .
but that has nothing to do with the debate about discipline within the team .
allofs says the recent negative headlines were also to do with the increased media attention in bremen , especially since diego 's liaison with sarah connor has put him in the paparazzi 's focus .
" nevertheless , our players naturally have a function as a role model , " he said .
" and fundamentally , this should apply to everyone , even for diego : stay away from driving after enjoying alcohol . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

former deutsche post head klaus zumwinkel will face a 1 million euro fine , but will avoid jail time . zumwinkel , 65 , confessed last week to using a liechtenstein bank to evade 966,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in taxes .
on monday , jan .
26 , a court found him guilty and handed down a two year suspended sentence and a fine of just under 1 million euros .
zumwinkel 's arrest for tax evasion in 2008 sent shockwaves through germany 's close-knit business world .
authorities made an example of zumwinkel , leading him out of his posh villa near cologne as television cameras rolled .
arrest rattled german tax scofflaws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel 's arrest caused many others to turn themselves in zumwinkel was one of hundreds of wealthy germans executives , sports stars and entertainers exposed when a liechtenstein bank employee betrayed them by selling a stolen dvd with details of their accounts to germany 's foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
since then , german prosecutors have recovered more than 150 million euros -lrb- $ 194 million -rrb- from taxpayers hoping to avoid being taken to trial .
german tax authorities believe that more than 4 billion euros was being hidden in liechtenstein .
prosecutors said zumwinkel concealed money in trust funds managed by the ltg bank in liechtenstein .
he set up a trust fund for himself in liechtenstein in 1986 with money he inherited , but failed to disclose earnings and dividends from it to german tax authorities , as required by law .
zumwinkel fell hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leichtenstein is a favorite tax haven released on bail after a search of his villa , zumwinkel resigned shortly afterwards as head of deutsche post , one of the world 's leading logistics companies with a global workforce of more than 350,000 .
later , he stepped down from positions on the boards of other leading german companies such as deutsche telekom , lufthansa and retailer arcandor .
zumwinkel , named manager magazine 's 2003 " executive of the year " for his work at transforming deutsche post from a bloated state monopoly into one of the world 's largest logistics companies , admitted that he had made the " biggest mistake of my life . "
" i am not going to beat around the bush : i am guilty of what i am accused of , " zumwinkel told the court on the trial 's first day .
" my career had a bitter end .
my job was my life . "
zumwinkel barely avoided jail .
in december , the federal court of justice ruled that tax crimes of more than 1 million euros would automatically land an offender in jail .
zumwinkel was originally accused of hiding 1.2 million euros , but the court in bochum announced it would only bring charges on activities since 2002 , meaning the sum involved came in just under the one-million euro mark .
liechtenstein under scrutiny germany reportedly paid 4.5 million euros for the dvd .
the brouhaha also caused britain and the united states to launch their own investigations .
it also brought liechtenstein and other tax havens under heavy international criticism .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck vowed to " to put the screws " on liechtenstein , while chancellor angela merkel threatened to isolate it from the rest of europe unless it cooperated on ending banking secrecy .
liechtenstein is considered an " un-cooperative tax haven " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

attempts by environmental groups to stop the project have failed . germany gave the green light on monday to a controversial plan with india to drop six tons of iron dust in the south atlantic .
the experiment is the biggest trial ever of iron fertilization , a technology which could theoretically help stop global warming at very little cost .
but following complaints by environmentalists , germany 's science ministry ordered the plan suspended while it conducted an urgent review .
" after careful a study of expert reports , i am convinced there are no scientific or legal objections to the german-indian marine research project , " research minister annette schavan said on monday , jan .

" i have therefore decided … to begin the experiment . "
opponents of the plan fear that the results could be catastrophic , worring that it would cause the sea to become more acidic or trigger algae blooms that would deprive large areas of the ocean of oxygen .
environment minister sigmar gabriel told schavan in a letter recently that the experiment " destroys germany 's credibility and its vanguard role in protecting biodiversity . "
massive carbon sink under the plan , the iron dust is to be sprinkled over an area of 300 square kilometers from a german research vessel , the polarstern .
it is hoped that algae living at the ocean surface will soak up the iron and reproduce rapidly , absorbing carbon dioxide from the surface water .

attempts by environmental groups to stop the project have failed . germany gave the green light on monday to a controversial plan with india to drop six tons of iron dust in the south atlantic .
the experiment is the biggest trial ever of iron fertilization , a technology which could theoretically help stop global warming at very little cost .
but following complaints by environmentalists , germany 's science ministry ordered the plan suspended while it conducted an urgent review .
" after careful a study of expert reports , i am convinced there are no scientific or legal objections to the german-indian marine research project , " research minister annette schavan said on monday , jan .
26 .
" i have therefore decided … to begin the experiment . "
opponents of the plan fear that the results could be catastrophic , worring that it would cause the sea to become more acidic or trigger algae blooms that would deprive large areas of the ocean of oxygen .
environment minister sigmar gabriel told schavan in a letter recently that the experiment " destroys germany 's credibility and its vanguard role in protecting biodiversity . "
massive carbon sink under the plan , the iron dust is to be sprinkled over an area of 300 square kilometers from a german research vessel , the polarstern .
it is hoped that algae living at the ocean surface will soak up the iron and reproduce rapidly , absorbing carbon dioxide from the surface water .
at the end of their life cycle the algae die and sink .
most of the carbon ends up in deep water or on the sea bottom .
the ocean absorbs more carbon dioxide from the air , reducing the greenhouse effect .
sequestering carbon this way might stop global warming .
thirty indian scientists and 18 from other nations left on board the polarstern from cape town on jan .

" if we play consistently from the first match onwards then we will become german champions and will go a long way in the champions league , " klinsmann said in an interview with the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- website published on monday .
" if every player gives it all he has and contributes to the team we will win a title or two .
the team plays faster and more attractive football -lrb- than last season -rrb- and we believe that it can do even better .
the buildup gives us reason for hope . "
title holders bayern are tied on points with league leaders hoffenheim as the second half of the season opens this week .
munich visit vfb stuttgart for a german cup tie on tuesday and open bundesliga action on friday night at third-placed sv hamburg .
their next champions league date is a knock-out round tie in february with portugal 's sporting lisbon , with the club seeking to recapture europe 's top prize it last won in 2001 .
klinsmann said he did n't mind such tough domestic tests after the seven-week hibernation period .
" of course things could be easier but such games are a good indicator because we will know where we stand .
i am convinced that we can have a successful start if all players are fit . "
munich had a stuttering start into the season but improved in the final weeks before the winter break .
klinsmann confident despite podolski departure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery has been an inspiration since joining bayern looking at the team led by french star franck ribery , klinsmann expressed his disappointment with germany forward lukas podolski who returns to cologne in summer after never being able to challenge first-choice players luca toni and miroslav klose .
" it 's a fact that lukas could n't deal with the situation in munich of being the forward number three , " said klinsmann , who nonetheless expressed his hope that podolski will regain his form in cologne .
the former germany coach klinsmann recharged his batteries during a two-week family holiday in california as he admitted his first months as club coach had been very demanding .
" it was very intense .
the life of a club coach is very different to that of a national team coach .
but i can say after half a year that my decision to go to munich was the right one , " he said .
it could be worse .
klinsmann could be coach at werder bremen .
after starting the season in barn-storming form , the northern german team have slipped down to eighth in the league , embroiled in scandals and arguments involving former squeaky-clean star diego .
they now face a lawsuit by former player ivan klasnic .
legal action over kidneys klasnic is to sue two doctors at bremen over his treatment for kidney problems that eventually led to two organ transplants , the news magazine der spiegel reported monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bremen favorite klasnic is suing the club the striker , who joined french side nantes this season , underwent two kidney transplant operations in early 2007 while still at bremen and accuses the club 's doctors of negligent treatment and medical mistakes .
the doctors reject the allegations .
according to the report , made available ahead of publication , attempts in the previous nine months to reach an out-of-court settlement have failed .
the 28-year-old forward is now looking for two million euros -lrb- $ 2.6 million -rrb- in compensation with the case due to be heard in a bremen court on april 17 .
croatian international klasnic scored 49 league goals for bremen between 2001 and 2007 for bremen as well as netting 20 times in the champions league .
diego gets club backing meanwhile bremen seem to be maintaining their patience with unsettled brazilian diego .
this season the modest 23-year-old playmaker has been finding himself increasingly in the headlines for reasons which have often had little to do with his prowess on the field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego ran out on bremen for the beijing olympics right at the beginning of the season diego ruffled a few bremen feathers by insisting on playing for brazil at the olympics in beijing , much against the will of the club who wanted him back for the bundesliga start .
there then followed some late training appearances and a loss of control on the pitch in december when he grabbed a karlsruhe player around the neck - an act which earned him a hefty club fine and sees him banned for four matches up to february 21 .
much has also been made in the german tabloid press of an alleged affair with pop singer sarah connor , although the player says the two are " just good friends . "
then last week began with headlines of a police car chase , with diego made to take a breathalyser test in bremen .
brazilian faces ban bremen sports director klaus allofs says the incident should not be blown out of proportion .
" diego is sorry .
he knows that he committed an offense and will have to live with the consequences that the test brings with it .
i do n't know if he will receive a driving ban or a fine , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's new wayward image comes with a ruffled look diego said he had to take a breath test , but denied reports of a car chase or that he drove through a red light .
" i came to a police control stop where i followed the orders of the authorities .
i was a bit shocked that there were three cars with blue lights flashing .
but the policemen were very nice to me , " he said .
german media reports said diego was over the legal alcohol limit of 50 milligrams of alcohol per liter of blood and could lose his driving license for a month , although diego insists he was not intoxicated , but had just had some wine .
allofs said : " he made a mistake in a part of his private life from which he will learn .
we were not pleased about the headlines and we discouraged his behavior .
but that has nothing to do with the debate about discipline within the team .
allofs says the recent negative headlines were also to do with the increased media attention in bremen , especially since diego 's liaison with sarah connor has put him in the paparazzi 's focus .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 26.01.2009 german government to crack down on business with iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's status as a major exporter to iran is under threat germany is set to crack down on export credit guarantees to german firms seeking to do business with iran and will only approve them in exceptional cases , according to a report published monday . the article in the german business newspaper handelsblatt cited government and industry sources as saying that chancellor angela merkel had responded to criticism from germany 's partners , including the united states and israel , about the continued strength of german exports to iran despite a tightening of western sanctions over its nuclear program . german firms receive " hermes cover " export credit guarantees when selling goods to markets considered risky .
but according to the report , merkel has instructed the economics ministry to put the brakes on this practice after statistics showed that exports had risen 10.5 percent on an annual basis to 3.58 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.63 billion -rrb- through november 2008 .
some 75 percent of all medium and small businesses in iran use german-made equipment . business and banking trade elements are not specifically forbidden under un security council sanctions , which only limit the sale of technology that could be used in the weapons industry . merkel has repeatedly insisted that germany is only obliged to obey the un sanctions and said earlier this month that germany was not planning to undertake any further unilateral action against iran at this time .
but pressure from within the western powers working towards a nuclear-free iran may have persuaded her otherwise . germany has also come under fire from sections of the us media for its policy towards trade with iran .
a recent commentary by editorial writer dan schwammenthal in the wall street journal was titled : " germany loves iran . "
schwammenthal wrote that germany was less worried about an iranian nuclear bomb than it was about tightening sanctions that could negatively affect trade between the two countries . as the new us administration under president barack obama prepares to break with the previous administration and talk with iran about its nuclear program , germany now appears more comfortable with applying more pressure of its own . germany steps up restrictions on trade guarantees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's move increases the pressure on german firms the announcement to issue trade guarantees only in exceptional cases is actually the next logical step in a policy germany has been executing in increments ever since the nuclear stand-off between the west and iran began . germany , traditionally one of the top exporters to iran , has been gradually reducing the numbers of export guarantees for the past three years . german businesses have seen a significant fall in export guarantees for trade with the islamic republic since last year .
the economics ministry said a year ago that new guarantees for iran fell to 503.4 million euros in 2007 from 1.16 billion in 2006 . half-year numbers for last year show a sharp decline in new guarantees to 73.4 million euros , compared to 387 million in the first half of 2007 with full figures for 2008 to be published in the coming weeks . western powers believe iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons under the cover of a civilian atomic program .
tehran says it wants to master nuclear technology for peaceful power generation purposes . reports in recent weeks have said european countries , including britain , france and germany , could seek to pass new sanctions against iran , which has rejected repeated calls from the u.n. security council for it to suspend uranium enrichment . germany 's decision to limit its trade guarantees could herald the start of a new set of restrictions on iran by western powers . eu removes iranian organization from terror list in other developments , european union foreign ministers removed the people 's mujahedin of iran -lrb- pmoi -rrb- from their list of terrorist organizations on monday , despite public protests in tehran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pmoi 's case has been heard before but ignored the widely expected move follows a ruling by the european court in luxembourg , which in december said the eu was wrong to keep the pmoi 's assets frozen after it was taken off a british list of terrorist organizations . " what we are doing today is abiding by the resolution of the european court .
there 's nothing we can do about that resolution , " eu foreign-policy chief javier solana said . founded in 1965 , the pmoi operated a military wing in its early years , but says it renounced violence in june 2001 and now advocates the political overthrow of iran 's current government . reports of the eu 's planned decision prompted street protests outside eu embassies in tehran over the weekend by hundreds of iranian students and relatives of veterans of the iran-iraq war -lrb- 1980-88 -rrb- . iran regards pmoi as a terrorist group owing to its involvement in the assassinations of several high-ranking iranian officials , including the president and prime minister in 1980 . after the group was expelled from france in the 1980s , former iraqi president saddam hussein allocated a military base to the pmoi near the border with iran . before the ouster of saddam , the pmoi frequently infiltrated iranian territory , leading to clashes with iranian forces and casualties on both sides . solana said the eu decision could only be reversed if new evidence against the pmoi was presented to the european courts . " if there is something new that may be presented in front of the court , we 'll see , " solana said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if we play consistently from the first match onwards then we will become german champions and will go a long way in the champions league , " klinsmann said in an interview with the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- website published on monday .
" if every player gives it all he has and contributes to the team we will win a title or two .
the team plays faster and more attractive football -lrb- than last season -rrb- and we believe that it can do even better .
the buildup gives us reason for hope . "
title holders bayern are tied on points with league leaders hoffenheim as the second half of the season opens this week .
munich visit vfb stuttgart for a german cup tie on tuesday and open bundesliga action on friday night at third-placed sv hamburg .
their next champions league date is a knock-out round tie in february with portugal 's sporting lisbon , with the club seeking to recapture europe 's top prize it last won in 2001 .
klinsmann said he did n't mind such tough domestic tests after the seven-week hibernation period .
" of course things could be easier but such games are a good indicator because we will know where we stand .
i am convinced that we can have a successful start if all players are fit . "
munich had a stuttering start into the season but improved in the final weeks before the winter break .
klinsmann confident despite podolski departure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery has been an inspiration since joining bayern looking at the team led by french star franck ribery , klinsmann expressed his disappointment with germany forward lukas podolski who returns to cologne in summer after never being able to challenge first-choice players luca toni and miroslav klose .
" it 's a fact that lukas could n't deal with the situation in munich of being the forward number three , " said klinsmann , who nonetheless expressed his hope that podolski will regain his form in cologne .
the former germany coach klinsmann recharged his batteries during a two-week family holiday in california as he admitted his first months as club coach had been very demanding .
" it was very intense .
the life of a club coach is very different to that of a national team coach .
but i can say after half a year that my decision to go to munich was the right one , " he said .
it could be worse .
klinsmann could be coach at werder bremen .
after starting the season in barn-storming form , the northern german team have slipped down to eighth in the league , embroiled in scandals and arguments involving former squeaky-clean star diego .
they now face a lawsuit by former player ivan klasnic .
legal action over kidneys klasnic is to sue two doctors at bremen over his treatment for kidney problems that eventually led to two organ transplants , the news magazine der spiegel reported monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bremen favorite klasnic is suing the club the striker , who joined french side nantes this season , underwent two kidney transplant operations in early 2007 while still at bremen and accuses the club 's doctors of negligent treatment and medical mistakes .
the doctors reject the allegations .
according to the report , made available ahead of publication , attempts in the previous nine months to reach an out-of-court settlement have failed .
the 28-year-old forward is now looking for two million euros -lrb- $ 2.6 million -rrb- in compensation with the case due to be heard in a bremen court on april 17 .
croatian international klasnic scored 49 league goals for bremen between 2001 and 2007 for bremen as well as netting 20 times in the champions league .
diego gets club backing meanwhile bremen seem to be maintaining their patience with unsettled brazilian diego .
this season the modest 23-year-old playmaker has been finding himself increasingly in the headlines for reasons which have often had little to do with his prowess on the field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego ran out on bremen for the beijing olympics right at the beginning of the season diego ruffled a few bremen feathers by insisting on playing for brazil at the olympics in beijing , much against the will of the club who wanted him back for the bundesliga start .
there then followed some late training appearances and a loss of control on the pitch in december when he grabbed a karlsruhe player around the neck - an act which earned him a hefty club fine and sees him banned for four matches up to february 21 .
much has also been made in the german tabloid press of an alleged affair with pop singer sarah connor , although the player says the two are " just good friends . "
then last week began with headlines of a police car chase , with diego made to take a breathalyser test in bremen .
brazilian faces ban bremen sports director klaus allofs says the incident should not be blown out of proportion .
" diego is sorry .
he knows that he committed an offense and will have to live with the consequences that the test brings with it .
i do n't know if he will receive a driving ban or a fine , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's new wayward image comes with a ruffled look diego said he had to take a breath test , but denied reports of a car chase or that he drove through a red light .
" i came to a police control stop where i followed the orders of the authorities .
i was a bit shocked that there were three cars with blue lights flashing .
but the policemen were very nice to me , " he said .
german media reports said diego was over the legal alcohol limit of 50 milligrams of alcohol per liter of blood and could lose his driving license for a month , although diego insists he was not intoxicated , but had just had some wine .
allofs said : " he made a mistake in a part of his private life from which he will learn .
we were not pleased about the headlines and we discouraged his behavior .
but that has nothing to do with the debate about discipline within the team .
allofs says the recent negative headlines were also to do with the increased media attention in bremen , especially since diego 's liaison with sarah connor has put him in the paparazzi 's focus .
" nevertheless , our players naturally have a function as a role model , " he said .
" and fundamentally , this should apply to everyone , even for diego : stay away from driving after enjoying alcohol . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it ’ s breaking up in space , though experts are confident it poses no risk . a german space expert has rejected concerns about an old nuclear-powered soviet satellite which is breaking up in space , saying its orbit appears stable and the fuel on board is not very radioactive anymore .
us space watchers highlighted the fate of cosmos 1818 two weeks ago .
a article in the january issue of orbital debris quarterly news , published by the us national aeronautics and space administration -lrb- nasa -rrb- , revealed it was strewing parts .
heiner klinkrad , a specialist in space junk at the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- office in darmstadt , germany , said in an interview with the dpa news agency that he saw no danger .
" the satellite is still in a stable orbit , " said klinkrad , who heads the esa department tracking orbital debris .
he said nasa 's space surveillance network was keeping it under observation .
no indication of an explosion the fragments were only moving away slowly from the satellite , which indicated there had not been any explosion on board .
" only a high-energy explosion would be capable of destabilizing its orbital path , " said klinkrad .
he suggested paint or other surface material was coming free , or a coolant system had sprung a leak , perhaps after impact by a piece of high-speed space junk .
launched by the former soviet union in february 1987 , the satellite was intended to evaluate a nuclear-reactor power supply .
it was still at an altitude of 800 kilometres and its orbit had not slowed , klinkrad said , adding that even if cosmos 1818 were to slow down and tumble to earth , this would be no disaster .
" the reactor on the satellite was shut down 20 years ago , " he said .
" in that time , the radioactivity in the idle reactor would have declined to less than one-thousandth of its original level . " dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , that it was providing 58 million euros -lrb- $ 74.3 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid to vulnerable palestinians this year . in a statement , eu aid commissioner louis michel said around 32 million euros would be earmarked for gaza , which suffered massive damage during a three-week bombing campaign by israel .
an additional 20 million euros are to go to the west bank , with the remaining six million destined for palestinian refugees in lebanon .
" this funding package of 58 million euros will contribute substantially to the international effort on behalf of these suffering people and will also sustain our ongoing solidarity with the entire palestinian population , " michel said .
calling the situation in gaza " catastrophic , " he said the strip 's civilian population of nearly 1.5 million had faced " terrible and unprecedented " suffering compared to past times of violence in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
" destruction on such a massive scale saddens me deeply , " michel said during a fact-finding visit to the gaza strip .
eu commissioner distributes responsibility equally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's michel blamed israel and hamas equally michel sharply criticized israel for the massive destruction he saw around him , but said also hamas bore an " overwhelming " part of the blame .
" we have to also recall the overwhelming responsibility of hamas , " michel told local reporters as he toured jabaliya , a crowded refugee camp north of gaza city which was hit hard in israel 's 22-day offensive .
" firing rockets at civilians is a terrorist action , " he said .
" i intentionally say this here , hamas is a terrorist movement and it has to be denounced as such , " he said .
he earlier strongly condemned israel for its destruction of the civilian infrastructure , as he inspected buildings in gaza destroyed in the israeli assault , including an ice-cream , a cookie and a soft-drink factory .
he said the destruction pointed at an obvious violation of international humanitarian law .
but the 61-year-old belgian , normally known as a staunch critic of israel , added that for progress in the peace process to be possible , hamas had to accept two " small conditions " - recognize israel 's right to exist and to abandon armed struggle .
eu offering to help stop smuggling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to help stop hamas rearming after the war meanwhile , eu foreign ministers met in brussels to discuss ways of helping israel counter arms smuggling destined for hamas into the gaza strip and ensure that the fragile ceasefire between israel and hamas holds .
ministers were expected to call on hamas to halt its rocket launches , ask israel to reopen border crossings into gaza and discuss an " effective mechanism to prevent the smuggling of arms and ammunition " to the strip , diplomats said .
france on friday announced that it was dispatching a helicopter- carrying frigate to the gaza coast , while britain has said its royal navy would also be prepared to help .
meanwhile , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in brussels that his country would send five experts with special equipment to help egypt uncover the tunnels allegedly used to smuggle arms into gaza .
however , egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit said in brussels late sunday that most of the arms smuggling was taking place by sea and not through his territory .
abul gheit was attending talks with eu foreign ministers and counterparts from the palestinian authority , turkey , jordan and norway as part of a diplomatic push by the eu to make its voice heard in the region .
on wednesday , eu diplomats held separate talks with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni , who insisted on the need to stop weapons being smuggled into the strip .
eu foreign-policy chief javier solana has also offered to redeploy monitors which used to patrol the rafah crossing between 2005 and 2007 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they finished bottom of the table behind immigrants from the former yugoslavia and africa -lrb- 3.2 -rrb- , the middle east -lrb- 4.1 -rrb- , southern europe -lrb- 4.4 -rrb- and the far east -lrb- 4.6 -rrb- .
the most integrated group in germany , according to the berlin institute , is immigrants from other eu countries who score 5.5 on the institute 's index .
the report 's assessment is based on results from several criteria including education , assimilation into society and employment to make up its index .
turks failing in education , assimilation and employment areas in the area of education , the study shows that 30 percent of students of turkish origin do not have a school leaving certificate and only 14 percent pass their final secondary school examinations .
in the state of saarland , 45 percent of turkish immigrants have failed to complete their high school education .
in terms of assimilation into society , turkish immigrants are marked down due to the fact that less than a third of turks born in germany have chosen to obtain german citizenship and 93 percent have married within the turkish community .
unemployment among turkish immigrants is high and many survive on state benefits while the reports shows a large number of turkish women remain in the home to manage the family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble defended the government 's integration record in an article in the german news magazine der spiegel , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble defended the german government 's initiatives to promote integration saying it was " on the right track " but added that more could be done .
" we must tell the socially weaker people , who have been isolated over generations : you are important , " schaeuble said .
" we value you .
you are as valuable as the others . "
some 15 million people in germany are foreigners or of foreign origin , including just under three million turks , representing just under 20 percent of the total population .

thailand energy minister wannarat charnukul , who is attending the opening ceremony , last week welcomed the launch of irena .
" we 've confronted some problems with solar energy development in thailand so we need some technology transfer from irena , " wannaret said .

the preliminary framework was drawn up in madrid in october 2008 .

26 , that it was providing 58 million euros -lrb- $ 74.3 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid to vulnerable palestinians this year . in a statement , eu aid commissioner louis michel said around 32 million euros would be earmarked for gaza , which suffered massive damage during a three-week bombing campaign by israel .
an additional 20 million euros are to go to the west bank , with the remaining six million destined for palestinian refugees in lebanon .
" this funding package of 58 million euros will contribute substantially to the international effort on behalf of these suffering people and will also sustain our ongoing solidarity with the entire palestinian population , " michel said .
calling the situation in gaza " catastrophic , " he said the strip 's civilian population of nearly 1.5 million had faced " terrible and unprecedented " suffering compared to past times of violence in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
" destruction on such a massive scale saddens me deeply , " michel said during a fact-finding visit to the gaza strip .
eu commissioner distributes responsibility equally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's michel blamed israel and hamas equally michel sharply criticized israel for the massive destruction he saw around him , but said also hamas bore an " overwhelming " part of the blame .
" we have to also recall the overwhelming responsibility of hamas , " michel told local reporters as he toured jabaliya , a crowded refugee camp north of gaza city which was hit hard in israel 's 22-day offensive .
" firing rockets at civilians is a terrorist action , " he said .
" i intentionally say this here , hamas is a terrorist movement and it has to be denounced as such , " he said .
he earlier strongly condemned israel for its destruction of the civilian infrastructure , as he inspected buildings in gaza destroyed in the israeli assault , including an ice-cream , a cookie and a soft-drink factory .
he said the destruction pointed at an obvious violation of international humanitarian law .
but the 61-year-old belgian , normally known as a staunch critic of israel , added that for progress in the peace process to be possible , hamas had to accept two " small conditions " - recognize israel 's right to exist and to abandon armed struggle .
eu offering to help stop smuggling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to help stop hamas rearming after the war meanwhile , eu foreign ministers met in brussels to discuss ways of helping israel counter arms smuggling destined for hamas into the gaza strip and ensure that the fragile ceasefire between israel and hamas holds .
ministers were expected to call on hamas to halt its rocket launches , ask israel to reopen border crossings into gaza and discuss an " effective mechanism to prevent the smuggling of arms and ammunition " to the strip , diplomats said .
france on friday announced that it was dispatching a helicopter- carrying frigate to the gaza coast , while britain has said its royal navy would also be prepared to help .
meanwhile , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in brussels that his country would send five experts with special equipment to help egypt uncover the tunnels allegedly used to smuggle arms into gaza .
however , egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit said in brussels late sunday that most of the arms smuggling was taking place by sea and not through his territory .
abul gheit was attending talks with eu foreign ministers and counterparts from the palestinian authority , turkey , jordan and norway as part of a diplomatic push by the eu to make its voice heard in the region .
on wednesday , eu diplomats held separate talks with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni , who insisted on the need to stop weapons being smuggled into the strip .

they finished bottom of the table behind immigrants from the former yugoslavia and africa -lrb- 3.2 -rrb- , the middle east -lrb- 4.1 -rrb- , southern europe -lrb- 4.4 -rrb- and the far east -lrb- 4.6 -rrb- .
the most integrated group in germany , according to the berlin institute , is immigrants from other eu countries who score 5.5 on the institute 's index .
the report 's assessment is based on results from several criteria including education , assimilation into society and employment to make up its index .
turks failing in education , assimilation and employment areas in the area of education , the study shows that 30 percent of students of turkish origin do not have a school leaving certificate and only 14 percent pass their final secondary school examinations .
in the state of saarland , 45 percent of turkish immigrants have failed to complete their high school education .
in terms of assimilation into society , turkish immigrants are marked down due to the fact that less than a third of turks born in germany have chosen to obtain german citizenship and 93 percent have married within the turkish community .
unemployment among turkish immigrants is high and many survive on state benefits while the reports shows a large number of turkish women remain in the home to manage the family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble defended the government 's integration record in an article in the german news magazine der spiegel , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble defended the german government 's initiatives to promote integration saying it was " on the right track " but added that more could be done .
" we must tell the socially weaker people , who have been isolated over generations : you are important , " schaeuble said .
" we value you .
you are as valuable as the others . "
some 15 million people in germany are foreigners or of foreign origin , including just under three million turks , representing just under 20 percent of the total population .
the largest group , statistically , are germans repatriated from the former soviet union following its collapse and german reunification . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de poll : most turks in germany feel unwelcome over half of turks living in germany feel like unwanted guests .
the survey was released ahead of the german islam conference on thursday , march 13 , where the thorny topic of integration tops the agenda .

it suggested a job quota as a step in the right direction .
-lrb- 01.03.2008 -rrb- low rate of german-turkish marriages impedes integration many german turks are pressured to marry only within their ethnic and religious group .
but the practice of " importing " partners from turkey creates new immigrants and stands in the way of integration .

it ’ s breaking up in space , though experts are confident it poses no risk . a german space expert has rejected concerns about an old nuclear-powered soviet satellite which is breaking up in space , saying its orbit appears stable and the fuel on board is not very radioactive anymore .
us space watchers highlighted the fate of cosmos 1818 two weeks ago .
a article in the january issue of orbital debris quarterly news , published by the us national aeronautics and space administration -lrb- nasa -rrb- , revealed it was strewing parts .
heiner klinkrad , a specialist in space junk at the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- office in darmstadt , germany , said in an interview with the dpa news agency that he saw no danger .
" the satellite is still in a stable orbit , " said klinkrad , who heads the esa department tracking orbital debris .
he said nasa 's space surveillance network was keeping it under observation .
no indication of an explosion the fragments were only moving away slowly from the satellite , which indicated there had not been any explosion on board .
" only a high-energy explosion would be capable of destabilizing its orbital path , " said klinkrad .
he suggested paint or other surface material was coming free , or a coolant system had sprung a leak , perhaps after impact by a piece of high-speed space junk .
launched by the former soviet union in february 1987 , the satellite was intended to evaluate a nuclear-reactor power supply .
it was still at an altitude of 800 kilometres and its orbit had not slowed , klinkrad said , adding that even if cosmos 1818 were to slow down and tumble to earth , this would be no disaster .
" the reactor on the satellite was shut down 20 years ago , " he said .

the most integrated group in germany , according to the berlin institute , is immigrants from other eu countries who score 5.5 on the institute 's index .
the report 's assessment is based on results from several criteria including education , assimilation into society and employment to make up its index .
turks failing in education , assimilation and employment areas in the area of education , the study shows that 30 percent of students of turkish origin do not have a school leaving certificate and only 14 percent pass their final secondary school examinations .

in terms of assimilation into society , turkish immigrants are marked down due to the fact that less than a third of turks born in germany have chosen to obtain german citizenship and 93 percent have married within the turkish community .
unemployment among turkish immigrants is high and many survive on state benefits while the reports shows a large number of turkish women remain in the home to manage the family .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 26.01.2009 german government to crack down on business with iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's status as a major exporter to iran is under threat germany is set to crack down on export credit guarantees to german firms seeking to do business with iran and will only approve them in exceptional cases , according to a report published monday . the article in the german business newspaper handelsblatt cited government and industry sources as saying that chancellor angela merkel had responded to criticism from germany 's partners , including the united states and israel , about the continued strength of german exports to iran despite a tightening of western sanctions over its nuclear program . german firms receive " hermes cover " export credit guarantees when selling goods to markets considered risky .
but according to the report , merkel has instructed the economics ministry to put the brakes on this practice after statistics showed that exports had risen 10.5 percent on an annual basis to 3.58 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.63 billion -rrb- through november 2008 .
some 75 percent of all medium and small businesses in iran use german-made equipment . business and banking trade elements are not specifically forbidden under un security council sanctions , which only limit the sale of technology that could be used in the weapons industry . merkel has repeatedly insisted that germany is only obliged to obey the un sanctions and said earlier this month that germany was not planning to undertake any further unilateral action against iran at this time .
but pressure from within the western powers working towards a nuclear-free iran may have persuaded her otherwise . germany has also come under fire from sections of the us media for its policy towards trade with iran .
a recent commentary by editorial writer dan schwammenthal in the wall street journal was titled : " germany loves iran . "
schwammenthal wrote that germany was less worried about an iranian nuclear bomb than it was about tightening sanctions that could negatively affect trade between the two countries . as the new us administration under president barack obama prepares to break with the previous administration and talk with iran about its nuclear program , germany now appears more comfortable with applying more pressure of its own . germany steps up restrictions on trade guarantees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's move increases the pressure on german firms the announcement to issue trade guarantees only in exceptional cases is actually the next logical step in a policy germany has been executing in increments ever since the nuclear stand-off between the west and iran began . germany , traditionally one of the top exporters to iran , has been gradually reducing the numbers of export guarantees for the past three years . german businesses have seen a significant fall in export guarantees for trade with the islamic republic since last year .
the economics ministry said a year ago that new guarantees for iran fell to 503.4 million euros in 2007 from 1.16 billion in 2006 . half-year numbers for last year show a sharp decline in new guarantees to 73.4 million euros , compared to 387 million in the first half of 2007 with full figures for 2008 to be published in the coming weeks . western powers believe iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons under the cover of a civilian atomic program .
tehran says it wants to master nuclear technology for peaceful power generation purposes . reports in recent weeks have said european countries , including britain , france and germany , could seek to pass new sanctions against iran , which has rejected repeated calls from the u.n. security council for it to suspend uranium enrichment . germany 's decision to limit its trade guarantees could herald the start of a new set of restrictions on iran by western powers . eu removes iranian organization from terror list in other developments , european union foreign ministers removed the people 's mujahedin of iran -lrb- pmoi -rrb- from their list of terrorist organizations on monday , despite public protests in tehran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pmoi 's case has been heard before but ignored the widely expected move follows a ruling by the european court in luxembourg , which in december said the eu was wrong to keep the pmoi 's assets frozen after it was taken off a british list of terrorist organizations . " what we are doing today is abiding by the resolution of the european court .
there 's nothing we can do about that resolution , " eu foreign-policy chief javier solana said . founded in 1965 , the pmoi operated a military wing in its early years , but says it renounced violence in june 2001 and now advocates the political overthrow of iran 's current government . reports of the eu 's planned decision prompted street protests outside eu embassies in tehran over the weekend by hundreds of iranian students and relatives of veterans of the iran-iraq war -lrb- 1980-88 -rrb- . iran regards pmoi as a terrorist group owing to its involvement in the assassinations of several high-ranking iranian officials , including the president and prime minister in 1980 . after the group was expelled from france in the 1980s , former iraqi president saddam hussein allocated a military base to the pmoi near the border with iran . before the ouster of saddam , the pmoi frequently infiltrated iranian territory , leading to clashes with iranian forces and casualties on both sides . solana said the eu decision could only be reversed if new evidence against the pmoi was presented to the european courts . " if there is something new that may be presented in front of the court , we 'll see , " solana said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since then , german prosecutors have recovered more than 150 million euros -lrb- $ 194 million -rrb- from taxpayers hoping to avoid being taken to trial .
german tax authorities believe that more than 4 billion euros was being hidden in liechtenstein .

zumwinkel , named manager magazine 's 2003 " executive of the year " for his work at transforming deutsche post from a bloated state monopoly into one of the world 's largest logistics companies , admitted that he had made the " biggest mistake of my life . "
" i am not going to beat around the bush : i am guilty of what i am accused of , " zumwinkel told the court on the trial 's first day .
" my career had a bitter end .
my job was my life . "
zumwinkel barely avoided jail .
in december , the federal court of justice ruled that tax crimes of more than 1 million euros would automatically land an offender in jail .
zumwinkel was originally accused of hiding 1.2 million euros , but the court in bochum announced it would only bring charges on activities since 2002 , meaning the sum involved came in just under the one-million euro mark .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 26.01.2009 klinsmann insists much-improved bayern can challenge for titles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann is enjoying more good times than bad as the season progresses bayern munich have steadily improved since the start of the season and can play a major role in germany and europe if they can keep up the momentum , coach juergen klinsmann said . " if we play consistently from the first match onwards then we will become german champions and will go a long way in the champions league , " klinsmann said in an interview with the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- website published on monday .
" if every player gives it all he has and contributes to the team we will win a title or two .
the team plays faster and more attractive football -lrb- than last season -rrb- and we believe that it can do even better .
the buildup gives us reason for hope . "
title holders bayern are tied on points with league leaders hoffenheim as the second half of the season opens this week .
munich visit vfb stuttgart for a german cup tie on tuesday and open bundesliga action on friday night at third-placed sv hamburg .
their next champions league date is a knock-out round tie in february with portugal 's sporting lisbon , with the club seeking to recapture europe 's top prize it last won in 2001 .
klinsmann said he did n't mind such tough domestic tests after the seven-week hibernation period .
" of course things could be easier but such games are a good indicator because we will know where we stand .
i am convinced that we can have a successful start if all players are fit . "
munich had a stuttering start into the season but improved in the final weeks before the winter break .
klinsmann confident despite podolski departure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery has been an inspiration since joining bayern looking at the team led by french star franck ribery , klinsmann expressed his disappointment with germany forward lukas podolski who returns to cologne in summer after never being able to challenge first-choice players luca toni and miroslav klose .
" it 's a fact that lukas could n't deal with the situation in munich of being the forward number three , " said klinsmann , who nonetheless expressed his hope that podolski will regain his form in cologne .
the former germany coach klinsmann recharged his batteries during a two-week family holiday in california as he admitted his first months as club coach had been very demanding .
" it was very intense .
the life of a club coach is very different to that of a national team coach .
but i can say after half a year that my decision to go to munich was the right one , " he said .
it could be worse .
klinsmann could be coach at werder bremen .
after starting the season in barn-storming form , the northern german team have slipped down to eighth in the league , embroiled in scandals and arguments involving former squeaky-clean star diego .
they now face a lawsuit by former player ivan klasnic .
legal action over kidneys klasnic is to sue two doctors at bremen over his treatment for kidney problems that eventually led to two organ transplants , the news magazine der spiegel reported monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bremen favorite klasnic is suing the club the striker , who joined french side nantes this season , underwent two kidney transplant operations in early 2007 while still at bremen and accuses the club 's doctors of negligent treatment and medical mistakes .
the doctors reject the allegations .
according to the report , made available ahead of publication , attempts in the previous nine months to reach an out-of-court settlement have failed .
the 28-year-old forward is now looking for two million euros -lrb- $ 2.6 million -rrb- in compensation with the case due to be heard in a bremen court on april 17 .
croatian international klasnic scored 49 league goals for bremen between 2001 and 2007 for bremen as well as netting 20 times in the champions league .
diego gets club backing meanwhile bremen seem to be maintaining their patience with unsettled brazilian diego .
this season the modest 23-year-old playmaker has been finding himself increasingly in the headlines for reasons which have often had little to do with his prowess on the field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego ran out on bremen for the beijing olympics right at the beginning of the season diego ruffled a few bremen feathers by insisting on playing for brazil at the olympics in beijing , much against the will of the club who wanted him back for the bundesliga start .
there then followed some late training appearances and a loss of control on the pitch in december when he grabbed a karlsruhe player around the neck - an act which earned him a hefty club fine and sees him banned for four matches up to february 21 .
much has also been made in the german tabloid press of an alleged affair with pop singer sarah connor , although the player says the two are " just good friends . "
then last week began with headlines of a police car chase , with diego made to take a breathalyser test in bremen .
brazilian faces ban bremen sports director klaus allofs says the incident should not be blown out of proportion .
" diego is sorry .
he knows that he committed an offense and will have to live with the consequences that the test brings with it .
i do n't know if he will receive a driving ban or a fine , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's new wayward image comes with a ruffled look diego said he had to take a breath test , but denied reports of a car chase or that he drove through a red light .
" i came to a police control stop where i followed the orders of the authorities .
i was a bit shocked that there were three cars with blue lights flashing .
but the policemen were very nice to me , " he said .
german media reports said diego was over the legal alcohol limit of 50 milligrams of alcohol per liter of blood and could lose his driving license for a month , although diego insists he was not intoxicated , but had just had some wine .
allofs said : " he made a mistake in a part of his private life from which he will learn .
we were not pleased about the headlines and we discouraged his behavior .
but that has nothing to do with the debate about discipline within the team .
allofs says the recent negative headlines were also to do with the increased media attention in bremen , especially since diego 's liaison with sarah connor has put him in the paparazzi 's focus .
" nevertheless , our players naturally have a function as a role model , " he said .
" and fundamentally , this should apply to everyone , even for diego : stay away from driving after enjoying alcohol . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , that it was providing 58 million euros -lrb- $ 74.3 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid to vulnerable palestinians this year . in a statement , eu aid commissioner louis michel said around 32 million euros would be earmarked for gaza , which suffered massive damage during a three-week bombing campaign by israel .
an additional 20 million euros are to go to the west bank , with the remaining six million destined for palestinian refugees in lebanon .
" this funding package of 58 million euros will contribute substantially to the international effort on behalf of these suffering people and will also sustain our ongoing solidarity with the entire palestinian population , " michel said .
calling the situation in gaza " catastrophic , " he said the strip 's civilian population of nearly 1.5 million had faced " terrible and unprecedented " suffering compared to past times of violence in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
" destruction on such a massive scale saddens me deeply , " michel said during a fact-finding visit to the gaza strip .
eu commissioner distributes responsibility equally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's michel blamed israel and hamas equally michel sharply criticized israel for the massive destruction he saw around him , but said also hamas bore an " overwhelming " part of the blame .
" we have to also recall the overwhelming responsibility of hamas , " michel told local reporters as he toured jabaliya , a crowded refugee camp north of gaza city which was hit hard in israel 's 22-day offensive .
" firing rockets at civilians is a terrorist action , " he said .
" i intentionally say this here , hamas is a terrorist movement and it has to be denounced as such , " he said .
he earlier strongly condemned israel for its destruction of the civilian infrastructure , as he inspected buildings in gaza destroyed in the israeli assault , including an ice-cream , a cookie and a soft-drink factory .
he said the destruction pointed at an obvious violation of international humanitarian law .
but the 61-year-old belgian , normally known as a staunch critic of israel , added that for progress in the peace process to be possible , hamas had to accept two " small conditions " - recognize israel 's right to exist and to abandon armed struggle .
eu offering to help stop smuggling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to help stop hamas rearming after the war meanwhile , eu foreign ministers met in brussels to discuss ways of helping israel counter arms smuggling destined for hamas into the gaza strip and ensure that the fragile ceasefire between israel and hamas holds .
ministers were expected to call on hamas to halt its rocket launches , ask israel to reopen border crossings into gaza and discuss an " effective mechanism to prevent the smuggling of arms and ammunition " to the strip , diplomats said .
france on friday announced that it was dispatching a helicopter- carrying frigate to the gaza coast , while britain has said its royal navy would also be prepared to help .
meanwhile , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in brussels that his country would send five experts with special equipment to help egypt uncover the tunnels allegedly used to smuggle arms into gaza .
however , egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit said in brussels late sunday that most of the arms smuggling was taking place by sea and not through his territory .
abul gheit was attending talks with eu foreign ministers and counterparts from the palestinian authority , turkey , jordan and norway as part of a diplomatic push by the eu to make its voice heard in the region .
on wednesday , eu diplomats held separate talks with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni , who insisted on the need to stop weapons being smuggled into the strip .
eu foreign-policy chief javier solana has also offered to redeploy monitors which used to patrol the rafah crossing between 2005 and 2007 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but will they succeed ? staging an event that has become known at least as much for its elaborate parties as for its deep debates in the middle of the worst economic crisis in recent memory is no small feat .
but the world economic forum has adapted .
according to swiss media , companies have seriously scaled down their party portfolios .
instead of caviar and lobster , it 's now ham and cheese .
at exclusive events , guests now have to toast with ordinary champagne instead of the usual dom perignon .
and at less fancy gatherings , the champagne is scrapped altogether in favor of a good old glass of white wine .
mixed expectations instead of glamour and glitter , substance is supposed to be king at the world economic forum 2009 .
to that end , global business and government leaders will be given the task of sketching a post-crisis world .
still , expectations for davos are mixed .
" actually , we do n't expect very much , " said alexis passadakis from the german section of the anti-globalization group attac .
" those people who meet in davos are those who are responsible for the world economic crisis we are facing now .
the governments and the companies who meet there were responsible for the liberalization of world trade and world finance and are responsible for what 's happening now , " passadakis said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-werner sinn some business experts would beg to differ .

" we have lots of countries which are not represented in the g20 or g8 meetings so they have an opportunity to meet now and also raise their voice and there are some important people also coming to this event so i find it basically very fruitful . "
broad range of topics and debate they surely will in davos .
during 57 sessions , participants will tackle issues ranging from climate change and new business models to sustainable development , which are all important and worth talking about .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 26.01.2009 german government to crack down on business with iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's status as a major exporter to iran is under threat germany is set to crack down on export credit guarantees to german firms seeking to do business with iran and will only approve them in exceptional cases , according to a report published monday . the article in the german business newspaper handelsblatt cited government and industry sources as saying that chancellor angela merkel had responded to criticism from germany 's partners , including the united states and israel , about the continued strength of german exports to iran despite a tightening of western sanctions over its nuclear program . german firms receive " hermes cover " export credit guarantees when selling goods to markets considered risky .
but according to the report , merkel has instructed the economics ministry to put the brakes on this practice after statistics showed that exports had risen 10.5 percent on an annual basis to 3.58 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.63 billion -rrb- through november 2008 .
some 75 percent of all medium and small businesses in iran use german-made equipment . business and banking trade elements are not specifically forbidden under un security council sanctions , which only limit the sale of technology that could be used in the weapons industry . merkel has repeatedly insisted that germany is only obliged to obey the un sanctions and said earlier this month that germany was not planning to undertake any further unilateral action against iran at this time .
but pressure from within the western powers working towards a nuclear-free iran may have persuaded her otherwise . germany has also come under fire from sections of the us media for its policy towards trade with iran .
a recent commentary by editorial writer dan schwammenthal in the wall street journal was titled : " germany loves iran . "
schwammenthal wrote that germany was less worried about an iranian nuclear bomb than it was about tightening sanctions that could negatively affect trade between the two countries . as the new us administration under president barack obama prepares to break with the previous administration and talk with iran about its nuclear program , germany now appears more comfortable with applying more pressure of its own . germany steps up restrictions on trade guarantees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's move increases the pressure on german firms the announcement to issue trade guarantees only in exceptional cases is actually the next logical step in a policy germany has been executing in increments ever since the nuclear stand-off between the west and iran began . germany , traditionally one of the top exporters to iran , has been gradually reducing the numbers of export guarantees for the past three years . german businesses have seen a significant fall in export guarantees for trade with the islamic republic since last year .
the economics ministry said a year ago that new guarantees for iran fell to 503.4 million euros in 2007 from 1.16 billion in 2006 . half-year numbers for last year show a sharp decline in new guarantees to 73.4 million euros , compared to 387 million in the first half of 2007 with full figures for 2008 to be published in the coming weeks . western powers believe iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons under the cover of a civilian atomic program .

but according to the report , merkel has instructed the economics ministry to put the brakes on this practice after statistics showed that exports had risen 10.5 percent on an annual basis to 3.58 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.63 billion -rrb- through november 2008 .
some 75 percent of all medium and small businesses in iran use german-made equipment . business and banking trade elements are not specifically forbidden under un security council sanctions , which only limit the sale of technology that could be used in the weapons industry . merkel has repeatedly insisted that germany is only obliged to obey the un sanctions and said earlier this month that germany was not planning to undertake any further unilateral action against iran at this time .
but pressure from within the western powers working towards a nuclear-free iran may have persuaded her otherwise . germany has also come under fire from sections of the us media for its policy towards trade with iran .
a recent commentary by editorial writer dan schwammenthal in the wall street journal was titled : " germany loves iran . "
schwammenthal wrote that germany was less worried about an iranian nuclear bomb than it was about tightening sanctions that could negatively affect trade between the two countries . as the new us administration under president barack obama prepares to break with the previous administration and talk with iran about its nuclear program , germany now appears more comfortable with applying more pressure of its own . germany steps up restrictions on trade guarantees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's move increases the pressure on german firms the announcement to issue trade guarantees only in exceptional cases is actually the next logical step in a policy germany has been executing in increments ever since the nuclear stand-off between the west and iran began . germany , traditionally one of the top exporters to iran , has been gradually reducing the numbers of export guarantees for the past three years . german businesses have seen a significant fall in export guarantees for trade with the islamic republic since last year .
the economics ministry said a year ago that new guarantees for iran fell to 503.4 million euros in 2007 from 1.16 billion in 2006 . half-year numbers for last year show a sharp decline in new guarantees to 73.4 million euros , compared to 387 million in the first half of 2007 with full figures for 2008 to be published in the coming weeks . western powers believe iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons under the cover of a civilian atomic program .
tehran says it wants to master nuclear technology for peaceful power generation purposes . reports in recent weeks have said european countries , including britain , france and germany , could seek to pass new sanctions against iran , which has rejected repeated calls from the u.n. security council for it to suspend uranium enrichment . germany 's decision to limit its trade guarantees could herald the start of a new set of restrictions on iran by western powers . eu removes iranian organization from terror list in other developments , european union foreign ministers removed the people 's mujahedin of iran -lrb- pmoi -rrb- from their list of terrorist organizations on monday , despite public protests in tehran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pmoi 's case has been heard before but ignored the widely expected move follows a ruling by the european court in luxembourg , which in december said the eu was wrong to keep the pmoi 's assets frozen after it was taken off a british list of terrorist organizations .

it ’ s breaking up in space , though experts are confident it poses no risk . a german space expert has rejected concerns about an old nuclear-powered soviet satellite which is breaking up in space , saying its orbit appears stable and the fuel on board is not very radioactive anymore .
us space watchers highlighted the fate of cosmos 1818 two weeks ago .
a article in the january issue of orbital debris quarterly news , published by the us national aeronautics and space administration -lrb- nasa -rrb- , revealed it was strewing parts .
heiner klinkrad , a specialist in space junk at the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- office in darmstadt , germany , said in an interview with the dpa news agency that he saw no danger .
" the satellite is still in a stable orbit , " said klinkrad , who heads the esa department tracking orbital debris .
he said nasa 's space surveillance network was keeping it under observation .
no indication of an explosion the fragments were only moving away slowly from the satellite , which indicated there had not been any explosion on board .
" only a high-energy explosion would be capable of destabilizing its orbital path , " said klinkrad .
he suggested paint or other surface material was coming free , or a coolant system had sprung a leak , perhaps after impact by a piece of high-speed space junk .
launched by the former soviet union in february 1987 , the satellite was intended to evaluate a nuclear-reactor power supply .
it was still at an altitude of 800 kilometres and its orbit had not slowed , klinkrad said , adding that even if cosmos 1818 were to slow down and tumble to earth , this would be no disaster .

but according to the report , merkel has instructed the economics ministry to put the brakes on this practice after statistics showed that exports had risen 10.5 percent on an annual basis to 3.58 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.63 billion -rrb- through november 2008 .
some 75 percent of all medium and small businesses in iran use german-made equipment . business and banking trade elements are not specifically forbidden under un security council sanctions , which only limit the sale of technology that could be used in the weapons industry . merkel has repeatedly insisted that germany is only obliged to obey the un sanctions and said earlier this month that germany was not planning to undertake any further unilateral action against iran at this time .
but pressure from within the western powers working towards a nuclear-free iran may have persuaded her otherwise . germany has also come under fire from sections of the us media for its policy towards trade with iran .
a recent commentary by editorial writer dan schwammenthal in the wall street journal was titled : " germany loves iran . "
schwammenthal wrote that germany was less worried about an iranian nuclear bomb than it was about tightening sanctions that could negatively affect trade between the two countries . as the new us administration under president barack obama prepares to break with the previous administration and talk with iran about its nuclear program , germany now appears more comfortable with applying more pressure of its own . germany steps up restrictions on trade guarantees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's move increases the pressure on german firms the announcement to issue trade guarantees only in exceptional cases is actually the next logical step in a policy germany has been executing in increments ever since the nuclear stand-off between the west and iran began . germany , traditionally one of the top exporters to iran , has been gradually reducing the numbers of export guarantees for the past three years . german businesses have seen a significant fall in export guarantees for trade with the islamic republic since last year .
the economics ministry said a year ago that new guarantees for iran fell to 503.4 million euros in 2007 from 1.16 billion in 2006 . half-year numbers for last year show a sharp decline in new guarantees to 73.4 million euros , compared to 387 million in the first half of 2007 with full figures for 2008 to be published in the coming weeks . western powers believe iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons under the cover of a civilian atomic program .

it ’ s breaking up in space , though experts are confident it poses no risk . a german space expert has rejected concerns about an old nuclear-powered soviet satellite which is breaking up in space , saying its orbit appears stable and the fuel on board is not very radioactive anymore .
us space watchers highlighted the fate of cosmos 1818 two weeks ago .
a article in the january issue of orbital debris quarterly news , published by the us national aeronautics and space administration -lrb- nasa -rrb- , revealed it was strewing parts .
heiner klinkrad , a specialist in space junk at the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- office in darmstadt , germany , said in an interview with the dpa news agency that he saw no danger .
" the satellite is still in a stable orbit , " said klinkrad , who heads the esa department tracking orbital debris .
he said nasa 's space surveillance network was keeping it under observation .
no indication of an explosion the fragments were only moving away slowly from the satellite , which indicated there had not been any explosion on board .
" only a high-energy explosion would be capable of destabilizing its orbital path , " said klinkrad .
he suggested paint or other surface material was coming free , or a coolant system had sprung a leak , perhaps after impact by a piece of high-speed space junk .
launched by the former soviet union in february 1987 , the satellite was intended to evaluate a nuclear-reactor power supply .
it was still at an altitude of 800 kilometres and its orbit had not slowed , klinkrad said , adding that even if cosmos 1818 were to slow down and tumble to earth , this would be no disaster .
" the reactor on the satellite was shut down 20 years ago , " he said .
" in that time , the radioactivity in the idle reactor would have declined to less than one-thousandth of its original level . " dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" only a high-energy explosion would be capable of destabilizing its orbital path , " said klinkrad .
he suggested paint or other surface material was coming free , or a coolant system had sprung a leak , perhaps after impact by a piece of high-speed space junk .
launched by the former soviet union in february 1987 , the satellite was intended to evaluate a nuclear-reactor power supply .
it was still at an altitude of 800 kilometres and its orbit had not slowed , klinkrad said , adding that even if cosmos 1818 were to slow down and tumble to earth , this would be no disaster .
" the reactor on the satellite was shut down 20 years ago , " he said .
" in that time , the radioactivity in the idle reactor would have declined to less than one-thousandth of its original level . " dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new eco-energy agency has been created in germany to help nations do just that . a new organization promoting the development and use of renewable energies was launched monday in the former german capital , bonn .
the international renewable energy agency -lrb- irena -rrb- will advise industrialized and developing nations on ways of reducing their dependency on oil , coal and gas .
speaking at the opening event , german environment minister sigmar gabriel said the potential for renewable energies is huge , and needs more help to achieve a global breakthrough .
" irena will be the new mouthpiece for renewable energies , " he said .
around 75 states signed the founding document , while representatives from a further 25 countries were in bonn for the occasion .
a driving force for renewable energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister sigmar gabriel is confident the agency will make a difference the united states is not signing the treaty , although the us is expected to invest more in renewable energy sources under president barack obama .
irena is intended to provide a counterbalance to the international energy agency and the international atomic energy agency , by becoming a driving force behind renewable technologies such as sun , wind , water and geothermal energy sources .
the organization aims to facilitate the transfer of renewable technologies to developing countries rich in renewable energy resources , such as sunshine .
environmentally friendly and lucrative bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister sigmar gabriel opened the conference with his spanish and danish counterparts germany , one of the world 's leading developers in solar energy , stands to benefit not just from the environmental do-good factor , as irena could lead to lucrative partnerships with developing countries .
german deputy foreign minister gernot erler said the development of renewable energies would offer economic opportunities , adding that " germany in particular is well positioned with its outstanding environmental technology . "
thailand energy minister wannarat charnukul , who is attending the opening ceremony , last week welcomed the launch of irena .
" we 've confronted some problems with solar energy development in thailand so we need some technology transfer from irena , " wannaret said .
germany , spain and denmark initially campaigned for the foundation of a renewable energy organisation .
the preliminary framework was drawn up in madrid in october 2008 .
the city of bonn , which has developed into a centre for environment and sustainable development , is bidding to host irena 's headquarters . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , that it was providing 58 million euros -lrb- $ 74.3 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid to vulnerable palestinians this year . in a statement , eu aid commissioner louis michel said around 32 million euros would be earmarked for gaza , which suffered massive damage during a three-week bombing campaign by israel .
an additional 20 million euros are to go to the west bank , with the remaining six million destined for palestinian refugees in lebanon .
" this funding package of 58 million euros will contribute substantially to the international effort on behalf of these suffering people and will also sustain our ongoing solidarity with the entire palestinian population , " michel said .
calling the situation in gaza " catastrophic , " he said the strip 's civilian population of nearly 1.5 million had faced " terrible and unprecedented " suffering compared to past times of violence in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
" destruction on such a massive scale saddens me deeply , " michel said during a fact-finding visit to the gaza strip .
eu commissioner distributes responsibility equally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's michel blamed israel and hamas equally michel sharply criticized israel for the massive destruction he saw around him , but said also hamas bore an " overwhelming " part of the blame .
" we have to also recall the overwhelming responsibility of hamas , " michel told local reporters as he toured jabaliya , a crowded refugee camp north of gaza city which was hit hard in israel 's 22-day offensive .
" firing rockets at civilians is a terrorist action , " he said .
" i intentionally say this here , hamas is a terrorist movement and it has to be denounced as such , " he said .
he earlier strongly condemned israel for its destruction of the civilian infrastructure , as he inspected buildings in gaza destroyed in the israeli assault , including an ice-cream , a cookie and a soft-drink factory .
he said the destruction pointed at an obvious violation of international humanitarian law .
but the 61-year-old belgian , normally known as a staunch critic of israel , added that for progress in the peace process to be possible , hamas had to accept two " small conditions " - recognize israel 's right to exist and to abandon armed struggle .
eu offering to help stop smuggling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to help stop hamas rearming after the war meanwhile , eu foreign ministers met in brussels to discuss ways of helping israel counter arms smuggling destined for hamas into the gaza strip and ensure that the fragile ceasefire between israel and hamas holds .
ministers were expected to call on hamas to halt its rocket launches , ask israel to reopen border crossings into gaza and discuss an " effective mechanism to prevent the smuggling of arms and ammunition " to the strip , diplomats said .
france on friday announced that it was dispatching a helicopter- carrying frigate to the gaza coast , while britain has said its royal navy would also be prepared to help .
meanwhile , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in brussels that his country would send five experts with special equipment to help egypt uncover the tunnels allegedly used to smuggle arms into gaza .
however , egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit said in brussels late sunday that most of the arms smuggling was taking place by sea and not through his territory .
abul gheit was attending talks with eu foreign ministers and counterparts from the palestinian authority , turkey , jordan and norway as part of a diplomatic push by the eu to make its voice heard in the region .
on wednesday , eu diplomats held separate talks with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni , who insisted on the need to stop weapons being smuggled into the strip .

26 , attributing the problems to rising food prices in 2008 and to the international financial crisis .
the conference should facilitate " a drastic change in the way we govern hunger , " jacques diouf , general director of the un food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , said in an interview with the daily el pais .
looking for solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these children in haiti only eat one meal a day the meeting bringing together un officials , representatives of international agencies and the civil society was to be closed by un secretary general ban ki-moon and spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero on tuesday .
the summit was aimed at charting the progress in meeting the goals of the rome food summit in june 2008 .
it will draw up a road map to ensure the enforcement of the rome agreements to alleviate the suffering caused by soaring food prices and to stimulate agricultural development and food production , according to spanish government sources .
more people going hungry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fao wants more help for poor countries the summit was taking place in the context of an economic crisis which was seen as complicating alimentary problems through price volatility and the credit crunch while food prices remained high in many developing countries .
" we have more and more hungry people , while food reserves are the second lowest in 30 years , " diouf said .
about 960 million people are undernourished , and more than 100,000 die daily of causes related to hunger , according to un figures .
obama called on to play a " leading role " the summit will result in a madrid declaration on how to move forward .

26 , that it was providing 58 million euros -lrb- $ 74.3 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid to vulnerable palestinians this year . in a statement , eu aid commissioner louis michel said around 32 million euros would be earmarked for gaza , which suffered massive damage during a three-week bombing campaign by israel .
an additional 20 million euros are to go to the west bank , with the remaining six million destined for palestinian refugees in lebanon .
" this funding package of 58 million euros will contribute substantially to the international effort on behalf of these suffering people and will also sustain our ongoing solidarity with the entire palestinian population , " michel said .
calling the situation in gaza " catastrophic , " he said the strip 's civilian population of nearly 1.5 million had faced " terrible and unprecedented " suffering compared to past times of violence in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
" destruction on such a massive scale saddens me deeply , " michel said during a fact-finding visit to the gaza strip .
eu commissioner distributes responsibility equally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's michel blamed israel and hamas equally michel sharply criticized israel for the massive destruction he saw around him , but said also hamas bore an " overwhelming " part of the blame .
" we have to also recall the overwhelming responsibility of hamas , " michel told local reporters as he toured jabaliya , a crowded refugee camp north of gaza city which was hit hard in israel 's 22-day offensive .
" firing rockets at civilians is a terrorist action , " he said .
" i intentionally say this here , hamas is a terrorist movement and it has to be denounced as such , " he said .
he earlier strongly condemned israel for its destruction of the civilian infrastructure , as he inspected buildings in gaza destroyed in the israeli assault , including an ice-cream , a cookie and a soft-drink factory .
he said the destruction pointed at an obvious violation of international humanitarian law .
but the 61-year-old belgian , normally known as a staunch critic of israel , added that for progress in the peace process to be possible , hamas had to accept two " small conditions " - recognize israel 's right to exist and to abandon armed struggle .
eu offering to help stop smuggling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to help stop hamas rearming after the war meanwhile , eu foreign ministers met in brussels to discuss ways of helping israel counter arms smuggling destined for hamas into the gaza strip and ensure that the fragile ceasefire between israel and hamas holds .
ministers were expected to call on hamas to halt its rocket launches , ask israel to reopen border crossings into gaza and discuss an " effective mechanism to prevent the smuggling of arms and ammunition " to the strip , diplomats said .
france on friday announced that it was dispatching a helicopter- carrying frigate to the gaza coast , while britain has said its royal navy would also be prepared to help .
meanwhile , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in brussels that his country would send five experts with special equipment to help egypt uncover the tunnels allegedly used to smuggle arms into gaza .
however , egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit said in brussels late sunday that most of the arms smuggling was taking place by sea and not through his territory .
abul gheit was attending talks with eu foreign ministers and counterparts from the palestinian authority , turkey , jordan and norway as part of a diplomatic push by the eu to make its voice heard in the region .
on wednesday , eu diplomats held separate talks with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni , who insisted on the need to stop weapons being smuggled into the strip .
eu foreign-policy chief javier solana has also offered to redeploy monitors which used to patrol the rafah crossing between 2005 and 2007 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but will they succeed ? staging an event that has become known at least as much for its elaborate parties as for its deep debates in the middle of the worst economic crisis in recent memory is no small feat .
but the world economic forum has adapted .
according to swiss media , companies have seriously scaled down their party portfolios .
instead of caviar and lobster , it 's now ham and cheese .
at exclusive events , guests now have to toast with ordinary champagne instead of the usual dom perignon .
and at less fancy gatherings , the champagne is scrapped altogether in favor of a good old glass of white wine .
mixed expectations instead of glamour and glitter , substance is supposed to be king at the world economic forum 2009 .
to that end , global business and government leaders will be given the task of sketching a post-crisis world .
still , expectations for davos are mixed .
" actually , we do n't expect very much , " said alexis passadakis from the german section of the anti-globalization group attac .
" those people who meet in davos are those who are responsible for the world economic crisis we are facing now .
the governments and the companies who meet there were responsible for the liberalization of world trade and world finance and are responsible for what 's happening now , " passadakis said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-werner sinn some business experts would beg to differ .
" it 's useful to have this debate , " said hans-werner sinn , head of the ifo institute , one of germany 's major economic think tanks .
" we have lots of countries which are not represented in the g20 or g8 meetings so they have an opportunity to meet now and also raise their voice and there are some important people also coming to this event so i find it basically very fruitful . "
broad range of topics and debate they surely will in davos .
during 57 sessions , participants will tackle issues ranging from climate change and new business models to sustainable development , which are all important and worth talking about .
but probably , by most people 's standards , the world economic forum can only be called a success if it shows ways out of the current global economic crisis . michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it ’ s breaking up in space , though experts are confident it poses no risk . a german space expert has rejected concerns about an old nuclear-powered soviet satellite which is breaking up in space , saying its orbit appears stable and the fuel on board is not very radioactive anymore .
us space watchers highlighted the fate of cosmos 1818 two weeks ago .
a article in the january issue of orbital debris quarterly news , published by the us national aeronautics and space administration -lrb- nasa -rrb- , revealed it was strewing parts .
heiner klinkrad , a specialist in space junk at the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- office in darmstadt , germany , said in an interview with the dpa news agency that he saw no danger .
" the satellite is still in a stable orbit , " said klinkrad , who heads the esa department tracking orbital debris .
he said nasa 's space surveillance network was keeping it under observation .
no indication of an explosion the fragments were only moving away slowly from the satellite , which indicated there had not been any explosion on board .
" only a high-energy explosion would be capable of destabilizing its orbital path , " said klinkrad .
he suggested paint or other surface material was coming free , or a coolant system had sprung a leak , perhaps after impact by a piece of high-speed space junk .
launched by the former soviet union in february 1987 , the satellite was intended to evaluate a nuclear-reactor power supply .
it was still at an altitude of 800 kilometres and its orbit had not slowed , klinkrad said , adding that even if cosmos 1818 were to slow down and tumble to earth , this would be no disaster .
" the reactor on the satellite was shut down 20 years ago , " he said .
" in that time , the radioactivity in the idle reactor would have declined to less than one-thousandth of its original level . " dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gaza and guantanamo are also high on the agenda of europe 's foreign ministers . european union foreign ministers extended a travel ban and asset freeze on around 60 people and companies allied to mugabe on monday , jan .
26 .
the ministers also expressed concern over the cholera outbreak ravaging the country , saying that it viewed the humanitarian situation in zimbabwe with " particular distress . "
and they called for closer international cooperation to bring about democratic change in zimbabwe and to crack down on the flow of illicitly-traded diamonds which provides mugabe 's regime with a financial lifeline .
differences remain on guantanamo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is under pressure to accept former guantanamo detainees it 's been a busy few days for european union foreign ministers , who are also grappling on whether to offer a home to released guantanamo detainees who might face abuse if sent back to their country of origin .
the eu has said it will consider taking the detainees , but will leave the final decision up to individual member countries .
the eu has long called for the closure of the detention center in guantanamo bay , cuba , and welcomed the decision by new us president barack obama to prepare the jail 's closure on his first day in office .
" we have not received any demand from our american friends .
this is an american problem that they have to solve , but we will be ready to help if necessary , " the eu 's top foreign policy official , javier solana , said .
so far , portugal is the only eu member state which has said clearly that it will take in former detainees .

25 , in brussels .
europe hosted israel 's foreign minister tzipi livni last week and will send solana to the middle east on monday in a bid to bolster the gaza ceasefire .

more than 4,000 homes were destroyed and 17,000 damaged .
the assault 's goal was to stop hamas militants from firing rockets at israeli civilians .
hamas " essential to peace process " though the eu lists hamas as a terrorist organization , some eu ministers say no peace can be achieved in the middle east unless hamas - which governs the gaza strip - is also brought into the equation .
europeans are concerned about the divisions between hamas and the more moderate palestinian authority of mahmoud abbas .

while palestinian foreign affairs minister riyad al-maliki was in brussels , hamas officials holding parallel talks in cairo insisted that they would continue smuggling weapons into gaza .
in the past , hamas has smuggled arms through a network of tunnels under the gaza border with egypt .
israel claims are moving into the territory from iran .
on sunday egypt closed its rafah crossing point with gaza , fearing that israel may renew its attacks on underground passage ways .
yet european leaders were undaunted by the defiant stand from hamas .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 26.01.2009 klinsmann insists much-improved bayern can challenge for titles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann is enjoying more good times than bad as the season progresses bayern munich have steadily improved since the start of the season and can play a major role in germany and europe if they can keep up the momentum , coach juergen klinsmann said . " if we play consistently from the first match onwards then we will become german champions and will go a long way in the champions league , " klinsmann said in an interview with the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- website published on monday .
" if every player gives it all he has and contributes to the team we will win a title or two .
the team plays faster and more attractive football -lrb- than last season -rrb- and we believe that it can do even better .
the buildup gives us reason for hope . "
title holders bayern are tied on points with league leaders hoffenheim as the second half of the season opens this week .
munich visit vfb stuttgart for a german cup tie on tuesday and open bundesliga action on friday night at third-placed sv hamburg .
their next champions league date is a knock-out round tie in february with portugal 's sporting lisbon , with the club seeking to recapture europe 's top prize it last won in 2001 .
klinsmann said he did n't mind such tough domestic tests after the seven-week hibernation period .
" of course things could be easier but such games are a good indicator because we will know where we stand .
i am convinced that we can have a successful start if all players are fit . "
munich had a stuttering start into the season but improved in the final weeks before the winter break .
klinsmann confident despite podolski departure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery has been an inspiration since joining bayern looking at the team led by french star franck ribery , klinsmann expressed his disappointment with germany forward lukas podolski who returns to cologne in summer after never being able to challenge first-choice players luca toni and miroslav klose .
" it 's a fact that lukas could n't deal with the situation in munich of being the forward number three , " said klinsmann , who nonetheless expressed his hope that podolski will regain his form in cologne .
the former germany coach klinsmann recharged his batteries during a two-week family holiday in california as he admitted his first months as club coach had been very demanding .
" it was very intense .
the life of a club coach is very different to that of a national team coach .
but i can say after half a year that my decision to go to munich was the right one , " he said .
it could be worse .
klinsmann could be coach at werder bremen .
after starting the season in barn-storming form , the northern german team have slipped down to eighth in the league , embroiled in scandals and arguments involving former squeaky-clean star diego .
they now face a lawsuit by former player ivan klasnic .
legal action over kidneys klasnic is to sue two doctors at bremen over his treatment for kidney problems that eventually led to two organ transplants , the news magazine der spiegel reported monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bremen favorite klasnic is suing the club the striker , who joined french side nantes this season , underwent two kidney transplant operations in early 2007 while still at bremen and accuses the club 's doctors of negligent treatment and medical mistakes .
the doctors reject the allegations .
according to the report , made available ahead of publication , attempts in the previous nine months to reach an out-of-court settlement have failed .
the 28-year-old forward is now looking for two million euros -lrb- $ 2.6 million -rrb- in compensation with the case due to be heard in a bremen court on april 17 .
croatian international klasnic scored 49 league goals for bremen between 2001 and 2007 for bremen as well as netting 20 times in the champions league .
diego gets club backing meanwhile bremen seem to be maintaining their patience with unsettled brazilian diego .
this season the modest 23-year-old playmaker has been finding himself increasingly in the headlines for reasons which have often had little to do with his prowess on the field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego ran out on bremen for the beijing olympics right at the beginning of the season diego ruffled a few bremen feathers by insisting on playing for brazil at the olympics in beijing , much against the will of the club who wanted him back for the bundesliga start .
there then followed some late training appearances and a loss of control on the pitch in december when he grabbed a karlsruhe player around the neck - an act which earned him a hefty club fine and sees him banned for four matches up to february 21 .
much has also been made in the german tabloid press of an alleged affair with pop singer sarah connor , although the player says the two are " just good friends . "
then last week began with headlines of a police car chase , with diego made to take a breathalyser test in bremen .
brazilian faces ban bremen sports director klaus allofs says the incident should not be blown out of proportion .
" diego is sorry .
he knows that he committed an offense and will have to live with the consequences that the test brings with it .
i do n't know if he will receive a driving ban or a fine , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's new wayward image comes with a ruffled look diego said he had to take a breath test , but denied reports of a car chase or that he drove through a red light .
" i came to a police control stop where i followed the orders of the authorities .
i was a bit shocked that there were three cars with blue lights flashing .
but the policemen were very nice to me , " he said .
german media reports said diego was over the legal alcohol limit of 50 milligrams of alcohol per liter of blood and could lose his driving license for a month , although diego insists he was not intoxicated , but had just had some wine .
allofs said : " he made a mistake in a part of his private life from which he will learn .
we were not pleased about the headlines and we discouraged his behavior .
but that has nothing to do with the debate about discipline within the team .
allofs says the recent negative headlines were also to do with the increased media attention in bremen , especially since diego 's liaison with sarah connor has put him in the paparazzi 's focus .
" nevertheless , our players naturally have a function as a role model , " he said .
" and fundamentally , this should apply to everyone , even for diego : stay away from driving after enjoying alcohol . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

former deutsche post head klaus zumwinkel will face a 1 million euro fine , but will avoid jail time . zumwinkel , 65 , confessed last week to using a liechtenstein bank to evade 966,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in taxes .
on monday , jan .
26 , a court found him guilty and handed down a two year suspended sentence and a fine of just under 1 million euros .
zumwinkel 's arrest for tax evasion in 2008 sent shockwaves through germany 's close-knit business world .
authorities made an example of zumwinkel , leading him out of his posh villa near cologne as television cameras rolled .
arrest rattled german tax scofflaws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel 's arrest caused many others to turn themselves in zumwinkel was one of hundreds of wealthy germans executives , sports stars and entertainers exposed when a liechtenstein bank employee betrayed them by selling a stolen dvd with details of their accounts to germany 's foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
since then , german prosecutors have recovered more than 150 million euros -lrb- $ 194 million -rrb- from taxpayers hoping to avoid being taken to trial .
german tax authorities believe that more than 4 billion euros was being hidden in liechtenstein .
prosecutors said zumwinkel concealed money in trust funds managed by the ltg bank in liechtenstein .
he set up a trust fund for himself in liechtenstein in 1986 with money he inherited , but failed to disclose earnings and dividends from it to german tax authorities , as required by law .
zumwinkel fell hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leichtenstein is a favorite tax haven released on bail after a search of his villa , zumwinkel resigned shortly afterwards as head of deutsche post , one of the world 's leading logistics companies with a global workforce of more than 350,000 .
later , he stepped down from positions on the boards of other leading german companies such as deutsche telekom , lufthansa and retailer arcandor .
zumwinkel , named manager magazine 's 2003 " executive of the year " for his work at transforming deutsche post from a bloated state monopoly into one of the world 's largest logistics companies , admitted that he had made the " biggest mistake of my life . "
" i am not going to beat around the bush : i am guilty of what i am accused of , " zumwinkel told the court on the trial 's first day .
" my career had a bitter end .
my job was my life . "
zumwinkel barely avoided jail .
in december , the federal court of justice ruled that tax crimes of more than 1 million euros would automatically land an offender in jail .
zumwinkel was originally accused of hiding 1.2 million euros , but the court in bochum announced it would only bring charges on activities since 2002 , meaning the sum involved came in just under the one-million euro mark .
liechtenstein under scrutiny germany reportedly paid 4.5 million euros for the dvd .
the brouhaha also caused britain and the united states to launch their own investigations .
it also brought liechtenstein and other tax havens under heavy international criticism .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck vowed to " to put the screws " on liechtenstein , while chancellor angela merkel threatened to isolate it from the rest of europe unless it cooperated on ending banking secrecy .

they finished bottom of the table behind immigrants from the former yugoslavia and africa -lrb- 3.2 -rrb- , the middle east -lrb- 4.1 -rrb- , southern europe -lrb- 4.4 -rrb- and the far east -lrb- 4.6 -rrb- .
the most integrated group in germany , according to the berlin institute , is immigrants from other eu countries who score 5.5 on the institute 's index .
the report 's assessment is based on results from several criteria including education , assimilation into society and employment to make up its index .
turks failing in education , assimilation and employment areas in the area of education , the study shows that 30 percent of students of turkish origin do not have a school leaving certificate and only 14 percent pass their final secondary school examinations .
in the state of saarland , 45 percent of turkish immigrants have failed to complete their high school education .
in terms of assimilation into society , turkish immigrants are marked down due to the fact that less than a third of turks born in germany have chosen to obtain german citizenship and 93 percent have married within the turkish community .
unemployment among turkish immigrants is high and many survive on state benefits while the reports shows a large number of turkish women remain in the home to manage the family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble defended the government 's integration record in an article in the german news magazine der spiegel , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble defended the german government 's initiatives to promote integration saying it was " on the right track " but added that more could be done .
" we must tell the socially weaker people , who have been isolated over generations : you are important , " schaeuble said .
" we value you .
you are as valuable as the others . "
some 15 million people in germany are foreigners or of foreign origin , including just under three million turks , representing just under 20 percent of the total population .
the largest group , statistically , are germans repatriated from the former soviet union following its collapse and german reunification . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if we play consistently from the first match onwards then we will become german champions and will go a long way in the champions league , " klinsmann said in an interview with the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- website published on monday .
" if every player gives it all he has and contributes to the team we will win a title or two .
the team plays faster and more attractive football -lrb- than last season -rrb- and we believe that it can do even better .
the buildup gives us reason for hope . "
title holders bayern are tied on points with league leaders hoffenheim as the second half of the season opens this week .
munich visit vfb stuttgart for a german cup tie on tuesday and open bundesliga action on friday night at third-placed sv hamburg .
their next champions league date is a knock-out round tie in february with portugal 's sporting lisbon , with the club seeking to recapture europe 's top prize it last won in 2001 .
klinsmann said he did n't mind such tough domestic tests after the seven-week hibernation period .
" of course things could be easier but such games are a good indicator because we will know where we stand .
i am convinced that we can have a successful start if all players are fit . "
munich had a stuttering start into the season but improved in the final weeks before the winter break .
klinsmann confident despite podolski departure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery has been an inspiration since joining bayern looking at the team led by french star franck ribery , klinsmann expressed his disappointment with germany forward lukas podolski who returns to cologne in summer after never being able to challenge first-choice players luca toni and miroslav klose .
" it 's a fact that lukas could n't deal with the situation in munich of being the forward number three , " said klinsmann , who nonetheless expressed his hope that podolski will regain his form in cologne .
the former germany coach klinsmann recharged his batteries during a two-week family holiday in california as he admitted his first months as club coach had been very demanding .
" it was very intense .
the life of a club coach is very different to that of a national team coach .
but i can say after half a year that my decision to go to munich was the right one , " he said .
it could be worse .
klinsmann could be coach at werder bremen .
after starting the season in barn-storming form , the northern german team have slipped down to eighth in the league , embroiled in scandals and arguments involving former squeaky-clean star diego .
they now face a lawsuit by former player ivan klasnic .
legal action over kidneys klasnic is to sue two doctors at bremen over his treatment for kidney problems that eventually led to two organ transplants , the news magazine der spiegel reported monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bremen favorite klasnic is suing the club the striker , who joined french side nantes this season , underwent two kidney transplant operations in early 2007 while still at bremen and accuses the club 's doctors of negligent treatment and medical mistakes .
the doctors reject the allegations .
according to the report , made available ahead of publication , attempts in the previous nine months to reach an out-of-court settlement have failed .
the 28-year-old forward is now looking for two million euros -lrb- $ 2.6 million -rrb- in compensation with the case due to be heard in a bremen court on april 17 .
croatian international klasnic scored 49 league goals for bremen between 2001 and 2007 for bremen as well as netting 20 times in the champions league .
diego gets club backing meanwhile bremen seem to be maintaining their patience with unsettled brazilian diego .
this season the modest 23-year-old playmaker has been finding himself increasingly in the headlines for reasons which have often had little to do with his prowess on the field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego ran out on bremen for the beijing olympics right at the beginning of the season diego ruffled a few bremen feathers by insisting on playing for brazil at the olympics in beijing , much against the will of the club who wanted him back for the bundesliga start .
there then followed some late training appearances and a loss of control on the pitch in december when he grabbed a karlsruhe player around the neck - an act which earned him a hefty club fine and sees him banned for four matches up to february 21 .
much has also been made in the german tabloid press of an alleged affair with pop singer sarah connor , although the player says the two are " just good friends . "
then last week began with headlines of a police car chase , with diego made to take a breathalyser test in bremen .
brazilian faces ban bremen sports director klaus allofs says the incident should not be blown out of proportion .
" diego is sorry .
he knows that he committed an offense and will have to live with the consequences that the test brings with it .
i do n't know if he will receive a driving ban or a fine , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's new wayward image comes with a ruffled look diego said he had to take a breath test , but denied reports of a car chase or that he drove through a red light .
" i came to a police control stop where i followed the orders of the authorities .
i was a bit shocked that there were three cars with blue lights flashing .
but the policemen were very nice to me , " he said .
german media reports said diego was over the legal alcohol limit of 50 milligrams of alcohol per liter of blood and could lose his driving license for a month , although diego insists he was not intoxicated , but had just had some wine .
allofs said : " he made a mistake in a part of his private life from which he will learn .
we were not pleased about the headlines and we discouraged his behavior .
but that has nothing to do with the debate about discipline within the team .
allofs says the recent negative headlines were also to do with the increased media attention in bremen , especially since diego 's liaison with sarah connor has put him in the paparazzi 's focus .
" nevertheless , our players naturally have a function as a role model , " he said .
" and fundamentally , this should apply to everyone , even for diego : stay away from driving after enjoying alcohol . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they finished bottom of the table behind immigrants from the former yugoslavia and africa -lrb- 3.2 -rrb- , the middle east -lrb- 4.1 -rrb- , southern europe -lrb- 4.4 -rrb- and the far east -lrb- 4.6 -rrb- .
the most integrated group in germany , according to the berlin institute , is immigrants from other eu countries who score 5.5 on the institute 's index .
the report 's assessment is based on results from several criteria including education , assimilation into society and employment to make up its index .
turks failing in education , assimilation and employment areas in the area of education , the study shows that 30 percent of students of turkish origin do not have a school leaving certificate and only 14 percent pass their final secondary school examinations .
in the state of saarland , 45 percent of turkish immigrants have failed to complete their high school education .
in terms of assimilation into society , turkish immigrants are marked down due to the fact that less than a third of turks born in germany have chosen to obtain german citizenship and 93 percent have married within the turkish community .
unemployment among turkish immigrants is high and many survive on state benefits while the reports shows a large number of turkish women remain in the home to manage the family .

former deutsche post head klaus zumwinkel will face a 1 million euro fine , but will avoid jail time . zumwinkel , 65 , confessed last week to using a liechtenstein bank to evade 966,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in taxes .
on monday , jan .
26 , a court found him guilty and handed down a two year suspended sentence and a fine of just under 1 million euros .
zumwinkel 's arrest for tax evasion in 2008 sent shockwaves through germany 's close-knit business world .

since then , german prosecutors have recovered more than 150 million euros -lrb- $ 194 million -rrb- from taxpayers hoping to avoid being taken to trial .
german tax authorities believe that more than 4 billion euros was being hidden in liechtenstein .
prosecutors said zumwinkel concealed money in trust funds managed by the ltg bank in liechtenstein .

zumwinkel , named manager magazine 's 2003 " executive of the year " for his work at transforming deutsche post from a bloated state monopoly into one of the world 's largest logistics companies , admitted that he had made the " biggest mistake of my life . "
" i am not going to beat around the bush : i am guilty of what i am accused of , " zumwinkel told the court on the trial 's first day .
" my career had a bitter end .
my job was my life . "
zumwinkel barely avoided jail .
in december , the federal court of justice ruled that tax crimes of more than 1 million euros would automatically land an offender in jail .
zumwinkel was originally accused of hiding 1.2 million euros , but the court in bochum announced it would only bring charges on activities since 2002 , meaning the sum involved came in just under the one-million euro mark .

but according to the report , merkel has instructed the economics ministry to put the brakes on this practice after statistics showed that exports had risen 10.5 percent on an annual basis to 3.58 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.63 billion -rrb- through november 2008 .
some 75 percent of all medium and small businesses in iran use german-made equipment . business and banking trade elements are not specifically forbidden under un security council sanctions , which only limit the sale of technology that could be used in the weapons industry . merkel has repeatedly insisted that germany is only obliged to obey the un sanctions and said earlier this month that germany was not planning to undertake any further unilateral action against iran at this time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 26.01.2009 german expert discounts risk from old soviet satellite großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the satellite in question went up in 1987 it 's a leftover relic from a time when two powerful nations raced one another into the stratosphere : a nuclear powered soviet satellite .
it ’ s breaking up in space , though experts are confident it poses no risk . a german space expert has rejected concerns about an old nuclear-powered soviet satellite which is breaking up in space , saying its orbit appears stable and the fuel on board is not very radioactive anymore .
us space watchers highlighted the fate of cosmos 1818 two weeks ago .
a article in the january issue of orbital debris quarterly news , published by the us national aeronautics and space administration -lrb- nasa -rrb- , revealed it was strewing parts .
heiner klinkrad , a specialist in space junk at the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- office in darmstadt , germany , said in an interview with the dpa news agency that he saw no danger .
" the satellite is still in a stable orbit , " said klinkrad , who heads the esa department tracking orbital debris .
he said nasa 's space surveillance network was keeping it under observation .
no indication of an explosion the fragments were only moving away slowly from the satellite , which indicated there had not been any explosion on board .
" only a high-energy explosion would be capable of destabilizing its orbital path , " said klinkrad .
he suggested paint or other surface material was coming free , or a coolant system had sprung a leak , perhaps after impact by a piece of high-speed space junk .
launched by the former soviet union in february 1987 , the satellite was intended to evaluate a nuclear-reactor power supply .
it was still at an altitude of 800 kilometres and its orbit had not slowed , klinkrad said , adding that even if cosmos 1818 were to slow down and tumble to earth , this would be no disaster .
" the reactor on the satellite was shut down 20 years ago , " he said .
" in that time , the radioactivity in the idle reactor would have declined to less than one-thousandth of its original level . " dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it ’ s breaking up in space , though experts are confident it poses no risk . a german space expert has rejected concerns about an old nuclear-powered soviet satellite which is breaking up in space , saying its orbit appears stable and the fuel on board is not very radioactive anymore .
us space watchers highlighted the fate of cosmos 1818 two weeks ago .
a article in the january issue of orbital debris quarterly news , published by the us national aeronautics and space administration -lrb- nasa -rrb- , revealed it was strewing parts .
heiner klinkrad , a specialist in space junk at the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- office in darmstadt , germany , said in an interview with the dpa news agency that he saw no danger .
" the satellite is still in a stable orbit , " said klinkrad , who heads the esa department tracking orbital debris .
he said nasa 's space surveillance network was keeping it under observation .
no indication of an explosion the fragments were only moving away slowly from the satellite , which indicated there had not been any explosion on board .
" only a high-energy explosion would be capable of destabilizing its orbital path , " said klinkrad .
he suggested paint or other surface material was coming free , or a coolant system had sprung a leak , perhaps after impact by a piece of high-speed space junk .
launched by the former soviet union in february 1987 , the satellite was intended to evaluate a nuclear-reactor power supply .
it was still at an altitude of 800 kilometres and its orbit had not slowed , klinkrad said , adding that even if cosmos 1818 were to slow down and tumble to earth , this would be no disaster .
" the reactor on the satellite was shut down 20 years ago , " he said .
" in that time , the radioactivity in the idle reactor would have declined to less than one-thousandth of its original level . " dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if we play consistently from the first match onwards then we will become german champions and will go a long way in the champions league , " klinsmann said in an interview with the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- website published on monday .
" if every player gives it all he has and contributes to the team we will win a title or two .
the team plays faster and more attractive football -lrb- than last season -rrb- and we believe that it can do even better .
the buildup gives us reason for hope . "
title holders bayern are tied on points with league leaders hoffenheim as the second half of the season opens this week .
munich visit vfb stuttgart for a german cup tie on tuesday and open bundesliga action on friday night at third-placed sv hamburg .
their next champions league date is a knock-out round tie in february with portugal 's sporting lisbon , with the club seeking to recapture europe 's top prize it last won in 2001 .
klinsmann said he did n't mind such tough domestic tests after the seven-week hibernation period .
" of course things could be easier but such games are a good indicator because we will know where we stand .
i am convinced that we can have a successful start if all players are fit . "
munich had a stuttering start into the season but improved in the final weeks before the winter break .
klinsmann confident despite podolski departure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery has been an inspiration since joining bayern looking at the team led by french star franck ribery , klinsmann expressed his disappointment with germany forward lukas podolski who returns to cologne in summer after never being able to challenge first-choice players luca toni and miroslav klose .
" it 's a fact that lukas could n't deal with the situation in munich of being the forward number three , " said klinsmann , who nonetheless expressed his hope that podolski will regain his form in cologne .
the former germany coach klinsmann recharged his batteries during a two-week family holiday in california as he admitted his first months as club coach had been very demanding .
" it was very intense .
the life of a club coach is very different to that of a national team coach .
but i can say after half a year that my decision to go to munich was the right one , " he said .
it could be worse .
klinsmann could be coach at werder bremen .
after starting the season in barn-storming form , the northern german team have slipped down to eighth in the league , embroiled in scandals and arguments involving former squeaky-clean star diego .
they now face a lawsuit by former player ivan klasnic .
legal action over kidneys klasnic is to sue two doctors at bremen over his treatment for kidney problems that eventually led to two organ transplants , the news magazine der spiegel reported monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bremen favorite klasnic is suing the club the striker , who joined french side nantes this season , underwent two kidney transplant operations in early 2007 while still at bremen and accuses the club 's doctors of negligent treatment and medical mistakes .
the doctors reject the allegations .
according to the report , made available ahead of publication , attempts in the previous nine months to reach an out-of-court settlement have failed .
the 28-year-old forward is now looking for two million euros -lrb- $ 2.6 million -rrb- in compensation with the case due to be heard in a bremen court on april 17 .
croatian international klasnic scored 49 league goals for bremen between 2001 and 2007 for bremen as well as netting 20 times in the champions league .
diego gets club backing meanwhile bremen seem to be maintaining their patience with unsettled brazilian diego .
this season the modest 23-year-old playmaker has been finding himself increasingly in the headlines for reasons which have often had little to do with his prowess on the field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego ran out on bremen for the beijing olympics right at the beginning of the season diego ruffled a few bremen feathers by insisting on playing for brazil at the olympics in beijing , much against the will of the club who wanted him back for the bundesliga start .
there then followed some late training appearances and a loss of control on the pitch in december when he grabbed a karlsruhe player around the neck - an act which earned him a hefty club fine and sees him banned for four matches up to february 21 .
much has also been made in the german tabloid press of an alleged affair with pop singer sarah connor , although the player says the two are " just good friends . "
then last week began with headlines of a police car chase , with diego made to take a breathalyser test in bremen .
brazilian faces ban bremen sports director klaus allofs says the incident should not be blown out of proportion .
" diego is sorry .
he knows that he committed an offense and will have to live with the consequences that the test brings with it .
i do n't know if he will receive a driving ban or a fine , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's new wayward image comes with a ruffled look diego said he had to take a breath test , but denied reports of a car chase or that he drove through a red light .
" i came to a police control stop where i followed the orders of the authorities .
i was a bit shocked that there were three cars with blue lights flashing .
but the policemen were very nice to me , " he said .
german media reports said diego was over the legal alcohol limit of 50 milligrams of alcohol per liter of blood and could lose his driving license for a month , although diego insists he was not intoxicated , but had just had some wine .
allofs said : " he made a mistake in a part of his private life from which he will learn .
we were not pleased about the headlines and we discouraged his behavior .
but that has nothing to do with the debate about discipline within the team .
allofs says the recent negative headlines were also to do with the increased media attention in bremen , especially since diego 's liaison with sarah connor has put him in the paparazzi 's focus .
" nevertheless , our players naturally have a function as a role model , " he said .
" and fundamentally , this should apply to everyone , even for diego : stay away from driving after enjoying alcohol . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the former germany coach klinsmann recharged his batteries during a two-week family holiday in california as he admitted his first months as club coach had been very demanding .
" it was very intense .
the life of a club coach is very different to that of a national team coach .
but i can say after half a year that my decision to go to munich was the right one , " he said .
it could be worse .
klinsmann could be coach at werder bremen .
after starting the season in barn-storming form , the northern german team have slipped down to eighth in the league , embroiled in scandals and arguments involving former squeaky-clean star diego .
they now face a lawsuit by former player ivan klasnic .
legal action over kidneys klasnic is to sue two doctors at bremen over his treatment for kidney problems that eventually led to two organ transplants , the news magazine der spiegel reported monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bremen favorite klasnic is suing the club the striker , who joined french side nantes this season , underwent two kidney transplant operations in early 2007 while still at bremen and accuses the club 's doctors of negligent treatment and medical mistakes .
the doctors reject the allegations .
according to the report , made available ahead of publication , attempts in the previous nine months to reach an out-of-court settlement have failed .
the 28-year-old forward is now looking for two million euros -lrb- $ 2.6 million -rrb- in compensation with the case due to be heard in a bremen court on april 17 .
croatian international klasnic scored 49 league goals for bremen between 2001 and 2007 for bremen as well as netting 20 times in the champions league .
diego gets club backing meanwhile bremen seem to be maintaining their patience with unsettled brazilian diego .
this season the modest 23-year-old playmaker has been finding himself increasingly in the headlines for reasons which have often had little to do with his prowess on the field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego ran out on bremen for the beijing olympics right at the beginning of the season diego ruffled a few bremen feathers by insisting on playing for brazil at the olympics in beijing , much against the will of the club who wanted him back for the bundesliga start .
there then followed some late training appearances and a loss of control on the pitch in december when he grabbed a karlsruhe player around the neck - an act which earned him a hefty club fine and sees him banned for four matches up to february 21 .
much has also been made in the german tabloid press of an alleged affair with pop singer sarah connor , although the player says the two are " just good friends . "
then last week began with headlines of a police car chase , with diego made to take a breathalyser test in bremen .
brazilian faces ban bremen sports director klaus allofs says the incident should not be blown out of proportion .
" diego is sorry .
he knows that he committed an offense and will have to live with the consequences that the test brings with it .
i do n't know if he will receive a driving ban or a fine , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's new wayward image comes with a ruffled look diego said he had to take a breath test , but denied reports of a car chase or that he drove through a red light .
" i came to a police control stop where i followed the orders of the authorities .
i was a bit shocked that there were three cars with blue lights flashing .
but the policemen were very nice to me , " he said .
german media reports said diego was over the legal alcohol limit of 50 milligrams of alcohol per liter of blood and could lose his driving license for a month , although diego insists he was not intoxicated , but had just had some wine .
allofs said : " he made a mistake in a part of his private life from which he will learn .
we were not pleased about the headlines and we discouraged his behavior .
but that has nothing to do with the debate about discipline within the team .
allofs says the recent negative headlines were also to do with the increased media attention in bremen , especially since diego 's liaison with sarah connor has put him in the paparazzi 's focus .

german media reports said diego was over the legal alcohol limit of 50 milligrams of alcohol per liter of blood and could lose his driving license for a month , although diego insists he was not intoxicated , but had just had some wine .
allofs said : " he made a mistake in a part of his private life from which he will learn .
we were not pleased about the headlines and we discouraged his behavior .
but that has nothing to do with the debate about discipline within the team .
allofs says the recent negative headlines were also to do with the increased media attention in bremen , especially since diego 's liaison with sarah connor has put him in the paparazzi 's focus .
" nevertheless , our players naturally have a function as a role model , " he said .
" and fundamentally , this should apply to everyone , even for diego : stay away from driving after enjoying alcohol . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , that it was providing 58 million euros -lrb- $ 74.3 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid to vulnerable palestinians this year . in a statement , eu aid commissioner louis michel said around 32 million euros would be earmarked for gaza , which suffered massive damage during a three-week bombing campaign by israel .
an additional 20 million euros are to go to the west bank , with the remaining six million destined for palestinian refugees in lebanon .
" this funding package of 58 million euros will contribute substantially to the international effort on behalf of these suffering people and will also sustain our ongoing solidarity with the entire palestinian population , " michel said .
calling the situation in gaza " catastrophic , " he said the strip 's civilian population of nearly 1.5 million had faced " terrible and unprecedented " suffering compared to past times of violence in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
" destruction on such a massive scale saddens me deeply , " michel said during a fact-finding visit to the gaza strip .
eu commissioner distributes responsibility equally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's michel blamed israel and hamas equally michel sharply criticized israel for the massive destruction he saw around him , but said also hamas bore an " overwhelming " part of the blame .
" we have to also recall the overwhelming responsibility of hamas , " michel told local reporters as he toured jabaliya , a crowded refugee camp north of gaza city which was hit hard in israel 's 22-day offensive .
" firing rockets at civilians is a terrorist action , " he said .
" i intentionally say this here , hamas is a terrorist movement and it has to be denounced as such , " he said .
he earlier strongly condemned israel for its destruction of the civilian infrastructure , as he inspected buildings in gaza destroyed in the israeli assault , including an ice-cream , a cookie and a soft-drink factory .
he said the destruction pointed at an obvious violation of international humanitarian law .
but the 61-year-old belgian , normally known as a staunch critic of israel , added that for progress in the peace process to be possible , hamas had to accept two " small conditions " - recognize israel 's right to exist and to abandon armed struggle .
eu offering to help stop smuggling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to help stop hamas rearming after the war meanwhile , eu foreign ministers met in brussels to discuss ways of helping israel counter arms smuggling destined for hamas into the gaza strip and ensure that the fragile ceasefire between israel and hamas holds .
ministers were expected to call on hamas to halt its rocket launches , ask israel to reopen border crossings into gaza and discuss an " effective mechanism to prevent the smuggling of arms and ammunition " to the strip , diplomats said .
france on friday announced that it was dispatching a helicopter- carrying frigate to the gaza coast , while britain has said its royal navy would also be prepared to help .
meanwhile , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in brussels that his country would send five experts with special equipment to help egypt uncover the tunnels allegedly used to smuggle arms into gaza .
however , egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit said in brussels late sunday that most of the arms smuggling was taking place by sea and not through his territory .
abul gheit was attending talks with eu foreign ministers and counterparts from the palestinian authority , turkey , jordan and norway as part of a diplomatic push by the eu to make its voice heard in the region .
on wednesday , eu diplomats held separate talks with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni , who insisted on the need to stop weapons being smuggled into the strip .
eu foreign-policy chief javier solana has also offered to redeploy monitors which used to patrol the rafah crossing between 2005 and 2007 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , that it was providing 58 million euros -lrb- $ 74.3 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid to vulnerable palestinians this year . in a statement , eu aid commissioner louis michel said around 32 million euros would be earmarked for gaza , which suffered massive damage during a three-week bombing campaign by israel .
an additional 20 million euros are to go to the west bank , with the remaining six million destined for palestinian refugees in lebanon .
" this funding package of 58 million euros will contribute substantially to the international effort on behalf of these suffering people and will also sustain our ongoing solidarity with the entire palestinian population , " michel said .
calling the situation in gaza " catastrophic , " he said the strip 's civilian population of nearly 1.5 million had faced " terrible and unprecedented " suffering compared to past times of violence in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
" destruction on such a massive scale saddens me deeply , " michel said during a fact-finding visit to the gaza strip .
eu commissioner distributes responsibility equally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's michel blamed israel and hamas equally michel sharply criticized israel for the massive destruction he saw around him , but said also hamas bore an " overwhelming " part of the blame .
" we have to also recall the overwhelming responsibility of hamas , " michel told local reporters as he toured jabaliya , a crowded refugee camp north of gaza city which was hit hard in israel 's 22-day offensive .
" firing rockets at civilians is a terrorist action , " he said .
" i intentionally say this here , hamas is a terrorist movement and it has to be denounced as such , " he said .
he earlier strongly condemned israel for its destruction of the civilian infrastructure , as he inspected buildings in gaza destroyed in the israeli assault , including an ice-cream , a cookie and a soft-drink factory .
he said the destruction pointed at an obvious violation of international humanitarian law .
but the 61-year-old belgian , normally known as a staunch critic of israel , added that for progress in the peace process to be possible , hamas had to accept two " small conditions " - recognize israel 's right to exist and to abandon armed struggle .
eu offering to help stop smuggling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to help stop hamas rearming after the war meanwhile , eu foreign ministers met in brussels to discuss ways of helping israel counter arms smuggling destined for hamas into the gaza strip and ensure that the fragile ceasefire between israel and hamas holds .
ministers were expected to call on hamas to halt its rocket launches , ask israel to reopen border crossings into gaza and discuss an " effective mechanism to prevent the smuggling of arms and ammunition " to the strip , diplomats said .
france on friday announced that it was dispatching a helicopter- carrying frigate to the gaza coast , while britain has said its royal navy would also be prepared to help .
meanwhile , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in brussels that his country would send five experts with special equipment to help egypt uncover the tunnels allegedly used to smuggle arms into gaza .
however , egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit said in brussels late sunday that most of the arms smuggling was taking place by sea and not through his territory .
abul gheit was attending talks with eu foreign ministers and counterparts from the palestinian authority , turkey , jordan and norway as part of a diplomatic push by the eu to make its voice heard in the region .
on wednesday , eu diplomats held separate talks with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni , who insisted on the need to stop weapons being smuggled into the strip .
eu foreign-policy chief javier solana has also offered to redeploy monitors which used to patrol the rafah crossing between 2005 and 2007 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

attempts by environmental groups to stop the project have failed . germany gave the green light on monday to a controversial plan with india to drop six tons of iron dust in the south atlantic .
the experiment is the biggest trial ever of iron fertilization , a technology which could theoretically help stop global warming at very little cost .
but following complaints by environmentalists , germany 's science ministry ordered the plan suspended while it conducted an urgent review .
" after careful a study of expert reports , i am convinced there are no scientific or legal objections to the german-indian marine research project , " research minister annette schavan said on monday , jan .
26 .
" i have therefore decided … to begin the experiment . "
opponents of the plan fear that the results could be catastrophic , worring that it would cause the sea to become more acidic or trigger algae blooms that would deprive large areas of the ocean of oxygen .
environment minister sigmar gabriel told schavan in a letter recently that the experiment " destroys germany 's credibility and its vanguard role in protecting biodiversity . "
massive carbon sink under the plan , the iron dust is to be sprinkled over an area of 300 square kilometers from a german research vessel , the polarstern .
it is hoped that algae living at the ocean surface will soak up the iron and reproduce rapidly , absorbing carbon dioxide from the surface water .
at the end of their life cycle the algae die and sink .
most of the carbon ends up in deep water or on the sea bottom .
the ocean absorbs more carbon dioxide from the air , reducing the greenhouse effect .

but following complaints by environmentalists , germany 's science ministry ordered the plan suspended while it conducted an urgent review .
" after careful a study of expert reports , i am convinced there are no scientific or legal objections to the german-indian marine research project , " research minister annette schavan said on monday , jan .
26 .
" i have therefore decided … to begin the experiment . "
opponents of the plan fear that the results could be catastrophic , worring that it would cause the sea to become more acidic or trigger algae blooms that would deprive large areas of the ocean of oxygen .
environment minister sigmar gabriel told schavan in a letter recently that the experiment " destroys germany 's credibility and its vanguard role in protecting biodiversity . "
massive carbon sink under the plan , the iron dust is to be sprinkled over an area of 300 square kilometers from a german research vessel , the polarstern .
it is hoped that algae living at the ocean surface will soak up the iron and reproduce rapidly , absorbing carbon dioxide from the surface water .
at the end of their life cycle the algae die and sink .
most of the carbon ends up in deep water or on the sea bottom .
the ocean absorbs more carbon dioxide from the air , reducing the greenhouse effect .
sequestering carbon this way might stop global warming .
thirty indian scientists and 18 from other nations left on board the polarstern from cape town on jan .

26 , that it was providing 58 million euros -lrb- $ 74.3 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid to vulnerable palestinians this year . in a statement , eu aid commissioner louis michel said around 32 million euros would be earmarked for gaza , which suffered massive damage during a three-week bombing campaign by israel .
an additional 20 million euros are to go to the west bank , with the remaining six million destined for palestinian refugees in lebanon .
" this funding package of 58 million euros will contribute substantially to the international effort on behalf of these suffering people and will also sustain our ongoing solidarity with the entire palestinian population , " michel said .
calling the situation in gaza " catastrophic , " he said the strip 's civilian population of nearly 1.5 million had faced " terrible and unprecedented " suffering compared to past times of violence in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
" destruction on such a massive scale saddens me deeply , " michel said during a fact-finding visit to the gaza strip .
eu commissioner distributes responsibility equally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's michel blamed israel and hamas equally michel sharply criticized israel for the massive destruction he saw around him , but said also hamas bore an " overwhelming " part of the blame .
" we have to also recall the overwhelming responsibility of hamas , " michel told local reporters as he toured jabaliya , a crowded refugee camp north of gaza city which was hit hard in israel 's 22-day offensive .
" firing rockets at civilians is a terrorist action , " he said .
" i intentionally say this here , hamas is a terrorist movement and it has to be denounced as such , " he said .
he earlier strongly condemned israel for its destruction of the civilian infrastructure , as he inspected buildings in gaza destroyed in the israeli assault , including an ice-cream , a cookie and a soft-drink factory .
he said the destruction pointed at an obvious violation of international humanitarian law .
but the 61-year-old belgian , normally known as a staunch critic of israel , added that for progress in the peace process to be possible , hamas had to accept two " small conditions " - recognize israel 's right to exist and to abandon armed struggle .
eu offering to help stop smuggling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to help stop hamas rearming after the war meanwhile , eu foreign ministers met in brussels to discuss ways of helping israel counter arms smuggling destined for hamas into the gaza strip and ensure that the fragile ceasefire between israel and hamas holds .
ministers were expected to call on hamas to halt its rocket launches , ask israel to reopen border crossings into gaza and discuss an " effective mechanism to prevent the smuggling of arms and ammunition " to the strip , diplomats said .
france on friday announced that it was dispatching a helicopter- carrying frigate to the gaza coast , while britain has said its royal navy would also be prepared to help .
meanwhile , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in brussels that his country would send five experts with special equipment to help egypt uncover the tunnels allegedly used to smuggle arms into gaza .
however , egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit said in brussels late sunday that most of the arms smuggling was taking place by sea and not through his territory .
abul gheit was attending talks with eu foreign ministers and counterparts from the palestinian authority , turkey , jordan and norway as part of a diplomatic push by the eu to make its voice heard in the region .
on wednesday , eu diplomats held separate talks with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni , who insisted on the need to stop weapons being smuggled into the strip .
eu foreign-policy chief javier solana has also offered to redeploy monitors which used to patrol the rafah crossing between 2005 and 2007 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , that it was providing 58 million euros -lrb- $ 74.3 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid to vulnerable palestinians this year . in a statement , eu aid commissioner louis michel said around 32 million euros would be earmarked for gaza , which suffered massive damage during a three-week bombing campaign by israel .
an additional 20 million euros are to go to the west bank , with the remaining six million destined for palestinian refugees in lebanon .
" this funding package of 58 million euros will contribute substantially to the international effort on behalf of these suffering people and will also sustain our ongoing solidarity with the entire palestinian population , " michel said .
calling the situation in gaza " catastrophic , " he said the strip 's civilian population of nearly 1.5 million had faced " terrible and unprecedented " suffering compared to past times of violence in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
" destruction on such a massive scale saddens me deeply , " michel said during a fact-finding visit to the gaza strip .
eu commissioner distributes responsibility equally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's michel blamed israel and hamas equally michel sharply criticized israel for the massive destruction he saw around him , but said also hamas bore an " overwhelming " part of the blame .
" we have to also recall the overwhelming responsibility of hamas , " michel told local reporters as he toured jabaliya , a crowded refugee camp north of gaza city which was hit hard in israel 's 22-day offensive .
" firing rockets at civilians is a terrorist action , " he said .
" i intentionally say this here , hamas is a terrorist movement and it has to be denounced as such , " he said .
he earlier strongly condemned israel for its destruction of the civilian infrastructure , as he inspected buildings in gaza destroyed in the israeli assault , including an ice-cream , a cookie and a soft-drink factory .
he said the destruction pointed at an obvious violation of international humanitarian law .
but the 61-year-old belgian , normally known as a staunch critic of israel , added that for progress in the peace process to be possible , hamas had to accept two " small conditions " - recognize israel 's right to exist and to abandon armed struggle .
eu offering to help stop smuggling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to help stop hamas rearming after the war meanwhile , eu foreign ministers met in brussels to discuss ways of helping israel counter arms smuggling destined for hamas into the gaza strip and ensure that the fragile ceasefire between israel and hamas holds .
ministers were expected to call on hamas to halt its rocket launches , ask israel to reopen border crossings into gaza and discuss an " effective mechanism to prevent the smuggling of arms and ammunition " to the strip , diplomats said .
france on friday announced that it was dispatching a helicopter- carrying frigate to the gaza coast , while britain has said its royal navy would also be prepared to help .
meanwhile , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in brussels that his country would send five experts with special equipment to help egypt uncover the tunnels allegedly used to smuggle arms into gaza .
however , egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit said in brussels late sunday that most of the arms smuggling was taking place by sea and not through his territory .
abul gheit was attending talks with eu foreign ministers and counterparts from the palestinian authority , turkey , jordan and norway as part of a diplomatic push by the eu to make its voice heard in the region .
on wednesday , eu diplomats held separate talks with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni , who insisted on the need to stop weapons being smuggled into the strip .
eu foreign-policy chief javier solana has also offered to redeploy monitors which used to patrol the rafah crossing between 2005 and 2007 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

attempts by environmental groups to stop the project have failed . germany gave the green light on monday to a controversial plan with india to drop six tons of iron dust in the south atlantic .
the experiment is the biggest trial ever of iron fertilization , a technology which could theoretically help stop global warming at very little cost .
but following complaints by environmentalists , germany 's science ministry ordered the plan suspended while it conducted an urgent review .
" after careful a study of expert reports , i am convinced there are no scientific or legal objections to the german-indian marine research project , " research minister annette schavan said on monday , jan .
26 .
" i have therefore decided … to begin the experiment . "
opponents of the plan fear that the results could be catastrophic , worring that it would cause the sea to become more acidic or trigger algae blooms that would deprive large areas of the ocean of oxygen .
environment minister sigmar gabriel told schavan in a letter recently that the experiment " destroys germany 's credibility and its vanguard role in protecting biodiversity . "
massive carbon sink under the plan , the iron dust is to be sprinkled over an area of 300 square kilometers from a german research vessel , the polarstern .
it is hoped that algae living at the ocean surface will soak up the iron and reproduce rapidly , absorbing carbon dioxide from the surface water .
at the end of their life cycle the algae die and sink .
most of the carbon ends up in deep water or on the sea bottom .
the ocean absorbs more carbon dioxide from the air , reducing the greenhouse effect .
sequestering carbon this way might stop global warming .
thirty indian scientists and 18 from other nations left on board the polarstern from cape town on jan .

" if we play consistently from the first match onwards then we will become german champions and will go a long way in the champions league , " klinsmann said in an interview with the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- website published on monday .
" if every player gives it all he has and contributes to the team we will win a title or two .
the team plays faster and more attractive football -lrb- than last season -rrb- and we believe that it can do even better .
the buildup gives us reason for hope . "
title holders bayern are tied on points with league leaders hoffenheim as the second half of the season opens this week .
munich visit vfb stuttgart for a german cup tie on tuesday and open bundesliga action on friday night at third-placed sv hamburg .
their next champions league date is a knock-out round tie in february with portugal 's sporting lisbon , with the club seeking to recapture europe 's top prize it last won in 2001 .
klinsmann said he did n't mind such tough domestic tests after the seven-week hibernation period .
" of course things could be easier but such games are a good indicator because we will know where we stand .
i am convinced that we can have a successful start if all players are fit . "
munich had a stuttering start into the season but improved in the final weeks before the winter break .
klinsmann confident despite podolski departure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery has been an inspiration since joining bayern looking at the team led by french star franck ribery , klinsmann expressed his disappointment with germany forward lukas podolski who returns to cologne in summer after never being able to challenge first-choice players luca toni and miroslav klose .
" it 's a fact that lukas could n't deal with the situation in munich of being the forward number three , " said klinsmann , who nonetheless expressed his hope that podolski will regain his form in cologne .
the former germany coach klinsmann recharged his batteries during a two-week family holiday in california as he admitted his first months as club coach had been very demanding .
" it was very intense .
the life of a club coach is very different to that of a national team coach .
but i can say after half a year that my decision to go to munich was the right one , " he said .
it could be worse .
klinsmann could be coach at werder bremen .
after starting the season in barn-storming form , the northern german team have slipped down to eighth in the league , embroiled in scandals and arguments involving former squeaky-clean star diego .
they now face a lawsuit by former player ivan klasnic .
legal action over kidneys klasnic is to sue two doctors at bremen over his treatment for kidney problems that eventually led to two organ transplants , the news magazine der spiegel reported monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bremen favorite klasnic is suing the club the striker , who joined french side nantes this season , underwent two kidney transplant operations in early 2007 while still at bremen and accuses the club 's doctors of negligent treatment and medical mistakes .
the doctors reject the allegations .
according to the report , made available ahead of publication , attempts in the previous nine months to reach an out-of-court settlement have failed .
the 28-year-old forward is now looking for two million euros -lrb- $ 2.6 million -rrb- in compensation with the case due to be heard in a bremen court on april 17 .
croatian international klasnic scored 49 league goals for bremen between 2001 and 2007 for bremen as well as netting 20 times in the champions league .
diego gets club backing meanwhile bremen seem to be maintaining their patience with unsettled brazilian diego .
this season the modest 23-year-old playmaker has been finding himself increasingly in the headlines for reasons which have often had little to do with his prowess on the field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego ran out on bremen for the beijing olympics right at the beginning of the season diego ruffled a few bremen feathers by insisting on playing for brazil at the olympics in beijing , much against the will of the club who wanted him back for the bundesliga start .
there then followed some late training appearances and a loss of control on the pitch in december when he grabbed a karlsruhe player around the neck - an act which earned him a hefty club fine and sees him banned for four matches up to february 21 .
much has also been made in the german tabloid press of an alleged affair with pop singer sarah connor , although the player says the two are " just good friends . "
then last week began with headlines of a police car chase , with diego made to take a breathalyser test in bremen .
brazilian faces ban bremen sports director klaus allofs says the incident should not be blown out of proportion .
" diego is sorry .
he knows that he committed an offense and will have to live with the consequences that the test brings with it .
i do n't know if he will receive a driving ban or a fine , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's new wayward image comes with a ruffled look diego said he had to take a breath test , but denied reports of a car chase or that he drove through a red light .
" i came to a police control stop where i followed the orders of the authorities .
i was a bit shocked that there were three cars with blue lights flashing .
but the policemen were very nice to me , " he said .
german media reports said diego was over the legal alcohol limit of 50 milligrams of alcohol per liter of blood and could lose his driving license for a month , although diego insists he was not intoxicated , but had just had some wine .
allofs said : " he made a mistake in a part of his private life from which he will learn .
we were not pleased about the headlines and we discouraged his behavior .
but that has nothing to do with the debate about discipline within the team .
allofs says the recent negative headlines were also to do with the increased media attention in bremen , especially since diego 's liaison with sarah connor has put him in the paparazzi 's focus .
" nevertheless , our players naturally have a function as a role model , " he said .

legal action over kidneys klasnic is to sue two doctors at bremen over his treatment for kidney problems that eventually led to two organ transplants , the news magazine der spiegel reported monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bremen favorite klasnic is suing the club the striker , who joined french side nantes this season , underwent two kidney transplant operations in early 2007 while still at bremen and accuses the club 's doctors of negligent treatment and medical mistakes .
the doctors reject the allegations .
according to the report , made available ahead of publication , attempts in the previous nine months to reach an out-of-court settlement have failed .
the 28-year-old forward is now looking for two million euros -lrb- $ 2.6 million -rrb- in compensation with the case due to be heard in a bremen court on april 17 .
croatian international klasnic scored 49 league goals for bremen between 2001 and 2007 for bremen as well as netting 20 times in the champions league .
diego gets club backing meanwhile bremen seem to be maintaining their patience with unsettled brazilian diego .
this season the modest 23-year-old playmaker has been finding himself increasingly in the headlines for reasons which have often had little to do with his prowess on the field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego ran out on bremen for the beijing olympics right at the beginning of the season diego ruffled a few bremen feathers by insisting on playing for brazil at the olympics in beijing , much against the will of the club who wanted him back for the bundesliga start .
there then followed some late training appearances and a loss of control on the pitch in december when he grabbed a karlsruhe player around the neck - an act which earned him a hefty club fine and sees him banned for four matches up to february 21 .
much has also been made in the german tabloid press of an alleged affair with pop singer sarah connor , although the player says the two are " just good friends . "
then last week began with headlines of a police car chase , with diego made to take a breathalyser test in bremen .
brazilian faces ban bremen sports director klaus allofs says the incident should not be blown out of proportion .
" diego is sorry .
he knows that he committed an offense and will have to live with the consequences that the test brings with it .
i do n't know if he will receive a driving ban or a fine , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's new wayward image comes with a ruffled look diego said he had to take a breath test , but denied reports of a car chase or that he drove through a red light .
" i came to a police control stop where i followed the orders of the authorities .
i was a bit shocked that there were three cars with blue lights flashing .
but the policemen were very nice to me , " he said .
german media reports said diego was over the legal alcohol limit of 50 milligrams of alcohol per liter of blood and could lose his driving license for a month , although diego insists he was not intoxicated , but had just had some wine .
allofs said : " he made a mistake in a part of his private life from which he will learn .
we were not pleased about the headlines and we discouraged his behavior .
but that has nothing to do with the debate about discipline within the team .
allofs says the recent negative headlines were also to do with the increased media attention in bremen , especially since diego 's liaison with sarah connor has put him in the paparazzi 's focus .
" nevertheless , our players naturally have a function as a role model , " he said .
" and fundamentally , this should apply to everyone , even for diego : stay away from driving after enjoying alcohol . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if we play consistently from the first match onwards then we will become german champions and will go a long way in the champions league , " klinsmann said in an interview with the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- website published on monday .
" if every player gives it all he has and contributes to the team we will win a title or two .
the team plays faster and more attractive football -lrb- than last season -rrb- and we believe that it can do even better .
the buildup gives us reason for hope . "
title holders bayern are tied on points with league leaders hoffenheim as the second half of the season opens this week .
munich visit vfb stuttgart for a german cup tie on tuesday and open bundesliga action on friday night at third-placed sv hamburg .
their next champions league date is a knock-out round tie in february with portugal 's sporting lisbon , with the club seeking to recapture europe 's top prize it last won in 2001 .
klinsmann said he did n't mind such tough domestic tests after the seven-week hibernation period .
" of course things could be easier but such games are a good indicator because we will know where we stand .
i am convinced that we can have a successful start if all players are fit . "
munich had a stuttering start into the season but improved in the final weeks before the winter break .
klinsmann confident despite podolski departure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery has been an inspiration since joining bayern looking at the team led by french star franck ribery , klinsmann expressed his disappointment with germany forward lukas podolski who returns to cologne in summer after never being able to challenge first-choice players luca toni and miroslav klose .
" it 's a fact that lukas could n't deal with the situation in munich of being the forward number three , " said klinsmann , who nonetheless expressed his hope that podolski will regain his form in cologne .
the former germany coach klinsmann recharged his batteries during a two-week family holiday in california as he admitted his first months as club coach had been very demanding .
" it was very intense .
the life of a club coach is very different to that of a national team coach .
but i can say after half a year that my decision to go to munich was the right one , " he said .
it could be worse .
klinsmann could be coach at werder bremen .

" if we play consistently from the first match onwards then we will become german champions and will go a long way in the champions league , " klinsmann said in an interview with the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- website published on monday .
" if every player gives it all he has and contributes to the team we will win a title or two .
the team plays faster and more attractive football -lrb- than last season -rrb- and we believe that it can do even better .
the buildup gives us reason for hope . "
title holders bayern are tied on points with league leaders hoffenheim as the second half of the season opens this week .
munich visit vfb stuttgart for a german cup tie on tuesday and open bundesliga action on friday night at third-placed sv hamburg .
their next champions league date is a knock-out round tie in february with portugal 's sporting lisbon , with the club seeking to recapture europe 's top prize it last won in 2001 .
klinsmann said he did n't mind such tough domestic tests after the seven-week hibernation period .
" of course things could be easier but such games are a good indicator because we will know where we stand .
i am convinced that we can have a successful start if all players are fit . "
munich had a stuttering start into the season but improved in the final weeks before the winter break .
klinsmann confident despite podolski departure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery has been an inspiration since joining bayern looking at the team led by french star franck ribery , klinsmann expressed his disappointment with germany forward lukas podolski who returns to cologne in summer after never being able to challenge first-choice players luca toni and miroslav klose .
" it 's a fact that lukas could n't deal with the situation in munich of being the forward number three , " said klinsmann , who nonetheless expressed his hope that podolski will regain his form in cologne .
the former germany coach klinsmann recharged his batteries during a two-week family holiday in california as he admitted his first months as club coach had been very demanding .
" it was very intense .
the life of a club coach is very different to that of a national team coach .
but i can say after half a year that my decision to go to munich was the right one , " he said .
it could be worse .
klinsmann could be coach at werder bremen .
after starting the season in barn-storming form , the northern german team have slipped down to eighth in the league , embroiled in scandals and arguments involving former squeaky-clean star diego .
they now face a lawsuit by former player ivan klasnic .
legal action over kidneys klasnic is to sue two doctors at bremen over his treatment for kidney problems that eventually led to two organ transplants , the news magazine der spiegel reported monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bremen favorite klasnic is suing the club the striker , who joined french side nantes this season , underwent two kidney transplant operations in early 2007 while still at bremen and accuses the club 's doctors of negligent treatment and medical mistakes .
the doctors reject the allegations .
according to the report , made available ahead of publication , attempts in the previous nine months to reach an out-of-court settlement have failed .
the 28-year-old forward is now looking for two million euros -lrb- $ 2.6 million -rrb- in compensation with the case due to be heard in a bremen court on april 17 .
croatian international klasnic scored 49 league goals for bremen between 2001 and 2007 for bremen as well as netting 20 times in the champions league .
diego gets club backing meanwhile bremen seem to be maintaining their patience with unsettled brazilian diego .
this season the modest 23-year-old playmaker has been finding himself increasingly in the headlines for reasons which have often had little to do with his prowess on the field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego ran out on bremen for the beijing olympics right at the beginning of the season diego ruffled a few bremen feathers by insisting on playing for brazil at the olympics in beijing , much against the will of the club who wanted him back for the bundesliga start .
there then followed some late training appearances and a loss of control on the pitch in december when he grabbed a karlsruhe player around the neck - an act which earned him a hefty club fine and sees him banned for four matches up to february 21 .
much has also been made in the german tabloid press of an alleged affair with pop singer sarah connor , although the player says the two are " just good friends . "
then last week began with headlines of a police car chase , with diego made to take a breathalyser test in bremen .
brazilian faces ban bremen sports director klaus allofs says the incident should not be blown out of proportion .
" diego is sorry .
he knows that he committed an offense and will have to live with the consequences that the test brings with it .
i do n't know if he will receive a driving ban or a fine , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's new wayward image comes with a ruffled look diego said he had to take a breath test , but denied reports of a car chase or that he drove through a red light .
" i came to a police control stop where i followed the orders of the authorities .
i was a bit shocked that there were three cars with blue lights flashing .
but the policemen were very nice to me , " he said .
german media reports said diego was over the legal alcohol limit of 50 milligrams of alcohol per liter of blood and could lose his driving license for a month , although diego insists he was not intoxicated , but had just had some wine .
allofs said : " he made a mistake in a part of his private life from which he will learn .
we were not pleased about the headlines and we discouraged his behavior .
but that has nothing to do with the debate about discipline within the team .
allofs says the recent negative headlines were also to do with the increased media attention in bremen , especially since diego 's liaison with sarah connor has put him in the paparazzi 's focus .

attempts by environmental groups to stop the project have failed . germany gave the green light on monday to a controversial plan with india to drop six tons of iron dust in the south atlantic .
the experiment is the biggest trial ever of iron fertilization , a technology which could theoretically help stop global warming at very little cost .
but following complaints by environmentalists , germany 's science ministry ordered the plan suspended while it conducted an urgent review .
" after careful a study of expert reports , i am convinced there are no scientific or legal objections to the german-indian marine research project , " research minister annette schavan said on monday , jan .
26 .
" i have therefore decided … to begin the experiment . "
opponents of the plan fear that the results could be catastrophic , worring that it would cause the sea to become more acidic or trigger algae blooms that would deprive large areas of the ocean of oxygen .
environment minister sigmar gabriel told schavan in a letter recently that the experiment " destroys germany 's credibility and its vanguard role in protecting biodiversity . "
massive carbon sink under the plan , the iron dust is to be sprinkled over an area of 300 square kilometers from a german research vessel , the polarstern .
it is hoped that algae living at the ocean surface will soak up the iron and reproduce rapidly , absorbing carbon dioxide from the surface water .
at the end of their life cycle the algae die and sink .
most of the carbon ends up in deep water or on the sea bottom .
the ocean absorbs more carbon dioxide from the air , reducing the greenhouse effect .

attempts by environmental groups to stop the project have failed . germany gave the green light on monday to a controversial plan with india to drop six tons of iron dust in the south atlantic .
the experiment is the biggest trial ever of iron fertilization , a technology which could theoretically help stop global warming at very little cost .
but following complaints by environmentalists , germany 's science ministry ordered the plan suspended while it conducted an urgent review .
" after careful a study of expert reports , i am convinced there are no scientific or legal objections to the german-indian marine research project , " research minister annette schavan said on monday , jan .
26 .
" i have therefore decided … to begin the experiment . "
opponents of the plan fear that the results could be catastrophic , worring that it would cause the sea to become more acidic or trigger algae blooms that would deprive large areas of the ocean of oxygen .
environment minister sigmar gabriel told schavan in a letter recently that the experiment " destroys germany 's credibility and its vanguard role in protecting biodiversity . "
massive carbon sink under the plan , the iron dust is to be sprinkled over an area of 300 square kilometers from a german research vessel , the polarstern .
it is hoped that algae living at the ocean surface will soak up the iron and reproduce rapidly , absorbing carbon dioxide from the surface water .
at the end of their life cycle the algae die and sink .
most of the carbon ends up in deep water or on the sea bottom .
the ocean absorbs more carbon dioxide from the air , reducing the greenhouse effect .
sequestering carbon this way might stop global warming .

former deutsche post head klaus zumwinkel will face a 1 million euro fine , but will avoid jail time . zumwinkel , 65 , confessed last week to using a liechtenstein bank to evade 966,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in taxes .
on monday , jan .
26 , a court found him guilty and handed down a two year suspended sentence and a fine of just under 1 million euros .
zumwinkel 's arrest for tax evasion in 2008 sent shockwaves through germany 's close-knit business world .
authorities made an example of zumwinkel , leading him out of his posh villa near cologne as television cameras rolled .
arrest rattled german tax scofflaws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel 's arrest caused many others to turn themselves in zumwinkel was one of hundreds of wealthy germans executives , sports stars and entertainers exposed when a liechtenstein bank employee betrayed them by selling a stolen dvd with details of their accounts to germany 's foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
since then , german prosecutors have recovered more than 150 million euros -lrb- $ 194 million -rrb- from taxpayers hoping to avoid being taken to trial .
german tax authorities believe that more than 4 billion euros was being hidden in liechtenstein .
prosecutors said zumwinkel concealed money in trust funds managed by the ltg bank in liechtenstein .
he set up a trust fund for himself in liechtenstein in 1986 with money he inherited , but failed to disclose earnings and dividends from it to german tax authorities , as required by law .
zumwinkel fell hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leichtenstein is a favorite tax haven released on bail after a search of his villa , zumwinkel resigned shortly afterwards as head of deutsche post , one of the world 's leading logistics companies with a global workforce of more than 350,000 .
later , he stepped down from positions on the boards of other leading german companies such as deutsche telekom , lufthansa and retailer arcandor .
zumwinkel , named manager magazine 's 2003 " executive of the year " for his work at transforming deutsche post from a bloated state monopoly into one of the world 's largest logistics companies , admitted that he had made the " biggest mistake of my life . "
" i am not going to beat around the bush : i am guilty of what i am accused of , " zumwinkel told the court on the trial 's first day .
" my career had a bitter end .
my job was my life . "
zumwinkel barely avoided jail .
in december , the federal court of justice ruled that tax crimes of more than 1 million euros would automatically land an offender in jail .
zumwinkel was originally accused of hiding 1.2 million euros , but the court in bochum announced it would only bring charges on activities since 2002 , meaning the sum involved came in just under the one-million euro mark .
liechtenstein under scrutiny germany reportedly paid 4.5 million euros for the dvd .
the brouhaha also caused britain and the united states to launch their own investigations .
it also brought liechtenstein and other tax havens under heavy international criticism .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck vowed to " to put the screws " on liechtenstein , while chancellor angela merkel threatened to isolate it from the rest of europe unless it cooperated on ending banking secrecy .

former deutsche post head klaus zumwinkel will face a 1 million euro fine , but will avoid jail time . zumwinkel , 65 , confessed last week to using a liechtenstein bank to evade 966,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- in taxes .
on monday , jan .
26 , a court found him guilty and handed down a two year suspended sentence and a fine of just under 1 million euros .
zumwinkel 's arrest for tax evasion in 2008 sent shockwaves through germany 's close-knit business world .
authorities made an example of zumwinkel , leading him out of his posh villa near cologne as television cameras rolled .
arrest rattled german tax scofflaws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel 's arrest caused many others to turn themselves in zumwinkel was one of hundreds of wealthy germans executives , sports stars and entertainers exposed when a liechtenstein bank employee betrayed them by selling a stolen dvd with details of their accounts to germany 's foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
since then , german prosecutors have recovered more than 150 million euros -lrb- $ 194 million -rrb- from taxpayers hoping to avoid being taken to trial .
german tax authorities believe that more than 4 billion euros was being hidden in liechtenstein .
prosecutors said zumwinkel concealed money in trust funds managed by the ltg bank in liechtenstein .
he set up a trust fund for himself in liechtenstein in 1986 with money he inherited , but failed to disclose earnings and dividends from it to german tax authorities , as required by law .
zumwinkel fell hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leichtenstein is a favorite tax haven released on bail after a search of his villa , zumwinkel resigned shortly afterwards as head of deutsche post , one of the world 's leading logistics companies with a global workforce of more than 350,000 .
later , he stepped down from positions on the boards of other leading german companies such as deutsche telekom , lufthansa and retailer arcandor .
zumwinkel , named manager magazine 's 2003 " executive of the year " for his work at transforming deutsche post from a bloated state monopoly into one of the world 's largest logistics companies , admitted that he had made the " biggest mistake of my life . "
" i am not going to beat around the bush : i am guilty of what i am accused of , " zumwinkel told the court on the trial 's first day .
" my career had a bitter end .
my job was my life . "
zumwinkel barely avoided jail .
in december , the federal court of justice ruled that tax crimes of more than 1 million euros would automatically land an offender in jail .
zumwinkel was originally accused of hiding 1.2 million euros , but the court in bochum announced it would only bring charges on activities since 2002 , meaning the sum involved came in just under the one-million euro mark .
liechtenstein under scrutiny germany reportedly paid 4.5 million euros for the dvd .
the brouhaha also caused britain and the united states to launch their own investigations .
it also brought liechtenstein and other tax havens under heavy international criticism .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck vowed to " to put the screws " on liechtenstein , while chancellor angela merkel threatened to isolate it from the rest of europe unless it cooperated on ending banking secrecy .
liechtenstein is considered an " un-cooperative tax haven " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it ’ s breaking up in space , though experts are confident it poses no risk . a german space expert has rejected concerns about an old nuclear-powered soviet satellite which is breaking up in space , saying its orbit appears stable and the fuel on board is not very radioactive anymore .
us space watchers highlighted the fate of cosmos 1818 two weeks ago .
a article in the january issue of orbital debris quarterly news , published by the us national aeronautics and space administration -lrb- nasa -rrb- , revealed it was strewing parts .
heiner klinkrad , a specialist in space junk at the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- office in darmstadt , germany , said in an interview with the dpa news agency that he saw no danger .
" the satellite is still in a stable orbit , " said klinkrad , who heads the esa department tracking orbital debris .
he said nasa 's space surveillance network was keeping it under observation .
no indication of an explosion the fragments were only moving away slowly from the satellite , which indicated there had not been any explosion on board .
" only a high-energy explosion would be capable of destabilizing its orbital path , " said klinkrad .
he suggested paint or other surface material was coming free , or a coolant system had sprung a leak , perhaps after impact by a piece of high-speed space junk .
launched by the former soviet union in february 1987 , the satellite was intended to evaluate a nuclear-reactor power supply .
it was still at an altitude of 800 kilometres and its orbit had not slowed , klinkrad said , adding that even if cosmos 1818 were to slow down and tumble to earth , this would be no disaster .

26 , attributing the problems to rising food prices in 2008 and to the international financial crisis .
the conference should facilitate " a drastic change in the way we govern hunger , " jacques diouf , general director of the un food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , said in an interview with the daily el pais .

the summit was aimed at charting the progress in meeting the goals of the rome food summit in june 2008 .
it will draw up a road map to ensure the enforcement of the rome agreements to alleviate the suffering caused by soaring food prices and to stimulate agricultural development and food production , according to spanish government sources .

" we have more and more hungry people , while food reserves are the second lowest in 30 years , " diouf said .
about 960 million people are undernourished , and more than 100,000 die daily of causes related to hunger , according to un figures .
obama called on to play a " leading role " the summit will result in a madrid declaration on how to move forward .
the debates were to focus on how to meet emergency food needs , reinvigorate agricultural systems , increase investment in agriculture and improve market conditions .
" rich countries continue to massively subsidize their farmers , " diouf complained .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 26.01.2009 german government to crack down on business with iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's status as a major exporter to iran is under threat germany is set to crack down on export credit guarantees to german firms seeking to do business with iran and will only approve them in exceptional cases , according to a report published monday . the article in the german business newspaper handelsblatt cited government and industry sources as saying that chancellor angela merkel had responded to criticism from germany 's partners , including the united states and israel , about the continued strength of german exports to iran despite a tightening of western sanctions over its nuclear program . german firms receive " hermes cover " export credit guarantees when selling goods to markets considered risky .
but according to the report , merkel has instructed the economics ministry to put the brakes on this practice after statistics showed that exports had risen 10.5 percent on an annual basis to 3.58 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.63 billion -rrb- through november 2008 .
some 75 percent of all medium and small businesses in iran use german-made equipment . business and banking trade elements are not specifically forbidden under un security council sanctions , which only limit the sale of technology that could be used in the weapons industry . merkel has repeatedly insisted that germany is only obliged to obey the un sanctions and said earlier this month that germany was not planning to undertake any further unilateral action against iran at this time .
but pressure from within the western powers working towards a nuclear-free iran may have persuaded her otherwise . germany has also come under fire from sections of the us media for its policy towards trade with iran .
a recent commentary by editorial writer dan schwammenthal in the wall street journal was titled : " germany loves iran . "
schwammenthal wrote that germany was less worried about an iranian nuclear bomb than it was about tightening sanctions that could negatively affect trade between the two countries . as the new us administration under president barack obama prepares to break with the previous administration and talk with iran about its nuclear program , germany now appears more comfortable with applying more pressure of its own . germany steps up restrictions on trade guarantees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's move increases the pressure on german firms the announcement to issue trade guarantees only in exceptional cases is actually the next logical step in a policy germany has been executing in increments ever since the nuclear stand-off between the west and iran began . germany , traditionally one of the top exporters to iran , has been gradually reducing the numbers of export guarantees for the past three years . german businesses have seen a significant fall in export guarantees for trade with the islamic republic since last year .
the economics ministry said a year ago that new guarantees for iran fell to 503.4 million euros in 2007 from 1.16 billion in 2006 . half-year numbers for last year show a sharp decline in new guarantees to 73.4 million euros , compared to 387 million in the first half of 2007 with full figures for 2008 to be published in the coming weeks . western powers believe iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons under the cover of a civilian atomic program .
tehran says it wants to master nuclear technology for peaceful power generation purposes . reports in recent weeks have said european countries , including britain , france and germany , could seek to pass new sanctions against iran , which has rejected repeated calls from the u.n. security council for it to suspend uranium enrichment . germany 's decision to limit its trade guarantees could herald the start of a new set of restrictions on iran by western powers . eu removes iranian organization from terror list in other developments , european union foreign ministers removed the people 's mujahedin of iran -lrb- pmoi -rrb- from their list of terrorist organizations on monday , despite public protests in tehran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pmoi 's case has been heard before but ignored the widely expected move follows a ruling by the european court in luxembourg , which in december said the eu was wrong to keep the pmoi 's assets frozen after it was taken off a british list of terrorist organizations . " what we are doing today is abiding by the resolution of the european court .
there 's nothing we can do about that resolution , " eu foreign-policy chief javier solana said . founded in 1965 , the pmoi operated a military wing in its early years , but says it renounced violence in june 2001 and now advocates the political overthrow of iran 's current government . reports of the eu 's planned decision prompted street protests outside eu embassies in tehran over the weekend by hundreds of iranian students and relatives of veterans of the iran-iraq war -lrb- 1980-88 -rrb- . iran regards pmoi as a terrorist group owing to its involvement in the assassinations of several high-ranking iranian officials , including the president and prime minister in 1980 . after the group was expelled from france in the 1980s , former iraqi president saddam hussein allocated a military base to the pmoi near the border with iran . before the ouster of saddam , the pmoi frequently infiltrated iranian territory , leading to clashes with iranian forces and casualties on both sides . solana said the eu decision could only be reversed if new evidence against the pmoi was presented to the european courts . " if there is something new that may be presented in front of the court , we 'll see , " solana said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but according to the report , merkel has instructed the economics ministry to put the brakes on this practice after statistics showed that exports had risen 10.5 percent on an annual basis to 3.58 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.63 billion -rrb- through november 2008 .
some 75 percent of all medium and small businesses in iran use german-made equipment . business and banking trade elements are not specifically forbidden under un security council sanctions , which only limit the sale of technology that could be used in the weapons industry . merkel has repeatedly insisted that germany is only obliged to obey the un sanctions and said earlier this month that germany was not planning to undertake any further unilateral action against iran at this time .

the economics ministry said a year ago that new guarantees for iran fell to 503.4 million euros in 2007 from 1.16 billion in 2006 . half-year numbers for last year show a sharp decline in new guarantees to 73.4 million euros , compared to 387 million in the first half of 2007 with full figures for 2008 to be published in the coming weeks . western powers believe iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons under the cover of a civilian atomic program .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 26.01.2009 study shows turkish immigrants least integrated in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite initiatives , turks are the least integrated in germany a new study published on monday shows that turks are the least integrated group of immigrants in german society and are also less successful than immigrants from other countries in securing a job in germany . on a sliding scale of one -lrb- poorly integrated -rrb- to eight -lrb- well integrated -rrb- , the report by the berlin institute for population and development shows that turkish immigrants came last with a score of 2.4 despite being the second most numerous immigrant group in the country .
they finished bottom of the table behind immigrants from the former yugoslavia and africa -lrb- 3.2 -rrb- , the middle east -lrb- 4.1 -rrb- , southern europe -lrb- 4.4 -rrb- and the far east -lrb- 4.6 -rrb- .
the most integrated group in germany , according to the berlin institute , is immigrants from other eu countries who score 5.5 on the institute 's index .
the report 's assessment is based on results from several criteria including education , assimilation into society and employment to make up its index .
turks failing in education , assimilation and employment areas in the area of education , the study shows that 30 percent of students of turkish origin do not have a school leaving certificate and only 14 percent pass their final secondary school examinations .
in the state of saarland , 45 percent of turkish immigrants have failed to complete their high school education .
in terms of assimilation into society , turkish immigrants are marked down due to the fact that less than a third of turks born in germany have chosen to obtain german citizenship and 93 percent have married within the turkish community .
unemployment among turkish immigrants is high and many survive on state benefits while the reports shows a large number of turkish women remain in the home to manage the family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble defended the government 's integration record in an article in the german news magazine der spiegel , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble defended the german government 's initiatives to promote integration saying it was " on the right track " but added that more could be done .
" we must tell the socially weaker people , who have been isolated over generations : you are important , " schaeuble said .
" we value you .
you are as valuable as the others . "
some 15 million people in germany are foreigners or of foreign origin , including just under three million turks , representing just under 20 percent of the total population .
the largest group , statistically , are germans repatriated from the former soviet union following its collapse and german reunification . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it suggested a job quota as a step in the right direction .
-lrb- 01.03.2008 -rrb- low rate of german-turkish marriages impedes integration many german turks are pressured to marry only within their ethnic and religious group .

but according to the report , merkel has instructed the economics ministry to put the brakes on this practice after statistics showed that exports had risen 10.5 percent on an annual basis to 3.58 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.63 billion -rrb- through november 2008 .
some 75 percent of all medium and small businesses in iran use german-made equipment . business and banking trade elements are not specifically forbidden under un security council sanctions , which only limit the sale of technology that could be used in the weapons industry . merkel has repeatedly insisted that germany is only obliged to obey the un sanctions and said earlier this month that germany was not planning to undertake any further unilateral action against iran at this time .
but pressure from within the western powers working towards a nuclear-free iran may have persuaded her otherwise . germany has also come under fire from sections of the us media for its policy towards trade with iran .
a recent commentary by editorial writer dan schwammenthal in the wall street journal was titled : " germany loves iran . "
schwammenthal wrote that germany was less worried about an iranian nuclear bomb than it was about tightening sanctions that could negatively affect trade between the two countries . as the new us administration under president barack obama prepares to break with the previous administration and talk with iran about its nuclear program , germany now appears more comfortable with applying more pressure of its own . germany steps up restrictions on trade guarantees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's move increases the pressure on german firms the announcement to issue trade guarantees only in exceptional cases is actually the next logical step in a policy germany has been executing in increments ever since the nuclear stand-off between the west and iran began . germany , traditionally one of the top exporters to iran , has been gradually reducing the numbers of export guarantees for the past three years . german businesses have seen a significant fall in export guarantees for trade with the islamic republic since last year .
the economics ministry said a year ago that new guarantees for iran fell to 503.4 million euros in 2007 from 1.16 billion in 2006 . half-year numbers for last year show a sharp decline in new guarantees to 73.4 million euros , compared to 387 million in the first half of 2007 with full figures for 2008 to be published in the coming weeks . western powers believe iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons under the cover of a civilian atomic program .
tehran says it wants to master nuclear technology for peaceful power generation purposes . reports in recent weeks have said european countries , including britain , france and germany , could seek to pass new sanctions against iran , which has rejected repeated calls from the u.n. security council for it to suspend uranium enrichment . germany 's decision to limit its trade guarantees could herald the start of a new set of restrictions on iran by western powers . eu removes iranian organization from terror list in other developments , european union foreign ministers removed the people 's mujahedin of iran -lrb- pmoi -rrb- from their list of terrorist organizations on monday , despite public protests in tehran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pmoi 's case has been heard before but ignored the widely expected move follows a ruling by the european court in luxembourg , which in december said the eu was wrong to keep the pmoi 's assets frozen after it was taken off a british list of terrorist organizations . " what we are doing today is abiding by the resolution of the european court .
there 's nothing we can do about that resolution , " eu foreign-policy chief javier solana said . founded in 1965 , the pmoi operated a military wing in its early years , but says it renounced violence in june 2001 and now advocates the political overthrow of iran 's current government . reports of the eu 's planned decision prompted street protests outside eu embassies in tehran over the weekend by hundreds of iranian students and relatives of veterans of the iran-iraq war -lrb- 1980-88 -rrb- . iran regards pmoi as a terrorist group owing to its involvement in the assassinations of several high-ranking iranian officials , including the president and prime minister in 1980 . after the group was expelled from france in the 1980s , former iraqi president saddam hussein allocated a military base to the pmoi near the border with iran . before the ouster of saddam , the pmoi frequently infiltrated iranian territory , leading to clashes with iranian forces and casualties on both sides . solana said the eu decision could only be reversed if new evidence against the pmoi was presented to the european courts .

the most integrated group in germany , according to the berlin institute , is immigrants from other eu countries who score 5.5 on the institute 's index .
the report 's assessment is based on results from several criteria including education , assimilation into society and employment to make up its index .
turks failing in education , assimilation and employment areas in the area of education , the study shows that 30 percent of students of turkish origin do not have a school leaving certificate and only 14 percent pass their final secondary school examinations .
in the state of saarland , 45 percent of turkish immigrants have failed to complete their high school education .
in terms of assimilation into society , turkish immigrants are marked down due to the fact that less than a third of turks born in germany have chosen to obtain german citizenship and 93 percent have married within the turkish community .
unemployment among turkish immigrants is high and many survive on state benefits while the reports shows a large number of turkish women remain in the home to manage the family .

they finished bottom of the table behind immigrants from the former yugoslavia and africa -lrb- 3.2 -rrb- , the middle east -lrb- 4.1 -rrb- , southern europe -lrb- 4.4 -rrb- and the far east -lrb- 4.6 -rrb- .
the most integrated group in germany , according to the berlin institute , is immigrants from other eu countries who score 5.5 on the institute 's index .
the report 's assessment is based on results from several criteria including education , assimilation into society and employment to make up its index .
turks failing in education , assimilation and employment areas in the area of education , the study shows that 30 percent of students of turkish origin do not have a school leaving certificate and only 14 percent pass their final secondary school examinations .
in the state of saarland , 45 percent of turkish immigrants have failed to complete their high school education .
in terms of assimilation into society , turkish immigrants are marked down due to the fact that less than a third of turks born in germany have chosen to obtain german citizenship and 93 percent have married within the turkish community .
unemployment among turkish immigrants is high and many survive on state benefits while the reports shows a large number of turkish women remain in the home to manage the family .

26 , attributing the problems to rising food prices in 2008 and to the international financial crisis .
the conference should facilitate " a drastic change in the way we govern hunger , " jacques diouf , general director of the un food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , said in an interview with the daily el pais .

the summit was aimed at charting the progress in meeting the goals of the rome food summit in june 2008 .
it will draw up a road map to ensure the enforcement of the rome agreements to alleviate the suffering caused by soaring food prices and to stimulate agricultural development and food production , according to spanish government sources .

" we have more and more hungry people , while food reserves are the second lowest in 30 years , " diouf said .
about 960 million people are undernourished , and more than 100,000 die daily of causes related to hunger , according to un figures .
obama called on to play a " leading role " the summit will result in a madrid declaration on how to move forward .
the debates were to focus on how to meet emergency food needs , reinvigorate agricultural systems , increase investment in agriculture and improve market conditions .
" rich countries continue to massively subsidize their farmers , " diouf complained .
diouf said he hoped new us president barack obama would play a " leading role " in eradicating hunger , " starting with the united states , an advanced country which has 31 million hungry people .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 26.01.2009 german government to crack down on business with iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's status as a major exporter to iran is under threat germany is set to crack down on export credit guarantees to german firms seeking to do business with iran and will only approve them in exceptional cases , according to a report published monday . the article in the german business newspaper handelsblatt cited government and industry sources as saying that chancellor angela merkel had responded to criticism from germany 's partners , including the united states and israel , about the continued strength of german exports to iran despite a tightening of western sanctions over its nuclear program . german firms receive " hermes cover " export credit guarantees when selling goods to markets considered risky .
but according to the report , merkel has instructed the economics ministry to put the brakes on this practice after statistics showed that exports had risen 10.5 percent on an annual basis to 3.58 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.63 billion -rrb- through november 2008 .
some 75 percent of all medium and small businesses in iran use german-made equipment . business and banking trade elements are not specifically forbidden under un security council sanctions , which only limit the sale of technology that could be used in the weapons industry . merkel has repeatedly insisted that germany is only obliged to obey the un sanctions and said earlier this month that germany was not planning to undertake any further unilateral action against iran at this time .
but pressure from within the western powers working towards a nuclear-free iran may have persuaded her otherwise . germany has also come under fire from sections of the us media for its policy towards trade with iran .
a recent commentary by editorial writer dan schwammenthal in the wall street journal was titled : " germany loves iran . "
schwammenthal wrote that germany was less worried about an iranian nuclear bomb than it was about tightening sanctions that could negatively affect trade between the two countries . as the new us administration under president barack obama prepares to break with the previous administration and talk with iran about its nuclear program , germany now appears more comfortable with applying more pressure of its own . germany steps up restrictions on trade guarantees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's move increases the pressure on german firms the announcement to issue trade guarantees only in exceptional cases is actually the next logical step in a policy germany has been executing in increments ever since the nuclear stand-off between the west and iran began . germany , traditionally one of the top exporters to iran , has been gradually reducing the numbers of export guarantees for the past three years . german businesses have seen a significant fall in export guarantees for trade with the islamic republic since last year .
the economics ministry said a year ago that new guarantees for iran fell to 503.4 million euros in 2007 from 1.16 billion in 2006 . half-year numbers for last year show a sharp decline in new guarantees to 73.4 million euros , compared to 387 million in the first half of 2007 with full figures for 2008 to be published in the coming weeks . western powers believe iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons under the cover of a civilian atomic program .
tehran says it wants to master nuclear technology for peaceful power generation purposes . reports in recent weeks have said european countries , including britain , france and germany , could seek to pass new sanctions against iran , which has rejected repeated calls from the u.n. security council for it to suspend uranium enrichment . germany 's decision to limit its trade guarantees could herald the start of a new set of restrictions on iran by western powers . eu removes iranian organization from terror list in other developments , european union foreign ministers removed the people 's mujahedin of iran -lrb- pmoi -rrb- from their list of terrorist organizations on monday , despite public protests in tehran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pmoi 's case has been heard before but ignored the widely expected move follows a ruling by the european court in luxembourg , which in december said the eu was wrong to keep the pmoi 's assets frozen after it was taken off a british list of terrorist organizations . " what we are doing today is abiding by the resolution of the european court .
there 's nothing we can do about that resolution , " eu foreign-policy chief javier solana said . founded in 1965 , the pmoi operated a military wing in its early years , but says it renounced violence in june 2001 and now advocates the political overthrow of iran 's current government . reports of the eu 's planned decision prompted street protests outside eu embassies in tehran over the weekend by hundreds of iranian students and relatives of veterans of the iran-iraq war -lrb- 1980-88 -rrb- . iran regards pmoi as a terrorist group owing to its involvement in the assassinations of several high-ranking iranian officials , including the president and prime minister in 1980 . after the group was expelled from france in the 1980s , former iraqi president saddam hussein allocated a military base to the pmoi near the border with iran . before the ouster of saddam , the pmoi frequently infiltrated iranian territory , leading to clashes with iranian forces and casualties on both sides . solana said the eu decision could only be reversed if new evidence against the pmoi was presented to the european courts . " if there is something new that may be presented in front of the court , we 'll see , " solana said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they finished bottom of the table behind immigrants from the former yugoslavia and africa -lrb- 3.2 -rrb- , the middle east -lrb- 4.1 -rrb- , southern europe -lrb- 4.4 -rrb- and the far east -lrb- 4.6 -rrb- .
the most integrated group in germany , according to the berlin institute , is immigrants from other eu countries who score 5.5 on the institute 's index .
the report 's assessment is based on results from several criteria including education , assimilation into society and employment to make up its index .
turks failing in education , assimilation and employment areas in the area of education , the study shows that 30 percent of students of turkish origin do not have a school leaving certificate and only 14 percent pass their final secondary school examinations .
in the state of saarland , 45 percent of turkish immigrants have failed to complete their high school education .
in terms of assimilation into society , turkish immigrants are marked down due to the fact that less than a third of turks born in germany have chosen to obtain german citizenship and 93 percent have married within the turkish community .
unemployment among turkish immigrants is high and many survive on state benefits while the reports shows a large number of turkish women remain in the home to manage the family .

" we must tell the socially weaker people , who have been isolated over generations : you are important , " schaeuble said .
" we value you .
you are as valuable as the others . "
some 15 million people in germany are foreigners or of foreign origin , including just under three million turks , representing just under 20 percent of the total population .

attempts by environmental groups to stop the project have failed . germany gave the green light on monday to a controversial plan with india to drop six tons of iron dust in the south atlantic .
the experiment is the biggest trial ever of iron fertilization , a technology which could theoretically help stop global warming at very little cost .
but following complaints by environmentalists , germany 's science ministry ordered the plan suspended while it conducted an urgent review .
" after careful a study of expert reports , i am convinced there are no scientific or legal objections to the german-indian marine research project , " research minister annette schavan said on monday , jan .
26 .
" i have therefore decided … to begin the experiment . "
opponents of the plan fear that the results could be catastrophic , worring that it would cause the sea to become more acidic or trigger algae blooms that would deprive large areas of the ocean of oxygen .
environment minister sigmar gabriel told schavan in a letter recently that the experiment " destroys germany 's credibility and its vanguard role in protecting biodiversity . "
massive carbon sink under the plan , the iron dust is to be sprinkled over an area of 300 square kilometers from a german research vessel , the polarstern .
it is hoped that algae living at the ocean surface will soak up the iron and reproduce rapidly , absorbing carbon dioxide from the surface water .
at the end of their life cycle the algae die and sink .
most of the carbon ends up in deep water or on the sea bottom .
the ocean absorbs more carbon dioxide from the air , reducing the greenhouse effect .
sequestering carbon this way might stop global warming .

they finished bottom of the table behind immigrants from the former yugoslavia and africa -lrb- 3.2 -rrb- , the middle east -lrb- 4.1 -rrb- , southern europe -lrb- 4.4 -rrb- and the far east -lrb- 4.6 -rrb- .
the most integrated group in germany , according to the berlin institute , is immigrants from other eu countries who score 5.5 on the institute 's index .
the report 's assessment is based on results from several criteria including education , assimilation into society and employment to make up its index .
turks failing in education , assimilation and employment areas in the area of education , the study shows that 30 percent of students of turkish origin do not have a school leaving certificate and only 14 percent pass their final secondary school examinations .
in the state of saarland , 45 percent of turkish immigrants have failed to complete their high school education .
in terms of assimilation into society , turkish immigrants are marked down due to the fact that less than a third of turks born in germany have chosen to obtain german citizenship and 93 percent have married within the turkish community .
unemployment among turkish immigrants is high and many survive on state benefits while the reports shows a large number of turkish women remain in the home to manage the family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble defended the government 's integration record in an article in the german news magazine der spiegel , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble defended the german government 's initiatives to promote integration saying it was " on the right track " but added that more could be done .
" we must tell the socially weaker people , who have been isolated over generations : you are important , " schaeuble said .
" we value you .
you are as valuable as the others . "
some 15 million people in germany are foreigners or of foreign origin , including just under three million turks , representing just under 20 percent of the total population .
the largest group , statistically , are germans repatriated from the former soviet union following its collapse and german reunification . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

attempts by environmental groups to stop the project have failed . germany gave the green light on monday to a controversial plan with india to drop six tons of iron dust in the south atlantic .
the experiment is the biggest trial ever of iron fertilization , a technology which could theoretically help stop global warming at very little cost .
but following complaints by environmentalists , germany 's science ministry ordered the plan suspended while it conducted an urgent review .
" after careful a study of expert reports , i am convinced there are no scientific or legal objections to the german-indian marine research project , " research minister annette schavan said on monday , jan .
26 .
" i have therefore decided … to begin the experiment . "
opponents of the plan fear that the results could be catastrophic , worring that it would cause the sea to become more acidic or trigger algae blooms that would deprive large areas of the ocean of oxygen .
environment minister sigmar gabriel told schavan in a letter recently that the experiment " destroys germany 's credibility and its vanguard role in protecting biodiversity . "
massive carbon sink under the plan , the iron dust is to be sprinkled over an area of 300 square kilometers from a german research vessel , the polarstern .
it is hoped that algae living at the ocean surface will soak up the iron and reproduce rapidly , absorbing carbon dioxide from the surface water .
at the end of their life cycle the algae die and sink .
most of the carbon ends up in deep water or on the sea bottom .
the ocean absorbs more carbon dioxide from the air , reducing the greenhouse effect .
sequestering carbon this way might stop global warming .
thirty indian scientists and 18 from other nations left on board the polarstern from cape town on jan .

26 , that it was providing 58 million euros -lrb- $ 74.3 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid to vulnerable palestinians this year . in a statement , eu aid commissioner louis michel said around 32 million euros would be earmarked for gaza , which suffered massive damage during a three-week bombing campaign by israel .
an additional 20 million euros are to go to the west bank , with the remaining six million destined for palestinian refugees in lebanon .
" this funding package of 58 million euros will contribute substantially to the international effort on behalf of these suffering people and will also sustain our ongoing solidarity with the entire palestinian population , " michel said .
calling the situation in gaza " catastrophic , " he said the strip 's civilian population of nearly 1.5 million had faced " terrible and unprecedented " suffering compared to past times of violence in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
" destruction on such a massive scale saddens me deeply , " michel said during a fact-finding visit to the gaza strip .
eu commissioner distributes responsibility equally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's michel blamed israel and hamas equally michel sharply criticized israel for the massive destruction he saw around him , but said also hamas bore an " overwhelming " part of the blame .
" we have to also recall the overwhelming responsibility of hamas , " michel told local reporters as he toured jabaliya , a crowded refugee camp north of gaza city which was hit hard in israel 's 22-day offensive .
" firing rockets at civilians is a terrorist action , " he said .
" i intentionally say this here , hamas is a terrorist movement and it has to be denounced as such , " he said .
he earlier strongly condemned israel for its destruction of the civilian infrastructure , as he inspected buildings in gaza destroyed in the israeli assault , including an ice-cream , a cookie and a soft-drink factory .
he said the destruction pointed at an obvious violation of international humanitarian law .
but the 61-year-old belgian , normally known as a staunch critic of israel , added that for progress in the peace process to be possible , hamas had to accept two " small conditions " - recognize israel 's right to exist and to abandon armed struggle .
eu offering to help stop smuggling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to help stop hamas rearming after the war meanwhile , eu foreign ministers met in brussels to discuss ways of helping israel counter arms smuggling destined for hamas into the gaza strip and ensure that the fragile ceasefire between israel and hamas holds .
ministers were expected to call on hamas to halt its rocket launches , ask israel to reopen border crossings into gaza and discuss an " effective mechanism to prevent the smuggling of arms and ammunition " to the strip , diplomats said .
france on friday announced that it was dispatching a helicopter- carrying frigate to the gaza coast , while britain has said its royal navy would also be prepared to help .
meanwhile , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in brussels that his country would send five experts with special equipment to help egypt uncover the tunnels allegedly used to smuggle arms into gaza .
however , egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit said in brussels late sunday that most of the arms smuggling was taking place by sea and not through his territory .
abul gheit was attending talks with eu foreign ministers and counterparts from the palestinian authority , turkey , jordan and norway as part of a diplomatic push by the eu to make its voice heard in the region .
on wednesday , eu diplomats held separate talks with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni , who insisted on the need to stop weapons being smuggled into the strip .
eu foreign-policy chief javier solana has also offered to redeploy monitors which used to patrol the rafah crossing between 2005 and 2007 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

senator john mccain called for tax cuts rather than increased spending , while house minority leader john boehner said the package needs substantial changes .
the republicans do not have enough votes to defeat the package , but they could delay it in the senate .
speaker nancy pelosi has promised to bring the stimulus package to a vote in the house of representatives this week .
at the same time , the senate will begin drawing up another version that is likely to give republicans more of what they want , the bbc 's sarah morris reports from washington .
she says it all adds up to a huge early test of president obama 's ability to fix the economy with large bi-partisan majorities .
criticism speaking to fox television , mr mccain said the package does not do enough to create jobs .
" there have to be major rewrites if we want to stimulate the economy , " he said .
" as it stands now , i ca n't vote for it . "
mr boehner also criticised the plan : " i just think there 's a lot of slow-moving government spending in this program that wo n't work ...
we ca n't borrow and spend our way back to prosperity . "
hoping to change their minds , mr obama will hold private meetings with the republican leadership on tuesday .
his proposed plan will send the american budget deficit above $ 2 trillion amid the worst economic crisis in decades .
us vice president joe biden , who spent the weekend trying to persuade republican senators to come to a compromise , had earlier sounded an optimistic note .
" i think we 'll get a significant bipartisan support out of the senate , " he said .

while the english football premier league has struggled to sell its overseas game concept to a sceptical british media and fanbase , us sporting bodies have been setting out on global evangelisation .
both the national basketball association -lrb- nba -rrb- and the national football league -lrb- nfl -rrb- have staged high-profile sell-out events in london featuring us teams , and even ice-hockey 's nhl has staged challenge matches in europe .
now , in an ambitious statement of intent , basketball 's flagship nba league has moved into spacious new headquarters in london 's bustling kensington high street .
from there - in its open plan accommodation above the uruguayan embassy - the nba 's emea division hopes to market the game to an area that includes europe , the middle east , and africa .
' well placed ' " what we are seeing is the globalisation of sport , including basketball , " heidi ueberroth , nba president of global marketing partnerships and international business operations , told the bbc business website .
" even in these difficult economic times we think we are well placed .
like most organisations we are going through some belt-tightening , but are also looking to use the opportunity to drive into new areas , " said the woman behind the global expansion drive .
the nba founded in 1946 30-team league , 29 teams from us & one from canada annual turnover $ 4bn domestic tv deal of $ 7.5bn five european offices - london , paris , milan , istanbul and madrid four offices in china " there is great interest and demand for our sport even in these difficult times . "
and the 43-year-old , who joined the nba in 1995 , has no qualms about taking the game into markets where there already is a dominant sport , such as football in the uk .
" we look at it in a different , new way and focus on the attributes we have , " says ms ueberroth , whose father peter organised the 1984 olympic games in los angeles .
" the elements we have are so global - the game is incredibly easy to understand , and accessible . "
" it is easy in terms of infrastructure , you can have a two against two game almost anywhere . "
' long-term approach ' no one can doubt the nba 's expansion commitment - it has been patiently building a market in china for two decades and first staged a game in the uk in 1993 .
the london game is set to be staged again in 2009 " it has been a very long-term approach .
it has to be long term if we are to promote and sell the game around the world , " she says .
and there is progress .
last autumn two nba teams , the miami heat and the new jersey nets , played a pre-season friendly at london 's o2 arena .
the match was a sell-out , and there are plans to stage another game this year .
meanwhile , off the field , the uk has seen a sizeable increase in sales of nba-branded products such as sports shoes .
chinese way india and east asia are other target areas for the nba , with the game experiencing rapid growth in china .
" i have just come back from the middle east , and india , and china before that , and all these regions recognise the positive attributes of basketball , " says ms ueberroth .
it is in china that the nba 's expansion has been most spectacular , with an estimated 12 % of the urban chinese population now playing basketball .
basketball is being increasingly played in the cities of china fourteen nba games are broadcast live every week on state television and 51 regional stations .
and a year ago nba china was established , with investment from disney 's sports television channel espn , and four chinese banks and trade groups .
" china is our number one market outside the us , " she says .
" this process started back in 1985 when the chinese basketball team was invited to visit the us back . "
now , 23 years on , the nba has plans to design and develop 12 new arenas in partnership with stadium builder anschutz entertainment group .
" we are working on an 18,000-seat arena in shanghai which is planned to open for the world expo there in may 2010 . "
' impact players ' with the downturn in the us it may be that it is even-more important to find new areas of revenue , although ms ueberroth says us attendances " remain strong and on track " .
since the early 1990s the nba has used stars such as michael jordan , shaq o 'neal , kobe bryant , lebron james , and dwane wade to market the game globally .
chicago bulls ' star luol deng plays for the great britain team " the nba has some things that are different compared to other sports , " she says .
" we have the best players from around the world playing in a single league .
as well as the us we have players from 35 different countries .
" they include tony parker from france , dirk nowitzki from germany , and britain 's luol deng - these players are all ' impact players . "
but while these superstars can attract commercial partners at home and in overseas markets , it is gate revenues and tv money that are the real money earners for the nba .
a us television contract that runs from october 2008 until the end of the 2015-16 season is reputed to be worth about $ 7.5bn , a one-fifth increase on the previous deal .
online focus other cash generators are merchandise sales and the nba 's internet presence .
the nba.com network of 60 websites adds to other media assets including the league 's own television channel , nba tv , radio , and print publications .
we love being in london , it is a world city heidi ueberroth , nba " for us a big area of focus is online , " she says .
" we are looking at new ways to connect with the young and tech-savvy audience .
" we have more and more customised websites , programme packages and information . "
meanwhile , as us president barack obama , a basketball fan , is said to be ready to install a court at the white house , in kensington they are unpacking the last boxes and plugging in the drinks machines .
" we love being in london , it is a world city , " says ms ueberroth .
" it is great to have something more than we had before , and everyone in the same space .
we are planning to be here for the long term , we are really committed . "

last autumn two nba teams , the miami heat and the new jersey nets , played a pre-season friendly at london 's o2 arena .
the match was a sell-out , and there are plans to stage another game this year .
meanwhile , off the field , the uk has seen a sizeable increase in sales of nba-branded products such as sports shoes .
chinese way india and east asia are other target areas for the nba , with the game experiencing rapid growth in china .
" i have just come back from the middle east , and india , and china before that , and all these regions recognise the positive attributes of basketball , " says ms ueberroth .
it is in china that the nba 's expansion has been most spectacular , with an estimated 12 % of the urban chinese population now playing basketball .
basketball is being increasingly played in the cities of china fourteen nba games are broadcast live every week on state television and 51 regional stations .
and a year ago nba china was established , with investment from disney 's sports television channel espn , and four chinese banks and trade groups .
" china is our number one market outside the us , " she says .
" this process started back in 1985 when the chinese basketball team was invited to visit the us back . "
now , 23 years on , the nba has plans to design and develop 12 new arenas in partnership with stadium builder anschutz entertainment group .
" we are working on an 18,000-seat arena in shanghai which is planned to open for the world expo there in may 2010 . "
' impact players ' with the downturn in the us it may be that it is even-more important to find new areas of revenue , although ms ueberroth says us attendances " remain strong and on track " .
since the early 1990s the nba has used stars such as michael jordan , shaq o 'neal , kobe bryant , lebron james , and dwane wade to market the game globally .
chicago bulls ' star luol deng plays for the great britain team " the nba has some things that are different compared to other sports , " she says .
" we have the best players from around the world playing in a single league .
as well as the us we have players from 35 different countries .
" they include tony parker from france , dirk nowitzki from germany , and britain 's luol deng - these players are all ' impact players . "
but while these superstars can attract commercial partners at home and in overseas markets , it is gate revenues and tv money that are the real money earners for the nba .
a us television contract that runs from october 2008 until the end of the 2015-16 season is reputed to be worth about $ 7.5bn , a one-fifth increase on the previous deal .
online focus other cash generators are merchandise sales and the nba 's internet presence .
the nba.com network of 60 websites adds to other media assets including the league 's own television channel , nba tv , radio , and print publications .
we love being in london , it is a world city heidi ueberroth , nba " for us a big area of focus is online , " she says .
" we are looking at new ways to connect with the young and tech-savvy audience .
" we have more and more customised websites , programme packages and information . "
meanwhile , as us president barack obama , a basketball fan , is said to be ready to install a court at the white house , in kensington they are unpacking the last boxes and plugging in the drinks machines .

while the english football premier league has struggled to sell its overseas game concept to a sceptical british media and fanbase , us sporting bodies have been setting out on global evangelisation .
both the national basketball association -lrb- nba -rrb- and the national football league -lrb- nfl -rrb- have staged high-profile sell-out events in london featuring us teams , and even ice-hockey 's nhl has staged challenge matches in europe .
now , in an ambitious statement of intent , basketball 's flagship nba league has moved into spacious new headquarters in london 's bustling kensington high street .
from there - in its open plan accommodation above the uruguayan embassy - the nba 's emea division hopes to market the game to an area that includes europe , the middle east , and africa .
' well placed ' " what we are seeing is the globalisation of sport , including basketball , " heidi ueberroth , nba president of global marketing partnerships and international business operations , told the bbc business website .
" even in these difficult economic times we think we are well placed .
like most organisations we are going through some belt-tightening , but are also looking to use the opportunity to drive into new areas , " said the woman behind the global expansion drive .
the nba founded in 1946 30-team league , 29 teams from us & one from canada annual turnover $ 4bn domestic tv deal of $ 7.5bn five european offices - london , paris , milan , istanbul and madrid four offices in china " there is great interest and demand for our sport even in these difficult times .

and the 43-year-old , who joined the nba in 1995 , has no qualms about taking the game into markets where there already is a dominant sport , such as football in the uk .
" we look at it in a different , new way and focus on the attributes we have , " says ms ueberroth , whose father peter organised the 1984 olympic games in los angeles .
" the elements we have are so global - the game is incredibly easy to understand , and accessible . "
" it is easy in terms of infrastructure , you can have a two against two game almost anywhere . "
' long-term approach ' no one can doubt the nba 's expansion commitment - it has been patiently building a market in china for two decades and first staged a game in the uk in 1993 .
the london game is set to be staged again in 2009 " it has been a very long-term approach .

while the english football premier league has struggled to sell its overseas game concept to a sceptical british media and fanbase , us sporting bodies have been setting out on global evangelisation .
both the national basketball association -lrb- nba -rrb- and the national football league -lrb- nfl -rrb- have staged high-profile sell-out events in london featuring us teams , and even ice-hockey 's nhl has staged challenge matches in europe .
now , in an ambitious statement of intent , basketball 's flagship nba league has moved into spacious new headquarters in london 's bustling kensington high street .
from there - in its open plan accommodation above the uruguayan embassy - the nba 's emea division hopes to market the game to an area that includes europe , the middle east , and africa .
' well placed ' " what we are seeing is the globalisation of sport , including basketball , " heidi ueberroth , nba president of global marketing partnerships and international business operations , told the bbc business website .
" even in these difficult economic times we think we are well placed .
like most organisations we are going through some belt-tightening , but are also looking to use the opportunity to drive into new areas , " said the woman behind the global expansion drive .
the nba founded in 1946 30-team league , 29 teams from us & one from canada annual turnover $ 4bn domestic tv deal of $ 7.5bn five european offices - london , paris , milan , istanbul and madrid four offices in china " there is great interest and demand for our sport even in these difficult times . "
and the 43-year-old , who joined the nba in 1995 , has no qualms about taking the game into markets where there already is a dominant sport , such as football in the uk .
" we look at it in a different , new way and focus on the attributes we have , " says ms ueberroth , whose father peter organised the 1984 olympic games in los angeles .
" the elements we have are so global - the game is incredibly easy to understand , and accessible . "
" it is easy in terms of infrastructure , you can have a two against two game almost anywhere . "
' long-term approach ' no one can doubt the nba 's expansion commitment - it has been patiently building a market in china for two decades and first staged a game in the uk in 1993 .
the london game is set to be staged again in 2009 " it has been a very long-term approach .
it has to be long term if we are to promote and sell the game around the world , " she says .
and there is progress .
last autumn two nba teams , the miami heat and the new jersey nets , played a pre-season friendly at london 's o2 arena .
the match was a sell-out , and there are plans to stage another game this year .
meanwhile , off the field , the uk has seen a sizeable increase in sales of nba-branded products such as sports shoes .
chinese way india and east asia are other target areas for the nba , with the game experiencing rapid growth in china .
" i have just come back from the middle east , and india , and china before that , and all these regions recognise the positive attributes of basketball , " says ms ueberroth .
it is in china that the nba 's expansion has been most spectacular , with an estimated 12 % of the urban chinese population now playing basketball .
basketball is being increasingly played in the cities of china fourteen nba games are broadcast live every week on state television and 51 regional stations .
and a year ago nba china was established , with investment from disney 's sports television channel espn , and four chinese banks and trade groups .
" china is our number one market outside the us , " she says .
" this process started back in 1985 when the chinese basketball team was invited to visit the us back . "
now , 23 years on , the nba has plans to design and develop 12 new arenas in partnership with stadium builder anschutz entertainment group .
" we are working on an 18,000-seat arena in shanghai which is planned to open for the world expo there in may 2010 . "
' impact players ' with the downturn in the us it may be that it is even-more important to find new areas of revenue , although ms ueberroth says us attendances " remain strong and on track " .
since the early 1990s the nba has used stars such as michael jordan , shaq o 'neal , kobe bryant , lebron james , and dwane wade to market the game globally .
chicago bulls ' star luol deng plays for the great britain team " the nba has some things that are different compared to other sports , " she says .
" we have the best players from around the world playing in a single league .
as well as the us we have players from 35 different countries .
" they include tony parker from france , dirk nowitzki from germany , and britain 's luol deng - these players are all ' impact players . "
but while these superstars can attract commercial partners at home and in overseas markets , it is gate revenues and tv money that are the real money earners for the nba .
a us television contract that runs from october 2008 until the end of the 2015-16 season is reputed to be worth about $ 7.5bn , a one-fifth increase on the previous deal .

the public service ombudsman for wales ordered conwy council to pay the money after an inquiry into how it dealt with complaints against the tenants .
the ombudsman heard how the family had cars damaged , bricks thrown through windows and were racially abused .
the council said the report would now be considered by a committee .
peter tyndall , the ombudsman , ordered the council to pay the affected family , known as the smith family , £ 2,500 for each of the four years of " maladministration and injustice " in its handling of complaints by the family about their neighbours .
between 2003 and 2007 , mr smith , who is disabled , his wife , whose first language is neither english or welsh , and their young son lived in a property owned by clwyd alyn housing association .
complaints it was next to a house owned by conwy council which had tenants in .
during that time , the smiths complained on numerous occasions to the council about a number of incidents they said were carried out by their neighbours including having bricks thrown through their window on two occasions , six cars being vandalised , raw eggs thrown at them , verbal abuse and racial abuse .
however , the council was found to have failed to act on their complaints and the ombudsman found " repeated instances of maladministration " .
during his investigation , the ombudsman found the smiths had made several complaints against the council tenants and that there had also been five other complaints .
a number of complaints were made to conwy council about the tenants they included racial abuse , threats of violence , damage to cars , including battery acid being poured over a car , physical attacks , noise disturbance and a drunken garden party which lasted for three nights .
the police and housing association were also aware of the tenants concerned and various legal proceedings had been carried out against them .
' breaking point ' but despite evidence suggesting the tenants were problematic to neighbours , the council continued to house them .
at one point , the tenants were told that eviction proceedings were in place but after they appealed , those were stopped .
the smiths made several more complaints saying they were " at breaking point " and were living in a climate of fear and intimidation .
it was only when clwyd alyn housing association was able to get funding to purchase a suitable property for the smith family that they were able to move .
it is unclear if the tenants are still at the property they were living in .
review the ombudsman carried out a thorough review of the case and referred to previously upheld ombudsman reports against conwy council .
in his report the ombudsman said he was " concerned " to find in a " replication of previous failings to deal with anti-social behaviour " by the council .
he found a " continuing lack of knowledge " on the part of council staff dealing with enforcement action and criticised the authority 's " over reliance " on the police .
he recommended a review of procedures and training with details to be submitted to him within three months and that another report would be placed before full cabinet by the council .
he also ordered the council to give a " fulsome and detailed " apology to the smith family .
in the report , conwy council said it " had worked closely with local residents , local councillors , north wales police and clwyd alyn housing association in relation to ' real and alleged problems " ' .
it also said it had " sympathy for the residents " .
conwy council said the report would go to its constitution and maladministration review committee .

the public service ombudsman for wales ordered conwy council to pay the money after an inquiry into how it dealt with complaints against the tenants .
the ombudsman heard how the family had cars damaged , bricks thrown through windows and were racially abused .
the council said the report would now be considered by a committee .
peter tyndall , the ombudsman , ordered the council to pay the affected family , known as the smith family , £ 2,500 for each of the four years of " maladministration and injustice " in its handling of complaints by the family about their neighbours .
between 2003 and 2007 , mr smith , who is disabled , his wife , whose first language is neither english or welsh , and their young son lived in a property owned by clwyd alyn housing association .
complaints it was next to a house owned by conwy council which had tenants in .
during that time , the smiths complained on numerous occasions to the council about a number of incidents they said were carried out by their neighbours including having bricks thrown through their window on two occasions , six cars being vandalised , raw eggs thrown at them , verbal abuse and racial abuse .
however , the council was found to have failed to act on their complaints and the ombudsman found " repeated instances of maladministration " .
during his investigation , the ombudsman found the smiths had made several complaints against the council tenants and that there had also been five other complaints .
a number of complaints were made to conwy council about the tenants they included racial abuse , threats of violence , damage to cars , including battery acid being poured over a car , physical attacks , noise disturbance and a drunken garden party which lasted for three nights .
the police and housing association were also aware of the tenants concerned and various legal proceedings had been carried out against them .
' breaking point ' but despite evidence suggesting the tenants were problematic to neighbours , the council continued to house them .
at one point , the tenants were told that eviction proceedings were in place but after they appealed , those were stopped .
the smiths made several more complaints saying they were " at breaking point " and were living in a climate of fear and intimidation .
it was only when clwyd alyn housing association was able to get funding to purchase a suitable property for the smith family that they were able to move .
it is unclear if the tenants are still at the property they were living in .
review the ombudsman carried out a thorough review of the case and referred to previously upheld ombudsman reports against conwy council .
in his report the ombudsman said he was " concerned " to find in a " replication of previous failings to deal with anti-social behaviour " by the council .
he found a " continuing lack of knowledge " on the part of council staff dealing with enforcement action and criticised the authority 's " over reliance " on the police .
he recommended a review of procedures and training with details to be submitted to him within three months and that another report would be placed before full cabinet by the council .
he also ordered the council to give a " fulsome and detailed " apology to the smith family .
in the report , conwy council said it " had worked closely with local residents , local councillors , north wales police and clwyd alyn housing association in relation to ' real and alleged problems " ' .
it also said it had " sympathy for the residents " .
conwy council said the report would go to its constitution and maladministration review committee .

alfred russel wallace was in a remote part of what is now indonesia when he wrote to darwin about evolution .
but although both men 's ideas were very similar , it was darwin who became synonymous with the theory .
authorities on the island of ternate have now named a street after wallace and want to rebuild his former home .
there are also plans to establish an observatory in his name to research plant and animal species in eastern indonesia .
dr george beccaloni , curator of insects at the natural history museum and chairman of the alfred russel wallace memorial fund , said it was a fitting tribute .
the fact of the matter is that it was a co-published theory , it was not just darwin 's theory dr george beccaloni " i think it 's a brilliant idea .
if they rebuild the house , they would turn it into a museum dedicated to wallace and wallacea -lsb- a group of islands in indonesia -rsb- , " he said .
" they 're also in the process of building some sort of monument outside the property . "
this year is the 200th anniversary of darwin 's birth and the 150th anniversary since the publication of his most celebrated work .
on the origin of species , which put forward the theory of evolution by natural selection , contradicted the prevailing view of how species arose .
darwin said evolution occurred by natural selection where the " fittest " animals or plants , those with the characteristics best suited to their environment , were more likely to survive and reproduce .
but wallace , living at the house in ternate , posted a letter to darwin in 1858 - the year before on the origin of species was published - containing an essay detailing a similar theory .
charles darwin published on the origin of species 150 years ago darwin had been working for many years on evolution but had not yet published his idea .
they jointly published the theory in a paper in august 1858 but , while it made an impact among scientists , it failed to capture the public imagination .
but when darwin published on the origin of species a year later while wallace was still away , it caused an immediate stir and made darwin famous .
dr beccaloni said while wallace was neglected after his death , he did receive recognition for his work during his lifetime .
" the fact of the matter is that it was a co-published theory , it was not just darwin 's theory , " said dr beccaloni .
" wallace was n't overlooked during his lifetime - it was just that after his death , darwin got more and more famous largely because historians of science focused on darwin and hardly published anything on wallace . "
he said wallace was awarded various medals marking his achievements , and was also given the order of merit , the highest honour that could be given by the british monarch to a civilian .
no grudges wallace was born in 1823 in llanbadoc , near usk in monmouthshire , the second youngest of nine children .
his interest in natural history developed when he moved to neath and worked as a land surveyor with his brother .
he sailed to south america and later travelled to the far east , collecting tens of thousands of specimens , and wrote more than 20 books and hundreds of articles .
dr beccaloni said wallace bore no grudges to darwin and was always keen to give him more of the credit for the theory of evolution .
" darwin had come up with the idea before wallace but had n't published it .
wallace acknowledged that and said darwin deserved the credit , " he said .

but wallace , living at the house in ternate , posted a letter to darwin in 1858 - the year before on the origin of species was published - containing an essay detailing a similar theory .
charles darwin published on the origin of species 150 years ago darwin had been working for many years on evolution but had not yet published his idea .
they jointly published the theory in a paper in august 1858 but , while it made an impact among scientists , it failed to capture the public imagination .
but when darwin published on the origin of species a year later while wallace was still away , it caused an immediate stir and made darwin famous .
dr beccaloni said while wallace was neglected after his death , he did receive recognition for his work during his lifetime .
" the fact of the matter is that it was a co-published theory , it was not just darwin 's theory , " said dr beccaloni .
" wallace was n't overlooked during his lifetime - it was just that after his death , darwin got more and more famous largely because historians of science focused on darwin and hardly published anything on wallace . "
he said wallace was awarded various medals marking his achievements , and was also given the order of merit , the highest honour that could be given by the british monarch to a civilian .
no grudges wallace was born in 1823 in llanbadoc , near usk in monmouthshire , the second youngest of nine children .
his interest in natural history developed when he moved to neath and worked as a land surveyor with his brother .
he sailed to south america and later travelled to the far east , collecting tens of thousands of specimens , and wrote more than 20 books and hundreds of articles .
dr beccaloni said wallace bore no grudges to darwin and was always keen to give him more of the credit for the theory of evolution .
" darwin had come up with the idea before wallace but had n't published it .
wallace acknowledged that and said darwin deserved the credit , " he said .

on the origin of species , which put forward the theory of evolution by natural selection , contradicted the prevailing view of how species arose .
darwin said evolution occurred by natural selection where the " fittest " animals or plants , those with the characteristics best suited to their environment , were more likely to survive and reproduce .
but wallace , living at the house in ternate , posted a letter to darwin in 1858 - the year before on the origin of species was published - containing an essay detailing a similar theory .
darwin had been working for many years on evolution but had not yet published his idea .
they jointly published the theory in a paper in august 1858 but , while it made an impact among scientists , it failed to capture the public imagination .
but when darwin published on the origin of species a year later while wallace was still away , it caused an immediate stir and made darwin famous .
dr beccaloni said while wallace was neglected after his death , he did receive recognition for his work during his lifetime .
" the fact of the matter is that it was a co-published theory , it was not just darwin 's theory , " said dr beccaloni .
" wallace was n't overlooked during his lifetime - it was just that after his death , darwin got more and more famous largely because historians of science focused on darwin and hardly published anything on wallace . "
he said wallace was awarded various medals marking his achievements , and was also given the order of merit , the highest honour that could be given by the british monarch to a civilian .
no grudges wallace was born in 1823 in llanbadoc , near usk in monmouthshire , the second youngest of nine children .
his interest in natural history developed when he moved to neath and worked as a land surveyor with his brother .
he sailed to south america and later travelled to the far east , collecting tens of thousands of specimens , and wrote more than 20 books and hundreds of articles .
dr beccaloni said wallace bore no grudges to darwin and was always keen to give him more of the credit for the theory of evolution .
" darwin had come up with the idea before wallace but had n't published it .
wallace acknowledged that and said darwin deserved the credit , " he said .

it should not be taken too seriously , but it does illustrate how the strength of the euro is providing big savings for people south of the border - and lucrative opportunities for those in the wedding industry .
" we say that to go to donegal we 'll have to charge you an extra £ 100 , but then they 're saying that 's ok , no problem , and we 're going ... why did n't we say £ 200 ! "
six months ago the euro was worth 79p .
now it is almost worth a pound .
shops along the northern ireland side of the border will happily take it on a like-for-like basis , meaning a huge influx of people from the republic doing everything from grocery to furniture shopping .

" i was at a wedding fair in dublin yesterday and pricing everything down there compared to things i 've already booked here and seeing the savings we 've made .
" a lot of friends would be coming up to newry thinking they could make the savings too .
it 's worth the while to come up and get your rings or your dress up here rather than in dublin . "
lynette douglas , owner of platinum brides in rathfriland , had one customer who went one better .
" i had a girl that travelled three hours from longford .
she 'd seen the dress in the republic and asked if i had it .
" she drove up , tried it on , bought it and took it home with her that day . "
patrick mcconville who works in the suit hire business in portadown , saw the difference for himself at a wedding fair south of the border in county louth .
" the price they charge for the average tails in the republic is roughly 135 euro .
" we were doing it at 65 euro - the difference in it is phenomenal . "
while some economists have predicted that sterling will regain ground against the euro in the second half of the year , there is still plenty of business to be done .
there are no official statistics available yet from the hotel industry as to how the euro has benefitted northern ireland businesses compared to those in the republic .
chris stevenson from the slieve donard said , anecdotally , it appears the number of enquiries from the south has doubled .
there has even been an interested bridal party from county kerry .
" we 'd probably have 4-5 enquiries a week from the south , these days you 're looking at 10 a week , with quite a lot being confirmed as bookings , " he said .
" the main thing does seem to be the price , its making it much more attractive to come north . "

the british heart foundation -lrb- bhf -rrb- money will be used to help improve residents ' health to prevent cardiac problems occurring in the first place .
it will also go towards supporting those who already have heart disease .
bhf figures suggest that a man from dundee is one-and-a-half times more likely to die young from heart disease than one a few miles away in angus .
the charity is investing £ 9m throughout the uk on projects which aim to tackle inequalities in heart disease by focussing on some of the most disadvantaged areas .
hearty lives dundee will involve inviting people in for health checks at an earlier age .
currently only those aged 45-64 are part of a project which sees blood pressure and cholesterol tests being done and then lifestyle advice offered . "
if you think on it - if you waited until people had attacks before you tried to treat them , then how long would they have to spend in hospital ? "
alex whyte , 74 that scheme will be extended so that those aged from 40 years old can take part .
alex whyte , 74 , from the whitfield area of the city , found out he had a heart problem after getting his blood pressure checked at a local gala day in 2006 .
a few months later he had an operation to help open up one of his arteries .
mr whyte said : " if this had n't been done i suppose i could 've had a heart attack and then who knows how long you would 've been in hospital or even if you would 've survived the heart attack . "
he welcomes the extra cash that dundee is getting .
he said : " if you think on it - if you waited until people had attacks before you tried to treat them , then how long would they have to spend in hospital ?
" so i think it 's very good that they are putting more money into preventative medicine rather than waiting to try to cure people once they 've had it -lsb- a heart attack -rsb- . "
the new money will also be used to look at ways of making it easier for people to access health services , for example going into homes , holding sessions at different types of venues and at more flexible times so that more residents can attend .
marjory burns , director of bhf scotland , said : " we recognise that with busy working and family lives , it can be hard for people to eat healthily , or take part in physical activity .
" hearty lives dundee aims to make it easier for the city 's residents to make healthier choices as part of their everyday lives . "

mr whyte said : " if this had n't been done i suppose i could 've had a heart attack and then who knows how long you would 've been in hospital or even if you would 've survived the heart attack . "
he welcomes the extra cash that dundee is getting .
he said : " if you think on it - if you waited until people had attacks before you tried to treat them , then how long would they have to spend in hospital ?
" so i think it 's very good that they are putting more money into preventative medicine rather than waiting to try to cure people once they 've had it -lsb- a heart attack -rsb- . "
the new money will also be used to look at ways of making it easier for people to access health services , for example going into homes , holding sessions at different types of venues and at more flexible times so that more residents can attend .
marjory burns , director of bhf scotland , said : " we recognise that with busy working and family lives , it can be hard for people to eat healthily , or take part in physical activity .
" hearty lives dundee aims to make it easier for the city 's residents to make healthier choices as part of their everyday lives . "
