the politician said that under the administration of long-term cdu chancellor helmut kohl germany 's research ministry demanded in a 1983 letter that the federal agency responsible for the findings on gorleben alter them .
gabriel said scientists had warned that gorleben might prove to be a bad long-term storage site for the waste and that other locations should be explored .

" should the evaluation show that something is not order , we will have to reassess the situation , " said vater , adding that it would take time to comb through the 80 to 90 folders .
he criticized the timing of the revelation , which was made by the daily sueddeutsche zeitung in its wednesday edition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 09.09.2009 nuclear revelations contaminate german election campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors have opposed using gorleben for nuclear waste for years environment minister sigmar gabriel says new data proves that former chancellor helmut kohl 's government tampered with a report to play down the risks of a nuclear waste storage site . gabriel , a social democrat , on wednesday spoke of a " downright scandal " and said that new " records proved " that christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- politicians had in the 1980s manipulated assessments over the suitability of the gorleben salt mine in lower saxony as a permanent storage site for nuclear waste .
the politician said that under the administration of long-term cdu chancellor helmut kohl germany 's research ministry demanded in a 1983 letter that the federal agency responsible for the findings on gorleben alter them .
gabriel said scientists had warned that gorleben might prove to be a bad long-term storage site for the waste and that other locations should be explored .
these warnings , however , were ignored because certain conservative politicians allegedly used their influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel 's spd seems to be off the hook since they were n't in government at the time according to the agency 's 1983 report there was a risk that radioactive substances could seep into the ground water .
this particular warning was eventually played down in the report .
" a downright scandal " the government of chancellor angela merkel , the current head of the cdu , has pledged a thorough check of all gorleben files , dating back to 1980s . " we will put all files on the table , " said deputy government spokesman klaus vater in berlin on wednesday .
" should the evaluation show that something is not order , we will have to reassess the situation , " said vater , adding that it would take time to comb through the 80 to 90 folders .
he criticized the timing of the revelation , which was made by the daily sueddeutsche zeitung in its wednesday edition .
after gathering dust for more than a quarter of century , the controversial files have now surfaced just three weeks ahead of federal elections .
" i do ask myself : did nobody ever take a look at these files ? "
vater said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl can expect new scrutiny of his government timely revelations ?
the deputy head of the cdu parliamentary group , katherina reiche , slammed the allegations as timely campaign diversions .
" the environment minister just wants one thing : campaigning rather than a solution to the issue of ultimate waste disposal .
gabriel 's sole aim is to discredit gorleben no matter whether it 's a suitable spot or not . "

but two-thirds of germans say they do n't want to be immunized . in the latest step to fight an anticipated breakout of the h1n1 swine flu virus , germany 's 16 state health ministers have announced they plan to order another 18 million vaccination units .
that 's enough to immunize nine million more people and ensures there is enough stock should demand surge later in the year .
the health ministers have already ordered 50 million swine flu vaccinations for 25 million people , as each person requires two doses of the vaccine .
that means there will be enough vaccine to cover 40 percent of the german population .
the latest order is subject to funding being available .
the thorny question of who will bear the cost of this – the federal government , the health insurers , the state health departments or local authorities – is being discussed at a special working group meeting in berlin on wednesday .
two-thirds reject swine flu immunization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans are not convinced that swine flu is a threat a new study conducted by the forsa institute for dak , one of germany 's largest health insurers , revealed that a surprising number of germans do not plan to get immunized .
in the study of 1,001 people aged between 18 and 60 years , 62 percent said they would " definitely not , " or " almost definitely not " let themselves be vaccinated this autumn when the first swine flu vaccines become available .
eighty-two percent of germans said that swine flu poses a " fairly low " or " very low " danger .
bavarians , in germany 's south , in particular rejected vaccination .
only nine percent said they would " definitely " go to their doctor to be immunized compared to 14 percent of germans on average .
it 's a different picture in eastern germany , where almost a quarter of those who took part in the study said they were " definitely " going to get immunized .
" if the situation changes in the next few weeks , than we expect the number of people prepared to vaccinate themselves to increase sharply , " said horst boelle , the director of the claims department at dak .
are vaccinations worth the risk ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german medical association urges a rethink the german medical association is urging the government to reassess its mass vaccinations plan , the largest such scheme in postwar history .
" many people have already had swine flu and never even noticed that had it , " said frank ulrich montgomery , the association 's vice president .
montgomery also questioned whether the risks of vaccinating outweigh those of actually getting swine flu .
swine flu is highly infectious but it produces fairly mild symptoms and no one in germany has died of it so far .
" the disease could take a turn for the worse , and claim its first fatalities , " said deputy health minister klaus theo schroeder .
" i have the impression that we are now able to do that which we need to do in the next few weeks , " he added .
the first vaccinations are expected to be available in october and more units will be delivered on a weekly basis .
schroeder said mass vaccinations should be completed by the end of january or early february next year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 09.09.2009 parents ' jobs are most important factor in fighting eu child poverty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty has far-reaching consequences for children growing up in europe having parents who work is the most important factor in preventing child poverty in europe .
but what can the eu do to alleviate child poverty ?
guidelines are available , but it 's mostly down to individual countries . the fight against child poverty in the eu is , first and foremost , a matter for individual states .
yet following the lisbon strategy , a development plan set out by the european council in 2000 , eu governments have promised to place children at the center of political dealings .
furthermore , the european commission has set out criteria defining child poverty , how it arises , spreads and how it can be combated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty can lead to social exclusion for many children the most recent report on child poverty by the commission was published in february 2008 ; in other words , before the financial crisis began .
the figures are likely to have worsened in the meantime .
then 19 million children in the eu were classified as poor , on average every fifth child .
the eu defines poor as earning 60 percent of the average income in each respective member state .
for a family in germany with two children , that means 1,600 euros -lrb- $ 2,300 -rrb- per month .
poverty impacts all areas of life the eu is keen to stress , however , that this does not just mean money as a means to consume , rather that child poverty takes away access to education -lrb- and therefore a good start in life -rrb- , damages health and excludes youngsters from a large part of cultural and social life .
that is another point brussels stresses : child poverty is a negative economic factor for each country .
it 's not just about sympathy and justice , but rather that economic policy should have a vested interest in nurturing and supporting children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployed parents are the greatest cause of child poverty the eu commission is especially concerned about unemployment .
out-of-work parents are the biggest cause of child poverty .
this leads to a vicious cycle that is hard to escape .
negative factors in families suffering from unemployment are often passed down from generation to generation .
according to the report , immigrant families are most at risk .
they suffer not only disproportionately from difficult financial circumstances , but also their children experience social and cultural exclusion .
policy solutions are the key the eu recommends to individual states a host of social , economic and cultural policies , including active employment and childcare policies , financial aid for families and integrated education and health policies .
and it has lauded the european states that lead in the fight against child poverty .
the scandinavian countries , the netherlands , austria , cyprus and slovenia all came out favorably in the commission 's report - in other words , not just rich countries .
they received praise for their comprehensive policies as the relatively high level and effectiveness of their welfare systems ran parallel with active employment policies and good childcare options .
italy , britain and spain came out the worst , with germany somewhere in the middle .

joerg tauss maintains his innocence , saying he was conducting research . state prosecutors in the southern city of karlsruhe accuse tauss of having acquired , distributed , and possessed child pornography 102 times between may 2007 and january 2009 .
an investigation was carried out earlier this year after evidence was found in tauss ' office , including mobile phone pictures and dvds of underage sex .
but prosecutors could not press charges until parliament voted to repeal his immunity status , which happened on tuesday . fifty-six-year-old tauss is also accused of having shared child pornography with others via email in six cases , according to prosecutors .
the former spd politician has repeatedly denied the charges , insisting that he was merely conducting research as part of his efforts to break up a child pornography ring .
in response , prosecutors said investigators had found " no evidence of this claim . "
tauss resigned his position after the scandal broke and later joined the pirate party , a swedish-based group that advocates for more freedom on the internet .
he has resisted calls to step down from parliament .

joerg tauss maintains his innocence , saying he was conducting research . state prosecutors in the southern city of karlsruhe accuse tauss of having acquired , distributed , and possessed child pornography 102 times between may 2007 and january 2009 .
an investigation was carried out earlier this year after evidence was found in tauss ' office , including mobile phone pictures and dvds of underage sex .
but prosecutors could not press charges until parliament voted to repeal his immunity status , which happened on tuesday . fifty-six-year-old tauss is also accused of having shared child pornography with others via email in six cases , according to prosecutors .
the former spd politician has repeatedly denied the charges , insisting that he was merely conducting research as part of his efforts to break up a child pornography ring .
in response , prosecutors said investigators had found " no evidence of this claim . "
tauss resigned his position after the scandal broke and later joined the pirate party , a swedish-based group that advocates for more freedom on the internet .
he has resisted calls to step down from parliament .
tauss is expected to lose his seat in germany 's parliamentary elections on september 27. vj / ap / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after a german-ordered airstrike killed scores in kunduz last week , the left 's view is becoming more popular . the campaign signs for germany 's left party send a clear message : " out of afghanistan ! "
it 's a sentiment widely held by many germans and has increased since a german commander in afghanistan ordered an airstrike on two fuel tankers , hijacked by the taliban last week , that left scores of people dead , including civilians .
while the future of the 4,200 german troops currently deployed in afghanistan is a political issue , politicians from chancellor angela merkel 's ruling christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their coalition partner , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , say last week 's attack will not change government policy on afghanistan .
with the exception of the left party , the rest of germany 's major parties are in favor of continuing the country 's mission in afghanistan .
but the latest weekly election polls , released on wednesday , suggest that the attack may be influencing voters .
a survey by the forsa-institut shows an increase of four percentage points for the left party , to 14 percent , while an ifd allensbach poll gave the party a 2 percent increase over last week , to 11.5 percent .

in a meeting of the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , about the attacks on tuesday , left party co-leader oskar lafontaine reiterated his party 's stance .
" we want german troops out of afghanistan because we are firmly convinced that the mission does nothing for international security , nothing for peace and is not the way to counter international terrorism , " said lafontaine .
the former spd leader and finance minister under chancellor schroeder dismissed any talk of forming a coalition with the social democrats and green party .
" the social democrats and the greens still support our troops staying in afghanistan and we want to bring them home immediately .
so long as interests are diametrically opposed nobody needs to speculate about any coalition with the spd and greens after the sept .

" you can never stabilize afghanistan with an army , " one left party campaigner told deutsche welle .
" i understand that we have a huge problem in afghanistan and the taliban are not our friends - let that be clear !

other parties slip in polls while the far-left are riding higher in the polls , the ruling christian democrats and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have dipped slightly .
the cdu received 35 percent in both surveys , dipping by 0.5-1 percent .

the social democrats slipped similarly , to 21-22.5 percent .
their preferred coalition partners , the greens , polled 10-13 percent .

after a german-ordered airstrike killed scores in kunduz last week , the left 's view is becoming more popular . the campaign signs for germany 's left party send a clear message : " out of afghanistan ! "
it 's a sentiment widely held by many germans and has increased since a german commander in afghanistan ordered an airstrike on two fuel tankers , hijacked by the taliban last week , that left scores of people dead , including civilians .
while the future of the 4,200 german troops currently deployed in afghanistan is a political issue , politicians from chancellor angela merkel 's ruling christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their coalition partner , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , say last week 's attack will not change government policy on afghanistan .
with the exception of the left party , the rest of germany 's major parties are in favor of continuing the country 's mission in afghanistan .
but the latest weekly election polls , released on wednesday , suggest that the attack may be influencing voters .

" we want german troops out of afghanistan because we are firmly convinced that the mission does nothing for international security , nothing for peace and is not the way to counter international terrorism , " said lafontaine .

but two-thirds of germans say they do n't want to be immunized . in the latest step to fight an anticipated breakout of the h1n1 swine flu virus , germany 's 16 state health ministers have announced they plan to order another 18 million vaccination units .
that 's enough to immunize nine million more people and ensures there is enough stock should demand surge later in the year .
the health ministers have already ordered 50 million swine flu vaccinations for 25 million people , as each person requires two doses of the vaccine .
that means there will be enough vaccine to cover 40 percent of the german population .
the latest order is subject to funding being available .
the thorny question of who will bear the cost of this – the federal government , the health insurers , the state health departments or local authorities – is being discussed at a special working group meeting in berlin on wednesday .
two-thirds reject swine flu immunization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans are not convinced that swine flu is a threat a new study conducted by the forsa institute for dak , one of germany 's largest health insurers , revealed that a surprising number of germans do not plan to get immunized .
in the study of 1,001 people aged between 18 and 60 years , 62 percent said they would " definitely not , " or " almost definitely not " let themselves be vaccinated this autumn when the first swine flu vaccines become available .
eighty-two percent of germans said that swine flu poses a " fairly low " or " very low " danger .
bavarians , in germany 's south , in particular rejected vaccination .
only nine percent said they would " definitely " go to their doctor to be immunized compared to 14 percent of germans on average .
it 's a different picture in eastern germany , where almost a quarter of those who took part in the study said they were " definitely " going to get immunized .
" if the situation changes in the next few weeks , than we expect the number of people prepared to vaccinate themselves to increase sharply , " said horst boelle , the director of the claims department at dak .
are vaccinations worth the risk ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german medical association urges a rethink the german medical association is urging the government to reassess its mass vaccinations plan , the largest such scheme in postwar history .
" many people have already had swine flu and never even noticed that had it , " said frank ulrich montgomery , the association 's vice president .
montgomery also questioned whether the risks of vaccinating outweigh those of actually getting swine flu .
swine flu is highly infectious but it produces fairly mild symptoms and no one in germany has died of it so far .
" the disease could take a turn for the worse , and claim its first fatalities , " said deputy health minister klaus theo schroeder .
" i have the impression that we are now able to do that which we need to do in the next few weeks , " he added .
the first vaccinations are expected to be available in october and more units will be delivered on a weekly basis .
schroeder said mass vaccinations should be completed by the end of january or early february next year .
testing of the vaccine is ongoing .

the politician said that under the administration of long-term cdu chancellor helmut kohl germany 's research ministry demanded in a 1983 letter that the federal agency responsible for the findings on gorleben alter them .
gabriel said scientists had warned that gorleben might prove to be a bad long-term storage site for the waste and that other locations should be explored .
these warnings , however , were ignored because certain conservative politicians allegedly used their influence .

" a downright scandal " the government of chancellor angela merkel , the current head of the cdu , has pledged a thorough check of all gorleben files , dating back to 1980s . " we will put all files on the table , " said deputy government spokesman klaus vater in berlin on wednesday .
" should the evaluation show that something is not order , we will have to reassess the situation , " said vater , adding that it would take time to comb through the 80 to 90 folders .
he criticized the timing of the revelation , which was made by the daily sueddeutsche zeitung in its wednesday edition .
after gathering dust for more than a quarter of century , the controversial files have now surfaced just three weeks ahead of federal elections .
" i do ask myself : did nobody ever take a look at these files ? "
vater said .

gabriel 's sole aim is to discredit gorleben no matter whether it 's a suitable spot or not . "
reiche reiterated her party 's call for a " thorough investigation to ascertain whether gorleben is a suitable spot for the disposal of atomic waste . "
she accused gabriel of dodging this issue , hinting that the minister was doing so because he feared that an investigation could prove that gorleben was in fact a suitable spot for dumping the radioactive waste. cs / nk / dpa / reuters / afp / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but two-thirds of germans say they do n't want to be immunized . in the latest step to fight an anticipated breakout of the h1n1 swine flu virus , germany 's 16 state health ministers have announced they plan to order another 18 million vaccination units .
that 's enough to immunize nine million more people and ensures there is enough stock should demand surge later in the year .
the health ministers have already ordered 50 million swine flu vaccinations for 25 million people , as each person requires two doses of the vaccine .
that means there will be enough vaccine to cover 40 percent of the german population .
the latest order is subject to funding being available .
the thorny question of who will bear the cost of this – the federal government , the health insurers , the state health departments or local authorities – is being discussed at a special working group meeting in berlin on wednesday .
two-thirds reject swine flu immunization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans are not convinced that swine flu is a threat a new study conducted by the forsa institute for dak , one of germany 's largest health insurers , revealed that a surprising number of germans do not plan to get immunized .
in the study of 1,001 people aged between 18 and 60 years , 62 percent said they would " definitely not , " or " almost definitely not " let themselves be vaccinated this autumn when the first swine flu vaccines become available .
eighty-two percent of germans said that swine flu poses a " fairly low " or " very low " danger .
bavarians , in germany 's south , in particular rejected vaccination .
only nine percent said they would " definitely " go to their doctor to be immunized compared to 14 percent of germans on average .
it 's a different picture in eastern germany , where almost a quarter of those who took part in the study said they were " definitely " going to get immunized .
" if the situation changes in the next few weeks , than we expect the number of people prepared to vaccinate themselves to increase sharply , " said horst boelle , the director of the claims department at dak .
are vaccinations worth the risk ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german medical association urges a rethink the german medical association is urging the government to reassess its mass vaccinations plan , the largest such scheme in postwar history .
" many people have already had swine flu and never even noticed that had it , " said frank ulrich montgomery , the association 's vice president .
montgomery also questioned whether the risks of vaccinating outweigh those of actually getting swine flu .
swine flu is highly infectious but it produces fairly mild symptoms and no one in germany has died of it so far .
" the disease could take a turn for the worse , and claim its first fatalities , " said deputy health minister klaus theo schroeder .
" i have the impression that we are now able to do that which we need to do in the next few weeks , " he added .
the first vaccinations are expected to be available in october and more units will be delivered on a weekly basis .
schroeder said mass vaccinations should be completed by the end of january or early february next year .
testing of the vaccine is ongoing .
in one pilot study , it was shown that a single vaccination was enough to provide protection in 80 percent of all test persons. wl / dpa / afp / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 09.09.2009 most germans do n't want swine flu vaccinations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is busy planning mass vaccinations the german government has ordered 18 million more vaccinations against swine flu .
but two-thirds of germans say they do n't want to be immunized . in the latest step to fight an anticipated breakout of the h1n1 swine flu virus , germany 's 16 state health ministers have announced they plan to order another 18 million vaccination units .
that 's enough to immunize nine million more people and ensures there is enough stock should demand surge later in the year .
the health ministers have already ordered 50 million swine flu vaccinations for 25 million people , as each person requires two doses of the vaccine .
that means there will be enough vaccine to cover 40 percent of the german population .
the latest order is subject to funding being available .
the thorny question of who will bear the cost of this – the federal government , the health insurers , the state health departments or local authorities – is being discussed at a special working group meeting in berlin on wednesday .
two-thirds reject swine flu immunization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans are not convinced that swine flu is a threat a new study conducted by the forsa institute for dak , one of germany 's largest health insurers , revealed that a surprising number of germans do not plan to get immunized .
in the study of 1,001 people aged between 18 and 60 years , 62 percent said they would " definitely not , " or " almost definitely not " let themselves be vaccinated this autumn when the first swine flu vaccines become available .
eighty-two percent of germans said that swine flu poses a " fairly low " or " very low " danger .
bavarians , in germany 's south , in particular rejected vaccination .
only nine percent said they would " definitely " go to their doctor to be immunized compared to 14 percent of germans on average .
it 's a different picture in eastern germany , where almost a quarter of those who took part in the study said they were " definitely " going to get immunized .
" if the situation changes in the next few weeks , than we expect the number of people prepared to vaccinate themselves to increase sharply , " said horst boelle , the director of the claims department at dak .
are vaccinations worth the risk ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german medical association urges a rethink the german medical association is urging the government to reassess its mass vaccinations plan , the largest such scheme in postwar history .
" many people have already had swine flu and never even noticed that had it , " said frank ulrich montgomery , the association 's vice president .
montgomery also questioned whether the risks of vaccinating outweigh those of actually getting swine flu .
swine flu is highly infectious but it produces fairly mild symptoms and no one in germany has died of it so far .
" the disease could take a turn for the worse , and claim its first fatalities , " said deputy health minister klaus theo schroeder .
" i have the impression that we are now able to do that which we need to do in the next few weeks , " he added .
the first vaccinations are expected to be available in october and more units will be delivered on a weekly basis .
schroeder said mass vaccinations should be completed by the end of january or early february next year .
testing of the vaccine is ongoing .
in one pilot study , it was shown that a single vaccination was enough to provide protection in 80 percent of all test persons. wl / dpa / afp / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de vaccination timetable unclear as swine flu spreads failing to reach agreement over funding the german government 's plan to launch mass vaccinations remains riddled with uncertainties .
experts point to the new drugs ' unknown side effects as another problem .
-lrb- 26.08.2009 -rrb- who forecasts ' explosion ' of swine flu cases the world health organization predicts that there will be a rapid and global spread of swine flu in the coming months and has urged governments to step up their precautionary measures .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 09.09.2009 parents ' jobs are most important factor in fighting eu child poverty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty has far-reaching consequences for children growing up in europe having parents who work is the most important factor in preventing child poverty in europe .
but what can the eu do to alleviate child poverty ?
guidelines are available , but it 's mostly down to individual countries . the fight against child poverty in the eu is , first and foremost , a matter for individual states .
yet following the lisbon strategy , a development plan set out by the european council in 2000 , eu governments have promised to place children at the center of political dealings .
furthermore , the european commission has set out criteria defining child poverty , how it arises , spreads and how it can be combated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty can lead to social exclusion for many children the most recent report on child poverty by the commission was published in february 2008 ; in other words , before the financial crisis began .
the figures are likely to have worsened in the meantime .
then 19 million children in the eu were classified as poor , on average every fifth child .
the eu defines poor as earning 60 percent of the average income in each respective member state .
for a family in germany with two children , that means 1,600 euros -lrb- $ 2,300 -rrb- per month .
poverty impacts all areas of life the eu is keen to stress , however , that this does not just mean money as a means to consume , rather that child poverty takes away access to education -lrb- and therefore a good start in life -rrb- , damages health and excludes youngsters from a large part of cultural and social life .
that is another point brussels stresses : child poverty is a negative economic factor for each country .
it 's not just about sympathy and justice , but rather that economic policy should have a vested interest in nurturing and supporting children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployed parents are the greatest cause of child poverty the eu commission is especially concerned about unemployment .
out-of-work parents are the biggest cause of child poverty .
this leads to a vicious cycle that is hard to escape .
negative factors in families suffering from unemployment are often passed down from generation to generation .
according to the report , immigrant families are most at risk .
they suffer not only disproportionately from difficult financial circumstances , but also their children experience social and cultural exclusion .
policy solutions are the key the eu recommends to individual states a host of social , economic and cultural policies , including active employment and childcare policies , financial aid for families and integrated education and health policies .
and it has lauded the european states that lead in the fight against child poverty .
the scandinavian countries , the netherlands , austria , cyprus and slovenia all came out favorably in the commission 's report - in other words , not just rich countries .
they received praise for their comprehensive policies as the relatively high level and effectiveness of their welfare systems ran parallel with active employment policies and good childcare options .
italy , britain and spain came out the worst , with germany somewhere in the middle .

the film shows how the nazis were put under pressure by the united states , which threatened to boycott the olympic games if germany failed to field any jewish athletes . in a bid to save face and get international respectability , the nazi leadership selected bergmann to participate in the games .
they made it clear her family left behind in germany would suffer the consequences if she refused . an unusually muscular replacement bergmann , played in the film by young german actress karoline herfurth , returned to germany and broke the german high-jump record ahead of the olympics . but just days before the start of the 1936 olympics , the nazis barred bergmann , a favorite for gold , from the games , saying her performances had n't been satisfactory .

the film shows how the nazis were put under pressure by the united states , which threatened to boycott the olympic games if germany failed to field any jewish athletes . in a bid to save face and get international respectability , the nazi leadership selected bergmann to participate in the games .
they made it clear her family left behind in germany would suffer the consequences if she refused . an unusually muscular replacement bergmann , played in the film by young german actress karoline herfurth , returned to germany and broke the german high-jump record ahead of the olympics . but just days before the start of the 1936 olympics , the nazis barred bergmann , a favorite for gold , from the games , saying her performances had n't been satisfactory .
the nazis wanted to ensure that hitler would not be embarrassed by a jewish athlete winning a gold medal for germany . the dramatic turnabout came after the ship carrying us athletes had set sail for germany .
by way of consolation , bergmann was given a spectator 's ticket . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bergmann 's competition in the film is a fictional character based on ratjen the nazis replaced bergmann with " aryan " athletes elfriede kaun and dora ratjen .

but critics say prohibiting them breaks eu rules and wo n't reduce their popularity . operators of internet betting sites in europe face an uncertain future after a recent european court ruling which allows governments to ban them as a way to crack down on crime .
the court case was brought on by a dispute between the portuguese government and bwin international ltd . , one of the largest online gambling operators in europe .
bwin sponsors some of europe 's most important football teams , such as bayern munich , real madrid and ac milan .
the company had been fined 74,500 euros -lrb- $ 106,765 -rrb- for offering its services in the country , which is against portuguese law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bwin says a ban on online gambling wo n't work according to the european court 's ruling , online bookmakers can be shut down in countries where the government holds exclusive rights to administering gambling activities , such as finland , greece , the netherlands and sweden .
germany banned online betting last year , and private german lottery companies ceased their operations at the beginning of 2009 .
only state-run betting and lotteries are now permitted . in its ruling , the european court cited the high-risk of fraud and criminal activity that often go hand-in-hand with online betting as a reason for its decision , adding that bookmakers who sponsor competitions could " influence the outcome of events . "
concerns about illicit gaming the head of the european lotteries association of state gaming organizations , friedrich stickler welcomed the ruling .
" you have to have a license in a country to operate , " stickler noted .
" for me it is the beginning of a new era in the internet gaming sector . "
however , bwin says they acted in compliance with eu rules granting unrestricted movement of capital within the 27-member bloc .
bwin director karin klein added that countries that block online betting companies " will end up with a huge black market . "
the european gaming and betting association 's legal expert siegbert alber said the ruling was " not fair " because it put bwin , " a serious provider " in the same category as " unscrupulous providers .

but critics say prohibiting them breaks eu rules and wo n't reduce their popularity . operators of internet betting sites in europe face an uncertain future after a recent european court ruling which allows governments to ban them as a way to crack down on crime .
the court case was brought on by a dispute between the portuguese government and bwin international ltd . , one of the largest online gambling operators in europe .
bwin sponsors some of europe 's most important football teams , such as bayern munich , real madrid and ac milan .
the company had been fined 74,500 euros -lrb- $ 106,765 -rrb- for offering its services in the country , which is against portuguese law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bwin says a ban on online gambling wo n't work according to the european court 's ruling , online bookmakers can be shut down in countries where the government holds exclusive rights to administering gambling activities , such as finland , greece , the netherlands and sweden .
germany banned online betting last year , and private german lottery companies ceased their operations at the beginning of 2009 .
only state-run betting and lotteries are now permitted . in its ruling , the european court cited the high-risk of fraud and criminal activity that often go hand-in-hand with online betting as a reason for its decision , adding that bookmakers who sponsor competitions could " influence the outcome of events . "
concerns about illicit gaming the head of the european lotteries association of state gaming organizations , friedrich stickler welcomed the ruling .
" you have to have a license in a country to operate , " stickler noted .
" for me it is the beginning of a new era in the internet gaming sector . "
however , bwin says they acted in compliance with eu rules granting unrestricted movement of capital within the 27-member bloc .
bwin director karin klein added that countries that block online betting companies " will end up with a huge black market . "
the european gaming and betting association 's legal expert siegbert alber said the ruling was " not fair " because it put bwin , " a serious provider " in the same category as " unscrupulous providers .

joerg tauss maintains his innocence , saying he was conducting research . state prosecutors in the southern city of karlsruhe accuse tauss of having acquired , distributed , and possessed child pornography 102 times between may 2007 and january 2009 .
an investigation was carried out earlier this year after evidence was found in tauss ' office , including mobile phone pictures and dvds of underage sex .
but prosecutors could not press charges until parliament voted to repeal his immunity status , which happened on tuesday . fifty-six-year-old tauss is also accused of having shared child pornography with others via email in six cases , according to prosecutors .
the former spd politician has repeatedly denied the charges , insisting that he was merely conducting research as part of his efforts to break up a child pornography ring .
in response , prosecutors said investigators had found " no evidence of this claim . "
tauss resigned his position after the scandal broke and later joined the pirate party , a swedish-based group that advocates for more freedom on the internet .
he has resisted calls to step down from parliament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 09.09.2009 new film focuses on olympics gender row in nazi germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian urzendowsky and karoline herfurth play two athletes in the film berlin ' 36 a new film set to open in germany this week tells the true but little-known story of how the nazis barred a female jewish high-jumper from the 1936 olympics and replaced her with a male athlete dressed as a woman . called " berlin ' 36 , " the film by german director kaspar heidelbach , tells the story of record-breaking jewish high-jumper gretel bergmann who fled nazi germany in 1933 and emigrated to britain . bergmann went on to win the british high-jumping title but was forced to return to germany in the run-up to the 1936 olympics in berlin .
the film shows how the nazis were put under pressure by the united states , which threatened to boycott the olympic games if germany failed to field any jewish athletes . in a bid to save face and get international respectability , the nazi leadership selected bergmann to participate in the games .
they made it clear her family left behind in germany would suffer the consequences if she refused . an unusually muscular replacement bergmann , played in the film by young german actress karoline herfurth , returned to germany and broke the german high-jump record ahead of the olympics . but just days before the start of the 1936 olympics , the nazis barred bergmann , a favorite for gold , from the games , saying her performances had n't been satisfactory .
the nazis wanted to ensure that hitler would not be embarrassed by a jewish athlete winning a gold medal for germany . the dramatic turnabout came after the ship carrying us athletes had set sail for germany .
by way of consolation , bergmann was given a spectator 's ticket . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bergmann 's competition in the film is a fictional character based on ratjen the nazis replaced bergmann with " aryan " athletes elfriede kaun and dora ratjen .
the two won third and fourth place respectively in the high-jump .
but two years later , it emerged that ratjen , who had a deep , gruff voice , was in fact male . in 1938 , still posing as a woman , ratjen set a new world high jump record for women of 1.70m - but was disqualified after a doctor discovered that he had strapped up his genitals .
he was stripped of his title , his performances were expunged from the records , and he was quickly conscripted into the army . the film shows bergmann 's trainer waldmann , played by popular german actor axel prahl , being replaced by a nazi loyalist who brings in a manly-looking athlete to replace high-jumper bergmann . the film does n't just show how bergmann was discriminated against and sidelined but also touches on how she becomes friends with ratjen .
it portrays ratjen as a tormented person who knows that he is not a woman but tries fearfully to hide the fact . a scene in the film shows actress herfurth coming upon marie ketteler , a fictional character based on dora ratjen and played by actor sebastian urzendowsky , in the shower and discovering that she is a man . bergmann : " i had no idea " in reality , it is not clear whether the nazis were aware that dora ratjen was in fact " hermann " ratjen .
bergmann , who emigrated to the united states in 1937 and still lives there , said she herself had no idea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film shows the athletes - seen here at berlin 's olympic stadium - becoming friends " i never suspected anything , " the now 95-year-old told the german news magazine der spiegel .
" we all wondered why she never appeared naked in the shower .
to be so shy at the age of 17 seemed grotesque .
but we just thought : well , she 's weird , she 's strange . " the film is interspersed with interviews with the real gretel bergmann .
the 25-year-old herfurth , hailed as an upcoming acting star in germany , is reported to have trained for a year to perfect her form for the long-jumping scenes . the film 's germany premiere , held in berlin in august , coincided with the row over the gender of south african athlete caster semenya , which marred the world athletics championships in the very stadium where the 1936 olympics were held . cheated of gold ? after emigrating to the united states , bergmann went on to win several more high-jumping titles .
she vowed never to return to germany again or speak the language . but more than 60 years later , bergmann did return to germany .
in 1999 , she accepted a prestigious award in frankfurt that recognized her sporting achievements .
and she made a second trip to her hometown laupheim in southwestern germany when a stadium there was named after her . but bergmann said she remains certain that she was cheated of an olympic gold medal by the nazis . " i would have won gold , nothing less , " she told der spiegel .
" i wanted to show to the germans and to the world that jews were not these terrible people , not fat , ugly and disgusting as were people , " she said . " i wanted to show that a jewish girl could beat the germans .
in front of 10,000 people . " the film " berlin 36 " opens across cinemas in germany on sept .

joerg tauss maintains his innocence , saying he was conducting research . state prosecutors in the southern city of karlsruhe accuse tauss of having acquired , distributed , and possessed child pornography 102 times between may 2007 and january 2009 .
an investigation was carried out earlier this year after evidence was found in tauss ' office , including mobile phone pictures and dvds of underage sex .
but prosecutors could not press charges until parliament voted to repeal his immunity status , which happened on tuesday . fifty-six-year-old tauss is also accused of having shared child pornography with others via email in six cases , according to prosecutors .
the former spd politician has repeatedly denied the charges , insisting that he was merely conducting research as part of his efforts to break up a child pornography ring .
in response , prosecutors said investigators had found " no evidence of this claim . "
tauss resigned his position after the scandal broke and later joined the pirate party , a swedish-based group that advocates for more freedom on the internet .
he has resisted calls to step down from parliament .
tauss is expected to lose his seat in germany 's parliamentary elections on september 27. vj / ap / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a message on the popular website said that the clip had been removed " due to terms of violation , " without giving any further details .
the spot , which was produced by the hamburg-based advertizing agency " das comitee " and launched by the aids awareness group regenbogen last week , runs just over 90 seconds .
it shows a couple having sex in a murky room .
to begin with , the focus is on body parts gliding over white bed sheets combined with the occasional shot of the woman 's face .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this poster is similar to the final scene of the ad as the proceedings begin to reach a climax , the camera zooms in on the man , who suddenly lifts his head .
his face is that of nazi leader adolf hitler .
the spot ends with the sentence : " aids is a mass murderer .
protect yourself . "
the ad has provoked outrage among aids groups and jewish organizations who have slammed the spot as being tasteless .
" the disgusting spot ... derides the victims of national socialism and compares people suffering from hiv to mass murderers , " said carsten schatz , the chairman of deutsche aids hilfe , germany 's main hiv / aids charity .
schatz also criticized the video for not giving information on how to protect oneself against hiv or other sexually transmitted diseases .
the spot 's originators said they could not understand what all the fuss was about .
they have apologized , but are unwilling to take the campaign spot offline - the video is still available at www.aids-is-a-mass-murderer.com.
" we never intended to depict those who suffer from aids or hiv as mass murderers .
we wanted to give a face to the disease , " said regenbogen 's jan schwertner .
bildunterschrift : the dictators josef stalin , left , and saddam hussein also feature in the campaign " the campaign was designed to make people sit up and get the issue back on the agenda and stop the trend toward unprotected sexual intercourse , " the group said in a statement on its website .
the anti-aids campaign includes posters of soviet and iraqi dictators josef stalin and saddam hussein in naked embraces with women and underlined with the slogan " aids is a mass murderer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 09.09.2009 new film focuses on olympics gender row in nazi germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian urzendowsky and karoline herfurth play two athletes in the film berlin ' 36 a new film set to open in germany this week tells the true but little-known story of how the nazis barred a female jewish high-jumper from the 1936 olympics and replaced her with a male athlete dressed as a woman . called " berlin ' 36 , " the film by german director kaspar heidelbach , tells the story of record-breaking jewish high-jumper gretel bergmann who fled nazi germany in 1933 and emigrated to britain . bergmann went on to win the british high-jumping title but was forced to return to germany in the run-up to the 1936 olympics in berlin .
the film shows how the nazis were put under pressure by the united states , which threatened to boycott the olympic games if germany failed to field any jewish athletes . in a bid to save face and get international respectability , the nazi leadership selected bergmann to participate in the games .
they made it clear her family left behind in germany would suffer the consequences if she refused . an unusually muscular replacement bergmann , played in the film by young german actress karoline herfurth , returned to germany and broke the german high-jump record ahead of the olympics . but just days before the start of the 1936 olympics , the nazis barred bergmann , a favorite for gold , from the games , saying her performances had n't been satisfactory .
the nazis wanted to ensure that hitler would not be embarrassed by a jewish athlete winning a gold medal for germany . the dramatic turnabout came after the ship carrying us athletes had set sail for germany .
by way of consolation , bergmann was given a spectator 's ticket . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bergmann 's competition in the film is a fictional character based on ratjen the nazis replaced bergmann with " aryan " athletes elfriede kaun and dora ratjen .
the two won third and fourth place respectively in the high-jump .

the film shows how the nazis were put under pressure by the united states , which threatened to boycott the olympic games if germany failed to field any jewish athletes . in a bid to save face and get international respectability , the nazi leadership selected bergmann to participate in the games .
they made it clear her family left behind in germany would suffer the consequences if she refused . an unusually muscular replacement bergmann , played in the film by young german actress karoline herfurth , returned to germany and broke the german high-jump record ahead of the olympics . but just days before the start of the 1936 olympics , the nazis barred bergmann , a favorite for gold , from the games , saying her performances had n't been satisfactory .
the nazis wanted to ensure that hitler would not be embarrassed by a jewish athlete winning a gold medal for germany . the dramatic turnabout came after the ship carrying us athletes had set sail for germany .
by way of consolation , bergmann was given a spectator 's ticket . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bergmann 's competition in the film is a fictional character based on ratjen the nazis replaced bergmann with " aryan " athletes elfriede kaun and dora ratjen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 09.09.2009 the left party trumps with anti-war card in election campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left wants germany to get out of afghanistan the only party calling for an end to germany 's engagement in afghanistan has moved up in recent polls .
after a german-ordered airstrike killed scores in kunduz last week , the left 's view is becoming more popular . the campaign signs for germany 's left party send a clear message : " out of afghanistan ! "
it 's a sentiment widely held by many germans and has increased since a german commander in afghanistan ordered an airstrike on two fuel tankers , hijacked by the taliban last week , that left scores of people dead , including civilians .
while the future of the 4,200 german troops currently deployed in afghanistan is a political issue , politicians from chancellor angela merkel 's ruling christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their coalition partner , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , say last week 's attack will not change government policy on afghanistan .
with the exception of the left party , the rest of germany 's major parties are in favor of continuing the country 's mission in afghanistan .
but the latest weekly election polls , released on wednesday , suggest that the attack may be influencing voters .
a survey by the forsa-institut shows an increase of four percentage points for the left party , to 14 percent , while an ifd allensbach poll gave the party a 2 percent increase over last week , to 11.5 percent .
back in 2002 , german chancellor gerhard schroeder campaigned against the us-led iraq war and won re-election by the narrowest of margins , picking up many votes with his anti-war rhetoric .
lone voice for afghanistan withdrawal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last week 's nato airstrike may have boosted the left party the left is the only party in germany that 's taken a clear stance against the deployment of german soldiers in afghanistan .
in a meeting of the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , about the attacks on tuesday , left party co-leader oskar lafontaine reiterated his party 's stance .
" we want german troops out of afghanistan because we are firmly convinced that the mission does nothing for international security , nothing for peace and is not the way to counter international terrorism , " said lafontaine .
the former spd leader and finance minister under chancellor schroeder dismissed any talk of forming a coalition with the social democrats and green party .
" the social democrats and the greens still support our troops staying in afghanistan and we want to bring them home immediately .
so long as interests are diametrically opposed nobody needs to speculate about any coalition with the spd and greens after the sept .
27 election , " lafontaine said . supporters of the left party made their voices heard at a demonstration against the german involvement in afghanistan held at berlin 's brandenburg gate on tuesday .
" you can never stabilize afghanistan with an army , " one left party campaigner told deutsche welle .
" i understand that we have a huge problem in afghanistan and the taliban are not our friends - let that be clear !
but in the past eight years it 's only been about war and killing people and we have n't got anywhere . "
other parties slip in polls while the far-left are riding higher in the polls , the ruling christian democrats and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have dipped slightly .
the cdu received 35 percent in both surveys , dipping by 0.5-1 percent .
the cdu 's preferred coalition partners , the free democrats , brought in 13-14 percent , which would leave the two parties just shy of the required 50 percent majority needed to form a coalition .
the social democrats slipped similarly , to 21-22.5 percent .
their preferred coalition partners , the greens , polled 10-13 percent .
even if the left were included in a coalition with the spd and the greens , the current surveys indicate they would not have the necessary majority to form a government. mz / nrt / dpa / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

joerg tauss maintains his innocence , saying he was conducting research . state prosecutors in the southern city of karlsruhe accuse tauss of having acquired , distributed , and possessed child pornography 102 times between may 2007 and january 2009 .
an investigation was carried out earlier this year after evidence was found in tauss ' office , including mobile phone pictures and dvds of underage sex .
but prosecutors could not press charges until parliament voted to repeal his immunity status , which happened on tuesday . fifty-six-year-old tauss is also accused of having shared child pornography with others via email in six cases , according to prosecutors .
the former spd politician has repeatedly denied the charges , insisting that he was merely conducting research as part of his efforts to break up a child pornography ring .
in response , prosecutors said investigators had found " no evidence of this claim . "
tauss resigned his position after the scandal broke and later joined the pirate party , a swedish-based group that advocates for more freedom on the internet .
he has resisted calls to step down from parliament .
tauss is expected to lose his seat in germany 's parliamentary elections on september 27. vj / ap / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 09.09.2009 parents ' jobs are most important factor in fighting eu child poverty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty has far-reaching consequences for children growing up in europe having parents who work is the most important factor in preventing child poverty in europe .
but what can the eu do to alleviate child poverty ?
guidelines are available , but it 's mostly down to individual countries . the fight against child poverty in the eu is , first and foremost , a matter for individual states .
yet following the lisbon strategy , a development plan set out by the european council in 2000 , eu governments have promised to place children at the center of political dealings .
furthermore , the european commission has set out criteria defining child poverty , how it arises , spreads and how it can be combated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty can lead to social exclusion for many children the most recent report on child poverty by the commission was published in february 2008 ; in other words , before the financial crisis began .
the figures are likely to have worsened in the meantime .
then 19 million children in the eu were classified as poor , on average every fifth child .
the eu defines poor as earning 60 percent of the average income in each respective member state .
for a family in germany with two children , that means 1,600 euros -lrb- $ 2,300 -rrb- per month .
poverty impacts all areas of life the eu is keen to stress , however , that this does not just mean money as a means to consume , rather that child poverty takes away access to education -lrb- and therefore a good start in life -rrb- , damages health and excludes youngsters from a large part of cultural and social life .
that is another point brussels stresses : child poverty is a negative economic factor for each country .
it 's not just about sympathy and justice , but rather that economic policy should have a vested interest in nurturing and supporting children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployed parents are the greatest cause of child poverty the eu commission is especially concerned about unemployment .
out-of-work parents are the biggest cause of child poverty .
this leads to a vicious cycle that is hard to escape .
negative factors in families suffering from unemployment are often passed down from generation to generation .
according to the report , immigrant families are most at risk .
they suffer not only disproportionately from difficult financial circumstances , but also their children experience social and cultural exclusion .
policy solutions are the key the eu recommends to individual states a host of social , economic and cultural policies , including active employment and childcare policies , financial aid for families and integrated education and health policies .
and it has lauded the european states that lead in the fight against child poverty .
the scandinavian countries , the netherlands , austria , cyprus and slovenia all came out favorably in the commission 's report - in other words , not just rich countries .
they received praise for their comprehensive policies as the relatively high level and effectiveness of their welfare systems ran parallel with active employment policies and good childcare options .
italy , britain and spain came out the worst , with germany somewhere in the middle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 09.09.2009 parents ' jobs are most important factor in fighting eu child poverty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty has far-reaching consequences for children growing up in europe having parents who work is the most important factor in preventing child poverty in europe .
but what can the eu do to alleviate child poverty ?
guidelines are available , but it 's mostly down to individual countries . the fight against child poverty in the eu is , first and foremost , a matter for individual states .
yet following the lisbon strategy , a development plan set out by the european council in 2000 , eu governments have promised to place children at the center of political dealings .
furthermore , the european commission has set out criteria defining child poverty , how it arises , spreads and how it can be combated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty can lead to social exclusion for many children the most recent report on child poverty by the commission was published in february 2008 ; in other words , before the financial crisis began .
the figures are likely to have worsened in the meantime .
then 19 million children in the eu were classified as poor , on average every fifth child .
the eu defines poor as earning 60 percent of the average income in each respective member state .
for a family in germany with two children , that means 1,600 euros -lrb- $ 2,300 -rrb- per month .
poverty impacts all areas of life the eu is keen to stress , however , that this does not just mean money as a means to consume , rather that child poverty takes away access to education -lrb- and therefore a good start in life -rrb- , damages health and excludes youngsters from a large part of cultural and social life .
that is another point brussels stresses : child poverty is a negative economic factor for each country .
it 's not just about sympathy and justice , but rather that economic policy should have a vested interest in nurturing and supporting children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployed parents are the greatest cause of child poverty the eu commission is especially concerned about unemployment .
out-of-work parents are the biggest cause of child poverty .
this leads to a vicious cycle that is hard to escape .
negative factors in families suffering from unemployment are often passed down from generation to generation .
according to the report , immigrant families are most at risk .
they suffer not only disproportionately from difficult financial circumstances , but also their children experience social and cultural exclusion .
policy solutions are the key the eu recommends to individual states a host of social , economic and cultural policies , including active employment and childcare policies , financial aid for families and integrated education and health policies .
and it has lauded the european states that lead in the fight against child poverty .
the scandinavian countries , the netherlands , austria , cyprus and slovenia all came out favorably in the commission 's report - in other words , not just rich countries .
they received praise for their comprehensive policies as the relatively high level and effectiveness of their welfare systems ran parallel with active employment policies and good childcare options .
italy , britain and spain came out the worst , with germany somewhere in the middle .

a message on the popular website said that the clip had been removed " due to terms of violation , " without giving any further details .
the spot , which was produced by the hamburg-based advertizing agency " das comitee " and launched by the aids awareness group regenbogen last week , runs just over 90 seconds .
it shows a couple having sex in a murky room .
to begin with , the focus is on body parts gliding over white bed sheets combined with the occasional shot of the woman 's face .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this poster is similar to the final scene of the ad as the proceedings begin to reach a climax , the camera zooms in on the man , who suddenly lifts his head .
his face is that of nazi leader adolf hitler .
the spot ends with the sentence : " aids is a mass murderer .
protect yourself . "
the ad has provoked outrage among aids groups and jewish organizations who have slammed the spot as being tasteless .
" the disgusting spot ... derides the victims of national socialism and compares people suffering from hiv to mass murderers , " said carsten schatz , the chairman of deutsche aids hilfe , germany 's main hiv / aids charity .
schatz also criticized the video for not giving information on how to protect oneself against hiv or other sexually transmitted diseases .
the spot 's originators said they could not understand what all the fuss was about .
they have apologized , but are unwilling to take the campaign spot offline - the video is still available at www.aids-is-a-mass-murderer.com.
" we never intended to depict those who suffer from aids or hiv as mass murderers .
we wanted to give a face to the disease , " said regenbogen 's jan schwertner .
bildunterschrift : the dictators josef stalin , left , and saddam hussein also feature in the campaign " the campaign was designed to make people sit up and get the issue back on the agenda and stop the trend toward unprotected sexual intercourse , " the group said in a statement on its website .
the anti-aids campaign includes posters of soviet and iraqi dictators josef stalin and saddam hussein in naked embraces with women and underlined with the slogan " aids is a mass murderer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 09.09.2009 most germans do n't want swine flu vaccinations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is busy planning mass vaccinations the german government has ordered 18 million more vaccinations against swine flu .
but two-thirds of germans say they do n't want to be immunized . in the latest step to fight an anticipated breakout of the h1n1 swine flu virus , germany 's 16 state health ministers have announced they plan to order another 18 million vaccination units .
that 's enough to immunize nine million more people and ensures there is enough stock should demand surge later in the year .
the health ministers have already ordered 50 million swine flu vaccinations for 25 million people , as each person requires two doses of the vaccine .
that means there will be enough vaccine to cover 40 percent of the german population .
the latest order is subject to funding being available .
the thorny question of who will bear the cost of this – the federal government , the health insurers , the state health departments or local authorities – is being discussed at a special working group meeting in berlin on wednesday .
two-thirds reject swine flu immunization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans are not convinced that swine flu is a threat a new study conducted by the forsa institute for dak , one of germany 's largest health insurers , revealed that a surprising number of germans do not plan to get immunized .
in the study of 1,001 people aged between 18 and 60 years , 62 percent said they would " definitely not , " or " almost definitely not " let themselves be vaccinated this autumn when the first swine flu vaccines become available .
eighty-two percent of germans said that swine flu poses a " fairly low " or " very low " danger .
bavarians , in germany 's south , in particular rejected vaccination .
only nine percent said they would " definitely " go to their doctor to be immunized compared to 14 percent of germans on average .
it 's a different picture in eastern germany , where almost a quarter of those who took part in the study said they were " definitely " going to get immunized .
" if the situation changes in the next few weeks , than we expect the number of people prepared to vaccinate themselves to increase sharply , " said horst boelle , the director of the claims department at dak .
are vaccinations worth the risk ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german medical association urges a rethink the german medical association is urging the government to reassess its mass vaccinations plan , the largest such scheme in postwar history .
" many people have already had swine flu and never even noticed that had it , " said frank ulrich montgomery , the association 's vice president .
montgomery also questioned whether the risks of vaccinating outweigh those of actually getting swine flu .
swine flu is highly infectious but it produces fairly mild symptoms and no one in germany has died of it so far .
" the disease could take a turn for the worse , and claim its first fatalities , " said deputy health minister klaus theo schroeder .
" i have the impression that we are now able to do that which we need to do in the next few weeks , " he added .
the first vaccinations are expected to be available in october and more units will be delivered on a weekly basis .
schroeder said mass vaccinations should be completed by the end of january or early february next year .
testing of the vaccine is ongoing .
in one pilot study , it was shown that a single vaccination was enough to provide protection in 80 percent of all test persons. wl / dpa / afp / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but two-thirds of germans say they do n't want to be immunized . in the latest step to fight an anticipated breakout of the h1n1 swine flu virus , germany 's 16 state health ministers have announced they plan to order another 18 million vaccination units .
that 's enough to immunize nine million more people and ensures there is enough stock should demand surge later in the year .
the health ministers have already ordered 50 million swine flu vaccinations for 25 million people , as each person requires two doses of the vaccine .
that means there will be enough vaccine to cover 40 percent of the german population .
the latest order is subject to funding being available .
the thorny question of who will bear the cost of this – the federal government , the health insurers , the state health departments or local authorities – is being discussed at a special working group meeting in berlin on wednesday .
two-thirds reject swine flu immunization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans are not convinced that swine flu is a threat a new study conducted by the forsa institute for dak , one of germany 's largest health insurers , revealed that a surprising number of germans do not plan to get immunized .
in the study of 1,001 people aged between 18 and 60 years , 62 percent said they would " definitely not , " or " almost definitely not " let themselves be vaccinated this autumn when the first swine flu vaccines become available .
eighty-two percent of germans said that swine flu poses a " fairly low " or " very low " danger .
bavarians , in germany 's south , in particular rejected vaccination .
only nine percent said they would " definitely " go to their doctor to be immunized compared to 14 percent of germans on average .
it 's a different picture in eastern germany , where almost a quarter of those who took part in the study said they were " definitely " going to get immunized .
" if the situation changes in the next few weeks , than we expect the number of people prepared to vaccinate themselves to increase sharply , " said horst boelle , the director of the claims department at dak .

" many people have already had swine flu and never even noticed that had it , " said frank ulrich montgomery , the association 's vice president .
montgomery also questioned whether the risks of vaccinating outweigh those of actually getting swine flu .
swine flu is highly infectious but it produces fairly mild symptoms and no one in germany has died of it so far .
" the disease could take a turn for the worse , and claim its first fatalities , " said deputy health minister klaus theo schroeder .
" i have the impression that we are now able to do that which we need to do in the next few weeks , " he added .
the first vaccinations are expected to be available in october and more units will be delivered on a weekly basis .
schroeder said mass vaccinations should be completed by the end of january or early february next year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 09.09.2009 new film focuses on olympics gender row in nazi germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian urzendowsky and karoline herfurth play two athletes in the film berlin ' 36 a new film set to open in germany this week tells the true but little-known story of how the nazis barred a female jewish high-jumper from the 1936 olympics and replaced her with a male athlete dressed as a woman . called " berlin ' 36 , " the film by german director kaspar heidelbach , tells the story of record-breaking jewish high-jumper gretel bergmann who fled nazi germany in 1933 and emigrated to britain . bergmann went on to win the british high-jumping title but was forced to return to germany in the run-up to the 1936 olympics in berlin .
the film shows how the nazis were put under pressure by the united states , which threatened to boycott the olympic games if germany failed to field any jewish athletes . in a bid to save face and get international respectability , the nazi leadership selected bergmann to participate in the games .
they made it clear her family left behind in germany would suffer the consequences if she refused . an unusually muscular replacement bergmann , played in the film by young german actress karoline herfurth , returned to germany and broke the german high-jump record ahead of the olympics . but just days before the start of the 1936 olympics , the nazis barred bergmann , a favorite for gold , from the games , saying her performances had n't been satisfactory .
the nazis wanted to ensure that hitler would not be embarrassed by a jewish athlete winning a gold medal for germany . the dramatic turnabout came after the ship carrying us athletes had set sail for germany .
by way of consolation , bergmann was given a spectator 's ticket . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bergmann 's competition in the film is a fictional character based on ratjen the nazis replaced bergmann with " aryan " athletes elfriede kaun and dora ratjen .
the two won third and fourth place respectively in the high-jump .
but two years later , it emerged that ratjen , who had a deep , gruff voice , was in fact male . in 1938 , still posing as a woman , ratjen set a new world high jump record for women of 1.70m - but was disqualified after a doctor discovered that he had strapped up his genitals .
he was stripped of his title , his performances were expunged from the records , and he was quickly conscripted into the army . the film shows bergmann 's trainer waldmann , played by popular german actor axel prahl , being replaced by a nazi loyalist who brings in a manly-looking athlete to replace high-jumper bergmann . the film does n't just show how bergmann was discriminated against and sidelined but also touches on how she becomes friends with ratjen .
it portrays ratjen as a tormented person who knows that he is not a woman but tries fearfully to hide the fact . a scene in the film shows actress herfurth coming upon marie ketteler , a fictional character based on dora ratjen and played by actor sebastian urzendowsky , in the shower and discovering that she is a man . bergmann : " i had no idea " in reality , it is not clear whether the nazis were aware that dora ratjen was in fact " hermann " ratjen .
bergmann , who emigrated to the united states in 1937 and still lives there , said she herself had no idea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film shows the athletes - seen here at berlin 's olympic stadium - becoming friends " i never suspected anything , " the now 95-year-old told the german news magazine der spiegel .
" we all wondered why she never appeared naked in the shower .
to be so shy at the age of 17 seemed grotesque .
but we just thought : well , she 's weird , she 's strange . " the film is interspersed with interviews with the real gretel bergmann .
the 25-year-old herfurth , hailed as an upcoming acting star in germany , is reported to have trained for a year to perfect her form for the long-jumping scenes . the film 's germany premiere , held in berlin in august , coincided with the row over the gender of south african athlete caster semenya , which marred the world athletics championships in the very stadium where the 1936 olympics were held . cheated of gold ? after emigrating to the united states , bergmann went on to win several more high-jumping titles .
she vowed never to return to germany again or speak the language . but more than 60 years later , bergmann did return to germany .
in 1999 , she accepted a prestigious award in frankfurt that recognized her sporting achievements .
and she made a second trip to her hometown laupheim in southwestern germany when a stadium there was named after her . but bergmann said she remains certain that she was cheated of an olympic gold medal by the nazis . " i would have won gold , nothing less , " she told der spiegel .
" i wanted to show to the germans and to the world that jews were not these terrible people , not fat , ugly and disgusting as were people , " she said . " i wanted to show that a jewish girl could beat the germans .
in front of 10,000 people . " the film " berlin 36 " opens across cinemas in germany on sept .

the film shows how the nazis were put under pressure by the united states , which threatened to boycott the olympic games if germany failed to field any jewish athletes . in a bid to save face and get international respectability , the nazi leadership selected bergmann to participate in the games .
they made it clear her family left behind in germany would suffer the consequences if she refused . an unusually muscular replacement bergmann , played in the film by young german actress karoline herfurth , returned to germany and broke the german high-jump record ahead of the olympics . but just days before the start of the 1936 olympics , the nazis barred bergmann , a favorite for gold , from the games , saying her performances had n't been satisfactory .

he was stripped of his title , his performances were expunged from the records , and he was quickly conscripted into the army . the film shows bergmann 's trainer waldmann , played by popular german actor axel prahl , being replaced by a nazi loyalist who brings in a manly-looking athlete to replace high-jumper bergmann . the film does n't just show how bergmann was discriminated against and sidelined but also touches on how she becomes friends with ratjen .
it portrays ratjen as a tormented person who knows that he is not a woman but tries fearfully to hide the fact . a scene in the film shows actress herfurth coming upon marie ketteler , a fictional character based on dora ratjen and played by actor sebastian urzendowsky , in the shower and discovering that she is a man . bergmann : " i had no idea " in reality , it is not clear whether the nazis were aware that dora ratjen was in fact " hermann " ratjen .

the film shows how the nazis were put under pressure by the united states , which threatened to boycott the olympic games if germany failed to field any jewish athletes . in a bid to save face and get international respectability , the nazi leadership selected bergmann to participate in the games .
they made it clear her family left behind in germany would suffer the consequences if she refused . an unusually muscular replacement bergmann , played in the film by young german actress karoline herfurth , returned to germany and broke the german high-jump record ahead of the olympics . but just days before the start of the 1936 olympics , the nazis barred bergmann , a favorite for gold , from the games , saying her performances had n't been satisfactory .
the nazis wanted to ensure that hitler would not be embarrassed by a jewish athlete winning a gold medal for germany . the dramatic turnabout came after the ship carrying us athletes had set sail for germany .
by way of consolation , bergmann was given a spectator 's ticket . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bergmann 's competition in the film is a fictional character based on ratjen the nazis replaced bergmann with " aryan " athletes elfriede kaun and dora ratjen .
the two won third and fourth place respectively in the high-jump .
but two years later , it emerged that ratjen , who had a deep , gruff voice , was in fact male . in 1938 , still posing as a woman , ratjen set a new world high jump record for women of 1.70m - but was disqualified after a doctor discovered that he had strapped up his genitals .
he was stripped of his title , his performances were expunged from the records , and he was quickly conscripted into the army . the film shows bergmann 's trainer waldmann , played by popular german actor axel prahl , being replaced by a nazi loyalist who brings in a manly-looking athlete to replace high-jumper bergmann . the film does n't just show how bergmann was discriminated against and sidelined but also touches on how she becomes friends with ratjen .
it portrays ratjen as a tormented person who knows that he is not a woman but tries fearfully to hide the fact . a scene in the film shows actress herfurth coming upon marie ketteler , a fictional character based on dora ratjen and played by actor sebastian urzendowsky , in the shower and discovering that she is a man . bergmann : " i had no idea " in reality , it is not clear whether the nazis were aware that dora ratjen was in fact " hermann " ratjen .
bergmann , who emigrated to the united states in 1937 and still lives there , said she herself had no idea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film shows the athletes - seen here at berlin 's olympic stadium - becoming friends " i never suspected anything , " the now 95-year-old told the german news magazine der spiegel .
" we all wondered why she never appeared naked in the shower .
to be so shy at the age of 17 seemed grotesque .
but we just thought : well , she 's weird , she 's strange . " the film is interspersed with interviews with the real gretel bergmann .
the 25-year-old herfurth , hailed as an upcoming acting star in germany , is reported to have trained for a year to perfect her form for the long-jumping scenes . the film 's germany premiere , held in berlin in august , coincided with the row over the gender of south african athlete caster semenya , which marred the world athletics championships in the very stadium where the 1936 olympics were held . cheated of gold ? after emigrating to the united states , bergmann went on to win several more high-jumping titles .
she vowed never to return to germany again or speak the language . but more than 60 years later , bergmann did return to germany .
in 1999 , she accepted a prestigious award in frankfurt that recognized her sporting achievements .
and she made a second trip to her hometown laupheim in southwestern germany when a stadium there was named after her . but bergmann said she remains certain that she was cheated of an olympic gold medal by the nazis . " i would have won gold , nothing less , " she told der spiegel .

but what can the eu do to alleviate child poverty ?
guidelines are available , but it 's mostly down to individual countries . the fight against child poverty in the eu is , first and foremost , a matter for individual states .
yet following the lisbon strategy , a development plan set out by the european council in 2000 , eu governments have promised to place children at the center of political dealings .
furthermore , the european commission has set out criteria defining child poverty , how it arises , spreads and how it can be combated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty can lead to social exclusion for many children the most recent report on child poverty by the commission was published in february 2008 ; in other words , before the financial crisis began .
the figures are likely to have worsened in the meantime .
then 19 million children in the eu were classified as poor , on average every fifth child .
the eu defines poor as earning 60 percent of the average income in each respective member state .
for a family in germany with two children , that means 1,600 euros -lrb- $ 2,300 -rrb- per month .
poverty impacts all areas of life the eu is keen to stress , however , that this does not just mean money as a means to consume , rather that child poverty takes away access to education -lrb- and therefore a good start in life -rrb- , damages health and excludes youngsters from a large part of cultural and social life .
that is another point brussels stresses : child poverty is a negative economic factor for each country .
it 's not just about sympathy and justice , but rather that economic policy should have a vested interest in nurturing and supporting children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployed parents are the greatest cause of child poverty the eu commission is especially concerned about unemployment .
out-of-work parents are the biggest cause of child poverty .
this leads to a vicious cycle that is hard to escape .
negative factors in families suffering from unemployment are often passed down from generation to generation .
according to the report , immigrant families are most at risk .
they suffer not only disproportionately from difficult financial circumstances , but also their children experience social and cultural exclusion .
policy solutions are the key the eu recommends to individual states a host of social , economic and cultural policies , including active employment and childcare policies , financial aid for families and integrated education and health policies .
and it has lauded the european states that lead in the fight against child poverty .
the scandinavian countries , the netherlands , austria , cyprus and slovenia all came out favorably in the commission 's report - in other words , not just rich countries .
they received praise for their comprehensive policies as the relatively high level and effectiveness of their welfare systems ran parallel with active employment policies and good childcare options .
italy , britain and spain came out the worst , with germany somewhere in the middle .

after a german-ordered airstrike killed scores in kunduz last week , the left 's view is becoming more popular . the campaign signs for germany 's left party send a clear message : " out of afghanistan ! "
it 's a sentiment widely held by many germans and has increased since a german commander in afghanistan ordered an airstrike on two fuel tankers , hijacked by the taliban last week , that left scores of people dead , including civilians .
while the future of the 4,200 german troops currently deployed in afghanistan is a political issue , politicians from chancellor angela merkel 's ruling christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their coalition partner , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , say last week 's attack will not change government policy on afghanistan .
with the exception of the left party , the rest of germany 's major parties are in favor of continuing the country 's mission in afghanistan .
but the latest weekly election polls , released on wednesday , suggest that the attack may be influencing voters .
a survey by the forsa-institut shows an increase of four percentage points for the left party , to 14 percent , while an ifd allensbach poll gave the party a 2 percent increase over last week , to 11.5 percent .

in a meeting of the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , about the attacks on tuesday , left party co-leader oskar lafontaine reiterated his party 's stance .
" we want german troops out of afghanistan because we are firmly convinced that the mission does nothing for international security , nothing for peace and is not the way to counter international terrorism , " said lafontaine .
the former spd leader and finance minister under chancellor schroeder dismissed any talk of forming a coalition with the social democrats and green party .
" the social democrats and the greens still support our troops staying in afghanistan and we want to bring them home immediately .
so long as interests are diametrically opposed nobody needs to speculate about any coalition with the spd and greens after the sept .

" you can never stabilize afghanistan with an army , " one left party campaigner told deutsche welle .
" i understand that we have a huge problem in afghanistan and the taliban are not our friends - let that be clear !

the social democrats slipped similarly , to 21-22.5 percent .
their preferred coalition partners , the greens , polled 10-13 percent .
even if the left were included in a coalition with the spd and the greens , the current surveys indicate they would not have the necessary majority to form a government. mz / nrt / dpa / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with the exception of the left party , the rest of germany 's major parties are in favor of continuing the country 's mission in afghanistan .
but the latest weekly election polls , released on wednesday , suggest that the attack may be influencing voters .
a survey by the forsa-institut shows an increase of four percentage points for the left party , to 14 percent , while an ifd allensbach poll gave the party a 2 percent increase over last week , to 11.5 percent .

lone voice for afghanistan withdrawal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last week 's nato airstrike may have boosted the left party the left is the only party in germany that 's taken a clear stance against the deployment of german soldiers in afghanistan .
in a meeting of the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , about the attacks on tuesday , left party co-leader oskar lafontaine reiterated his party 's stance .
" we want german troops out of afghanistan because we are firmly convinced that the mission does nothing for international security , nothing for peace and is not the way to counter international terrorism , " said lafontaine .
the former spd leader and finance minister under chancellor schroeder dismissed any talk of forming a coalition with the social democrats and green party .
" the social democrats and the greens still support our troops staying in afghanistan and we want to bring them home immediately .
so long as interests are diametrically opposed nobody needs to speculate about any coalition with the spd and greens after the sept .
27 election , " lafontaine said . supporters of the left party made their voices heard at a demonstration against the german involvement in afghanistan held at berlin 's brandenburg gate on tuesday .
" you can never stabilize afghanistan with an army , " one left party campaigner told deutsche welle .
" i understand that we have a huge problem in afghanistan and the taliban are not our friends - let that be clear !
but in the past eight years it 's only been about war and killing people and we have n't got anywhere . "
other parties slip in polls while the far-left are riding higher in the polls , the ruling christian democrats and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have dipped slightly .
the cdu received 35 percent in both surveys , dipping by 0.5-1 percent .
the cdu 's preferred coalition partners , the free democrats , brought in 13-14 percent , which would leave the two parties just shy of the required 50 percent majority needed to form a coalition .
the social democrats slipped similarly , to 21-22.5 percent .
their preferred coalition partners , the greens , polled 10-13 percent .
even if the left were included in a coalition with the spd and the greens , the current surveys indicate they would not have the necessary majority to form a government. mz / nrt / dpa / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

joerg tauss maintains his innocence , saying he was conducting research . state prosecutors in the southern city of karlsruhe accuse tauss of having acquired , distributed , and possessed child pornography 102 times between may 2007 and january 2009 .
an investigation was carried out earlier this year after evidence was found in tauss ' office , including mobile phone pictures and dvds of underage sex .
but prosecutors could not press charges until parliament voted to repeal his immunity status , which happened on tuesday . fifty-six-year-old tauss is also accused of having shared child pornography with others via email in six cases , according to prosecutors .
the former spd politician has repeatedly denied the charges , insisting that he was merely conducting research as part of his efforts to break up a child pornography ring .
in response , prosecutors said investigators had found " no evidence of this claim . "
tauss resigned his position after the scandal broke and later joined the pirate party , a swedish-based group that advocates for more freedom on the internet .
he has resisted calls to step down from parliament .

but prosecutors could not press charges until parliament voted to repeal his immunity status , which happened on tuesday . fifty-six-year-old tauss is also accused of having shared child pornography with others via email in six cases , according to prosecutors .
the former spd politician has repeatedly denied the charges , insisting that he was merely conducting research as part of his efforts to break up a child pornography ring .
in response , prosecutors said investigators had found " no evidence of this claim . "
tauss resigned his position after the scandal broke and later joined the pirate party , a swedish-based group that advocates for more freedom on the internet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 09.09.2009 parents ' jobs are most important factor in fighting eu child poverty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty has far-reaching consequences for children growing up in europe having parents who work is the most important factor in preventing child poverty in europe .
but what can the eu do to alleviate child poverty ?
guidelines are available , but it 's mostly down to individual countries . the fight against child poverty in the eu is , first and foremost , a matter for individual states .
yet following the lisbon strategy , a development plan set out by the european council in 2000 , eu governments have promised to place children at the center of political dealings .
furthermore , the european commission has set out criteria defining child poverty , how it arises , spreads and how it can be combated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty can lead to social exclusion for many children the most recent report on child poverty by the commission was published in february 2008 ; in other words , before the financial crisis began .
the figures are likely to have worsened in the meantime .
then 19 million children in the eu were classified as poor , on average every fifth child .
the eu defines poor as earning 60 percent of the average income in each respective member state .
for a family in germany with two children , that means 1,600 euros -lrb- $ 2,300 -rrb- per month .
poverty impacts all areas of life the eu is keen to stress , however , that this does not just mean money as a means to consume , rather that child poverty takes away access to education -lrb- and therefore a good start in life -rrb- , damages health and excludes youngsters from a large part of cultural and social life .
that is another point brussels stresses : child poverty is a negative economic factor for each country .
it 's not just about sympathy and justice , but rather that economic policy should have a vested interest in nurturing and supporting children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployed parents are the greatest cause of child poverty the eu commission is especially concerned about unemployment .
out-of-work parents are the biggest cause of child poverty .
this leads to a vicious cycle that is hard to escape .
negative factors in families suffering from unemployment are often passed down from generation to generation .
according to the report , immigrant families are most at risk .
they suffer not only disproportionately from difficult financial circumstances , but also their children experience social and cultural exclusion .
policy solutions are the key the eu recommends to individual states a host of social , economic and cultural policies , including active employment and childcare policies , financial aid for families and integrated education and health policies .
and it has lauded the european states that lead in the fight against child poverty .
the scandinavian countries , the netherlands , austria , cyprus and slovenia all came out favorably in the commission 's report - in other words , not just rich countries .
they received praise for their comprehensive policies as the relatively high level and effectiveness of their welfare systems ran parallel with active employment policies and good childcare options .
italy , britain and spain came out the worst , with germany somewhere in the middle .

the politician said that under the administration of long-term cdu chancellor helmut kohl germany 's research ministry demanded in a 1983 letter that the federal agency responsible for the findings on gorleben alter them .
gabriel said scientists had warned that gorleben might prove to be a bad long-term storage site for the waste and that other locations should be explored .
these warnings , however , were ignored because certain conservative politicians allegedly used their influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel 's spd seems to be off the hook since they were n't in government at the time according to the agency 's 1983 report there was a risk that radioactive substances could seep into the ground water .
this particular warning was eventually played down in the report .
" a downright scandal " the government of chancellor angela merkel , the current head of the cdu , has pledged a thorough check of all gorleben files , dating back to 1980s . " we will put all files on the table , " said deputy government spokesman klaus vater in berlin on wednesday .
" should the evaluation show that something is not order , we will have to reassess the situation , " said vater , adding that it would take time to comb through the 80 to 90 folders .
he criticized the timing of the revelation , which was made by the daily sueddeutsche zeitung in its wednesday edition .
after gathering dust for more than a quarter of century , the controversial files have now surfaced just three weeks ahead of federal elections .
" i do ask myself : did nobody ever take a look at these files ? "
vater said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl can expect new scrutiny of his government timely revelations ?
the deputy head of the cdu parliamentary group , katherina reiche , slammed the allegations as timely campaign diversions .
" the environment minister just wants one thing : campaigning rather than a solution to the issue of ultimate waste disposal .
gabriel 's sole aim is to discredit gorleben no matter whether it 's a suitable spot or not . "
reiche reiterated her party 's call for a " thorough investigation to ascertain whether gorleben is a suitable spot for the disposal of atomic waste . "
she accused gabriel of dodging this issue , hinting that the minister was doing so because he feared that an investigation could prove that gorleben was in fact a suitable spot for dumping the radioactive waste. cs / nk / dpa / reuters / afp / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the politician said that under the administration of long-term cdu chancellor helmut kohl germany 's research ministry demanded in a 1983 letter that the federal agency responsible for the findings on gorleben alter them .
gabriel said scientists had warned that gorleben might prove to be a bad long-term storage site for the waste and that other locations should be explored .
these warnings , however , were ignored because certain conservative politicians allegedly used their influence .

" should the evaluation show that something is not order , we will have to reassess the situation , " said vater , adding that it would take time to comb through the 80 to 90 folders .
he criticized the timing of the revelation , which was made by the daily sueddeutsche zeitung in its wednesday edition .

a message on the popular website said that the clip had been removed " due to terms of violation , " without giving any further details .
the spot , which was produced by the hamburg-based advertizing agency " das comitee " and launched by the aids awareness group regenbogen last week , runs just over 90 seconds .
it shows a couple having sex in a murky room .
to begin with , the focus is on body parts gliding over white bed sheets combined with the occasional shot of the woman 's face .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this poster is similar to the final scene of the ad as the proceedings begin to reach a climax , the camera zooms in on the man , who suddenly lifts his head .
his face is that of nazi leader adolf hitler .
the spot ends with the sentence : " aids is a mass murderer .
protect yourself . "
the ad has provoked outrage among aids groups and jewish organizations who have slammed the spot as being tasteless .
" the disgusting spot ... derides the victims of national socialism and compares people suffering from hiv to mass murderers , " said carsten schatz , the chairman of deutsche aids hilfe , germany 's main hiv / aids charity .
schatz also criticized the video for not giving information on how to protect oneself against hiv or other sexually transmitted diseases .
the spot 's originators said they could not understand what all the fuss was about .
they have apologized , but are unwilling to take the campaign spot offline - the video is still available at www.aids-is-a-mass-murderer.com.
" we never intended to depict those who suffer from aids or hiv as mass murderers .
we wanted to give a face to the disease , " said regenbogen 's jan schwertner .
bildunterschrift : the dictators josef stalin , left , and saddam hussein also feature in the campaign " the campaign was designed to make people sit up and get the issue back on the agenda and stop the trend toward unprotected sexual intercourse , " the group said in a statement on its website .
the anti-aids campaign includes posters of soviet and iraqi dictators josef stalin and saddam hussein in naked embraces with women and underlined with the slogan " aids is a mass murderer .

but two-thirds of germans say they do n't want to be immunized . in the latest step to fight an anticipated breakout of the h1n1 swine flu virus , germany 's 16 state health ministers have announced they plan to order another 18 million vaccination units .
that 's enough to immunize nine million more people and ensures there is enough stock should demand surge later in the year .
the health ministers have already ordered 50 million swine flu vaccinations for 25 million people , as each person requires two doses of the vaccine .
that means there will be enough vaccine to cover 40 percent of the german population .
the latest order is subject to funding being available .
the thorny question of who will bear the cost of this – the federal government , the health insurers , the state health departments or local authorities – is being discussed at a special working group meeting in berlin on wednesday .
two-thirds reject swine flu immunization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans are not convinced that swine flu is a threat a new study conducted by the forsa institute for dak , one of germany 's largest health insurers , revealed that a surprising number of germans do not plan to get immunized .
in the study of 1,001 people aged between 18 and 60 years , 62 percent said they would " definitely not , " or " almost definitely not " let themselves be vaccinated this autumn when the first swine flu vaccines become available .
eighty-two percent of germans said that swine flu poses a " fairly low " or " very low " danger .
bavarians , in germany 's south , in particular rejected vaccination .
only nine percent said they would " definitely " go to their doctor to be immunized compared to 14 percent of germans on average .
it 's a different picture in eastern germany , where almost a quarter of those who took part in the study said they were " definitely " going to get immunized .
" if the situation changes in the next few weeks , than we expect the number of people prepared to vaccinate themselves to increase sharply , " said horst boelle , the director of the claims department at dak .

montgomery also questioned whether the risks of vaccinating outweigh those of actually getting swine flu .
swine flu is highly infectious but it produces fairly mild symptoms and no one in germany has died of it so far .
" the disease could take a turn for the worse , and claim its first fatalities , " said deputy health minister klaus theo schroeder .
" i have the impression that we are now able to do that which we need to do in the next few weeks , " he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 09.09.2009 parents ' jobs are most important factor in fighting eu child poverty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty has far-reaching consequences for children growing up in europe having parents who work is the most important factor in preventing child poverty in europe .
but what can the eu do to alleviate child poverty ?
guidelines are available , but it 's mostly down to individual countries . the fight against child poverty in the eu is , first and foremost , a matter for individual states .
yet following the lisbon strategy , a development plan set out by the european council in 2000 , eu governments have promised to place children at the center of political dealings .
furthermore , the european commission has set out criteria defining child poverty , how it arises , spreads and how it can be combated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty can lead to social exclusion for many children the most recent report on child poverty by the commission was published in february 2008 ; in other words , before the financial crisis began .
the figures are likely to have worsened in the meantime .
then 19 million children in the eu were classified as poor , on average every fifth child .
the eu defines poor as earning 60 percent of the average income in each respective member state .
for a family in germany with two children , that means 1,600 euros -lrb- $ 2,300 -rrb- per month .
poverty impacts all areas of life the eu is keen to stress , however , that this does not just mean money as a means to consume , rather that child poverty takes away access to education -lrb- and therefore a good start in life -rrb- , damages health and excludes youngsters from a large part of cultural and social life .
that is another point brussels stresses : child poverty is a negative economic factor for each country .
it 's not just about sympathy and justice , but rather that economic policy should have a vested interest in nurturing and supporting children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployed parents are the greatest cause of child poverty the eu commission is especially concerned about unemployment .
out-of-work parents are the biggest cause of child poverty .
this leads to a vicious cycle that is hard to escape .
negative factors in families suffering from unemployment are often passed down from generation to generation .
according to the report , immigrant families are most at risk .
they suffer not only disproportionately from difficult financial circumstances , but also their children experience social and cultural exclusion .
policy solutions are the key the eu recommends to individual states a host of social , economic and cultural policies , including active employment and childcare policies , financial aid for families and integrated education and health policies .
and it has lauded the european states that lead in the fight against child poverty .
the scandinavian countries , the netherlands , austria , cyprus and slovenia all came out favorably in the commission 's report - in other words , not just rich countries .
they received praise for their comprehensive policies as the relatively high level and effectiveness of their welfare systems ran parallel with active employment policies and good childcare options .
italy , britain and spain came out the worst , with germany somewhere in the middle .

but two-thirds of germans say they do n't want to be immunized . in the latest step to fight an anticipated breakout of the h1n1 swine flu virus , germany 's 16 state health ministers have announced they plan to order another 18 million vaccination units .
that 's enough to immunize nine million more people and ensures there is enough stock should demand surge later in the year .
the health ministers have already ordered 50 million swine flu vaccinations for 25 million people , as each person requires two doses of the vaccine .
that means there will be enough vaccine to cover 40 percent of the german population .
the latest order is subject to funding being available .
the thorny question of who will bear the cost of this – the federal government , the health insurers , the state health departments or local authorities – is being discussed at a special working group meeting in berlin on wednesday .
two-thirds reject swine flu immunization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans are not convinced that swine flu is a threat a new study conducted by the forsa institute for dak , one of germany 's largest health insurers , revealed that a surprising number of germans do not plan to get immunized .
in the study of 1,001 people aged between 18 and 60 years , 62 percent said they would " definitely not , " or " almost definitely not " let themselves be vaccinated this autumn when the first swine flu vaccines become available .
eighty-two percent of germans said that swine flu poses a " fairly low " or " very low " danger .
bavarians , in germany 's south , in particular rejected vaccination .
only nine percent said they would " definitely " go to their doctor to be immunized compared to 14 percent of germans on average .
it 's a different picture in eastern germany , where almost a quarter of those who took part in the study said they were " definitely " going to get immunized .
" if the situation changes in the next few weeks , than we expect the number of people prepared to vaccinate themselves to increase sharply , " said horst boelle , the director of the claims department at dak .
are vaccinations worth the risk ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german medical association urges a rethink the german medical association is urging the government to reassess its mass vaccinations plan , the largest such scheme in postwar history .
" many people have already had swine flu and never even noticed that had it , " said frank ulrich montgomery , the association 's vice president .
montgomery also questioned whether the risks of vaccinating outweigh those of actually getting swine flu .
swine flu is highly infectious but it produces fairly mild symptoms and no one in germany has died of it so far .
" the disease could take a turn for the worse , and claim its first fatalities , " said deputy health minister klaus theo schroeder .
" i have the impression that we are now able to do that which we need to do in the next few weeks , " he added .
the first vaccinations are expected to be available in october and more units will be delivered on a weekly basis .
schroeder said mass vaccinations should be completed by the end of january or early february next year .
testing of the vaccine is ongoing .
in one pilot study , it was shown that a single vaccination was enough to provide protection in 80 percent of all test persons. wl / dpa / afp / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts point to the new drugs ' unknown side effects as another problem .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 09.09.2009 parents ' jobs are most important factor in fighting eu child poverty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty has far-reaching consequences for children growing up in europe having parents who work is the most important factor in preventing child poverty in europe .
but what can the eu do to alleviate child poverty ?
guidelines are available , but it 's mostly down to individual countries . the fight against child poverty in the eu is , first and foremost , a matter for individual states .
yet following the lisbon strategy , a development plan set out by the european council in 2000 , eu governments have promised to place children at the center of political dealings .
furthermore , the european commission has set out criteria defining child poverty , how it arises , spreads and how it can be combated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty can lead to social exclusion for many children the most recent report on child poverty by the commission was published in february 2008 ; in other words , before the financial crisis began .
the figures are likely to have worsened in the meantime .
then 19 million children in the eu were classified as poor , on average every fifth child .
the eu defines poor as earning 60 percent of the average income in each respective member state .
for a family in germany with two children , that means 1,600 euros -lrb- $ 2,300 -rrb- per month .
poverty impacts all areas of life the eu is keen to stress , however , that this does not just mean money as a means to consume , rather that child poverty takes away access to education -lrb- and therefore a good start in life -rrb- , damages health and excludes youngsters from a large part of cultural and social life .
that is another point brussels stresses : child poverty is a negative economic factor for each country .
it 's not just about sympathy and justice , but rather that economic policy should have a vested interest in nurturing and supporting children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployed parents are the greatest cause of child poverty the eu commission is especially concerned about unemployment .
out-of-work parents are the biggest cause of child poverty .
this leads to a vicious cycle that is hard to escape .
negative factors in families suffering from unemployment are often passed down from generation to generation .
according to the report , immigrant families are most at risk .
they suffer not only disproportionately from difficult financial circumstances , but also their children experience social and cultural exclusion .
policy solutions are the key the eu recommends to individual states a host of social , economic and cultural policies , including active employment and childcare policies , financial aid for families and integrated education and health policies .
and it has lauded the european states that lead in the fight against child poverty .
the scandinavian countries , the netherlands , austria , cyprus and slovenia all came out favorably in the commission 's report - in other words , not just rich countries .
they received praise for their comprehensive policies as the relatively high level and effectiveness of their welfare systems ran parallel with active employment policies and good childcare options .
italy , britain and spain came out the worst , with germany somewhere in the middle .

joerg tauss maintains his innocence , saying he was conducting research . state prosecutors in the southern city of karlsruhe accuse tauss of having acquired , distributed , and possessed child pornography 102 times between may 2007 and january 2009 .
an investigation was carried out earlier this year after evidence was found in tauss ' office , including mobile phone pictures and dvds of underage sex .
but prosecutors could not press charges until parliament voted to repeal his immunity status , which happened on tuesday . fifty-six-year-old tauss is also accused of having shared child pornography with others via email in six cases , according to prosecutors .
the former spd politician has repeatedly denied the charges , insisting that he was merely conducting research as part of his efforts to break up a child pornography ring .
in response , prosecutors said investigators had found " no evidence of this claim . "
tauss resigned his position after the scandal broke and later joined the pirate party , a swedish-based group that advocates for more freedom on the internet .
he has resisted calls to step down from parliament .

guidelines are available , but it 's mostly down to individual countries . the fight against child poverty in the eu is , first and foremost , a matter for individual states .
yet following the lisbon strategy , a development plan set out by the european council in 2000 , eu governments have promised to place children at the center of political dealings .
furthermore , the european commission has set out criteria defining child poverty , how it arises , spreads and how it can be combated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty can lead to social exclusion for many children the most recent report on child poverty by the commission was published in february 2008 ; in other words , before the financial crisis began .
the figures are likely to have worsened in the meantime .
then 19 million children in the eu were classified as poor , on average every fifth child .
the eu defines poor as earning 60 percent of the average income in each respective member state .
for a family in germany with two children , that means 1,600 euros -lrb- $ 2,300 -rrb- per month .
poverty impacts all areas of life the eu is keen to stress , however , that this does not just mean money as a means to consume , rather that child poverty takes away access to education -lrb- and therefore a good start in life -rrb- , damages health and excludes youngsters from a large part of cultural and social life .
that is another point brussels stresses : child poverty is a negative economic factor for each country .
it 's not just about sympathy and justice , but rather that economic policy should have a vested interest in nurturing and supporting children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployed parents are the greatest cause of child poverty the eu commission is especially concerned about unemployment .
out-of-work parents are the biggest cause of child poverty .
this leads to a vicious cycle that is hard to escape .
negative factors in families suffering from unemployment are often passed down from generation to generation .
according to the report , immigrant families are most at risk .
they suffer not only disproportionately from difficult financial circumstances , but also their children experience social and cultural exclusion .
policy solutions are the key the eu recommends to individual states a host of social , economic and cultural policies , including active employment and childcare policies , financial aid for families and integrated education and health policies .
and it has lauded the european states that lead in the fight against child poverty .
the scandinavian countries , the netherlands , austria , cyprus and slovenia all came out favorably in the commission 's report - in other words , not just rich countries .
they received praise for their comprehensive policies as the relatively high level and effectiveness of their welfare systems ran parallel with active employment policies and good childcare options .
italy , britain and spain came out the worst , with germany somewhere in the middle .

a message on the popular website said that the clip had been removed " due to terms of violation , " without giving any further details .
the spot , which was produced by the hamburg-based advertizing agency " das comitee " and launched by the aids awareness group regenbogen last week , runs just over 90 seconds .

his face is that of nazi leader adolf hitler .
the spot ends with the sentence : " aids is a mass murderer .
protect yourself . "
the ad has provoked outrage among aids groups and jewish organizations who have slammed the spot as being tasteless .
" the disgusting spot ... derides the victims of national socialism and compares people suffering from hiv to mass murderers , " said carsten schatz , the chairman of deutsche aids hilfe , germany 's main hiv / aids charity .
schatz also criticized the video for not giving information on how to protect oneself against hiv or other sexually transmitted diseases .
the spot 's originators said they could not understand what all the fuss was about .
they have apologized , but are unwilling to take the campaign spot offline - the video is still available at www.aids-is-a-mass-murderer.com.
" we never intended to depict those who suffer from aids or hiv as mass murderers .
we wanted to give a face to the disease , " said regenbogen 's jan schwertner .
bildunterschrift : the dictators josef stalin , left , and saddam hussein also feature in the campaign " the campaign was designed to make people sit up and get the issue back on the agenda and stop the trend toward unprotected sexual intercourse , " the group said in a statement on its website .

joerg tauss maintains his innocence , saying he was conducting research . state prosecutors in the southern city of karlsruhe accuse tauss of having acquired , distributed , and possessed child pornography 102 times between may 2007 and january 2009 .
an investigation was carried out earlier this year after evidence was found in tauss ' office , including mobile phone pictures and dvds of underage sex .
but prosecutors could not press charges until parliament voted to repeal his immunity status , which happened on tuesday . fifty-six-year-old tauss is also accused of having shared child pornography with others via email in six cases , according to prosecutors .
the former spd politician has repeatedly denied the charges , insisting that he was merely conducting research as part of his efforts to break up a child pornography ring .
in response , prosecutors said investigators had found " no evidence of this claim . "
tauss resigned his position after the scandal broke and later joined the pirate party , a swedish-based group that advocates for more freedom on the internet .
he has resisted calls to step down from parliament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 09.09.2009 the left party trumps with anti-war card in election campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left wants germany to get out of afghanistan the only party calling for an end to germany 's engagement in afghanistan has moved up in recent polls .
after a german-ordered airstrike killed scores in kunduz last week , the left 's view is becoming more popular . the campaign signs for germany 's left party send a clear message : " out of afghanistan ! "
it 's a sentiment widely held by many germans and has increased since a german commander in afghanistan ordered an airstrike on two fuel tankers , hijacked by the taliban last week , that left scores of people dead , including civilians .
while the future of the 4,200 german troops currently deployed in afghanistan is a political issue , politicians from chancellor angela merkel 's ruling christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their coalition partner , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , say last week 's attack will not change government policy on afghanistan .
with the exception of the left party , the rest of germany 's major parties are in favor of continuing the country 's mission in afghanistan .
but the latest weekly election polls , released on wednesday , suggest that the attack may be influencing voters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de entertainment -pipe- 09.09.2009 court ruling allows european countries to ban online betting sites großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only state-run sports betting and lotteries are permitted in germany online bookmakers can be blocked by governments as a crime-fighting measure , a european court has ruled .
but critics say prohibiting them breaks eu rules and wo n't reduce their popularity . operators of internet betting sites in europe face an uncertain future after a recent european court ruling which allows governments to ban them as a way to crack down on crime .
the court case was brought on by a dispute between the portuguese government and bwin international ltd . , one of the largest online gambling operators in europe .
bwin sponsors some of europe 's most important football teams , such as bayern munich , real madrid and ac milan .
the company had been fined 74,500 euros -lrb- $ 106,765 -rrb- for offering its services in the country , which is against portuguese law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bwin says a ban on online gambling wo n't work according to the european court 's ruling , online bookmakers can be shut down in countries where the government holds exclusive rights to administering gambling activities , such as finland , greece , the netherlands and sweden .
germany banned online betting last year , and private german lottery companies ceased their operations at the beginning of 2009 .
only state-run betting and lotteries are now permitted . in its ruling , the european court cited the high-risk of fraud and criminal activity that often go hand-in-hand with online betting as a reason for its decision , adding that bookmakers who sponsor competitions could " influence the outcome of events . "
concerns about illicit gaming the head of the european lotteries association of state gaming organizations , friedrich stickler welcomed the ruling .
" you have to have a license in a country to operate , " stickler noted .
" for me it is the beginning of a new era in the internet gaming sector . "
however , bwin says they acted in compliance with eu rules granting unrestricted movement of capital within the 27-member bloc .

the film shows how the nazis were put under pressure by the united states , which threatened to boycott the olympic games if germany failed to field any jewish athletes . in a bid to save face and get international respectability , the nazi leadership selected bergmann to participate in the games .
they made it clear her family left behind in germany would suffer the consequences if she refused . an unusually muscular replacement bergmann , played in the film by young german actress karoline herfurth , returned to germany and broke the german high-jump record ahead of the olympics . but just days before the start of the 1936 olympics , the nazis barred bergmann , a favorite for gold , from the games , saying her performances had n't been satisfactory .
the nazis wanted to ensure that hitler would not be embarrassed by a jewish athlete winning a gold medal for germany . the dramatic turnabout came after the ship carrying us athletes had set sail for germany .
by way of consolation , bergmann was given a spectator 's ticket . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bergmann 's competition in the film is a fictional character based on ratjen the nazis replaced bergmann with " aryan " athletes elfriede kaun and dora ratjen .
the two won third and fourth place respectively in the high-jump .
but two years later , it emerged that ratjen , who had a deep , gruff voice , was in fact male . in 1938 , still posing as a woman , ratjen set a new world high jump record for women of 1.70m - but was disqualified after a doctor discovered that he had strapped up his genitals .
he was stripped of his title , his performances were expunged from the records , and he was quickly conscripted into the army . the film shows bergmann 's trainer waldmann , played by popular german actor axel prahl , being replaced by a nazi loyalist who brings in a manly-looking athlete to replace high-jumper bergmann . the film does n't just show how bergmann was discriminated against and sidelined but also touches on how she becomes friends with ratjen .
it portrays ratjen as a tormented person who knows that he is not a woman but tries fearfully to hide the fact . a scene in the film shows actress herfurth coming upon marie ketteler , a fictional character based on dora ratjen and played by actor sebastian urzendowsky , in the shower and discovering that she is a man . bergmann : " i had no idea " in reality , it is not clear whether the nazis were aware that dora ratjen was in fact " hermann " ratjen .
bergmann , who emigrated to the united states in 1937 and still lives there , said she herself had no idea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film shows the athletes - seen here at berlin 's olympic stadium - becoming friends " i never suspected anything , " the now 95-year-old told the german news magazine der spiegel .
" we all wondered why she never appeared naked in the shower .
to be so shy at the age of 17 seemed grotesque .
but we just thought : well , she 's weird , she 's strange . " the film is interspersed with interviews with the real gretel bergmann .
the 25-year-old herfurth , hailed as an upcoming acting star in germany , is reported to have trained for a year to perfect her form for the long-jumping scenes . the film 's germany premiere , held in berlin in august , coincided with the row over the gender of south african athlete caster semenya , which marred the world athletics championships in the very stadium where the 1936 olympics were held . cheated of gold ? after emigrating to the united states , bergmann went on to win several more high-jumping titles .
she vowed never to return to germany again or speak the language . but more than 60 years later , bergmann did return to germany .
in 1999 , she accepted a prestigious award in frankfurt that recognized her sporting achievements .
and she made a second trip to her hometown laupheim in southwestern germany when a stadium there was named after her . but bergmann said she remains certain that she was cheated of an olympic gold medal by the nazis . " i would have won gold , nothing less , " she told der spiegel .
" i wanted to show to the germans and to the world that jews were not these terrible people , not fat , ugly and disgusting as were people , " she said . " i wanted to show that a jewish girl could beat the germans .
in front of 10,000 people . " the film " berlin 36 " opens across cinemas in germany on sept .

the film shows how the nazis were put under pressure by the united states , which threatened to boycott the olympic games if germany failed to field any jewish athletes . in a bid to save face and get international respectability , the nazi leadership selected bergmann to participate in the games .
they made it clear her family left behind in germany would suffer the consequences if she refused . an unusually muscular replacement bergmann , played in the film by young german actress karoline herfurth , returned to germany and broke the german high-jump record ahead of the olympics . but just days before the start of the 1936 olympics , the nazis barred bergmann , a favorite for gold , from the games , saying her performances had n't been satisfactory .
the nazis wanted to ensure that hitler would not be embarrassed by a jewish athlete winning a gold medal for germany . the dramatic turnabout came after the ship carrying us athletes had set sail for germany .
by way of consolation , bergmann was given a spectator 's ticket . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bergmann 's competition in the film is a fictional character based on ratjen the nazis replaced bergmann with " aryan " athletes elfriede kaun and dora ratjen .
the two won third and fourth place respectively in the high-jump .
but two years later , it emerged that ratjen , who had a deep , gruff voice , was in fact male . in 1938 , still posing as a woman , ratjen set a new world high jump record for women of 1.70m - but was disqualified after a doctor discovered that he had strapped up his genitals .
he was stripped of his title , his performances were expunged from the records , and he was quickly conscripted into the army . the film shows bergmann 's trainer waldmann , played by popular german actor axel prahl , being replaced by a nazi loyalist who brings in a manly-looking athlete to replace high-jumper bergmann . the film does n't just show how bergmann was discriminated against and sidelined but also touches on how she becomes friends with ratjen .
it portrays ratjen as a tormented person who knows that he is not a woman but tries fearfully to hide the fact . a scene in the film shows actress herfurth coming upon marie ketteler , a fictional character based on dora ratjen and played by actor sebastian urzendowsky , in the shower and discovering that she is a man . bergmann : " i had no idea " in reality , it is not clear whether the nazis were aware that dora ratjen was in fact " hermann " ratjen .
bergmann , who emigrated to the united states in 1937 and still lives there , said she herself had no idea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film shows the athletes - seen here at berlin 's olympic stadium - becoming friends " i never suspected anything , " the now 95-year-old told the german news magazine der spiegel .
" we all wondered why she never appeared naked in the shower .
to be so shy at the age of 17 seemed grotesque .
but we just thought : well , she 's weird , she 's strange . " the film is interspersed with interviews with the real gretel bergmann .
the 25-year-old herfurth , hailed as an upcoming acting star in germany , is reported to have trained for a year to perfect her form for the long-jumping scenes . the film 's germany premiere , held in berlin in august , coincided with the row over the gender of south african athlete caster semenya , which marred the world athletics championships in the very stadium where the 1936 olympics were held . cheated of gold ? after emigrating to the united states , bergmann went on to win several more high-jumping titles .
she vowed never to return to germany again or speak the language . but more than 60 years later , bergmann did return to germany .
in 1999 , she accepted a prestigious award in frankfurt that recognized her sporting achievements .
and she made a second trip to her hometown laupheim in southwestern germany when a stadium there was named after her . but bergmann said she remains certain that she was cheated of an olympic gold medal by the nazis . " i would have won gold , nothing less , " she told der spiegel .
" i wanted to show to the germans and to the world that jews were not these terrible people , not fat , ugly and disgusting as were people , " she said . " i wanted to show that a jewish girl could beat the germans .
in front of 10,000 people . " the film " berlin 36 " opens across cinemas in germany on sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 09.09.2009 parents ' jobs are most important factor in fighting eu child poverty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty has far-reaching consequences for children growing up in europe having parents who work is the most important factor in preventing child poverty in europe .
but what can the eu do to alleviate child poverty ?
guidelines are available , but it 's mostly down to individual countries . the fight against child poverty in the eu is , first and foremost , a matter for individual states .
yet following the lisbon strategy , a development plan set out by the european council in 2000 , eu governments have promised to place children at the center of political dealings .
furthermore , the european commission has set out criteria defining child poverty , how it arises , spreads and how it can be combated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty can lead to social exclusion for many children the most recent report on child poverty by the commission was published in february 2008 ; in other words , before the financial crisis began .
the figures are likely to have worsened in the meantime .
then 19 million children in the eu were classified as poor , on average every fifth child .
the eu defines poor as earning 60 percent of the average income in each respective member state .
for a family in germany with two children , that means 1,600 euros -lrb- $ 2,300 -rrb- per month .
poverty impacts all areas of life the eu is keen to stress , however , that this does not just mean money as a means to consume , rather that child poverty takes away access to education -lrb- and therefore a good start in life -rrb- , damages health and excludes youngsters from a large part of cultural and social life .
that is another point brussels stresses : child poverty is a negative economic factor for each country .
it 's not just about sympathy and justice , but rather that economic policy should have a vested interest in nurturing and supporting children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployed parents are the greatest cause of child poverty the eu commission is especially concerned about unemployment .
out-of-work parents are the biggest cause of child poverty .
this leads to a vicious cycle that is hard to escape .
negative factors in families suffering from unemployment are often passed down from generation to generation .
according to the report , immigrant families are most at risk .
they suffer not only disproportionately from difficult financial circumstances , but also their children experience social and cultural exclusion .
policy solutions are the key the eu recommends to individual states a host of social , economic and cultural policies , including active employment and childcare policies , financial aid for families and integrated education and health policies .
and it has lauded the european states that lead in the fight against child poverty .
the scandinavian countries , the netherlands , austria , cyprus and slovenia all came out favorably in the commission 's report - in other words , not just rich countries .
they received praise for their comprehensive policies as the relatively high level and effectiveness of their welfare systems ran parallel with active employment policies and good childcare options .
italy , britain and spain came out the worst , with germany somewhere in the middle .

a message on the popular website said that the clip had been removed " due to terms of violation , " without giving any further details .
the spot , which was produced by the hamburg-based advertizing agency " das comitee " and launched by the aids awareness group regenbogen last week , runs just over 90 seconds .
it shows a couple having sex in a murky room .
to begin with , the focus is on body parts gliding over white bed sheets combined with the occasional shot of the woman 's face .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this poster is similar to the final scene of the ad as the proceedings begin to reach a climax , the camera zooms in on the man , who suddenly lifts his head .
his face is that of nazi leader adolf hitler .
the spot ends with the sentence : " aids is a mass murderer .
protect yourself . "
the ad has provoked outrage among aids groups and jewish organizations who have slammed the spot as being tasteless .
" the disgusting spot ... derides the victims of national socialism and compares people suffering from hiv to mass murderers , " said carsten schatz , the chairman of deutsche aids hilfe , germany 's main hiv / aids charity .
schatz also criticized the video for not giving information on how to protect oneself against hiv or other sexually transmitted diseases .
the spot 's originators said they could not understand what all the fuss was about .
they have apologized , but are unwilling to take the campaign spot offline - the video is still available at www.aids-is-a-mass-murderer.com.
" we never intended to depict those who suffer from aids or hiv as mass murderers .
we wanted to give a face to the disease , " said regenbogen 's jan schwertner .
bildunterschrift : the dictators josef stalin , left , and saddam hussein also feature in the campaign " the campaign was designed to make people sit up and get the issue back on the agenda and stop the trend toward unprotected sexual intercourse , " the group said in a statement on its website .
the anti-aids campaign includes posters of soviet and iraqi dictators josef stalin and saddam hussein in naked embraces with women and underlined with the slogan " aids is a mass murderer .

joerg tauss maintains his innocence , saying he was conducting research . state prosecutors in the southern city of karlsruhe accuse tauss of having acquired , distributed , and possessed child pornography 102 times between may 2007 and january 2009 .
an investigation was carried out earlier this year after evidence was found in tauss ' office , including mobile phone pictures and dvds of underage sex .
but prosecutors could not press charges until parliament voted to repeal his immunity status , which happened on tuesday . fifty-six-year-old tauss is also accused of having shared child pornography with others via email in six cases , according to prosecutors .
the former spd politician has repeatedly denied the charges , insisting that he was merely conducting research as part of his efforts to break up a child pornography ring .
in response , prosecutors said investigators had found " no evidence of this claim . "
tauss resigned his position after the scandal broke and later joined the pirate party , a swedish-based group that advocates for more freedom on the internet .
he has resisted calls to step down from parliament .
tauss is expected to lose his seat in germany 's parliamentary elections on september 27. vj / ap / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts believe european models may help him formulate a system which will work for americans . healthcare reform has become obama 's top domestic priority in recent months as millions of americans look to their president to make good on one of his key pledges in his election campaign .
the pressure on obama to overhaul the country 's $ 2.5 trillion -lrb- 1.7 trillion euros -rrb- healthcare system is intensifying as he prepares to address congress on sept .
9 to outline his latest vision and gears himself for what could turn out to be a bitter battle between democrats and republicans set to a background of public skepticism .
healthcare experts believe that obama has no other choice but to press on with his ambitious plans .
few believe that he will be able to achieve all that he has promised .
at the same time they say he ca n't afford to abandon his plans with so much public opinion and political currency at stake .
" obama wo n't abandon his plans , he simply ca n't afford to , " uwe reinhardt , professor for healthcare economics at princeton university told deutsche welle .
" he ca n't do all the things he said he could do .
the most he can do this year is to make sure that of the 47 million uninsured people in the us , maybe 20 million will be helped to get insurance . "
claus wendt , project director at the mannheim center for european social policy research , agrees that a solution must be found - and fast .
" obama has to do something , " wendt told deutsche welle .
" today , 16 percent of the total economy is spent on healthcare and this will only increase .
in ten years , it will be more than 20 percent .
take the situation with medicare , the insurance system for the elderly - it is very expensive .
if obama does nothing , then caring for the elderly will become even more costly as the population ages and this will be an even bigger burden on the economy . "
uninsured americans demand expensive healthcare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost 50 million americans have no healthcare cover in a country that prides itself on providing equal opportunities for all , it 's a shock to find that almost 50 million americans are without any type of healthcare .
yet that does n't stop them from making undue demands , according to professor reinhardt .
" americans do imagine themselves to have an enormous range of rights , " he said , " but at the same time they are skimpy on responsibility .
their thinking is that no one has the right to tell them to purchase insurance but when they 're sick and not insured they have the right to healthcare that may cost $ 200,000 .
i do n't think you would find that many germans to be so juvenile about it , " he said .
with such political and public pressure growing , obama will have to come up with a reform plan which brings both sides of the political spectrum together and eases the concerns of the american population .
with his critics citing all manner of evils from communism to nazi germany in their opposition to anything resembling public healthcare , obama needs to look for a model that the us can accept and one which will work in its complex healthcare arena .
both reinhardt and wendt believe obama should look towards europe when considering his next move .
european models offer compromise solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's model offers hope but is difficult politically " it was recently written in the new york times that the best model for the reform of the insurance system was that of germany , which does n't have a government-run plan but where there are private health funds , " reinhardt said .
" they compete but within a regulatory structure which makes that competition fair and humane .
" you could pick either the german system , the dutch system - even more so as they allow for profit-orientated insurance companies - or the swiss system , " he continued .
" all these systems are fairly similar in having a structured , regulated market for private insurers , either non-profit or profit-making . " " but i think a mixture of the dutch and german systems would be perfect for the insurance reform in the us , " he added . " it 's a shame that instead of having a rational discussion on the german system or taking a plane load of senators and congressmen and flying them over there , you have this shouting match over euthanasia , and pictures of hitler being waved about .
it has descended into quite an ugly scene . "
wendt agrees that that the german model is a political hot potato in the us and that the dutch healthcare system could provide obama with the compromise model he is looking for .
" i do n't think it 's a good idea to refer to the german model in the us for political reasons , " wendt said .
" in general , i would say that the german model in comparison to the us model is in quite good shape because germans have competition between different plans and the patients can choose between different plans and healthcare providers .
" but the dutch model might be a good option for the us , " he continued .
" this would show that a new healthcare system could be run through private organizations and as a publicly-run concern , which is a fear in some circles in the us .
the swiss model may also work as the insurance business is conducted by private organizations , and this could be implemented in the american healthcare system . "
obama needs to explain his plans , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is accused of not explaining his plans for health should obama choose to follow a european model or combine a number of them in a plan to suit the american healthcare landscape , he is going to have to sell it to the people , something many americans have accused the president of failing to do so far .
a cbs news poll recently said most americans think obama has not clearly explained his plans to overhaul the system .
" obama is a very intelligent man but i would not be surprised if he 's not that well informed on the european healthcare systems , " said reinhardt .
" the big mistake he has made is that he has n't been able to explain to people in simple terms what he wants to do and appeal to that big , broad centrist middle class .
and because it is a big unknown , everyone expects the worst .
you have educated , intelligent people like the catholic bishops believing that obama 's plan will lead to old people having their life-support systems turned off .
this information vacuum is president obama 's fault .
he should have taken hold of this issue much earlier . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 09.09.2009 parents ' jobs are most important factor in fighting eu child poverty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty has far-reaching consequences for children growing up in europe having parents who work is the most important factor in preventing child poverty in europe .
but what can the eu do to alleviate child poverty ?
guidelines are available , but it 's mostly down to individual countries . the fight against child poverty in the eu is , first and foremost , a matter for individual states .
yet following the lisbon strategy , a development plan set out by the european council in 2000 , eu governments have promised to place children at the center of political dealings .
furthermore , the european commission has set out criteria defining child poverty , how it arises , spreads and how it can be combated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty can lead to social exclusion for many children the most recent report on child poverty by the commission was published in february 2008 ; in other words , before the financial crisis began .
the figures are likely to have worsened in the meantime .
then 19 million children in the eu were classified as poor , on average every fifth child .
the eu defines poor as earning 60 percent of the average income in each respective member state .
for a family in germany with two children , that means 1,600 euros -lrb- $ 2,300 -rrb- per month .
poverty impacts all areas of life the eu is keen to stress , however , that this does not just mean money as a means to consume , rather that child poverty takes away access to education -lrb- and therefore a good start in life -rrb- , damages health and excludes youngsters from a large part of cultural and social life .
that is another point brussels stresses : child poverty is a negative economic factor for each country .
it 's not just about sympathy and justice , but rather that economic policy should have a vested interest in nurturing and supporting children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployed parents are the greatest cause of child poverty the eu commission is especially concerned about unemployment .
out-of-work parents are the biggest cause of child poverty .
this leads to a vicious cycle that is hard to escape .
negative factors in families suffering from unemployment are often passed down from generation to generation .
according to the report , immigrant families are most at risk .
they suffer not only disproportionately from difficult financial circumstances , but also their children experience social and cultural exclusion .
policy solutions are the key the eu recommends to individual states a host of social , economic and cultural policies , including active employment and childcare policies , financial aid for families and integrated education and health policies .
and it has lauded the european states that lead in the fight against child poverty .
the scandinavian countries , the netherlands , austria , cyprus and slovenia all came out favorably in the commission 's report - in other words , not just rich countries .
they received praise for their comprehensive policies as the relatively high level and effectiveness of their welfare systems ran parallel with active employment policies and good childcare options .
italy , britain and spain came out the worst , with germany somewhere in the middle .

experts believe european models may help him formulate a system which will work for americans . healthcare reform has become obama 's top domestic priority in recent months as millions of americans look to their president to make good on one of his key pledges in his election campaign .
the pressure on obama to overhaul the country 's $ 2.5 trillion -lrb- 1.7 trillion euros -rrb- healthcare system is intensifying as he prepares to address congress on sept .
9 to outline his latest vision and gears himself for what could turn out to be a bitter battle between democrats and republicans set to a background of public skepticism .
healthcare experts believe that obama has no other choice but to press on with his ambitious plans .
few believe that he will be able to achieve all that he has promised .
at the same time they say he ca n't afford to abandon his plans with so much public opinion and political currency at stake .
" obama wo n't abandon his plans , he simply ca n't afford to , " uwe reinhardt , professor for healthcare economics at princeton university told deutsche welle .
" he ca n't do all the things he said he could do .
the most he can do this year is to make sure that of the 47 million uninsured people in the us , maybe 20 million will be helped to get insurance . "
claus wendt , project director at the mannheim center for european social policy research , agrees that a solution must be found - and fast .
" obama has to do something , " wendt told deutsche welle .
" today , 16 percent of the total economy is spent on healthcare and this will only increase .
in ten years , it will be more than 20 percent .
take the situation with medicare , the insurance system for the elderly - it is very expensive .
if obama does nothing , then caring for the elderly will become even more costly as the population ages and this will be an even bigger burden on the economy . "
uninsured americans demand expensive healthcare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost 50 million americans have no healthcare cover in a country that prides itself on providing equal opportunities for all , it 's a shock to find that almost 50 million americans are without any type of healthcare .
yet that does n't stop them from making undue demands , according to professor reinhardt .
" americans do imagine themselves to have an enormous range of rights , " he said , " but at the same time they are skimpy on responsibility .
their thinking is that no one has the right to tell them to purchase insurance but when they 're sick and not insured they have the right to healthcare that may cost $ 200,000 .
i do n't think you would find that many germans to be so juvenile about it , " he said .
with such political and public pressure growing , obama will have to come up with a reform plan which brings both sides of the political spectrum together and eases the concerns of the american population .
with his critics citing all manner of evils from communism to nazi germany in their opposition to anything resembling public healthcare , obama needs to look for a model that the us can accept and one which will work in its complex healthcare arena .
both reinhardt and wendt believe obama should look towards europe when considering his next move .
european models offer compromise solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's model offers hope but is difficult politically " it was recently written in the new york times that the best model for the reform of the insurance system was that of germany , which does n't have a government-run plan but where there are private health funds , " reinhardt said .
" they compete but within a regulatory structure which makes that competition fair and humane .
" you could pick either the german system , the dutch system - even more so as they allow for profit-orientated insurance companies - or the swiss system , " he continued .
" all these systems are fairly similar in having a structured , regulated market for private insurers , either non-profit or profit-making . " " but i think a mixture of the dutch and german systems would be perfect for the insurance reform in the us , " he added . " it 's a shame that instead of having a rational discussion on the german system or taking a plane load of senators and congressmen and flying them over there , you have this shouting match over euthanasia , and pictures of hitler being waved about .
it has descended into quite an ugly scene . "
wendt agrees that that the german model is a political hot potato in the us and that the dutch healthcare system could provide obama with the compromise model he is looking for .
" i do n't think it 's a good idea to refer to the german model in the us for political reasons , " wendt said .
" in general , i would say that the german model in comparison to the us model is in quite good shape because germans have competition between different plans and the patients can choose between different plans and healthcare providers .
" but the dutch model might be a good option for the us , " he continued .
" this would show that a new healthcare system could be run through private organizations and as a publicly-run concern , which is a fear in some circles in the us .
the swiss model may also work as the insurance business is conducted by private organizations , and this could be implemented in the american healthcare system . "
obama needs to explain his plans , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is accused of not explaining his plans for health should obama choose to follow a european model or combine a number of them in a plan to suit the american healthcare landscape , he is going to have to sell it to the people , something many americans have accused the president of failing to do so far .
a cbs news poll recently said most americans think obama has not clearly explained his plans to overhaul the system .
" obama is a very intelligent man but i would not be surprised if he 's not that well informed on the european healthcare systems , " said reinhardt .
" the big mistake he has made is that he has n't been able to explain to people in simple terms what he wants to do and appeal to that big , broad centrist middle class .
and because it is a big unknown , everyone expects the worst .
you have educated , intelligent people like the catholic bishops believing that obama 's plan will lead to old people having their life-support systems turned off .
this information vacuum is president obama 's fault .
he should have taken hold of this issue much earlier . "

uninsured americans demand expensive healthcare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost 50 million americans have no healthcare cover in a country that prides itself on providing equal opportunities for all , it 's a shock to find that almost 50 million americans are without any type of healthcare .
yet that does n't stop them from making undue demands , according to professor reinhardt .
" americans do imagine themselves to have an enormous range of rights , " he said , " but at the same time they are skimpy on responsibility .
their thinking is that no one has the right to tell them to purchase insurance but when they 're sick and not insured they have the right to healthcare that may cost $ 200,000 .
i do n't think you would find that many germans to be so juvenile about it , " he said .
with such political and public pressure growing , obama will have to come up with a reform plan which brings both sides of the political spectrum together and eases the concerns of the american population .
with his critics citing all manner of evils from communism to nazi germany in their opposition to anything resembling public healthcare , obama needs to look for a model that the us can accept and one which will work in its complex healthcare arena .
both reinhardt and wendt believe obama should look towards europe when considering his next move .
european models offer compromise solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's model offers hope but is difficult politically " it was recently written in the new york times that the best model for the reform of the insurance system was that of germany , which does n't have a government-run plan but where there are private health funds , " reinhardt said .
" they compete but within a regulatory structure which makes that competition fair and humane .
" you could pick either the german system , the dutch system - even more so as they allow for profit-orientated insurance companies - or the swiss system , " he continued .
" all these systems are fairly similar in having a structured , regulated market for private insurers , either non-profit or profit-making . " " but i think a mixture of the dutch and german systems would be perfect for the insurance reform in the us , " he added . " it 's a shame that instead of having a rational discussion on the german system or taking a plane load of senators and congressmen and flying them over there , you have this shouting match over euthanasia , and pictures of hitler being waved about .
it has descended into quite an ugly scene . "
wendt agrees that that the german model is a political hot potato in the us and that the dutch healthcare system could provide obama with the compromise model he is looking for .
" i do n't think it 's a good idea to refer to the german model in the us for political reasons , " wendt said .
" in general , i would say that the german model in comparison to the us model is in quite good shape because germans have competition between different plans and the patients can choose between different plans and healthcare providers .
" but the dutch model might be a good option for the us , " he continued .
" this would show that a new healthcare system could be run through private organizations and as a publicly-run concern , which is a fear in some circles in the us .
the swiss model may also work as the insurance business is conducted by private organizations , and this could be implemented in the american healthcare system . "
obama needs to explain his plans , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is accused of not explaining his plans for health should obama choose to follow a european model or combine a number of them in a plan to suit the american healthcare landscape , he is going to have to sell it to the people , something many americans have accused the president of failing to do so far .
a cbs news poll recently said most americans think obama has not clearly explained his plans to overhaul the system .
" obama is a very intelligent man but i would not be surprised if he 's not that well informed on the european healthcare systems , " said reinhardt .
" the big mistake he has made is that he has n't been able to explain to people in simple terms what he wants to do and appeal to that big , broad centrist middle class .
and because it is a big unknown , everyone expects the worst .
you have educated , intelligent people like the catholic bishops believing that obama 's plan will lead to old people having their life-support systems turned off .
this information vacuum is president obama 's fault .
he should have taken hold of this issue much earlier . "

experts believe european models may help him formulate a system which will work for americans . healthcare reform has become obama 's top domestic priority in recent months as millions of americans look to their president to make good on one of his key pledges in his election campaign .

the film shows how the nazis were put under pressure by the united states , which threatened to boycott the olympic games if germany failed to field any jewish athletes . in a bid to save face and get international respectability , the nazi leadership selected bergmann to participate in the games .
they made it clear her family left behind in germany would suffer the consequences if she refused . an unusually muscular replacement bergmann , played in the film by young german actress karoline herfurth , returned to germany and broke the german high-jump record ahead of the olympics . but just days before the start of the 1936 olympics , the nazis barred bergmann , a favorite for gold , from the games , saying her performances had n't been satisfactory .
the nazis wanted to ensure that hitler would not be embarrassed by a jewish athlete winning a gold medal for germany . the dramatic turnabout came after the ship carrying us athletes had set sail for germany .
by way of consolation , bergmann was given a spectator 's ticket . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bergmann 's competition in the film is a fictional character based on ratjen the nazis replaced bergmann with " aryan " athletes elfriede kaun and dora ratjen .
the two won third and fourth place respectively in the high-jump .
but two years later , it emerged that ratjen , who had a deep , gruff voice , was in fact male . in 1938 , still posing as a woman , ratjen set a new world high jump record for women of 1.70m - but was disqualified after a doctor discovered that he had strapped up his genitals .
he was stripped of his title , his performances were expunged from the records , and he was quickly conscripted into the army . the film shows bergmann 's trainer waldmann , played by popular german actor axel prahl , being replaced by a nazi loyalist who brings in a manly-looking athlete to replace high-jumper bergmann . the film does n't just show how bergmann was discriminated against and sidelined but also touches on how she becomes friends with ratjen .
it portrays ratjen as a tormented person who knows that he is not a woman but tries fearfully to hide the fact . a scene in the film shows actress herfurth coming upon marie ketteler , a fictional character based on dora ratjen and played by actor sebastian urzendowsky , in the shower and discovering that she is a man . bergmann : " i had no idea " in reality , it is not clear whether the nazis were aware that dora ratjen was in fact " hermann " ratjen .
bergmann , who emigrated to the united states in 1937 and still lives there , said she herself had no idea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film shows the athletes - seen here at berlin 's olympic stadium - becoming friends " i never suspected anything , " the now 95-year-old told the german news magazine der spiegel .
" we all wondered why she never appeared naked in the shower .
to be so shy at the age of 17 seemed grotesque .
but we just thought : well , she 's weird , she 's strange . " the film is interspersed with interviews with the real gretel bergmann .
the 25-year-old herfurth , hailed as an upcoming acting star in germany , is reported to have trained for a year to perfect her form for the long-jumping scenes . the film 's germany premiere , held in berlin in august , coincided with the row over the gender of south african athlete caster semenya , which marred the world athletics championships in the very stadium where the 1936 olympics were held . cheated of gold ? after emigrating to the united states , bergmann went on to win several more high-jumping titles .
she vowed never to return to germany again or speak the language . but more than 60 years later , bergmann did return to germany .
in 1999 , she accepted a prestigious award in frankfurt that recognized her sporting achievements .
and she made a second trip to her hometown laupheim in southwestern germany when a stadium there was named after her . but bergmann said she remains certain that she was cheated of an olympic gold medal by the nazis . " i would have won gold , nothing less , " she told der spiegel .
" i wanted to show to the germans and to the world that jews were not these terrible people , not fat , ugly and disgusting as were people , " she said . " i wanted to show that a jewish girl could beat the germans .

the film shows how the nazis were put under pressure by the united states , which threatened to boycott the olympic games if germany failed to field any jewish athletes . in a bid to save face and get international respectability , the nazi leadership selected bergmann to participate in the games .
they made it clear her family left behind in germany would suffer the consequences if she refused . an unusually muscular replacement bergmann , played in the film by young german actress karoline herfurth , returned to germany and broke the german high-jump record ahead of the olympics . but just days before the start of the 1936 olympics , the nazis barred bergmann , a favorite for gold , from the games , saying her performances had n't been satisfactory .
the nazis wanted to ensure that hitler would not be embarrassed by a jewish athlete winning a gold medal for germany . the dramatic turnabout came after the ship carrying us athletes had set sail for germany .
by way of consolation , bergmann was given a spectator 's ticket . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bergmann 's competition in the film is a fictional character based on ratjen the nazis replaced bergmann with " aryan " athletes elfriede kaun and dora ratjen .
the two won third and fourth place respectively in the high-jump .
but two years later , it emerged that ratjen , who had a deep , gruff voice , was in fact male . in 1938 , still posing as a woman , ratjen set a new world high jump record for women of 1.70m - but was disqualified after a doctor discovered that he had strapped up his genitals .
he was stripped of his title , his performances were expunged from the records , and he was quickly conscripted into the army . the film shows bergmann 's trainer waldmann , played by popular german actor axel prahl , being replaced by a nazi loyalist who brings in a manly-looking athlete to replace high-jumper bergmann . the film does n't just show how bergmann was discriminated against and sidelined but also touches on how she becomes friends with ratjen .
it portrays ratjen as a tormented person who knows that he is not a woman but tries fearfully to hide the fact . a scene in the film shows actress herfurth coming upon marie ketteler , a fictional character based on dora ratjen and played by actor sebastian urzendowsky , in the shower and discovering that she is a man . bergmann : " i had no idea " in reality , it is not clear whether the nazis were aware that dora ratjen was in fact " hermann " ratjen .
bergmann , who emigrated to the united states in 1937 and still lives there , said she herself had no idea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film shows the athletes - seen here at berlin 's olympic stadium - becoming friends " i never suspected anything , " the now 95-year-old told the german news magazine der spiegel .
" we all wondered why she never appeared naked in the shower .
to be so shy at the age of 17 seemed grotesque .
but we just thought : well , she 's weird , she 's strange . " the film is interspersed with interviews with the real gretel bergmann .
the 25-year-old herfurth , hailed as an upcoming acting star in germany , is reported to have trained for a year to perfect her form for the long-jumping scenes . the film 's germany premiere , held in berlin in august , coincided with the row over the gender of south african athlete caster semenya , which marred the world athletics championships in the very stadium where the 1936 olympics were held . cheated of gold ? after emigrating to the united states , bergmann went on to win several more high-jumping titles .
she vowed never to return to germany again or speak the language . but more than 60 years later , bergmann did return to germany .
in 1999 , she accepted a prestigious award in frankfurt that recognized her sporting achievements .
and she made a second trip to her hometown laupheim in southwestern germany when a stadium there was named after her . but bergmann said she remains certain that she was cheated of an olympic gold medal by the nazis . " i would have won gold , nothing less , " she told der spiegel .
" i wanted to show to the germans and to the world that jews were not these terrible people , not fat , ugly and disgusting as were people , " she said . " i wanted to show that a jewish girl could beat the germans .

but what can the eu do to alleviate child poverty ?
guidelines are available , but it 's mostly down to individual countries . the fight against child poverty in the eu is , first and foremost , a matter for individual states .
yet following the lisbon strategy , a development plan set out by the european council in 2000 , eu governments have promised to place children at the center of political dealings .
furthermore , the european commission has set out criteria defining child poverty , how it arises , spreads and how it can be combated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty can lead to social exclusion for many children the most recent report on child poverty by the commission was published in february 2008 ; in other words , before the financial crisis began .
the figures are likely to have worsened in the meantime .
then 19 million children in the eu were classified as poor , on average every fifth child .
the eu defines poor as earning 60 percent of the average income in each respective member state .
for a family in germany with two children , that means 1,600 euros -lrb- $ 2,300 -rrb- per month .
poverty impacts all areas of life the eu is keen to stress , however , that this does not just mean money as a means to consume , rather that child poverty takes away access to education -lrb- and therefore a good start in life -rrb- , damages health and excludes youngsters from a large part of cultural and social life .
that is another point brussels stresses : child poverty is a negative economic factor for each country .
it 's not just about sympathy and justice , but rather that economic policy should have a vested interest in nurturing and supporting children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployed parents are the greatest cause of child poverty the eu commission is especially concerned about unemployment .
out-of-work parents are the biggest cause of child poverty .
this leads to a vicious cycle that is hard to escape .
negative factors in families suffering from unemployment are often passed down from generation to generation .
according to the report , immigrant families are most at risk .
they suffer not only disproportionately from difficult financial circumstances , but also their children experience social and cultural exclusion .
policy solutions are the key the eu recommends to individual states a host of social , economic and cultural policies , including active employment and childcare policies , financial aid for families and integrated education and health policies .
and it has lauded the european states that lead in the fight against child poverty .
the scandinavian countries , the netherlands , austria , cyprus and slovenia all came out favorably in the commission 's report - in other words , not just rich countries .
they received praise for their comprehensive policies as the relatively high level and effectiveness of their welfare systems ran parallel with active employment policies and good childcare options .
italy , britain and spain came out the worst , with germany somewhere in the middle .

but what can the eu do to alleviate child poverty ?
guidelines are available , but it 's mostly down to individual countries . the fight against child poverty in the eu is , first and foremost , a matter for individual states .
yet following the lisbon strategy , a development plan set out by the european council in 2000 , eu governments have promised to place children at the center of political dealings .
furthermore , the european commission has set out criteria defining child poverty , how it arises , spreads and how it can be combated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty can lead to social exclusion for many children the most recent report on child poverty by the commission was published in february 2008 ; in other words , before the financial crisis began .
the figures are likely to have worsened in the meantime .
then 19 million children in the eu were classified as poor , on average every fifth child .
the eu defines poor as earning 60 percent of the average income in each respective member state .
for a family in germany with two children , that means 1,600 euros -lrb- $ 2,300 -rrb- per month .
poverty impacts all areas of life the eu is keen to stress , however , that this does not just mean money as a means to consume , rather that child poverty takes away access to education -lrb- and therefore a good start in life -rrb- , damages health and excludes youngsters from a large part of cultural and social life .
that is another point brussels stresses : child poverty is a negative economic factor for each country .
it 's not just about sympathy and justice , but rather that economic policy should have a vested interest in nurturing and supporting children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployed parents are the greatest cause of child poverty the eu commission is especially concerned about unemployment .
out-of-work parents are the biggest cause of child poverty .
this leads to a vicious cycle that is hard to escape .
negative factors in families suffering from unemployment are often passed down from generation to generation .
according to the report , immigrant families are most at risk .
they suffer not only disproportionately from difficult financial circumstances , but also their children experience social and cultural exclusion .
policy solutions are the key the eu recommends to individual states a host of social , economic and cultural policies , including active employment and childcare policies , financial aid for families and integrated education and health policies .
and it has lauded the european states that lead in the fight against child poverty .
the scandinavian countries , the netherlands , austria , cyprus and slovenia all came out favorably in the commission 's report - in other words , not just rich countries .
they received praise for their comprehensive policies as the relatively high level and effectiveness of their welfare systems ran parallel with active employment policies and good childcare options .
italy , britain and spain came out the worst , with germany somewhere in the middle .

but what can the eu do to alleviate child poverty ?
guidelines are available , but it 's mostly down to individual countries . the fight against child poverty in the eu is , first and foremost , a matter for individual states .
yet following the lisbon strategy , a development plan set out by the european council in 2000 , eu governments have promised to place children at the center of political dealings .
furthermore , the european commission has set out criteria defining child poverty , how it arises , spreads and how it can be combated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty can lead to social exclusion for many children the most recent report on child poverty by the commission was published in february 2008 ; in other words , before the financial crisis began .
the figures are likely to have worsened in the meantime .
then 19 million children in the eu were classified as poor , on average every fifth child .
the eu defines poor as earning 60 percent of the average income in each respective member state .
for a family in germany with two children , that means 1,600 euros -lrb- $ 2,300 -rrb- per month .
poverty impacts all areas of life the eu is keen to stress , however , that this does not just mean money as a means to consume , rather that child poverty takes away access to education -lrb- and therefore a good start in life -rrb- , damages health and excludes youngsters from a large part of cultural and social life .
that is another point brussels stresses : child poverty is a negative economic factor for each country .
it 's not just about sympathy and justice , but rather that economic policy should have a vested interest in nurturing and supporting children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployed parents are the greatest cause of child poverty the eu commission is especially concerned about unemployment .
out-of-work parents are the biggest cause of child poverty .
this leads to a vicious cycle that is hard to escape .
negative factors in families suffering from unemployment are often passed down from generation to generation .
according to the report , immigrant families are most at risk .
they suffer not only disproportionately from difficult financial circumstances , but also their children experience social and cultural exclusion .
policy solutions are the key the eu recommends to individual states a host of social , economic and cultural policies , including active employment and childcare policies , financial aid for families and integrated education and health policies .
and it has lauded the european states that lead in the fight against child poverty .
the scandinavian countries , the netherlands , austria , cyprus and slovenia all came out favorably in the commission 's report - in other words , not just rich countries .
they received praise for their comprehensive policies as the relatively high level and effectiveness of their welfare systems ran parallel with active employment policies and good childcare options .
italy , britain and spain came out the worst , with germany somewhere in the middle .

the politician said that under the administration of long-term cdu chancellor helmut kohl germany 's research ministry demanded in a 1983 letter that the federal agency responsible for the findings on gorleben alter them .
gabriel said scientists had warned that gorleben might prove to be a bad long-term storage site for the waste and that other locations should be explored .
these warnings , however , were ignored because certain conservative politicians allegedly used their influence .

" should the evaluation show that something is not order , we will have to reassess the situation , " said vater , adding that it would take time to comb through the 80 to 90 folders .
he criticized the timing of the revelation , which was made by the daily sueddeutsche zeitung in its wednesday edition .
after gathering dust for more than a quarter of century , the controversial files have now surfaced just three weeks ahead of federal elections .

vater said .

a message on the popular website said that the clip had been removed " due to terms of violation , " without giving any further details .
the spot , which was produced by the hamburg-based advertizing agency " das comitee " and launched by the aids awareness group regenbogen last week , runs just over 90 seconds .
it shows a couple having sex in a murky room .
to begin with , the focus is on body parts gliding over white bed sheets combined with the occasional shot of the woman 's face .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this poster is similar to the final scene of the ad as the proceedings begin to reach a climax , the camera zooms in on the man , who suddenly lifts his head .
his face is that of nazi leader adolf hitler .
the spot ends with the sentence : " aids is a mass murderer .
protect yourself . "
the ad has provoked outrage among aids groups and jewish organizations who have slammed the spot as being tasteless .
" the disgusting spot ... derides the victims of national socialism and compares people suffering from hiv to mass murderers , " said carsten schatz , the chairman of deutsche aids hilfe , germany 's main hiv / aids charity .
schatz also criticized the video for not giving information on how to protect oneself against hiv or other sexually transmitted diseases .
the spot 's originators said they could not understand what all the fuss was about .
they have apologized , but are unwilling to take the campaign spot offline - the video is still available at www.aids-is-a-mass-murderer.com.
" we never intended to depict those who suffer from aids or hiv as mass murderers .
we wanted to give a face to the disease , " said regenbogen 's jan schwertner .
bildunterschrift : the dictators josef stalin , left , and saddam hussein also feature in the campaign " the campaign was designed to make people sit up and get the issue back on the agenda and stop the trend toward unprotected sexual intercourse , " the group said in a statement on its website .
the anti-aids campaign includes posters of soviet and iraqi dictators josef stalin and saddam hussein in naked embraces with women and underlined with the slogan " aids is a mass murderer .

but two-thirds of germans say they do n't want to be immunized . in the latest step to fight an anticipated breakout of the h1n1 swine flu virus , germany 's 16 state health ministers have announced they plan to order another 18 million vaccination units .
that 's enough to immunize nine million more people and ensures there is enough stock should demand surge later in the year .
the health ministers have already ordered 50 million swine flu vaccinations for 25 million people , as each person requires two doses of the vaccine .
that means there will be enough vaccine to cover 40 percent of the german population .
the latest order is subject to funding being available .

eighty-two percent of germans said that swine flu poses a " fairly low " or " very low " danger .
bavarians , in germany 's south , in particular rejected vaccination .
only nine percent said they would " definitely " go to their doctor to be immunized compared to 14 percent of germans on average .
it 's a different picture in eastern germany , where almost a quarter of those who took part in the study said they were " definitely " going to get immunized .

montgomery also questioned whether the risks of vaccinating outweigh those of actually getting swine flu .

but two-thirds of germans say they do n't want to be immunized . in the latest step to fight an anticipated breakout of the h1n1 swine flu virus , germany 's 16 state health ministers have announced they plan to order another 18 million vaccination units .
that 's enough to immunize nine million more people and ensures there is enough stock should demand surge later in the year .
the health ministers have already ordered 50 million swine flu vaccinations for 25 million people , as each person requires two doses of the vaccine .
that means there will be enough vaccine to cover 40 percent of the german population .
the latest order is subject to funding being available .
the thorny question of who will bear the cost of this – the federal government , the health insurers , the state health departments or local authorities – is being discussed at a special working group meeting in berlin on wednesday .
two-thirds reject swine flu immunization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans are not convinced that swine flu is a threat a new study conducted by the forsa institute for dak , one of germany 's largest health insurers , revealed that a surprising number of germans do not plan to get immunized .
in the study of 1,001 people aged between 18 and 60 years , 62 percent said they would " definitely not , " or " almost definitely not " let themselves be vaccinated this autumn when the first swine flu vaccines become available .
eighty-two percent of germans said that swine flu poses a " fairly low " or " very low " danger .
bavarians , in germany 's south , in particular rejected vaccination .
only nine percent said they would " definitely " go to their doctor to be immunized compared to 14 percent of germans on average .
it 's a different picture in eastern germany , where almost a quarter of those who took part in the study said they were " definitely " going to get immunized .
" if the situation changes in the next few weeks , than we expect the number of people prepared to vaccinate themselves to increase sharply , " said horst boelle , the director of the claims department at dak .

montgomery also questioned whether the risks of vaccinating outweigh those of actually getting swine flu .
swine flu is highly infectious but it produces fairly mild symptoms and no one in germany has died of it so far .
" the disease could take a turn for the worse , and claim its first fatalities , " said deputy health minister klaus theo schroeder .
" i have the impression that we are now able to do that which we need to do in the next few weeks , " he added .

joerg tauss maintains his innocence , saying he was conducting research . state prosecutors in the southern city of karlsruhe accuse tauss of having acquired , distributed , and possessed child pornography 102 times between may 2007 and january 2009 .
an investigation was carried out earlier this year after evidence was found in tauss ' office , including mobile phone pictures and dvds of underage sex .
but prosecutors could not press charges until parliament voted to repeal his immunity status , which happened on tuesday . fifty-six-year-old tauss is also accused of having shared child pornography with others via email in six cases , according to prosecutors .
the former spd politician has repeatedly denied the charges , insisting that he was merely conducting research as part of his efforts to break up a child pornography ring .
in response , prosecutors said investigators had found " no evidence of this claim . "
tauss resigned his position after the scandal broke and later joined the pirate party , a swedish-based group that advocates for more freedom on the internet .
he has resisted calls to step down from parliament .

joerg tauss maintains his innocence , saying he was conducting research . state prosecutors in the southern city of karlsruhe accuse tauss of having acquired , distributed , and possessed child pornography 102 times between may 2007 and january 2009 .
an investigation was carried out earlier this year after evidence was found in tauss ' office , including mobile phone pictures and dvds of underage sex .
but prosecutors could not press charges until parliament voted to repeal his immunity status , which happened on tuesday . fifty-six-year-old tauss is also accused of having shared child pornography with others via email in six cases , according to prosecutors .
the former spd politician has repeatedly denied the charges , insisting that he was merely conducting research as part of his efforts to break up a child pornography ring .
in response , prosecutors said investigators had found " no evidence of this claim . "
tauss resigned his position after the scandal broke and later joined the pirate party , a swedish-based group that advocates for more freedom on the internet .
he has resisted calls to step down from parliament .
tauss is expected to lose his seat in germany 's parliamentary elections on september 27. vj / ap / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after a german-ordered airstrike killed scores in kunduz last week , the left 's view is becoming more popular . the campaign signs for germany 's left party send a clear message : " out of afghanistan ! "
it 's a sentiment widely held by many germans and has increased since a german commander in afghanistan ordered an airstrike on two fuel tankers , hijacked by the taliban last week , that left scores of people dead , including civilians .
while the future of the 4,200 german troops currently deployed in afghanistan is a political issue , politicians from chancellor angela merkel 's ruling christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their coalition partner , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , say last week 's attack will not change government policy on afghanistan .
with the exception of the left party , the rest of germany 's major parties are in favor of continuing the country 's mission in afghanistan .
but the latest weekly election polls , released on wednesday , suggest that the attack may be influencing voters .
a survey by the forsa-institut shows an increase of four percentage points for the left party , to 14 percent , while an ifd allensbach poll gave the party a 2 percent increase over last week , to 11.5 percent .

in a meeting of the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , about the attacks on tuesday , left party co-leader oskar lafontaine reiterated his party 's stance .
" we want german troops out of afghanistan because we are firmly convinced that the mission does nothing for international security , nothing for peace and is not the way to counter international terrorism , " said lafontaine .
the former spd leader and finance minister under chancellor schroeder dismissed any talk of forming a coalition with the social democrats and green party .
" the social democrats and the greens still support our troops staying in afghanistan and we want to bring them home immediately .
so long as interests are diametrically opposed nobody needs to speculate about any coalition with the spd and greens after the sept .

" you can never stabilize afghanistan with an army , " one left party campaigner told deutsche welle .
" i understand that we have a huge problem in afghanistan and the taliban are not our friends - let that be clear !

the social democrats slipped similarly , to 21-22.5 percent .
their preferred coalition partners , the greens , polled 10-13 percent .

after a german-ordered airstrike killed scores in kunduz last week , the left 's view is becoming more popular . the campaign signs for germany 's left party send a clear message : " out of afghanistan ! "
it 's a sentiment widely held by many germans and has increased since a german commander in afghanistan ordered an airstrike on two fuel tankers , hijacked by the taliban last week , that left scores of people dead , including civilians .
while the future of the 4,200 german troops currently deployed in afghanistan is a political issue , politicians from chancellor angela merkel 's ruling christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their coalition partner , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , say last week 's attack will not change government policy on afghanistan .
with the exception of the left party , the rest of germany 's major parties are in favor of continuing the country 's mission in afghanistan .
but the latest weekly election polls , released on wednesday , suggest that the attack may be influencing voters .
a survey by the forsa-institut shows an increase of four percentage points for the left party , to 14 percent , while an ifd allensbach poll gave the party a 2 percent increase over last week , to 11.5 percent .
back in 2002 , german chancellor gerhard schroeder campaigned against the us-led iraq war and won re-election by the narrowest of margins , picking up many votes with his anti-war rhetoric .
lone voice for afghanistan withdrawal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last week 's nato airstrike may have boosted the left party the left is the only party in germany that 's taken a clear stance against the deployment of german soldiers in afghanistan .
in a meeting of the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , about the attacks on tuesday , left party co-leader oskar lafontaine reiterated his party 's stance .
" we want german troops out of afghanistan because we are firmly convinced that the mission does nothing for international security , nothing for peace and is not the way to counter international terrorism , " said lafontaine .
the former spd leader and finance minister under chancellor schroeder dismissed any talk of forming a coalition with the social democrats and green party .
" the social democrats and the greens still support our troops staying in afghanistan and we want to bring them home immediately .
so long as interests are diametrically opposed nobody needs to speculate about any coalition with the spd and greens after the sept .
27 election , " lafontaine said . supporters of the left party made their voices heard at a demonstration against the german involvement in afghanistan held at berlin 's brandenburg gate on tuesday .
" you can never stabilize afghanistan with an army , " one left party campaigner told deutsche welle .
" i understand that we have a huge problem in afghanistan and the taliban are not our friends - let that be clear !
but in the past eight years it 's only been about war and killing people and we have n't got anywhere . "
other parties slip in polls while the far-left are riding higher in the polls , the ruling christian democrats and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have dipped slightly .
the cdu received 35 percent in both surveys , dipping by 0.5-1 percent .
the cdu 's preferred coalition partners , the free democrats , brought in 13-14 percent , which would leave the two parties just shy of the required 50 percent majority needed to form a coalition .
the social democrats slipped similarly , to 21-22.5 percent .
their preferred coalition partners , the greens , polled 10-13 percent .
even if the left were included in a coalition with the spd and the greens , the current surveys indicate they would not have the necessary majority to form a government. mz / nrt / dpa / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 09.09.2009 new film focuses on olympics gender row in nazi germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian urzendowsky and karoline herfurth play two athletes in the film berlin ' 36 a new film set to open in germany this week tells the true but little-known story of how the nazis barred a female jewish high-jumper from the 1936 olympics and replaced her with a male athlete dressed as a woman . called " berlin ' 36 , " the film by german director kaspar heidelbach , tells the story of record-breaking jewish high-jumper gretel bergmann who fled nazi germany in 1933 and emigrated to britain . bergmann went on to win the british high-jumping title but was forced to return to germany in the run-up to the 1936 olympics in berlin .
the film shows how the nazis were put under pressure by the united states , which threatened to boycott the olympic games if germany failed to field any jewish athletes . in a bid to save face and get international respectability , the nazi leadership selected bergmann to participate in the games .
they made it clear her family left behind in germany would suffer the consequences if she refused . an unusually muscular replacement bergmann , played in the film by young german actress karoline herfurth , returned to germany and broke the german high-jump record ahead of the olympics . but just days before the start of the 1936 olympics , the nazis barred bergmann , a favorite for gold , from the games , saying her performances had n't been satisfactory .
the nazis wanted to ensure that hitler would not be embarrassed by a jewish athlete winning a gold medal for germany . the dramatic turnabout came after the ship carrying us athletes had set sail for germany .
by way of consolation , bergmann was given a spectator 's ticket . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bergmann 's competition in the film is a fictional character based on ratjen the nazis replaced bergmann with " aryan " athletes elfriede kaun and dora ratjen .
the two won third and fourth place respectively in the high-jump .
but two years later , it emerged that ratjen , who had a deep , gruff voice , was in fact male . in 1938 , still posing as a woman , ratjen set a new world high jump record for women of 1.70m - but was disqualified after a doctor discovered that he had strapped up his genitals .
he was stripped of his title , his performances were expunged from the records , and he was quickly conscripted into the army . the film shows bergmann 's trainer waldmann , played by popular german actor axel prahl , being replaced by a nazi loyalist who brings in a manly-looking athlete to replace high-jumper bergmann . the film does n't just show how bergmann was discriminated against and sidelined but also touches on how she becomes friends with ratjen .
it portrays ratjen as a tormented person who knows that he is not a woman but tries fearfully to hide the fact . a scene in the film shows actress herfurth coming upon marie ketteler , a fictional character based on dora ratjen and played by actor sebastian urzendowsky , in the shower and discovering that she is a man . bergmann : " i had no idea " in reality , it is not clear whether the nazis were aware that dora ratjen was in fact " hermann " ratjen .
bergmann , who emigrated to the united states in 1937 and still lives there , said she herself had no idea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film shows the athletes - seen here at berlin 's olympic stadium - becoming friends " i never suspected anything , " the now 95-year-old told the german news magazine der spiegel .
" we all wondered why she never appeared naked in the shower .
to be so shy at the age of 17 seemed grotesque .
but we just thought : well , she 's weird , she 's strange . " the film is interspersed with interviews with the real gretel bergmann .
the 25-year-old herfurth , hailed as an upcoming acting star in germany , is reported to have trained for a year to perfect her form for the long-jumping scenes . the film 's germany premiere , held in berlin in august , coincided with the row over the gender of south african athlete caster semenya , which marred the world athletics championships in the very stadium where the 1936 olympics were held . cheated of gold ? after emigrating to the united states , bergmann went on to win several more high-jumping titles .
she vowed never to return to germany again or speak the language . but more than 60 years later , bergmann did return to germany .
in 1999 , she accepted a prestigious award in frankfurt that recognized her sporting achievements .
and she made a second trip to her hometown laupheim in southwestern germany when a stadium there was named after her . but bergmann said she remains certain that she was cheated of an olympic gold medal by the nazis . " i would have won gold , nothing less , " she told der spiegel .
" i wanted to show to the germans and to the world that jews were not these terrible people , not fat , ugly and disgusting as were people , " she said . " i wanted to show that a jewish girl could beat the germans .
in front of 10,000 people . " the film " berlin 36 " opens across cinemas in germany on sept .

experts believe european models may help him formulate a system which will work for americans . healthcare reform has become obama 's top domestic priority in recent months as millions of americans look to their president to make good on one of his key pledges in his election campaign .
the pressure on obama to overhaul the country 's $ 2.5 trillion -lrb- 1.7 trillion euros -rrb- healthcare system is intensifying as he prepares to address congress on sept .
9 to outline his latest vision and gears himself for what could turn out to be a bitter battle between democrats and republicans set to a background of public skepticism .
healthcare experts believe that obama has no other choice but to press on with his ambitious plans .
few believe that he will be able to achieve all that he has promised .
at the same time they say he ca n't afford to abandon his plans with so much public opinion and political currency at stake .
" obama wo n't abandon his plans , he simply ca n't afford to , " uwe reinhardt , professor for healthcare economics at princeton university told deutsche welle .
" he ca n't do all the things he said he could do .
the most he can do this year is to make sure that of the 47 million uninsured people in the us , maybe 20 million will be helped to get insurance . "
claus wendt , project director at the mannheim center for european social policy research , agrees that a solution must be found - and fast .
" obama has to do something , " wendt told deutsche welle .
" today , 16 percent of the total economy is spent on healthcare and this will only increase .
in ten years , it will be more than 20 percent .
take the situation with medicare , the insurance system for the elderly - it is very expensive .
if obama does nothing , then caring for the elderly will become even more costly as the population ages and this will be an even bigger burden on the economy . "
uninsured americans demand expensive healthcare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost 50 million americans have no healthcare cover in a country that prides itself on providing equal opportunities for all , it 's a shock to find that almost 50 million americans are without any type of healthcare .
yet that does n't stop them from making undue demands , according to professor reinhardt .
" americans do imagine themselves to have an enormous range of rights , " he said , " but at the same time they are skimpy on responsibility .
their thinking is that no one has the right to tell them to purchase insurance but when they 're sick and not insured they have the right to healthcare that may cost $ 200,000 .
i do n't think you would find that many germans to be so juvenile about it , " he said .
with such political and public pressure growing , obama will have to come up with a reform plan which brings both sides of the political spectrum together and eases the concerns of the american population .
with his critics citing all manner of evils from communism to nazi germany in their opposition to anything resembling public healthcare , obama needs to look for a model that the us can accept and one which will work in its complex healthcare arena .
both reinhardt and wendt believe obama should look towards europe when considering his next move .
european models offer compromise solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's model offers hope but is difficult politically " it was recently written in the new york times that the best model for the reform of the insurance system was that of germany , which does n't have a government-run plan but where there are private health funds , " reinhardt said .
" they compete but within a regulatory structure which makes that competition fair and humane .
" you could pick either the german system , the dutch system - even more so as they allow for profit-orientated insurance companies - or the swiss system , " he continued .
" all these systems are fairly similar in having a structured , regulated market for private insurers , either non-profit or profit-making . " " but i think a mixture of the dutch and german systems would be perfect for the insurance reform in the us , " he added . " it 's a shame that instead of having a rational discussion on the german system or taking a plane load of senators and congressmen and flying them over there , you have this shouting match over euthanasia , and pictures of hitler being waved about .
it has descended into quite an ugly scene . "
wendt agrees that that the german model is a political hot potato in the us and that the dutch healthcare system could provide obama with the compromise model he is looking for .
" i do n't think it 's a good idea to refer to the german model in the us for political reasons , " wendt said .
" in general , i would say that the german model in comparison to the us model is in quite good shape because germans have competition between different plans and the patients can choose between different plans and healthcare providers .
" but the dutch model might be a good option for the us , " he continued .
" this would show that a new healthcare system could be run through private organizations and as a publicly-run concern , which is a fear in some circles in the us .
the swiss model may also work as the insurance business is conducted by private organizations , and this could be implemented in the american healthcare system . "
obama needs to explain his plans , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is accused of not explaining his plans for health should obama choose to follow a european model or combine a number of them in a plan to suit the american healthcare landscape , he is going to have to sell it to the people , something many americans have accused the president of failing to do so far .
a cbs news poll recently said most americans think obama has not clearly explained his plans to overhaul the system .
" obama is a very intelligent man but i would not be surprised if he 's not that well informed on the european healthcare systems , " said reinhardt .
" the big mistake he has made is that he has n't been able to explain to people in simple terms what he wants to do and appeal to that big , broad centrist middle class .
and because it is a big unknown , everyone expects the worst .
you have educated , intelligent people like the catholic bishops believing that obama 's plan will lead to old people having their life-support systems turned off .
this information vacuum is president obama 's fault .
he should have taken hold of this issue much earlier . "

experts believe european models may help him formulate a system which will work for americans . healthcare reform has become obama 's top domestic priority in recent months as millions of americans look to their president to make good on one of his key pledges in his election campaign .
the pressure on obama to overhaul the country 's $ 2.5 trillion -lrb- 1.7 trillion euros -rrb- healthcare system is intensifying as he prepares to address congress on sept .
9 to outline his latest vision and gears himself for what could turn out to be a bitter battle between democrats and republicans set to a background of public skepticism .
healthcare experts believe that obama has no other choice but to press on with his ambitious plans .
few believe that he will be able to achieve all that he has promised .
at the same time they say he ca n't afford to abandon his plans with so much public opinion and political currency at stake .
" obama wo n't abandon his plans , he simply ca n't afford to , " uwe reinhardt , professor for healthcare economics at princeton university told deutsche welle .
" he ca n't do all the things he said he could do .
the most he can do this year is to make sure that of the 47 million uninsured people in the us , maybe 20 million will be helped to get insurance . "
claus wendt , project director at the mannheim center for european social policy research , agrees that a solution must be found - and fast .
" obama has to do something , " wendt told deutsche welle .
" today , 16 percent of the total economy is spent on healthcare and this will only increase .
in ten years , it will be more than 20 percent .
take the situation with medicare , the insurance system for the elderly - it is very expensive .
if obama does nothing , then caring for the elderly will become even more costly as the population ages and this will be an even bigger burden on the economy . "
uninsured americans demand expensive healthcare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost 50 million americans have no healthcare cover in a country that prides itself on providing equal opportunities for all , it 's a shock to find that almost 50 million americans are without any type of healthcare .
yet that does n't stop them from making undue demands , according to professor reinhardt .
" americans do imagine themselves to have an enormous range of rights , " he said , " but at the same time they are skimpy on responsibility .
their thinking is that no one has the right to tell them to purchase insurance but when they 're sick and not insured they have the right to healthcare that may cost $ 200,000 .
i do n't think you would find that many germans to be so juvenile about it , " he said .
with such political and public pressure growing , obama will have to come up with a reform plan which brings both sides of the political spectrum together and eases the concerns of the american population .
with his critics citing all manner of evils from communism to nazi germany in their opposition to anything resembling public healthcare , obama needs to look for a model that the us can accept and one which will work in its complex healthcare arena .
both reinhardt and wendt believe obama should look towards europe when considering his next move .
european models offer compromise solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's model offers hope but is difficult politically " it was recently written in the new york times that the best model for the reform of the insurance system was that of germany , which does n't have a government-run plan but where there are private health funds , " reinhardt said .
" they compete but within a regulatory structure which makes that competition fair and humane .
" you could pick either the german system , the dutch system - even more so as they allow for profit-orientated insurance companies - or the swiss system , " he continued .
" all these systems are fairly similar in having a structured , regulated market for private insurers , either non-profit or profit-making . " " but i think a mixture of the dutch and german systems would be perfect for the insurance reform in the us , " he added . " it 's a shame that instead of having a rational discussion on the german system or taking a plane load of senators and congressmen and flying them over there , you have this shouting match over euthanasia , and pictures of hitler being waved about .
it has descended into quite an ugly scene . "
wendt agrees that that the german model is a political hot potato in the us and that the dutch healthcare system could provide obama with the compromise model he is looking for .
" i do n't think it 's a good idea to refer to the german model in the us for political reasons , " wendt said .
" in general , i would say that the german model in comparison to the us model is in quite good shape because germans have competition between different plans and the patients can choose between different plans and healthcare providers .
" but the dutch model might be a good option for the us , " he continued .
" this would show that a new healthcare system could be run through private organizations and as a publicly-run concern , which is a fear in some circles in the us .
the swiss model may also work as the insurance business is conducted by private organizations , and this could be implemented in the american healthcare system . "
obama needs to explain his plans , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is accused of not explaining his plans for health should obama choose to follow a european model or combine a number of them in a plan to suit the american healthcare landscape , he is going to have to sell it to the people , something many americans have accused the president of failing to do so far .
a cbs news poll recently said most americans think obama has not clearly explained his plans to overhaul the system .
" obama is a very intelligent man but i would not be surprised if he 's not that well informed on the european healthcare systems , " said reinhardt .
" the big mistake he has made is that he has n't been able to explain to people in simple terms what he wants to do and appeal to that big , broad centrist middle class .
and because it is a big unknown , everyone expects the worst .
you have educated , intelligent people like the catholic bishops believing that obama 's plan will lead to old people having their life-support systems turned off .
this information vacuum is president obama 's fault .
he should have taken hold of this issue much earlier . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 09.09.2009 65 pct of china 's organ transplants come from executed prisoners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal organ transplants in china have boosted the so-called organ transplant tourism .
nearly two-thirds of china 's transplanted organs come from executed prisoners , the chinese state media reported last week .
in a bid to curb the illegal trade in human organs , the government has now launched an official organ donation scheme .
it hopes this will encourage people to become voluntary donors . the chinese vice minister of health , huang jiefu , announced that about 65 percent of the organs transplanted in chinese hospitals come from convicts put to death for various crimes .
china does not release any figures on the number of executions , but amnesty international estimates that over 1,700 prisoners were executed in 2008 , making china the world leader as far as the implementation of the death penalty is concerned . dr. wenyi wang is from the washington-based rights group doctors against forced organ harvesting , who graduated from a chinese medical school and saw the way organs are removed from the executed prisoners , explains : “ the surgeon who is the chief of the residence goes to the executive prisoner 's site where they execute the people by gunshot .
then they immediately transfer the prisoners into the room and extract the organs . ”
prisoners denied of basic rights some chinese officials however claim that the people condemned to die give written consent that they are willing to allow their organs to be donated .
dr. francis delmonico , advisory for human transplantation , of world health organization argues : “ not for a moment do i believe that this person is voluntarily giving .
here is a human reality that executions are now being fuelled by the need for human organs . ” the chinese traditionally believe that their body should be complete when they die so that it can be reincarnated for their next life without any physical disabilities .
this makes organ donation among ordinary chinese very much a taboo subject , even today .
so , china still relies heavily on organs taken from executed prisoners .
critics say that a lot of young people are being sentenced to death for what people in the west would regard as relatively minor offenses , just to keep the supply of organs moving .
dr. wenyi wang explains : “ the person i first met in dealing with executed prisoners , when i was an intern in surgery , was very young , 18 years old and healthy .
basically his crime was that he had raped a woman who happened to be the daughter of the governor of our hometown .
so they gave a phone call to the public security bureau and in three days , he was given the death sentence without any trial .
in china the executed prisoners are considered to be an enemy of the country and have no rights .
the government can do whatever it wants . ”
health hazards there are a lot of health hazards associated with taking organs from executed prisoners .
dr. francis delmonico explains : “ the person that ’ s being executed could have tuberculosis , hepatitis or other transmissible diseases that go by their being in the environment of the prison .
one of the hazards of obtaining an organ from someone that ’ s being executed is to not know what transmissible disease might come along with the organ . ”
but with the government 's new scheme for the donation of organs , experts believe the situation will improve and that it will become more difficult for foreigners to come to china from rich countries in order to get a transplant .
they also argue that international action should be taken to put an end to the illegal practice of transplant tourism .

in a bid to curb the illegal trade in human organs , the government has now launched an official organ donation scheme .
it hopes this will encourage people to become voluntary donors . the chinese vice minister of health , huang jiefu , announced that about 65 percent of the organs transplanted in chinese hospitals come from convicts put to death for various crimes .
china does not release any figures on the number of executions , but amnesty international estimates that over 1,700 prisoners were executed in 2008 , making china the world leader as far as the implementation of the death penalty is concerned . dr. wenyi wang is from the washington-based rights group doctors against forced organ harvesting , who graduated from a chinese medical school and saw the way organs are removed from the executed prisoners , explains : “ the surgeon who is the chief of the residence goes to the executive prisoner 's site where they execute the people by gunshot .
then they immediately transfer the prisoners into the room and extract the organs . ”
prisoners denied of basic rights some chinese officials however claim that the people condemned to die give written consent that they are willing to allow their organs to be donated .
dr. francis delmonico , advisory for human transplantation , of world health organization argues : “ not for a moment do i believe that this person is voluntarily giving .
here is a human reality that executions are now being fuelled by the need for human organs . ” the chinese traditionally believe that their body should be complete when they die so that it can be reincarnated for their next life without any physical disabilities .
this makes organ donation among ordinary chinese very much a taboo subject , even today .
so , china still relies heavily on organs taken from executed prisoners .
critics say that a lot of young people are being sentenced to death for what people in the west would regard as relatively minor offenses , just to keep the supply of organs moving .
dr. wenyi wang explains : “ the person i first met in dealing with executed prisoners , when i was an intern in surgery , was very young , 18 years old and healthy .
basically his crime was that he had raped a woman who happened to be the daughter of the governor of our hometown .
so they gave a phone call to the public security bureau and in three days , he was given the death sentence without any trial .
in china the executed prisoners are considered to be an enemy of the country and have no rights .
the government can do whatever it wants . ”
health hazards there are a lot of health hazards associated with taking organs from executed prisoners .
dr. francis delmonico explains : “ the person that ’ s being executed could have tuberculosis , hepatitis or other transmissible diseases that go by their being in the environment of the prison .
one of the hazards of obtaining an organ from someone that ’ s being executed is to not know what transmissible disease might come along with the organ . ”
but with the government 's new scheme for the donation of organs , experts believe the situation will improve and that it will become more difficult for foreigners to come to china from rich countries in order to get a transplant .
they also argue that international action should be taken to put an end to the illegal practice of transplant tourism .

nearly two-thirds of china 's transplanted organs come from executed prisoners , the chinese state media reported last week .
in a bid to curb the illegal trade in human organs , the government has now launched an official organ donation scheme .
it hopes this will encourage people to become voluntary donors . the chinese vice minister of health , huang jiefu , announced that about 65 percent of the organs transplanted in chinese hospitals come from convicts put to death for various crimes .
china does not release any figures on the number of executions , but amnesty international estimates that over 1,700 prisoners were executed in 2008 , making china the world leader as far as the implementation of the death penalty is concerned . dr. wenyi wang is from the washington-based rights group doctors against forced organ harvesting , who graduated from a chinese medical school and saw the way organs are removed from the executed prisoners , explains : “ the surgeon who is the chief of the residence goes to the executive prisoner 's site where they execute the people by gunshot .
then they immediately transfer the prisoners into the room and extract the organs . ”
prisoners denied of basic rights some chinese officials however claim that the people condemned to die give written consent that they are willing to allow their organs to be donated .
dr. francis delmonico , advisory for human transplantation , of world health organization argues : “ not for a moment do i believe that this person is voluntarily giving .
here is a human reality that executions are now being fuelled by the need for human organs . ” the chinese traditionally believe that their body should be complete when they die so that it can be reincarnated for their next life without any physical disabilities .
this makes organ donation among ordinary chinese very much a taboo subject , even today .
so , china still relies heavily on organs taken from executed prisoners .
critics say that a lot of young people are being sentenced to death for what people in the west would regard as relatively minor offenses , just to keep the supply of organs moving .
dr. wenyi wang explains : “ the person i first met in dealing with executed prisoners , when i was an intern in surgery , was very young , 18 years old and healthy .
basically his crime was that he had raped a woman who happened to be the daughter of the governor of our hometown .
so they gave a phone call to the public security bureau and in three days , he was given the death sentence without any trial .
in china the executed prisoners are considered to be an enemy of the country and have no rights .
the government can do whatever it wants . ”
health hazards there are a lot of health hazards associated with taking organs from executed prisoners .
dr. francis delmonico explains : “ the person that ’ s being executed could have tuberculosis , hepatitis or other transmissible diseases that go by their being in the environment of the prison .
one of the hazards of obtaining an organ from someone that ’ s being executed is to not know what transmissible disease might come along with the organ . ”
but with the government 's new scheme for the donation of organs , experts believe the situation will improve and that it will become more difficult for foreigners to come to china from rich countries in order to get a transplant .
they also argue that international action should be taken to put an end to the illegal practice of transplant tourism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 09.09.2009 65 pct of china 's organ transplants come from executed prisoners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal organ transplants in china have boosted the so-called organ transplant tourism .
nearly two-thirds of china 's transplanted organs come from executed prisoners , the chinese state media reported last week .
in a bid to curb the illegal trade in human organs , the government has now launched an official organ donation scheme .
it hopes this will encourage people to become voluntary donors . the chinese vice minister of health , huang jiefu , announced that about 65 percent of the organs transplanted in chinese hospitals come from convicts put to death for various crimes .
china does not release any figures on the number of executions , but amnesty international estimates that over 1,700 prisoners were executed in 2008 , making china the world leader as far as the implementation of the death penalty is concerned . dr. wenyi wang is from the washington-based rights group doctors against forced organ harvesting , who graduated from a chinese medical school and saw the way organs are removed from the executed prisoners , explains : “ the surgeon who is the chief of the residence goes to the executive prisoner 's site where they execute the people by gunshot .
then they immediately transfer the prisoners into the room and extract the organs . ”
prisoners denied of basic rights some chinese officials however claim that the people condemned to die give written consent that they are willing to allow their organs to be donated .
dr. francis delmonico , advisory for human transplantation , of world health organization argues : “ not for a moment do i believe that this person is voluntarily giving .
here is a human reality that executions are now being fuelled by the need for human organs . ” the chinese traditionally believe that their body should be complete when they die so that it can be reincarnated for their next life without any physical disabilities .
this makes organ donation among ordinary chinese very much a taboo subject , even today .
so , china still relies heavily on organs taken from executed prisoners .
critics say that a lot of young people are being sentenced to death for what people in the west would regard as relatively minor offenses , just to keep the supply of organs moving .
dr. wenyi wang explains : “ the person i first met in dealing with executed prisoners , when i was an intern in surgery , was very young , 18 years old and healthy .
basically his crime was that he had raped a woman who happened to be the daughter of the governor of our hometown .
so they gave a phone call to the public security bureau and in three days , he was given the death sentence without any trial .
in china the executed prisoners are considered to be an enemy of the country and have no rights .
the government can do whatever it wants . ”
health hazards there are a lot of health hazards associated with taking organs from executed prisoners .
dr. francis delmonico explains : “ the person that ’ s being executed could have tuberculosis , hepatitis or other transmissible diseases that go by their being in the environment of the prison .
one of the hazards of obtaining an organ from someone that ’ s being executed is to not know what transmissible disease might come along with the organ . ”
but with the government 's new scheme for the donation of organs , experts believe the situation will improve and that it will become more difficult for foreigners to come to china from rich countries in order to get a transplant .
they also argue that international action should be taken to put an end to the illegal practice of transplant tourism .

experts believe european models may help him formulate a system which will work for americans . healthcare reform has become obama 's top domestic priority in recent months as millions of americans look to their president to make good on one of his key pledges in his election campaign .
the pressure on obama to overhaul the country 's $ 2.5 trillion -lrb- 1.7 trillion euros -rrb- healthcare system is intensifying as he prepares to address congress on sept .
9 to outline his latest vision and gears himself for what could turn out to be a bitter battle between democrats and republicans set to a background of public skepticism .
healthcare experts believe that obama has no other choice but to press on with his ambitious plans .
few believe that he will be able to achieve all that he has promised .
at the same time they say he ca n't afford to abandon his plans with so much public opinion and political currency at stake .
" obama wo n't abandon his plans , he simply ca n't afford to , " uwe reinhardt , professor for healthcare economics at princeton university told deutsche welle .
" he ca n't do all the things he said he could do .
the most he can do this year is to make sure that of the 47 million uninsured people in the us , maybe 20 million will be helped to get insurance . "
claus wendt , project director at the mannheim center for european social policy research , agrees that a solution must be found - and fast .
" obama has to do something , " wendt told deutsche welle .
" today , 16 percent of the total economy is spent on healthcare and this will only increase .
in ten years , it will be more than 20 percent .
take the situation with medicare , the insurance system for the elderly - it is very expensive .
if obama does nothing , then caring for the elderly will become even more costly as the population ages and this will be an even bigger burden on the economy . "
uninsured americans demand expensive healthcare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost 50 million americans have no healthcare cover in a country that prides itself on providing equal opportunities for all , it 's a shock to find that almost 50 million americans are without any type of healthcare .
yet that does n't stop them from making undue demands , according to professor reinhardt .
" americans do imagine themselves to have an enormous range of rights , " he said , " but at the same time they are skimpy on responsibility .
their thinking is that no one has the right to tell them to purchase insurance but when they 're sick and not insured they have the right to healthcare that may cost $ 200,000 .
i do n't think you would find that many germans to be so juvenile about it , " he said .
with such political and public pressure growing , obama will have to come up with a reform plan which brings both sides of the political spectrum together and eases the concerns of the american population .
with his critics citing all manner of evils from communism to nazi germany in their opposition to anything resembling public healthcare , obama needs to look for a model that the us can accept and one which will work in its complex healthcare arena .
both reinhardt and wendt believe obama should look towards europe when considering his next move .
european models offer compromise solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's model offers hope but is difficult politically " it was recently written in the new york times that the best model for the reform of the insurance system was that of germany , which does n't have a government-run plan but where there are private health funds , " reinhardt said .
" they compete but within a regulatory structure which makes that competition fair and humane .
" you could pick either the german system , the dutch system - even more so as they allow for profit-orientated insurance companies - or the swiss system , " he continued .
" all these systems are fairly similar in having a structured , regulated market for private insurers , either non-profit or profit-making . " " but i think a mixture of the dutch and german systems would be perfect for the insurance reform in the us , " he added . " it 's a shame that instead of having a rational discussion on the german system or taking a plane load of senators and congressmen and flying them over there , you have this shouting match over euthanasia , and pictures of hitler being waved about .
it has descended into quite an ugly scene . "
wendt agrees that that the german model is a political hot potato in the us and that the dutch healthcare system could provide obama with the compromise model he is looking for .
" i do n't think it 's a good idea to refer to the german model in the us for political reasons , " wendt said .
" in general , i would say that the german model in comparison to the us model is in quite good shape because germans have competition between different plans and the patients can choose between different plans and healthcare providers .
" but the dutch model might be a good option for the us , " he continued .
" this would show that a new healthcare system could be run through private organizations and as a publicly-run concern , which is a fear in some circles in the us .
the swiss model may also work as the insurance business is conducted by private organizations , and this could be implemented in the american healthcare system . "
obama needs to explain his plans , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is accused of not explaining his plans for health should obama choose to follow a european model or combine a number of them in a plan to suit the american healthcare landscape , he is going to have to sell it to the people , something many americans have accused the president of failing to do so far .
a cbs news poll recently said most americans think obama has not clearly explained his plans to overhaul the system .
" obama is a very intelligent man but i would not be surprised if he 's not that well informed on the european healthcare systems , " said reinhardt .
" the big mistake he has made is that he has n't been able to explain to people in simple terms what he wants to do and appeal to that big , broad centrist middle class .
and because it is a big unknown , everyone expects the worst .
you have educated , intelligent people like the catholic bishops believing that obama 's plan will lead to old people having their life-support systems turned off .
this information vacuum is president obama 's fault .
he should have taken hold of this issue much earlier . "

obama needs to explain his plans , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is accused of not explaining his plans for health should obama choose to follow a european model or combine a number of them in a plan to suit the american healthcare landscape , he is going to have to sell it to the people , something many americans have accused the president of failing to do so far .
a cbs news poll recently said most americans think obama has not clearly explained his plans to overhaul the system .
" obama is a very intelligent man but i would not be surprised if he 's not that well informed on the european healthcare systems , " said reinhardt .
" the big mistake he has made is that he has n't been able to explain to people in simple terms what he wants to do and appeal to that big , broad centrist middle class .
and because it is a big unknown , everyone expects the worst .
you have educated , intelligent people like the catholic bishops believing that obama 's plan will lead to old people having their life-support systems turned off .

experts believe european models may help him formulate a system which will work for americans . healthcare reform has become obama 's top domestic priority in recent months as millions of americans look to their president to make good on one of his key pledges in his election campaign .
the pressure on obama to overhaul the country 's $ 2.5 trillion -lrb- 1.7 trillion euros -rrb- healthcare system is intensifying as he prepares to address congress on sept .
9 to outline his latest vision and gears himself for what could turn out to be a bitter battle between democrats and republicans set to a background of public skepticism .
healthcare experts believe that obama has no other choice but to press on with his ambitious plans .
few believe that he will be able to achieve all that he has promised .
at the same time they say he ca n't afford to abandon his plans with so much public opinion and political currency at stake .
" obama wo n't abandon his plans , he simply ca n't afford to , " uwe reinhardt , professor for healthcare economics at princeton university told deutsche welle .
" he ca n't do all the things he said he could do .
the most he can do this year is to make sure that of the 47 million uninsured people in the us , maybe 20 million will be helped to get insurance . "
claus wendt , project director at the mannheim center for european social policy research , agrees that a solution must be found - and fast .
" obama has to do something , " wendt told deutsche welle .
" today , 16 percent of the total economy is spent on healthcare and this will only increase .
in ten years , it will be more than 20 percent .
take the situation with medicare , the insurance system for the elderly - it is very expensive .
if obama does nothing , then caring for the elderly will become even more costly as the population ages and this will be an even bigger burden on the economy . "
uninsured americans demand expensive healthcare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost 50 million americans have no healthcare cover in a country that prides itself on providing equal opportunities for all , it 's a shock to find that almost 50 million americans are without any type of healthcare .
yet that does n't stop them from making undue demands , according to professor reinhardt .
" americans do imagine themselves to have an enormous range of rights , " he said , " but at the same time they are skimpy on responsibility .
their thinking is that no one has the right to tell them to purchase insurance but when they 're sick and not insured they have the right to healthcare that may cost $ 200,000 .
i do n't think you would find that many germans to be so juvenile about it , " he said .
with such political and public pressure growing , obama will have to come up with a reform plan which brings both sides of the political spectrum together and eases the concerns of the american population .
with his critics citing all manner of evils from communism to nazi germany in their opposition to anything resembling public healthcare , obama needs to look for a model that the us can accept and one which will work in its complex healthcare arena .
both reinhardt and wendt believe obama should look towards europe when considering his next move .
european models offer compromise solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's model offers hope but is difficult politically " it was recently written in the new york times that the best model for the reform of the insurance system was that of germany , which does n't have a government-run plan but where there are private health funds , " reinhardt said .
" they compete but within a regulatory structure which makes that competition fair and humane .
" you could pick either the german system , the dutch system - even more so as they allow for profit-orientated insurance companies - or the swiss system , " he continued .
" all these systems are fairly similar in having a structured , regulated market for private insurers , either non-profit or profit-making . " " but i think a mixture of the dutch and german systems would be perfect for the insurance reform in the us , " he added . " it 's a shame that instead of having a rational discussion on the german system or taking a plane load of senators and congressmen and flying them over there , you have this shouting match over euthanasia , and pictures of hitler being waved about .
it has descended into quite an ugly scene . "
wendt agrees that that the german model is a political hot potato in the us and that the dutch healthcare system could provide obama with the compromise model he is looking for .
" i do n't think it 's a good idea to refer to the german model in the us for political reasons , " wendt said .
" in general , i would say that the german model in comparison to the us model is in quite good shape because germans have competition between different plans and the patients can choose between different plans and healthcare providers .
" but the dutch model might be a good option for the us , " he continued .
" this would show that a new healthcare system could be run through private organizations and as a publicly-run concern , which is a fear in some circles in the us .
the swiss model may also work as the insurance business is conducted by private organizations , and this could be implemented in the american healthcare system . "

experts believe european models may help him formulate a system which will work for americans . healthcare reform has become obama 's top domestic priority in recent months as millions of americans look to their president to make good on one of his key pledges in his election campaign .
the pressure on obama to overhaul the country 's $ 2.5 trillion -lrb- 1.7 trillion euros -rrb- healthcare system is intensifying as he prepares to address congress on sept .
9 to outline his latest vision and gears himself for what could turn out to be a bitter battle between democrats and republicans set to a background of public skepticism .
healthcare experts believe that obama has no other choice but to press on with his ambitious plans .
few believe that he will be able to achieve all that he has promised .
at the same time they say he ca n't afford to abandon his plans with so much public opinion and political currency at stake .
" obama wo n't abandon his plans , he simply ca n't afford to , " uwe reinhardt , professor for healthcare economics at princeton university told deutsche welle .
" he ca n't do all the things he said he could do .
the most he can do this year is to make sure that of the 47 million uninsured people in the us , maybe 20 million will be helped to get insurance . "
claus wendt , project director at the mannheim center for european social policy research , agrees that a solution must be found - and fast .
" obama has to do something , " wendt told deutsche welle .
" today , 16 percent of the total economy is spent on healthcare and this will only increase .
in ten years , it will be more than 20 percent .
take the situation with medicare , the insurance system for the elderly - it is very expensive .
if obama does nothing , then caring for the elderly will become even more costly as the population ages and this will be an even bigger burden on the economy . "
uninsured americans demand expensive healthcare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost 50 million americans have no healthcare cover in a country that prides itself on providing equal opportunities for all , it 's a shock to find that almost 50 million americans are without any type of healthcare .
yet that does n't stop them from making undue demands , according to professor reinhardt .
" americans do imagine themselves to have an enormous range of rights , " he said , " but at the same time they are skimpy on responsibility .
their thinking is that no one has the right to tell them to purchase insurance but when they 're sick and not insured they have the right to healthcare that may cost $ 200,000 .
i do n't think you would find that many germans to be so juvenile about it , " he said .
with such political and public pressure growing , obama will have to come up with a reform plan which brings both sides of the political spectrum together and eases the concerns of the american population .
with his critics citing all manner of evils from communism to nazi germany in their opposition to anything resembling public healthcare , obama needs to look for a model that the us can accept and one which will work in its complex healthcare arena .
both reinhardt and wendt believe obama should look towards europe when considering his next move .
european models offer compromise solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's model offers hope but is difficult politically " it was recently written in the new york times that the best model for the reform of the insurance system was that of germany , which does n't have a government-run plan but where there are private health funds , " reinhardt said .
" they compete but within a regulatory structure which makes that competition fair and humane .
" you could pick either the german system , the dutch system - even more so as they allow for profit-orientated insurance companies - or the swiss system , " he continued .
" all these systems are fairly similar in having a structured , regulated market for private insurers , either non-profit or profit-making . " " but i think a mixture of the dutch and german systems would be perfect for the insurance reform in the us , " he added . " it 's a shame that instead of having a rational discussion on the german system or taking a plane load of senators and congressmen and flying them over there , you have this shouting match over euthanasia , and pictures of hitler being waved about .
it has descended into quite an ugly scene . "
wendt agrees that that the german model is a political hot potato in the us and that the dutch healthcare system could provide obama with the compromise model he is looking for .
" i do n't think it 's a good idea to refer to the german model in the us for political reasons , " wendt said .
" in general , i would say that the german model in comparison to the us model is in quite good shape because germans have competition between different plans and the patients can choose between different plans and healthcare providers .
" but the dutch model might be a good option for the us , " he continued .
" this would show that a new healthcare system could be run through private organizations and as a publicly-run concern , which is a fear in some circles in the us .
the swiss model may also work as the insurance business is conducted by private organizations , and this could be implemented in the american healthcare system . "
obama needs to explain his plans , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is accused of not explaining his plans for health should obama choose to follow a european model or combine a number of them in a plan to suit the american healthcare landscape , he is going to have to sell it to the people , something many americans have accused the president of failing to do so far .
a cbs news poll recently said most americans think obama has not clearly explained his plans to overhaul the system .
" obama is a very intelligent man but i would not be surprised if he 's not that well informed on the european healthcare systems , " said reinhardt .
" the big mistake he has made is that he has n't been able to explain to people in simple terms what he wants to do and appeal to that big , broad centrist middle class .
and because it is a big unknown , everyone expects the worst .
you have educated , intelligent people like the catholic bishops believing that obama 's plan will lead to old people having their life-support systems turned off .
this information vacuum is president obama 's fault .
he should have taken hold of this issue much earlier . "

claus wendt , project director at the mannheim center for european social policy research , agrees that a solution must be found - and fast .
" obama has to do something , " wendt told deutsche welle .
" today , 16 percent of the total economy is spent on healthcare and this will only increase .
in ten years , it will be more than 20 percent .
take the situation with medicare , the insurance system for the elderly - it is very expensive .
if obama does nothing , then caring for the elderly will become even more costly as the population ages and this will be an even bigger burden on the economy . "
uninsured americans demand expensive healthcare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost 50 million americans have no healthcare cover in a country that prides itself on providing equal opportunities for all , it 's a shock to find that almost 50 million americans are without any type of healthcare .
yet that does n't stop them from making undue demands , according to professor reinhardt .
" americans do imagine themselves to have an enormous range of rights , " he said , " but at the same time they are skimpy on responsibility .
their thinking is that no one has the right to tell them to purchase insurance but when they 're sick and not insured they have the right to healthcare that may cost $ 200,000 .
i do n't think you would find that many germans to be so juvenile about it , " he said .
with such political and public pressure growing , obama will have to come up with a reform plan which brings both sides of the political spectrum together and eases the concerns of the american population .
with his critics citing all manner of evils from communism to nazi germany in their opposition to anything resembling public healthcare , obama needs to look for a model that the us can accept and one which will work in its complex healthcare arena .
both reinhardt and wendt believe obama should look towards europe when considering his next move .
european models offer compromise solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's model offers hope but is difficult politically " it was recently written in the new york times that the best model for the reform of the insurance system was that of germany , which does n't have a government-run plan but where there are private health funds , " reinhardt said .
" they compete but within a regulatory structure which makes that competition fair and humane .
" you could pick either the german system , the dutch system - even more so as they allow for profit-orientated insurance companies - or the swiss system , " he continued .
" all these systems are fairly similar in having a structured , regulated market for private insurers , either non-profit or profit-making . " " but i think a mixture of the dutch and german systems would be perfect for the insurance reform in the us , " he added . " it 's a shame that instead of having a rational discussion on the german system or taking a plane load of senators and congressmen and flying them over there , you have this shouting match over euthanasia , and pictures of hitler being waved about .
it has descended into quite an ugly scene . "
wendt agrees that that the german model is a political hot potato in the us and that the dutch healthcare system could provide obama with the compromise model he is looking for .
" i do n't think it 's a good idea to refer to the german model in the us for political reasons , " wendt said .
" in general , i would say that the german model in comparison to the us model is in quite good shape because germans have competition between different plans and the patients can choose between different plans and healthcare providers .
" but the dutch model might be a good option for the us , " he continued .
" this would show that a new healthcare system could be run through private organizations and as a publicly-run concern , which is a fear in some circles in the us .
the swiss model may also work as the insurance business is conducted by private organizations , and this could be implemented in the american healthcare system . "
obama needs to explain his plans , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is accused of not explaining his plans for health should obama choose to follow a european model or combine a number of them in a plan to suit the american healthcare landscape , he is going to have to sell it to the people , something many americans have accused the president of failing to do so far .
a cbs news poll recently said most americans think obama has not clearly explained his plans to overhaul the system .
" obama is a very intelligent man but i would not be surprised if he 's not that well informed on the european healthcare systems , " said reinhardt .
" the big mistake he has made is that he has n't been able to explain to people in simple terms what he wants to do and appeal to that big , broad centrist middle class .
and because it is a big unknown , everyone expects the worst .
you have educated , intelligent people like the catholic bishops believing that obama 's plan will lead to old people having their life-support systems turned off .
this information vacuum is president obama 's fault .
he should have taken hold of this issue much earlier . "

experts believe european models may help him formulate a system which will work for americans . healthcare reform has become obama 's top domestic priority in recent months as millions of americans look to their president to make good on one of his key pledges in his election campaign .

experts believe european models may help him formulate a system which will work for americans . healthcare reform has become obama 's top domestic priority in recent months as millions of americans look to their president to make good on one of his key pledges in his election campaign .
the pressure on obama to overhaul the country 's $ 2.5 trillion -lrb- 1.7 trillion euros -rrb- healthcare system is intensifying as he prepares to address congress on sept .
9 to outline his latest vision and gears himself for what could turn out to be a bitter battle between democrats and republicans set to a background of public skepticism .
healthcare experts believe that obama has no other choice but to press on with his ambitious plans .
few believe that he will be able to achieve all that he has promised .
at the same time they say he ca n't afford to abandon his plans with so much public opinion and political currency at stake .
" obama wo n't abandon his plans , he simply ca n't afford to , " uwe reinhardt , professor for healthcare economics at princeton university told deutsche welle .
" he ca n't do all the things he said he could do .
the most he can do this year is to make sure that of the 47 million uninsured people in the us , maybe 20 million will be helped to get insurance . "
claus wendt , project director at the mannheim center for european social policy research , agrees that a solution must be found - and fast .
" obama has to do something , " wendt told deutsche welle .
" today , 16 percent of the total economy is spent on healthcare and this will only increase .
in ten years , it will be more than 20 percent .
take the situation with medicare , the insurance system for the elderly - it is very expensive .
if obama does nothing , then caring for the elderly will become even more costly as the population ages and this will be an even bigger burden on the economy . "
uninsured americans demand expensive healthcare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost 50 million americans have no healthcare cover in a country that prides itself on providing equal opportunities for all , it 's a shock to find that almost 50 million americans are without any type of healthcare .
yet that does n't stop them from making undue demands , according to professor reinhardt .
" americans do imagine themselves to have an enormous range of rights , " he said , " but at the same time they are skimpy on responsibility .
their thinking is that no one has the right to tell them to purchase insurance but when they 're sick and not insured they have the right to healthcare that may cost $ 200,000 .
i do n't think you would find that many germans to be so juvenile about it , " he said .
with such political and public pressure growing , obama will have to come up with a reform plan which brings both sides of the political spectrum together and eases the concerns of the american population .
with his critics citing all manner of evils from communism to nazi germany in their opposition to anything resembling public healthcare , obama needs to look for a model that the us can accept and one which will work in its complex healthcare arena .
both reinhardt and wendt believe obama should look towards europe when considering his next move .
european models offer compromise solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's model offers hope but is difficult politically " it was recently written in the new york times that the best model for the reform of the insurance system was that of germany , which does n't have a government-run plan but where there are private health funds , " reinhardt said .
" they compete but within a regulatory structure which makes that competition fair and humane .
" you could pick either the german system , the dutch system - even more so as they allow for profit-orientated insurance companies - or the swiss system , " he continued .
" all these systems are fairly similar in having a structured , regulated market for private insurers , either non-profit or profit-making . " " but i think a mixture of the dutch and german systems would be perfect for the insurance reform in the us , " he added . " it 's a shame that instead of having a rational discussion on the german system or taking a plane load of senators and congressmen and flying them over there , you have this shouting match over euthanasia , and pictures of hitler being waved about .
it has descended into quite an ugly scene . "
wendt agrees that that the german model is a political hot potato in the us and that the dutch healthcare system could provide obama with the compromise model he is looking for .
" i do n't think it 's a good idea to refer to the german model in the us for political reasons , " wendt said .
" in general , i would say that the german model in comparison to the us model is in quite good shape because germans have competition between different plans and the patients can choose between different plans and healthcare providers .
" but the dutch model might be a good option for the us , " he continued .
" this would show that a new healthcare system could be run through private organizations and as a publicly-run concern , which is a fear in some circles in the us .
the swiss model may also work as the insurance business is conducted by private organizations , and this could be implemented in the american healthcare system . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 09.09.2009 new film focuses on olympics gender row in nazi germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian urzendowsky and karoline herfurth play two athletes in the film berlin ' 36 a new film set to open in germany this week tells the true but little-known story of how the nazis barred a female jewish high-jumper from the 1936 olympics and replaced her with a male athlete dressed as a woman . called " berlin ' 36 , " the film by german director kaspar heidelbach , tells the story of record-breaking jewish high-jumper gretel bergmann who fled nazi germany in 1933 and emigrated to britain . bergmann went on to win the british high-jumping title but was forced to return to germany in the run-up to the 1936 olympics in berlin .
the film shows how the nazis were put under pressure by the united states , which threatened to boycott the olympic games if germany failed to field any jewish athletes . in a bid to save face and get international respectability , the nazi leadership selected bergmann to participate in the games .
they made it clear her family left behind in germany would suffer the consequences if she refused . an unusually muscular replacement bergmann , played in the film by young german actress karoline herfurth , returned to germany and broke the german high-jump record ahead of the olympics . but just days before the start of the 1936 olympics , the nazis barred bergmann , a favorite for gold , from the games , saying her performances had n't been satisfactory .
the nazis wanted to ensure that hitler would not be embarrassed by a jewish athlete winning a gold medal for germany . the dramatic turnabout came after the ship carrying us athletes had set sail for germany .
by way of consolation , bergmann was given a spectator 's ticket . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bergmann 's competition in the film is a fictional character based on ratjen the nazis replaced bergmann with " aryan " athletes elfriede kaun and dora ratjen .
the two won third and fourth place respectively in the high-jump .
but two years later , it emerged that ratjen , who had a deep , gruff voice , was in fact male . in 1938 , still posing as a woman , ratjen set a new world high jump record for women of 1.70m - but was disqualified after a doctor discovered that he had strapped up his genitals .
he was stripped of his title , his performances were expunged from the records , and he was quickly conscripted into the army . the film shows bergmann 's trainer waldmann , played by popular german actor axel prahl , being replaced by a nazi loyalist who brings in a manly-looking athlete to replace high-jumper bergmann . the film does n't just show how bergmann was discriminated against and sidelined but also touches on how she becomes friends with ratjen .
it portrays ratjen as a tormented person who knows that he is not a woman but tries fearfully to hide the fact . a scene in the film shows actress herfurth coming upon marie ketteler , a fictional character based on dora ratjen and played by actor sebastian urzendowsky , in the shower and discovering that she is a man . bergmann : " i had no idea " in reality , it is not clear whether the nazis were aware that dora ratjen was in fact " hermann " ratjen .
bergmann , who emigrated to the united states in 1937 and still lives there , said she herself had no idea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film shows the athletes - seen here at berlin 's olympic stadium - becoming friends " i never suspected anything , " the now 95-year-old told the german news magazine der spiegel .
" we all wondered why she never appeared naked in the shower .
to be so shy at the age of 17 seemed grotesque .
but we just thought : well , she 's weird , she 's strange . " the film is interspersed with interviews with the real gretel bergmann .

she vowed never to return to germany again or speak the language . but more than 60 years later , bergmann did return to germany .
in 1999 , she accepted a prestigious award in frankfurt that recognized her sporting achievements .
and she made a second trip to her hometown laupheim in southwestern germany when a stadium there was named after her . but bergmann said she remains certain that she was cheated of an olympic gold medal by the nazis . " i would have won gold , nothing less , " she told der spiegel .
" i wanted to show to the germans and to the world that jews were not these terrible people , not fat , ugly and disgusting as were people , " she said . " i wanted to show that a jewish girl could beat the germans .

the politician said that under the administration of long-term cdu chancellor helmut kohl germany 's research ministry demanded in a 1983 letter that the federal agency responsible for the findings on gorleben alter them .
gabriel said scientists had warned that gorleben might prove to be a bad long-term storage site for the waste and that other locations should be explored .
these warnings , however , were ignored because certain conservative politicians allegedly used their influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel 's spd seems to be off the hook since they were n't in government at the time according to the agency 's 1983 report there was a risk that radioactive substances could seep into the ground water .
this particular warning was eventually played down in the report .
" a downright scandal " the government of chancellor angela merkel , the current head of the cdu , has pledged a thorough check of all gorleben files , dating back to 1980s . " we will put all files on the table , " said deputy government spokesman klaus vater in berlin on wednesday .
" should the evaluation show that something is not order , we will have to reassess the situation , " said vater , adding that it would take time to comb through the 80 to 90 folders .
he criticized the timing of the revelation , which was made by the daily sueddeutsche zeitung in its wednesday edition .
after gathering dust for more than a quarter of century , the controversial files have now surfaced just three weeks ahead of federal elections .
" i do ask myself : did nobody ever take a look at these files ? "
vater said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl can expect new scrutiny of his government timely revelations ?
the deputy head of the cdu parliamentary group , katherina reiche , slammed the allegations as timely campaign diversions .
" the environment minister just wants one thing : campaigning rather than a solution to the issue of ultimate waste disposal .
gabriel 's sole aim is to discredit gorleben no matter whether it 's a suitable spot or not . "
reiche reiterated her party 's call for a " thorough investigation to ascertain whether gorleben is a suitable spot for the disposal of atomic waste . "
she accused gabriel of dodging this issue , hinting that the minister was doing so because he feared that an investigation could prove that gorleben was in fact a suitable spot for dumping the radioactive waste. cs / nk / dpa / reuters / afp / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after a german-ordered airstrike killed scores in kunduz last week , the left 's view is becoming more popular . the campaign signs for germany 's left party send a clear message : " out of afghanistan ! "
it 's a sentiment widely held by many germans and has increased since a german commander in afghanistan ordered an airstrike on two fuel tankers , hijacked by the taliban last week , that left scores of people dead , including civilians .
while the future of the 4,200 german troops currently deployed in afghanistan is a political issue , politicians from chancellor angela merkel 's ruling christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their coalition partner , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , say last week 's attack will not change government policy on afghanistan .
with the exception of the left party , the rest of germany 's major parties are in favor of continuing the country 's mission in afghanistan .
but the latest weekly election polls , released on wednesday , suggest that the attack may be influencing voters .
a survey by the forsa-institut shows an increase of four percentage points for the left party , to 14 percent , while an ifd allensbach poll gave the party a 2 percent increase over last week , to 11.5 percent .

in a meeting of the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , about the attacks on tuesday , left party co-leader oskar lafontaine reiterated his party 's stance .
" we want german troops out of afghanistan because we are firmly convinced that the mission does nothing for international security , nothing for peace and is not the way to counter international terrorism , " said lafontaine .
the former spd leader and finance minister under chancellor schroeder dismissed any talk of forming a coalition with the social democrats and green party .
" the social democrats and the greens still support our troops staying in afghanistan and we want to bring them home immediately .
so long as interests are diametrically opposed nobody needs to speculate about any coalition with the spd and greens after the sept .

" i understand that we have a huge problem in afghanistan and the taliban are not our friends - let that be clear !
but in the past eight years it 's only been about war and killing people and we have n't got anywhere . "
other parties slip in polls while the far-left are riding higher in the polls , the ruling christian democrats and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have dipped slightly .
the cdu received 35 percent in both surveys , dipping by 0.5-1 percent .

their preferred coalition partners , the greens , polled 10-13 percent .

while the future of the 4,200 german troops currently deployed in afghanistan is a political issue , politicians from chancellor angela merkel 's ruling christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their coalition partner , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , say last week 's attack will not change government policy on afghanistan .
with the exception of the left party , the rest of germany 's major parties are in favor of continuing the country 's mission in afghanistan .
but the latest weekly election polls , released on wednesday , suggest that the attack may be influencing voters .
a survey by the forsa-institut shows an increase of four percentage points for the left party , to 14 percent , while an ifd allensbach poll gave the party a 2 percent increase over last week , to 11.5 percent .
back in 2002 , german chancellor gerhard schroeder campaigned against the us-led iraq war and won re-election by the narrowest of margins , picking up many votes with his anti-war rhetoric .
lone voice for afghanistan withdrawal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last week 's nato airstrike may have boosted the left party the left is the only party in germany that 's taken a clear stance against the deployment of german soldiers in afghanistan .
in a meeting of the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , about the attacks on tuesday , left party co-leader oskar lafontaine reiterated his party 's stance .
" we want german troops out of afghanistan because we are firmly convinced that the mission does nothing for international security , nothing for peace and is not the way to counter international terrorism , " said lafontaine .
the former spd leader and finance minister under chancellor schroeder dismissed any talk of forming a coalition with the social democrats and green party .
" the social democrats and the greens still support our troops staying in afghanistan and we want to bring them home immediately .
so long as interests are diametrically opposed nobody needs to speculate about any coalition with the spd and greens after the sept .
27 election , " lafontaine said . supporters of the left party made their voices heard at a demonstration against the german involvement in afghanistan held at berlin 's brandenburg gate on tuesday .
" you can never stabilize afghanistan with an army , " one left party campaigner told deutsche welle .
" i understand that we have a huge problem in afghanistan and the taliban are not our friends - let that be clear !
but in the past eight years it 's only been about war and killing people and we have n't got anywhere . "
other parties slip in polls while the far-left are riding higher in the polls , the ruling christian democrats and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have dipped slightly .
the cdu received 35 percent in both surveys , dipping by 0.5-1 percent .
the cdu 's preferred coalition partners , the free democrats , brought in 13-14 percent , which would leave the two parties just shy of the required 50 percent majority needed to form a coalition .
the social democrats slipped similarly , to 21-22.5 percent .
their preferred coalition partners , the greens , polled 10-13 percent .
even if the left were included in a coalition with the spd and the greens , the current surveys indicate they would not have the necessary majority to form a government. mz / nrt / dpa / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the politician said that under the administration of long-term cdu chancellor helmut kohl germany 's research ministry demanded in a 1983 letter that the federal agency responsible for the findings on gorleben alter them .
gabriel said scientists had warned that gorleben might prove to be a bad long-term storage site for the waste and that other locations should be explored .
these warnings , however , were ignored because certain conservative politicians allegedly used their influence .

" should the evaluation show that something is not order , we will have to reassess the situation , " said vater , adding that it would take time to comb through the 80 to 90 folders .
he criticized the timing of the revelation , which was made by the daily sueddeutsche zeitung in its wednesday edition .

but what can the eu do to alleviate child poverty ?
guidelines are available , but it 's mostly down to individual countries . the fight against child poverty in the eu is , first and foremost , a matter for individual states .
yet following the lisbon strategy , a development plan set out by the european council in 2000 , eu governments have promised to place children at the center of political dealings .
furthermore , the european commission has set out criteria defining child poverty , how it arises , spreads and how it can be combated .

poverty impacts all areas of life the eu is keen to stress , however , that this does not just mean money as a means to consume , rather that child poverty takes away access to education -lrb- and therefore a good start in life -rrb- , damages health and excludes youngsters from a large part of cultural and social life .

negative factors in families suffering from unemployment are often passed down from generation to generation .
according to the report , immigrant families are most at risk .
they suffer not only disproportionately from difficult financial circumstances , but also their children experience social and cultural exclusion .
policy solutions are the key the eu recommends to individual states a host of social , economic and cultural policies , including active employment and childcare policies , financial aid for families and integrated education and health policies .
and it has lauded the european states that lead in the fight against child poverty .
the scandinavian countries , the netherlands , austria , cyprus and slovenia all came out favorably in the commission 's report - in other words , not just rich countries .

but what can the eu do to alleviate child poverty ?
guidelines are available , but it 's mostly down to individual countries . the fight against child poverty in the eu is , first and foremost , a matter for individual states .
yet following the lisbon strategy , a development plan set out by the european council in 2000 , eu governments have promised to place children at the center of political dealings .
furthermore , the european commission has set out criteria defining child poverty , how it arises , spreads and how it can be combated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty can lead to social exclusion for many children the most recent report on child poverty by the commission was published in february 2008 ; in other words , before the financial crisis began .
the figures are likely to have worsened in the meantime .
then 19 million children in the eu were classified as poor , on average every fifth child .
the eu defines poor as earning 60 percent of the average income in each respective member state .
for a family in germany with two children , that means 1,600 euros -lrb- $ 2,300 -rrb- per month .
poverty impacts all areas of life the eu is keen to stress , however , that this does not just mean money as a means to consume , rather that child poverty takes away access to education -lrb- and therefore a good start in life -rrb- , damages health and excludes youngsters from a large part of cultural and social life .
that is another point brussels stresses : child poverty is a negative economic factor for each country .
it 's not just about sympathy and justice , but rather that economic policy should have a vested interest in nurturing and supporting children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployed parents are the greatest cause of child poverty the eu commission is especially concerned about unemployment .
out-of-work parents are the biggest cause of child poverty .
this leads to a vicious cycle that is hard to escape .
negative factors in families suffering from unemployment are often passed down from generation to generation .
according to the report , immigrant families are most at risk .
they suffer not only disproportionately from difficult financial circumstances , but also their children experience social and cultural exclusion .
policy solutions are the key the eu recommends to individual states a host of social , economic and cultural policies , including active employment and childcare policies , financial aid for families and integrated education and health policies .
and it has lauded the european states that lead in the fight against child poverty .
the scandinavian countries , the netherlands , austria , cyprus and slovenia all came out favorably in the commission 's report - in other words , not just rich countries .
they received praise for their comprehensive policies as the relatively high level and effectiveness of their welfare systems ran parallel with active employment policies and good childcare options .
italy , britain and spain came out the worst , with germany somewhere in the middle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 09.09.2009 nuclear revelations contaminate german election campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors have opposed using gorleben for nuclear waste for years environment minister sigmar gabriel says new data proves that former chancellor helmut kohl 's government tampered with a report to play down the risks of a nuclear waste storage site . gabriel , a social democrat , on wednesday spoke of a " downright scandal " and said that new " records proved " that christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- politicians had in the 1980s manipulated assessments over the suitability of the gorleben salt mine in lower saxony as a permanent storage site for nuclear waste .
the politician said that under the administration of long-term cdu chancellor helmut kohl germany 's research ministry demanded in a 1983 letter that the federal agency responsible for the findings on gorleben alter them .
gabriel said scientists had warned that gorleben might prove to be a bad long-term storage site for the waste and that other locations should be explored .
these warnings , however , were ignored because certain conservative politicians allegedly used their influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel 's spd seems to be off the hook since they were n't in government at the time according to the agency 's 1983 report there was a risk that radioactive substances could seep into the ground water .
this particular warning was eventually played down in the report .
" a downright scandal " the government of chancellor angela merkel , the current head of the cdu , has pledged a thorough check of all gorleben files , dating back to 1980s . " we will put all files on the table , " said deputy government spokesman klaus vater in berlin on wednesday .
" should the evaluation show that something is not order , we will have to reassess the situation , " said vater , adding that it would take time to comb through the 80 to 90 folders .
he criticized the timing of the revelation , which was made by the daily sueddeutsche zeitung in its wednesday edition .
after gathering dust for more than a quarter of century , the controversial files have now surfaced just three weeks ahead of federal elections .
" i do ask myself : did nobody ever take a look at these files ? "
vater said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl can expect new scrutiny of his government timely revelations ?
the deputy head of the cdu parliamentary group , katherina reiche , slammed the allegations as timely campaign diversions .
" the environment minister just wants one thing : campaigning rather than a solution to the issue of ultimate waste disposal .
gabriel 's sole aim is to discredit gorleben no matter whether it 's a suitable spot or not . "
reiche reiterated her party 's call for a " thorough investigation to ascertain whether gorleben is a suitable spot for the disposal of atomic waste . "
she accused gabriel of dodging this issue , hinting that the minister was doing so because he feared that an investigation could prove that gorleben was in fact a suitable spot for dumping the radioactive waste. cs / nk / dpa / reuters / afp / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after a german-ordered airstrike killed scores in kunduz last week , the left 's view is becoming more popular . the campaign signs for germany 's left party send a clear message : " out of afghanistan ! "
it 's a sentiment widely held by many germans and has increased since a german commander in afghanistan ordered an airstrike on two fuel tankers , hijacked by the taliban last week , that left scores of people dead , including civilians .
while the future of the 4,200 german troops currently deployed in afghanistan is a political issue , politicians from chancellor angela merkel 's ruling christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their coalition partner , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , say last week 's attack will not change government policy on afghanistan .
with the exception of the left party , the rest of germany 's major parties are in favor of continuing the country 's mission in afghanistan .
but the latest weekly election polls , released on wednesday , suggest that the attack may be influencing voters .
a survey by the forsa-institut shows an increase of four percentage points for the left party , to 14 percent , while an ifd allensbach poll gave the party a 2 percent increase over last week , to 11.5 percent .
back in 2002 , german chancellor gerhard schroeder campaigned against the us-led iraq war and won re-election by the narrowest of margins , picking up many votes with his anti-war rhetoric .
lone voice for afghanistan withdrawal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last week 's nato airstrike may have boosted the left party the left is the only party in germany that 's taken a clear stance against the deployment of german soldiers in afghanistan .
in a meeting of the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , about the attacks on tuesday , left party co-leader oskar lafontaine reiterated his party 's stance .
" we want german troops out of afghanistan because we are firmly convinced that the mission does nothing for international security , nothing for peace and is not the way to counter international terrorism , " said lafontaine .
the former spd leader and finance minister under chancellor schroeder dismissed any talk of forming a coalition with the social democrats and green party .
" the social democrats and the greens still support our troops staying in afghanistan and we want to bring them home immediately .
so long as interests are diametrically opposed nobody needs to speculate about any coalition with the spd and greens after the sept .
27 election , " lafontaine said . supporters of the left party made their voices heard at a demonstration against the german involvement in afghanistan held at berlin 's brandenburg gate on tuesday .
" you can never stabilize afghanistan with an army , " one left party campaigner told deutsche welle .
" i understand that we have a huge problem in afghanistan and the taliban are not our friends - let that be clear !
but in the past eight years it 's only been about war and killing people and we have n't got anywhere . "
other parties slip in polls while the far-left are riding higher in the polls , the ruling christian democrats and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have dipped slightly .
the cdu received 35 percent in both surveys , dipping by 0.5-1 percent .
the cdu 's preferred coalition partners , the free democrats , brought in 13-14 percent , which would leave the two parties just shy of the required 50 percent majority needed to form a coalition .
the social democrats slipped similarly , to 21-22.5 percent .
their preferred coalition partners , the greens , polled 10-13 percent .
even if the left were included in a coalition with the spd and the greens , the current surveys indicate they would not have the necessary majority to form a government. mz / nrt / dpa / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's enough to immunize nine million more people and ensures there is enough stock should demand surge later in the year .
the health ministers have already ordered 50 million swine flu vaccinations for 25 million people , as each person requires two doses of the vaccine .
that means there will be enough vaccine to cover 40 percent of the german population .
the latest order is subject to funding being available .
the thorny question of who will bear the cost of this – the federal government , the health insurers , the state health departments or local authorities – is being discussed at a special working group meeting in berlin on wednesday .

eighty-two percent of germans said that swine flu poses a " fairly low " or " very low " danger .
bavarians , in germany 's south , in particular rejected vaccination .

but two-thirds of germans say they do n't want to be immunized . in the latest step to fight an anticipated breakout of the h1n1 swine flu virus , germany 's 16 state health ministers have announced they plan to order another 18 million vaccination units .
that 's enough to immunize nine million more people and ensures there is enough stock should demand surge later in the year .
the health ministers have already ordered 50 million swine flu vaccinations for 25 million people , as each person requires two doses of the vaccine .
that means there will be enough vaccine to cover 40 percent of the german population .
the latest order is subject to funding being available .
the thorny question of who will bear the cost of this – the federal government , the health insurers , the state health departments or local authorities – is being discussed at a special working group meeting in berlin on wednesday .
two-thirds reject swine flu immunization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans are not convinced that swine flu is a threat a new study conducted by the forsa institute for dak , one of germany 's largest health insurers , revealed that a surprising number of germans do not plan to get immunized .
in the study of 1,001 people aged between 18 and 60 years , 62 percent said they would " definitely not , " or " almost definitely not " let themselves be vaccinated this autumn when the first swine flu vaccines become available .
eighty-two percent of germans said that swine flu poses a " fairly low " or " very low " danger .
bavarians , in germany 's south , in particular rejected vaccination .
only nine percent said they would " definitely " go to their doctor to be immunized compared to 14 percent of germans on average .
it 's a different picture in eastern germany , where almost a quarter of those who took part in the study said they were " definitely " going to get immunized .
" if the situation changes in the next few weeks , than we expect the number of people prepared to vaccinate themselves to increase sharply , " said horst boelle , the director of the claims department at dak .

joerg tauss maintains his innocence , saying he was conducting research . state prosecutors in the southern city of karlsruhe accuse tauss of having acquired , distributed , and possessed child pornography 102 times between may 2007 and january 2009 .
an investigation was carried out earlier this year after evidence was found in tauss ' office , including mobile phone pictures and dvds of underage sex .
but prosecutors could not press charges until parliament voted to repeal his immunity status , which happened on tuesday . fifty-six-year-old tauss is also accused of having shared child pornography with others via email in six cases , according to prosecutors .
the former spd politician has repeatedly denied the charges , insisting that he was merely conducting research as part of his efforts to break up a child pornography ring .
in response , prosecutors said investigators had found " no evidence of this claim . "
tauss resigned his position after the scandal broke and later joined the pirate party , a swedish-based group that advocates for more freedom on the internet .
he has resisted calls to step down from parliament .

a message on the popular website said that the clip had been removed " due to terms of violation , " without giving any further details .
the spot , which was produced by the hamburg-based advertizing agency " das comitee " and launched by the aids awareness group regenbogen last week , runs just over 90 seconds .
it shows a couple having sex in a murky room .

his face is that of nazi leader adolf hitler .
the spot ends with the sentence : " aids is a mass murderer .
protect yourself . "
the ad has provoked outrage among aids groups and jewish organizations who have slammed the spot as being tasteless .
" the disgusting spot ... derides the victims of national socialism and compares people suffering from hiv to mass murderers , " said carsten schatz , the chairman of deutsche aids hilfe , germany 's main hiv / aids charity .
schatz also criticized the video for not giving information on how to protect oneself against hiv or other sexually transmitted diseases .
the spot 's originators said they could not understand what all the fuss was about .
they have apologized , but are unwilling to take the campaign spot offline - the video is still available at www.aids-is-a-mass-murderer.com.
" we never intended to depict those who suffer from aids or hiv as mass murderers .
we wanted to give a face to the disease , " said regenbogen 's jan schwertner .
bildunterschrift : the dictators josef stalin , left , and saddam hussein also feature in the campaign " the campaign was designed to make people sit up and get the issue back on the agenda and stop the trend toward unprotected sexual intercourse , " the group said in a statement on its website .

but critics say prohibiting them breaks eu rules and wo n't reduce their popularity . operators of internet betting sites in europe face an uncertain future after a recent european court ruling which allows governments to ban them as a way to crack down on crime .
the court case was brought on by a dispute between the portuguese government and bwin international ltd . , one of the largest online gambling operators in europe .
bwin sponsors some of europe 's most important football teams , such as bayern munich , real madrid and ac milan .
the company had been fined 74,500 euros -lrb- $ 106,765 -rrb- for offering its services in the country , which is against portuguese law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bwin says a ban on online gambling wo n't work according to the european court 's ruling , online bookmakers can be shut down in countries where the government holds exclusive rights to administering gambling activities , such as finland , greece , the netherlands and sweden .
germany banned online betting last year , and private german lottery companies ceased their operations at the beginning of 2009 .
only state-run betting and lotteries are now permitted . in its ruling , the european court cited the high-risk of fraud and criminal activity that often go hand-in-hand with online betting as a reason for its decision , adding that bookmakers who sponsor competitions could " influence the outcome of events . "
concerns about illicit gaming the head of the european lotteries association of state gaming organizations , friedrich stickler welcomed the ruling .
" you have to have a license in a country to operate , " stickler noted .
" for me it is the beginning of a new era in the internet gaming sector . "
however , bwin says they acted in compliance with eu rules granting unrestricted movement of capital within the 27-member bloc .
bwin director karin klein added that countries that block online betting companies " will end up with a huge black market . "
the european gaming and betting association 's legal expert siegbert alber said the ruling was " not fair " because it put bwin , " a serious provider " in the same category as " unscrupulous providers .

joerg tauss maintains his innocence , saying he was conducting research . state prosecutors in the southern city of karlsruhe accuse tauss of having acquired , distributed , and possessed child pornography 102 times between may 2007 and january 2009 .
an investigation was carried out earlier this year after evidence was found in tauss ' office , including mobile phone pictures and dvds of underage sex .
but prosecutors could not press charges until parliament voted to repeal his immunity status , which happened on tuesday . fifty-six-year-old tauss is also accused of having shared child pornography with others via email in six cases , according to prosecutors .
the former spd politician has repeatedly denied the charges , insisting that he was merely conducting research as part of his efforts to break up a child pornography ring .
in response , prosecutors said investigators had found " no evidence of this claim . "
tauss resigned his position after the scandal broke and later joined the pirate party , a swedish-based group that advocates for more freedom on the internet .
he has resisted calls to step down from parliament .
tauss is expected to lose his seat in germany 's parliamentary elections on september 27. vj / ap / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but what can the eu do to alleviate child poverty ?
guidelines are available , but it 's mostly down to individual countries . the fight against child poverty in the eu is , first and foremost , a matter for individual states .
yet following the lisbon strategy , a development plan set out by the european council in 2000 , eu governments have promised to place children at the center of political dealings .
furthermore , the european commission has set out criteria defining child poverty , how it arises , spreads and how it can be combated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty can lead to social exclusion for many children the most recent report on child poverty by the commission was published in february 2008 ; in other words , before the financial crisis began .
the figures are likely to have worsened in the meantime .
then 19 million children in the eu were classified as poor , on average every fifth child .
the eu defines poor as earning 60 percent of the average income in each respective member state .
for a family in germany with two children , that means 1,600 euros -lrb- $ 2,300 -rrb- per month .
poverty impacts all areas of life the eu is keen to stress , however , that this does not just mean money as a means to consume , rather that child poverty takes away access to education -lrb- and therefore a good start in life -rrb- , damages health and excludes youngsters from a large part of cultural and social life .
that is another point brussels stresses : child poverty is a negative economic factor for each country .
it 's not just about sympathy and justice , but rather that economic policy should have a vested interest in nurturing and supporting children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployed parents are the greatest cause of child poverty the eu commission is especially concerned about unemployment .
out-of-work parents are the biggest cause of child poverty .
this leads to a vicious cycle that is hard to escape .
negative factors in families suffering from unemployment are often passed down from generation to generation .
according to the report , immigrant families are most at risk .
they suffer not only disproportionately from difficult financial circumstances , but also their children experience social and cultural exclusion .
policy solutions are the key the eu recommends to individual states a host of social , economic and cultural policies , including active employment and childcare policies , financial aid for families and integrated education and health policies .
and it has lauded the european states that lead in the fight against child poverty .
the scandinavian countries , the netherlands , austria , cyprus and slovenia all came out favorably in the commission 's report - in other words , not just rich countries .
they received praise for their comprehensive policies as the relatively high level and effectiveness of their welfare systems ran parallel with active employment policies and good childcare options .
italy , britain and spain came out the worst , with germany somewhere in the middle .

a message on the popular website said that the clip had been removed " due to terms of violation , " without giving any further details .
the spot , which was produced by the hamburg-based advertizing agency " das comitee " and launched by the aids awareness group regenbogen last week , runs just over 90 seconds .
it shows a couple having sex in a murky room .
to begin with , the focus is on body parts gliding over white bed sheets combined with the occasional shot of the woman 's face .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this poster is similar to the final scene of the ad as the proceedings begin to reach a climax , the camera zooms in on the man , who suddenly lifts his head .
his face is that of nazi leader adolf hitler .
the spot ends with the sentence : " aids is a mass murderer .
protect yourself . "
the ad has provoked outrage among aids groups and jewish organizations who have slammed the spot as being tasteless .
" the disgusting spot ... derides the victims of national socialism and compares people suffering from hiv to mass murderers , " said carsten schatz , the chairman of deutsche aids hilfe , germany 's main hiv / aids charity .
schatz also criticized the video for not giving information on how to protect oneself against hiv or other sexually transmitted diseases .
the spot 's originators said they could not understand what all the fuss was about .
they have apologized , but are unwilling to take the campaign spot offline - the video is still available at www.aids-is-a-mass-murderer.com.
" we never intended to depict those who suffer from aids or hiv as mass murderers .
we wanted to give a face to the disease , " said regenbogen 's jan schwertner .
bildunterschrift : the dictators josef stalin , left , and saddam hussein also feature in the campaign " the campaign was designed to make people sit up and get the issue back on the agenda and stop the trend toward unprotected sexual intercourse , " the group said in a statement on its website .
the anti-aids campaign includes posters of soviet and iraqi dictators josef stalin and saddam hussein in naked embraces with women and underlined with the slogan " aids is a mass murderer .

we wanted to give a face to the disease , " said regenbogen 's jan schwertner .

joerg tauss maintains his innocence , saying he was conducting research . state prosecutors in the southern city of karlsruhe accuse tauss of having acquired , distributed , and possessed child pornography 102 times between may 2007 and january 2009 .
an investigation was carried out earlier this year after evidence was found in tauss ' office , including mobile phone pictures and dvds of underage sex .
but prosecutors could not press charges until parliament voted to repeal his immunity status , which happened on tuesday . fifty-six-year-old tauss is also accused of having shared child pornography with others via email in six cases , according to prosecutors .
the former spd politician has repeatedly denied the charges , insisting that he was merely conducting research as part of his efforts to break up a child pornography ring .
in response , prosecutors said investigators had found " no evidence of this claim . "
tauss resigned his position after the scandal broke and later joined the pirate party , a swedish-based group that advocates for more freedom on the internet .
he has resisted calls to step down from parliament .
tauss is expected to lose his seat in germany 's parliamentary elections on september 27. vj / ap / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 09.09.2009 the left party trumps with anti-war card in election campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left wants germany to get out of afghanistan the only party calling for an end to germany 's engagement in afghanistan has moved up in recent polls .
after a german-ordered airstrike killed scores in kunduz last week , the left 's view is becoming more popular . the campaign signs for germany 's left party send a clear message : " out of afghanistan ! "
it 's a sentiment widely held by many germans and has increased since a german commander in afghanistan ordered an airstrike on two fuel tankers , hijacked by the taliban last week , that left scores of people dead , including civilians .
while the future of the 4,200 german troops currently deployed in afghanistan is a political issue , politicians from chancellor angela merkel 's ruling christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their coalition partner , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , say last week 's attack will not change government policy on afghanistan .
with the exception of the left party , the rest of germany 's major parties are in favor of continuing the country 's mission in afghanistan .
but the latest weekly election polls , released on wednesday , suggest that the attack may be influencing voters .
a survey by the forsa-institut shows an increase of four percentage points for the left party , to 14 percent , while an ifd allensbach poll gave the party a 2 percent increase over last week , to 11.5 percent .
back in 2002 , german chancellor gerhard schroeder campaigned against the us-led iraq war and won re-election by the narrowest of margins , picking up many votes with his anti-war rhetoric .
lone voice for afghanistan withdrawal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last week 's nato airstrike may have boosted the left party the left is the only party in germany that 's taken a clear stance against the deployment of german soldiers in afghanistan .
in a meeting of the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , about the attacks on tuesday , left party co-leader oskar lafontaine reiterated his party 's stance .
" we want german troops out of afghanistan because we are firmly convinced that the mission does nothing for international security , nothing for peace and is not the way to counter international terrorism , " said lafontaine .
the former spd leader and finance minister under chancellor schroeder dismissed any talk of forming a coalition with the social democrats and green party .
" the social democrats and the greens still support our troops staying in afghanistan and we want to bring them home immediately .
so long as interests are diametrically opposed nobody needs to speculate about any coalition with the spd and greens after the sept .
27 election , " lafontaine said . supporters of the left party made their voices heard at a demonstration against the german involvement in afghanistan held at berlin 's brandenburg gate on tuesday .
" you can never stabilize afghanistan with an army , " one left party campaigner told deutsche welle .
" i understand that we have a huge problem in afghanistan and the taliban are not our friends - let that be clear !
but in the past eight years it 's only been about war and killing people and we have n't got anywhere . "
other parties slip in polls while the far-left are riding higher in the polls , the ruling christian democrats and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have dipped slightly .
the cdu received 35 percent in both surveys , dipping by 0.5-1 percent .
the cdu 's preferred coalition partners , the free democrats , brought in 13-14 percent , which would leave the two parties just shy of the required 50 percent majority needed to form a coalition .
the social democrats slipped similarly , to 21-22.5 percent .
their preferred coalition partners , the greens , polled 10-13 percent .
even if the left were included in a coalition with the spd and the greens , the current surveys indicate they would not have the necessary majority to form a government. mz / nrt / dpa / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de merkel defends german involvement in afghanistan german chancellor angela merkel has delivered a staunch defense of her country 's mission in afghanistan , following international and domestic uproar over last week 's deadly nato airstrike .

the film shows how the nazis were put under pressure by the united states , which threatened to boycott the olympic games if germany failed to field any jewish athletes . in a bid to save face and get international respectability , the nazi leadership selected bergmann to participate in the games .
they made it clear her family left behind in germany would suffer the consequences if she refused . an unusually muscular replacement bergmann , played in the film by young german actress karoline herfurth , returned to germany and broke the german high-jump record ahead of the olympics . but just days before the start of the 1936 olympics , the nazis barred bergmann , a favorite for gold , from the games , saying her performances had n't been satisfactory .
the nazis wanted to ensure that hitler would not be embarrassed by a jewish athlete winning a gold medal for germany . the dramatic turnabout came after the ship carrying us athletes had set sail for germany .
by way of consolation , bergmann was given a spectator 's ticket . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bergmann 's competition in the film is a fictional character based on ratjen the nazis replaced bergmann with " aryan " athletes elfriede kaun and dora ratjen .
the two won third and fourth place respectively in the high-jump .
but two years later , it emerged that ratjen , who had a deep , gruff voice , was in fact male . in 1938 , still posing as a woman , ratjen set a new world high jump record for women of 1.70m - but was disqualified after a doctor discovered that he had strapped up his genitals .
he was stripped of his title , his performances were expunged from the records , and he was quickly conscripted into the army . the film shows bergmann 's trainer waldmann , played by popular german actor axel prahl , being replaced by a nazi loyalist who brings in a manly-looking athlete to replace high-jumper bergmann . the film does n't just show how bergmann was discriminated against and sidelined but also touches on how she becomes friends with ratjen .
it portrays ratjen as a tormented person who knows that he is not a woman but tries fearfully to hide the fact . a scene in the film shows actress herfurth coming upon marie ketteler , a fictional character based on dora ratjen and played by actor sebastian urzendowsky , in the shower and discovering that she is a man . bergmann : " i had no idea " in reality , it is not clear whether the nazis were aware that dora ratjen was in fact " hermann " ratjen .
bergmann , who emigrated to the united states in 1937 and still lives there , said she herself had no idea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film shows the athletes - seen here at berlin 's olympic stadium - becoming friends " i never suspected anything , " the now 95-year-old told the german news magazine der spiegel .
" we all wondered why she never appeared naked in the shower .
to be so shy at the age of 17 seemed grotesque .
but we just thought : well , she 's weird , she 's strange . " the film is interspersed with interviews with the real gretel bergmann .
the 25-year-old herfurth , hailed as an upcoming acting star in germany , is reported to have trained for a year to perfect her form for the long-jumping scenes . the film 's germany premiere , held in berlin in august , coincided with the row over the gender of south african athlete caster semenya , which marred the world athletics championships in the very stadium where the 1936 olympics were held . cheated of gold ? after emigrating to the united states , bergmann went on to win several more high-jumping titles .
she vowed never to return to germany again or speak the language . but more than 60 years later , bergmann did return to germany .
in 1999 , she accepted a prestigious award in frankfurt that recognized her sporting achievements .
and she made a second trip to her hometown laupheim in southwestern germany when a stadium there was named after her . but bergmann said she remains certain that she was cheated of an olympic gold medal by the nazis . " i would have won gold , nothing less , " she told der spiegel .
" i wanted to show to the germans and to the world that jews were not these terrible people , not fat , ugly and disgusting as were people , " she said . " i wanted to show that a jewish girl could beat the germans .
in front of 10,000 people . " the film " berlin 36 " opens across cinemas in germany on sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 09.09.2009 the left party trumps with anti-war card in election campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left wants germany to get out of afghanistan the only party calling for an end to germany 's engagement in afghanistan has moved up in recent polls .
after a german-ordered airstrike killed scores in kunduz last week , the left 's view is becoming more popular . the campaign signs for germany 's left party send a clear message : " out of afghanistan ! "
it 's a sentiment widely held by many germans and has increased since a german commander in afghanistan ordered an airstrike on two fuel tankers , hijacked by the taliban last week , that left scores of people dead , including civilians .
while the future of the 4,200 german troops currently deployed in afghanistan is a political issue , politicians from chancellor angela merkel 's ruling christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their coalition partner , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , say last week 's attack will not change government policy on afghanistan .
with the exception of the left party , the rest of germany 's major parties are in favor of continuing the country 's mission in afghanistan .
but the latest weekly election polls , released on wednesday , suggest that the attack may be influencing voters .
a survey by the forsa-institut shows an increase of four percentage points for the left party , to 14 percent , while an ifd allensbach poll gave the party a 2 percent increase over last week , to 11.5 percent .
back in 2002 , german chancellor gerhard schroeder campaigned against the us-led iraq war and won re-election by the narrowest of margins , picking up many votes with his anti-war rhetoric .
lone voice for afghanistan withdrawal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last week 's nato airstrike may have boosted the left party the left is the only party in germany that 's taken a clear stance against the deployment of german soldiers in afghanistan .
in a meeting of the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , about the attacks on tuesday , left party co-leader oskar lafontaine reiterated his party 's stance .
" we want german troops out of afghanistan because we are firmly convinced that the mission does nothing for international security , nothing for peace and is not the way to counter international terrorism , " said lafontaine .
the former spd leader and finance minister under chancellor schroeder dismissed any talk of forming a coalition with the social democrats and green party .
" the social democrats and the greens still support our troops staying in afghanistan and we want to bring them home immediately .
so long as interests are diametrically opposed nobody needs to speculate about any coalition with the spd and greens after the sept .
27 election , " lafontaine said . supporters of the left party made their voices heard at a demonstration against the german involvement in afghanistan held at berlin 's brandenburg gate on tuesday .
" you can never stabilize afghanistan with an army , " one left party campaigner told deutsche welle .
" i understand that we have a huge problem in afghanistan and the taliban are not our friends - let that be clear !
but in the past eight years it 's only been about war and killing people and we have n't got anywhere . "
other parties slip in polls while the far-left are riding higher in the polls , the ruling christian democrats and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have dipped slightly .
the cdu received 35 percent in both surveys , dipping by 0.5-1 percent .
the cdu 's preferred coalition partners , the free democrats , brought in 13-14 percent , which would leave the two parties just shy of the required 50 percent majority needed to form a coalition .
the social democrats slipped similarly , to 21-22.5 percent .
their preferred coalition partners , the greens , polled 10-13 percent .
even if the left were included in a coalition with the spd and the greens , the current surveys indicate they would not have the necessary majority to form a government. mz / nrt / dpa / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the politician said that under the administration of long-term cdu chancellor helmut kohl germany 's research ministry demanded in a 1983 letter that the federal agency responsible for the findings on gorleben alter them .
gabriel said scientists had warned that gorleben might prove to be a bad long-term storage site for the waste and that other locations should be explored .
these warnings , however , were ignored because certain conservative politicians allegedly used their influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel 's spd seems to be off the hook since they were n't in government at the time according to the agency 's 1983 report there was a risk that radioactive substances could seep into the ground water .
this particular warning was eventually played down in the report .
" a downright scandal " the government of chancellor angela merkel , the current head of the cdu , has pledged a thorough check of all gorleben files , dating back to 1980s . " we will put all files on the table , " said deputy government spokesman klaus vater in berlin on wednesday .
" should the evaluation show that something is not order , we will have to reassess the situation , " said vater , adding that it would take time to comb through the 80 to 90 folders .
he criticized the timing of the revelation , which was made by the daily sueddeutsche zeitung in its wednesday edition .
after gathering dust for more than a quarter of century , the controversial files have now surfaced just three weeks ahead of federal elections .
" i do ask myself : did nobody ever take a look at these files ? "
vater said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl can expect new scrutiny of his government timely revelations ?
the deputy head of the cdu parliamentary group , katherina reiche , slammed the allegations as timely campaign diversions .
" the environment minister just wants one thing : campaigning rather than a solution to the issue of ultimate waste disposal .
gabriel 's sole aim is to discredit gorleben no matter whether it 's a suitable spot or not . "
reiche reiterated her party 's call for a " thorough investigation to ascertain whether gorleben is a suitable spot for the disposal of atomic waste . "
she accused gabriel of dodging this issue , hinting that the minister was doing so because he feared that an investigation could prove that gorleben was in fact a suitable spot for dumping the radioactive waste. cs / nk / dpa / reuters / afp / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the film shows how the nazis were put under pressure by the united states , which threatened to boycott the olympic games if germany failed to field any jewish athletes . in a bid to save face and get international respectability , the nazi leadership selected bergmann to participate in the games .
they made it clear her family left behind in germany would suffer the consequences if she refused . an unusually muscular replacement bergmann , played in the film by young german actress karoline herfurth , returned to germany and broke the german high-jump record ahead of the olympics . but just days before the start of the 1936 olympics , the nazis barred bergmann , a favorite for gold , from the games , saying her performances had n't been satisfactory .
the nazis wanted to ensure that hitler would not be embarrassed by a jewish athlete winning a gold medal for germany . the dramatic turnabout came after the ship carrying us athletes had set sail for germany .
by way of consolation , bergmann was given a spectator 's ticket . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bergmann 's competition in the film is a fictional character based on ratjen the nazis replaced bergmann with " aryan " athletes elfriede kaun and dora ratjen .
the two won third and fourth place respectively in the high-jump .
but two years later , it emerged that ratjen , who had a deep , gruff voice , was in fact male . in 1938 , still posing as a woman , ratjen set a new world high jump record for women of 1.70m - but was disqualified after a doctor discovered that he had strapped up his genitals .
he was stripped of his title , his performances were expunged from the records , and he was quickly conscripted into the army . the film shows bergmann 's trainer waldmann , played by popular german actor axel prahl , being replaced by a nazi loyalist who brings in a manly-looking athlete to replace high-jumper bergmann . the film does n't just show how bergmann was discriminated against and sidelined but also touches on how she becomes friends with ratjen .
it portrays ratjen as a tormented person who knows that he is not a woman but tries fearfully to hide the fact . a scene in the film shows actress herfurth coming upon marie ketteler , a fictional character based on dora ratjen and played by actor sebastian urzendowsky , in the shower and discovering that she is a man . bergmann : " i had no idea " in reality , it is not clear whether the nazis were aware that dora ratjen was in fact " hermann " ratjen .
bergmann , who emigrated to the united states in 1937 and still lives there , said she herself had no idea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film shows the athletes - seen here at berlin 's olympic stadium - becoming friends " i never suspected anything , " the now 95-year-old told the german news magazine der spiegel .
" we all wondered why she never appeared naked in the shower .
to be so shy at the age of 17 seemed grotesque .
but we just thought : well , she 's weird , she 's strange . " the film is interspersed with interviews with the real gretel bergmann .
the 25-year-old herfurth , hailed as an upcoming acting star in germany , is reported to have trained for a year to perfect her form for the long-jumping scenes . the film 's germany premiere , held in berlin in august , coincided with the row over the gender of south african athlete caster semenya , which marred the world athletics championships in the very stadium where the 1936 olympics were held . cheated of gold ? after emigrating to the united states , bergmann went on to win several more high-jumping titles .
she vowed never to return to germany again or speak the language . but more than 60 years later , bergmann did return to germany .
in 1999 , she accepted a prestigious award in frankfurt that recognized her sporting achievements .
and she made a second trip to her hometown laupheim in southwestern germany when a stadium there was named after her . but bergmann said she remains certain that she was cheated of an olympic gold medal by the nazis . " i would have won gold , nothing less , " she told der spiegel .
" i wanted to show to the germans and to the world that jews were not these terrible people , not fat , ugly and disgusting as were people , " she said . " i wanted to show that a jewish girl could beat the germans .
in front of 10,000 people . " the film " berlin 36 " opens across cinemas in germany on sept .

the politician said that under the administration of long-term cdu chancellor helmut kohl germany 's research ministry demanded in a 1983 letter that the federal agency responsible for the findings on gorleben alter them .
gabriel said scientists had warned that gorleben might prove to be a bad long-term storage site for the waste and that other locations should be explored .
these warnings , however , were ignored because certain conservative politicians allegedly used their influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel 's spd seems to be off the hook since they were n't in government at the time according to the agency 's 1983 report there was a risk that radioactive substances could seep into the ground water .
this particular warning was eventually played down in the report .
" a downright scandal " the government of chancellor angela merkel , the current head of the cdu , has pledged a thorough check of all gorleben files , dating back to 1980s . " we will put all files on the table , " said deputy government spokesman klaus vater in berlin on wednesday .
" should the evaluation show that something is not order , we will have to reassess the situation , " said vater , adding that it would take time to comb through the 80 to 90 folders .
he criticized the timing of the revelation , which was made by the daily sueddeutsche zeitung in its wednesday edition .
after gathering dust for more than a quarter of century , the controversial files have now surfaced just three weeks ahead of federal elections .
" i do ask myself : did nobody ever take a look at these files ? "
vater said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl can expect new scrutiny of his government timely revelations ?
the deputy head of the cdu parliamentary group , katherina reiche , slammed the allegations as timely campaign diversions .
" the environment minister just wants one thing : campaigning rather than a solution to the issue of ultimate waste disposal .
gabriel 's sole aim is to discredit gorleben no matter whether it 's a suitable spot or not . "
reiche reiterated her party 's call for a " thorough investigation to ascertain whether gorleben is a suitable spot for the disposal of atomic waste . "
she accused gabriel of dodging this issue , hinting that the minister was doing so because he feared that an investigation could prove that gorleben was in fact a suitable spot for dumping the radioactive waste. cs / nk / dpa / reuters / afp / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts believe european models may help him formulate a system which will work for americans . healthcare reform has become obama 's top domestic priority in recent months as millions of americans look to their president to make good on one of his key pledges in his election campaign .
the pressure on obama to overhaul the country 's $ 2.5 trillion -lrb- 1.7 trillion euros -rrb- healthcare system is intensifying as he prepares to address congress on sept .
9 to outline his latest vision and gears himself for what could turn out to be a bitter battle between democrats and republicans set to a background of public skepticism .
healthcare experts believe that obama has no other choice but to press on with his ambitious plans .
few believe that he will be able to achieve all that he has promised .
at the same time they say he ca n't afford to abandon his plans with so much public opinion and political currency at stake .
" obama wo n't abandon his plans , he simply ca n't afford to , " uwe reinhardt , professor for healthcare economics at princeton university told deutsche welle .
" he ca n't do all the things he said he could do .
the most he can do this year is to make sure that of the 47 million uninsured people in the us , maybe 20 million will be helped to get insurance . "
claus wendt , project director at the mannheim center for european social policy research , agrees that a solution must be found - and fast .
" obama has to do something , " wendt told deutsche welle .
" today , 16 percent of the total economy is spent on healthcare and this will only increase .
in ten years , it will be more than 20 percent .
take the situation with medicare , the insurance system for the elderly - it is very expensive .
if obama does nothing , then caring for the elderly will become even more costly as the population ages and this will be an even bigger burden on the economy . "
uninsured americans demand expensive healthcare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost 50 million americans have no healthcare cover in a country that prides itself on providing equal opportunities for all , it 's a shock to find that almost 50 million americans are without any type of healthcare .
yet that does n't stop them from making undue demands , according to professor reinhardt .
" americans do imagine themselves to have an enormous range of rights , " he said , " but at the same time they are skimpy on responsibility .
their thinking is that no one has the right to tell them to purchase insurance but when they 're sick and not insured they have the right to healthcare that may cost $ 200,000 .
i do n't think you would find that many germans to be so juvenile about it , " he said .
with such political and public pressure growing , obama will have to come up with a reform plan which brings both sides of the political spectrum together and eases the concerns of the american population .
with his critics citing all manner of evils from communism to nazi germany in their opposition to anything resembling public healthcare , obama needs to look for a model that the us can accept and one which will work in its complex healthcare arena .
both reinhardt and wendt believe obama should look towards europe when considering his next move .
european models offer compromise solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's model offers hope but is difficult politically " it was recently written in the new york times that the best model for the reform of the insurance system was that of germany , which does n't have a government-run plan but where there are private health funds , " reinhardt said .
" they compete but within a regulatory structure which makes that competition fair and humane .
" you could pick either the german system , the dutch system - even more so as they allow for profit-orientated insurance companies - or the swiss system , " he continued .
" all these systems are fairly similar in having a structured , regulated market for private insurers , either non-profit or profit-making . " " but i think a mixture of the dutch and german systems would be perfect for the insurance reform in the us , " he added . " it 's a shame that instead of having a rational discussion on the german system or taking a plane load of senators and congressmen and flying them over there , you have this shouting match over euthanasia , and pictures of hitler being waved about .
it has descended into quite an ugly scene . "
wendt agrees that that the german model is a political hot potato in the us and that the dutch healthcare system could provide obama with the compromise model he is looking for .
" i do n't think it 's a good idea to refer to the german model in the us for political reasons , " wendt said .
" in general , i would say that the german model in comparison to the us model is in quite good shape because germans have competition between different plans and the patients can choose between different plans and healthcare providers .
" but the dutch model might be a good option for the us , " he continued .
" this would show that a new healthcare system could be run through private organizations and as a publicly-run concern , which is a fear in some circles in the us .
the swiss model may also work as the insurance business is conducted by private organizations , and this could be implemented in the american healthcare system . "
obama needs to explain his plans , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is accused of not explaining his plans for health should obama choose to follow a european model or combine a number of them in a plan to suit the american healthcare landscape , he is going to have to sell it to the people , something many americans have accused the president of failing to do so far .
a cbs news poll recently said most americans think obama has not clearly explained his plans to overhaul the system .
" obama is a very intelligent man but i would not be surprised if he 's not that well informed on the european healthcare systems , " said reinhardt .
" the big mistake he has made is that he has n't been able to explain to people in simple terms what he wants to do and appeal to that big , broad centrist middle class .
and because it is a big unknown , everyone expects the worst .
you have educated , intelligent people like the catholic bishops believing that obama 's plan will lead to old people having their life-support systems turned off .
this information vacuum is president obama 's fault .
he should have taken hold of this issue much earlier . "

" americans do imagine themselves to have an enormous range of rights , " he said , " but at the same time they are skimpy on responsibility .
their thinking is that no one has the right to tell them to purchase insurance but when they 're sick and not insured they have the right to healthcare that may cost $ 200,000 .
i do n't think you would find that many germans to be so juvenile about it , " he said .
with such political and public pressure growing , obama will have to come up with a reform plan which brings both sides of the political spectrum together and eases the concerns of the american population .
with his critics citing all manner of evils from communism to nazi germany in their opposition to anything resembling public healthcare , obama needs to look for a model that the us can accept and one which will work in its complex healthcare arena .
both reinhardt and wendt believe obama should look towards europe when considering his next move .
european models offer compromise solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's model offers hope but is difficult politically " it was recently written in the new york times that the best model for the reform of the insurance system was that of germany , which does n't have a government-run plan but where there are private health funds , " reinhardt said .
" they compete but within a regulatory structure which makes that competition fair and humane .
" you could pick either the german system , the dutch system - even more so as they allow for profit-orientated insurance companies - or the swiss system , " he continued .
" all these systems are fairly similar in having a structured , regulated market for private insurers , either non-profit or profit-making . " " but i think a mixture of the dutch and german systems would be perfect for the insurance reform in the us , " he added . " it 's a shame that instead of having a rational discussion on the german system or taking a plane load of senators and congressmen and flying them over there , you have this shouting match over euthanasia , and pictures of hitler being waved about .
it has descended into quite an ugly scene . "
wendt agrees that that the german model is a political hot potato in the us and that the dutch healthcare system could provide obama with the compromise model he is looking for .
" i do n't think it 's a good idea to refer to the german model in the us for political reasons , " wendt said .
" in general , i would say that the german model in comparison to the us model is in quite good shape because germans have competition between different plans and the patients can choose between different plans and healthcare providers .
" but the dutch model might be a good option for the us , " he continued .
" this would show that a new healthcare system could be run through private organizations and as a publicly-run concern , which is a fear in some circles in the us .
the swiss model may also work as the insurance business is conducted by private organizations , and this could be implemented in the american healthcare system . "
obama needs to explain his plans , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is accused of not explaining his plans for health should obama choose to follow a european model or combine a number of them in a plan to suit the american healthcare landscape , he is going to have to sell it to the people , something many americans have accused the president of failing to do so far .
a cbs news poll recently said most americans think obama has not clearly explained his plans to overhaul the system .
" obama is a very intelligent man but i would not be surprised if he 's not that well informed on the european healthcare systems , " said reinhardt .
" the big mistake he has made is that he has n't been able to explain to people in simple terms what he wants to do and appeal to that big , broad centrist middle class .
and because it is a big unknown , everyone expects the worst .
you have educated , intelligent people like the catholic bishops believing that obama 's plan will lead to old people having their life-support systems turned off .
this information vacuum is president obama 's fault .
he should have taken hold of this issue much earlier . "

obama needs to explain his plans , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is accused of not explaining his plans for health should obama choose to follow a european model or combine a number of them in a plan to suit the american healthcare landscape , he is going to have to sell it to the people , something many americans have accused the president of failing to do so far .
a cbs news poll recently said most americans think obama has not clearly explained his plans to overhaul the system .
" obama is a very intelligent man but i would not be surprised if he 's not that well informed on the european healthcare systems , " said reinhardt .
" the big mistake he has made is that he has n't been able to explain to people in simple terms what he wants to do and appeal to that big , broad centrist middle class .
and because it is a big unknown , everyone expects the worst .
you have educated , intelligent people like the catholic bishops believing that obama 's plan will lead to old people having their life-support systems turned off .
this information vacuum is president obama 's fault .
he should have taken hold of this issue much earlier . "

nearly two-thirds of china 's transplanted organs come from executed prisoners , the chinese state media reported last week .
in a bid to curb the illegal trade in human organs , the government has now launched an official organ donation scheme .
it hopes this will encourage people to become voluntary donors . the chinese vice minister of health , huang jiefu , announced that about 65 percent of the organs transplanted in chinese hospitals come from convicts put to death for various crimes .
china does not release any figures on the number of executions , but amnesty international estimates that over 1,700 prisoners were executed in 2008 , making china the world leader as far as the implementation of the death penalty is concerned . dr. wenyi wang is from the washington-based rights group doctors against forced organ harvesting , who graduated from a chinese medical school and saw the way organs are removed from the executed prisoners , explains : “ the surgeon who is the chief of the residence goes to the executive prisoner 's site where they execute the people by gunshot .
then they immediately transfer the prisoners into the room and extract the organs . ”
prisoners denied of basic rights some chinese officials however claim that the people condemned to die give written consent that they are willing to allow their organs to be donated .
dr. francis delmonico , advisory for human transplantation , of world health organization argues : “ not for a moment do i believe that this person is voluntarily giving .
here is a human reality that executions are now being fuelled by the need for human organs . ” the chinese traditionally believe that their body should be complete when they die so that it can be reincarnated for their next life without any physical disabilities .
this makes organ donation among ordinary chinese very much a taboo subject , even today .
so , china still relies heavily on organs taken from executed prisoners .
critics say that a lot of young people are being sentenced to death for what people in the west would regard as relatively minor offenses , just to keep the supply of organs moving .
dr. wenyi wang explains : “ the person i first met in dealing with executed prisoners , when i was an intern in surgery , was very young , 18 years old and healthy .
basically his crime was that he had raped a woman who happened to be the daughter of the governor of our hometown .
so they gave a phone call to the public security bureau and in three days , he was given the death sentence without any trial .
in china the executed prisoners are considered to be an enemy of the country and have no rights .
the government can do whatever it wants . ”
health hazards there are a lot of health hazards associated with taking organs from executed prisoners .
dr. francis delmonico explains : “ the person that ’ s being executed could have tuberculosis , hepatitis or other transmissible diseases that go by their being in the environment of the prison .
one of the hazards of obtaining an organ from someone that ’ s being executed is to not know what transmissible disease might come along with the organ . ”
but with the government 's new scheme for the donation of organs , experts believe the situation will improve and that it will become more difficult for foreigners to come to china from rich countries in order to get a transplant .
they also argue that international action should be taken to put an end to the illegal practice of transplant tourism .

nearly two-thirds of china 's transplanted organs come from executed prisoners , the chinese state media reported last week .
in a bid to curb the illegal trade in human organs , the government has now launched an official organ donation scheme .
it hopes this will encourage people to become voluntary donors . the chinese vice minister of health , huang jiefu , announced that about 65 percent of the organs transplanted in chinese hospitals come from convicts put to death for various crimes .
china does not release any figures on the number of executions , but amnesty international estimates that over 1,700 prisoners were executed in 2008 , making china the world leader as far as the implementation of the death penalty is concerned . dr. wenyi wang is from the washington-based rights group doctors against forced organ harvesting , who graduated from a chinese medical school and saw the way organs are removed from the executed prisoners , explains : “ the surgeon who is the chief of the residence goes to the executive prisoner 's site where they execute the people by gunshot .
then they immediately transfer the prisoners into the room and extract the organs . ”
prisoners denied of basic rights some chinese officials however claim that the people condemned to die give written consent that they are willing to allow their organs to be donated .
dr. francis delmonico , advisory for human transplantation , of world health organization argues : “ not for a moment do i believe that this person is voluntarily giving .
here is a human reality that executions are now being fuelled by the need for human organs . ” the chinese traditionally believe that their body should be complete when they die so that it can be reincarnated for their next life without any physical disabilities .
this makes organ donation among ordinary chinese very much a taboo subject , even today .
so , china still relies heavily on organs taken from executed prisoners .
critics say that a lot of young people are being sentenced to death for what people in the west would regard as relatively minor offenses , just to keep the supply of organs moving .
dr. wenyi wang explains : “ the person i first met in dealing with executed prisoners , when i was an intern in surgery , was very young , 18 years old and healthy .
basically his crime was that he had raped a woman who happened to be the daughter of the governor of our hometown .
so they gave a phone call to the public security bureau and in three days , he was given the death sentence without any trial .
in china the executed prisoners are considered to be an enemy of the country and have no rights .
the government can do whatever it wants . ”
health hazards there are a lot of health hazards associated with taking organs from executed prisoners .
dr. francis delmonico explains : “ the person that ’ s being executed could have tuberculosis , hepatitis or other transmissible diseases that go by their being in the environment of the prison .
one of the hazards of obtaining an organ from someone that ’ s being executed is to not know what transmissible disease might come along with the organ . ”
but with the government 's new scheme for the donation of organs , experts believe the situation will improve and that it will become more difficult for foreigners to come to china from rich countries in order to get a transplant .
they also argue that international action should be taken to put an end to the illegal practice of transplant tourism .

the film shows how the nazis were put under pressure by the united states , which threatened to boycott the olympic games if germany failed to field any jewish athletes . in a bid to save face and get international respectability , the nazi leadership selected bergmann to participate in the games .
they made it clear her family left behind in germany would suffer the consequences if she refused . an unusually muscular replacement bergmann , played in the film by young german actress karoline herfurth , returned to germany and broke the german high-jump record ahead of the olympics . but just days before the start of the 1936 olympics , the nazis barred bergmann , a favorite for gold , from the games , saying her performances had n't been satisfactory .
the nazis wanted to ensure that hitler would not be embarrassed by a jewish athlete winning a gold medal for germany . the dramatic turnabout came after the ship carrying us athletes had set sail for germany .
by way of consolation , bergmann was given a spectator 's ticket . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bergmann 's competition in the film is a fictional character based on ratjen the nazis replaced bergmann with " aryan " athletes elfriede kaun and dora ratjen .
the two won third and fourth place respectively in the high-jump .
but two years later , it emerged that ratjen , who had a deep , gruff voice , was in fact male . in 1938 , still posing as a woman , ratjen set a new world high jump record for women of 1.70m - but was disqualified after a doctor discovered that he had strapped up his genitals .
he was stripped of his title , his performances were expunged from the records , and he was quickly conscripted into the army . the film shows bergmann 's trainer waldmann , played by popular german actor axel prahl , being replaced by a nazi loyalist who brings in a manly-looking athlete to replace high-jumper bergmann . the film does n't just show how bergmann was discriminated against and sidelined but also touches on how she becomes friends with ratjen .
it portrays ratjen as a tormented person who knows that he is not a woman but tries fearfully to hide the fact . a scene in the film shows actress herfurth coming upon marie ketteler , a fictional character based on dora ratjen and played by actor sebastian urzendowsky , in the shower and discovering that she is a man . bergmann : " i had no idea " in reality , it is not clear whether the nazis were aware that dora ratjen was in fact " hermann " ratjen .
bergmann , who emigrated to the united states in 1937 and still lives there , said she herself had no idea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film shows the athletes - seen here at berlin 's olympic stadium - becoming friends " i never suspected anything , " the now 95-year-old told the german news magazine der spiegel .
" we all wondered why she never appeared naked in the shower .
to be so shy at the age of 17 seemed grotesque .
but we just thought : well , she 's weird , she 's strange . " the film is interspersed with interviews with the real gretel bergmann .
the 25-year-old herfurth , hailed as an upcoming acting star in germany , is reported to have trained for a year to perfect her form for the long-jumping scenes . the film 's germany premiere , held in berlin in august , coincided with the row over the gender of south african athlete caster semenya , which marred the world athletics championships in the very stadium where the 1936 olympics were held . cheated of gold ? after emigrating to the united states , bergmann went on to win several more high-jumping titles .
she vowed never to return to germany again or speak the language . but more than 60 years later , bergmann did return to germany .
in 1999 , she accepted a prestigious award in frankfurt that recognized her sporting achievements .
and she made a second trip to her hometown laupheim in southwestern germany when a stadium there was named after her . but bergmann said she remains certain that she was cheated of an olympic gold medal by the nazis . " i would have won gold , nothing less , " she told der spiegel .
" i wanted to show to the germans and to the world that jews were not these terrible people , not fat , ugly and disgusting as were people , " she said . " i wanted to show that a jewish girl could beat the germans .
in front of 10,000 people . " the film " berlin 36 " opens across cinemas in germany on sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 09.09.2009 the left party trumps with anti-war card in election campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left wants germany to get out of afghanistan the only party calling for an end to germany 's engagement in afghanistan has moved up in recent polls .
after a german-ordered airstrike killed scores in kunduz last week , the left 's view is becoming more popular . the campaign signs for germany 's left party send a clear message : " out of afghanistan ! "
it 's a sentiment widely held by many germans and has increased since a german commander in afghanistan ordered an airstrike on two fuel tankers , hijacked by the taliban last week , that left scores of people dead , including civilians .
while the future of the 4,200 german troops currently deployed in afghanistan is a political issue , politicians from chancellor angela merkel 's ruling christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their coalition partner , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , say last week 's attack will not change government policy on afghanistan .
with the exception of the left party , the rest of germany 's major parties are in favor of continuing the country 's mission in afghanistan .
but the latest weekly election polls , released on wednesday , suggest that the attack may be influencing voters .
a survey by the forsa-institut shows an increase of four percentage points for the left party , to 14 percent , while an ifd allensbach poll gave the party a 2 percent increase over last week , to 11.5 percent .
back in 2002 , german chancellor gerhard schroeder campaigned against the us-led iraq war and won re-election by the narrowest of margins , picking up many votes with his anti-war rhetoric .
lone voice for afghanistan withdrawal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last week 's nato airstrike may have boosted the left party the left is the only party in germany that 's taken a clear stance against the deployment of german soldiers in afghanistan .
in a meeting of the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , about the attacks on tuesday , left party co-leader oskar lafontaine reiterated his party 's stance .
" we want german troops out of afghanistan because we are firmly convinced that the mission does nothing for international security , nothing for peace and is not the way to counter international terrorism , " said lafontaine .
the former spd leader and finance minister under chancellor schroeder dismissed any talk of forming a coalition with the social democrats and green party .
" the social democrats and the greens still support our troops staying in afghanistan and we want to bring them home immediately .

after a german-ordered airstrike killed scores in kunduz last week , the left 's view is becoming more popular . the campaign signs for germany 's left party send a clear message : " out of afghanistan ! "
it 's a sentiment widely held by many germans and has increased since a german commander in afghanistan ordered an airstrike on two fuel tankers , hijacked by the taliban last week , that left scores of people dead , including civilians .
while the future of the 4,200 german troops currently deployed in afghanistan is a political issue , politicians from chancellor angela merkel 's ruling christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their coalition partner , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , say last week 's attack will not change government policy on afghanistan .
with the exception of the left party , the rest of germany 's major parties are in favor of continuing the country 's mission in afghanistan .
but the latest weekly election polls , released on wednesday , suggest that the attack may be influencing voters .
a survey by the forsa-institut shows an increase of four percentage points for the left party , to 14 percent , while an ifd allensbach poll gave the party a 2 percent increase over last week , to 11.5 percent .

the politician said that under the administration of long-term cdu chancellor helmut kohl germany 's research ministry demanded in a 1983 letter that the federal agency responsible for the findings on gorleben alter them .
gabriel said scientists had warned that gorleben might prove to be a bad long-term storage site for the waste and that other locations should be explored .

the politician said that under the administration of long-term cdu chancellor helmut kohl germany 's research ministry demanded in a 1983 letter that the federal agency responsible for the findings on gorleben alter them .
gabriel said scientists had warned that gorleben might prove to be a bad long-term storage site for the waste and that other locations should be explored .
these warnings , however , were ignored because certain conservative politicians allegedly used their influence .

" should the evaluation show that something is not order , we will have to reassess the situation , " said vater , adding that it would take time to comb through the 80 to 90 folders .
he criticized the timing of the revelation , which was made by the daily sueddeutsche zeitung in its wednesday edition .
after gathering dust for more than a quarter of century , the controversial files have now surfaced just three weeks ahead of federal elections .
" i do ask myself : did nobody ever take a look at these files ? "
vater said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 09.09.2009 most germans do n't want swine flu vaccinations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is busy planning mass vaccinations the german government has ordered 18 million more vaccinations against swine flu .
but two-thirds of germans say they do n't want to be immunized . in the latest step to fight an anticipated breakout of the h1n1 swine flu virus , germany 's 16 state health ministers have announced they plan to order another 18 million vaccination units .
that 's enough to immunize nine million more people and ensures there is enough stock should demand surge later in the year .
the health ministers have already ordered 50 million swine flu vaccinations for 25 million people , as each person requires two doses of the vaccine .
that means there will be enough vaccine to cover 40 percent of the german population .
the latest order is subject to funding being available .
the thorny question of who will bear the cost of this – the federal government , the health insurers , the state health departments or local authorities – is being discussed at a special working group meeting in berlin on wednesday .
two-thirds reject swine flu immunization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans are not convinced that swine flu is a threat a new study conducted by the forsa institute for dak , one of germany 's largest health insurers , revealed that a surprising number of germans do not plan to get immunized .
in the study of 1,001 people aged between 18 and 60 years , 62 percent said they would " definitely not , " or " almost definitely not " let themselves be vaccinated this autumn when the first swine flu vaccines become available .
eighty-two percent of germans said that swine flu poses a " fairly low " or " very low " danger .
bavarians , in germany 's south , in particular rejected vaccination .
only nine percent said they would " definitely " go to their doctor to be immunized compared to 14 percent of germans on average .
it 's a different picture in eastern germany , where almost a quarter of those who took part in the study said they were " definitely " going to get immunized .
" if the situation changes in the next few weeks , than we expect the number of people prepared to vaccinate themselves to increase sharply , " said horst boelle , the director of the claims department at dak .
are vaccinations worth the risk ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german medical association urges a rethink the german medical association is urging the government to reassess its mass vaccinations plan , the largest such scheme in postwar history .
" many people have already had swine flu and never even noticed that had it , " said frank ulrich montgomery , the association 's vice president .
montgomery also questioned whether the risks of vaccinating outweigh those of actually getting swine flu .
swine flu is highly infectious but it produces fairly mild symptoms and no one in germany has died of it so far .
" the disease could take a turn for the worse , and claim its first fatalities , " said deputy health minister klaus theo schroeder .
" i have the impression that we are now able to do that which we need to do in the next few weeks , " he added .
the first vaccinations are expected to be available in october and more units will be delivered on a weekly basis .

but two-thirds of germans say they do n't want to be immunized . in the latest step to fight an anticipated breakout of the h1n1 swine flu virus , germany 's 16 state health ministers have announced they plan to order another 18 million vaccination units .
that 's enough to immunize nine million more people and ensures there is enough stock should demand surge later in the year .
the health ministers have already ordered 50 million swine flu vaccinations for 25 million people , as each person requires two doses of the vaccine .
that means there will be enough vaccine to cover 40 percent of the german population .
the latest order is subject to funding being available .

in the study of 1,001 people aged between 18 and 60 years , 62 percent said they would " definitely not , " or " almost definitely not " let themselves be vaccinated this autumn when the first swine flu vaccines become available .
eighty-two percent of germans said that swine flu poses a " fairly low " or " very low " danger .
bavarians , in germany 's south , in particular rejected vaccination .
only nine percent said they would " definitely " go to their doctor to be immunized compared to 14 percent of germans on average .
it 's a different picture in eastern germany , where almost a quarter of those who took part in the study said they were " definitely " going to get immunized .

his face is that of nazi leader adolf hitler .
the spot ends with the sentence : " aids is a mass murderer .
protect yourself . "
the ad has provoked outrage among aids groups and jewish organizations who have slammed the spot as being tasteless .
" the disgusting spot ... derides the victims of national socialism and compares people suffering from hiv to mass murderers , " said carsten schatz , the chairman of deutsche aids hilfe , germany 's main hiv / aids charity .
schatz also criticized the video for not giving information on how to protect oneself against hiv or other sexually transmitted diseases .
the spot 's originators said they could not understand what all the fuss was about .
they have apologized , but are unwilling to take the campaign spot offline - the video is still available at www.aids-is-a-mass-murderer.com.
" we never intended to depict those who suffer from aids or hiv as mass murderers .
we wanted to give a face to the disease , " said regenbogen 's jan schwertner .
bildunterschrift : the dictators josef stalin , left , and saddam hussein also feature in the campaign " the campaign was designed to make people sit up and get the issue back on the agenda and stop the trend toward unprotected sexual intercourse , " the group said in a statement on its website .
the anti-aids campaign includes posters of soviet and iraqi dictators josef stalin and saddam hussein in naked embraces with women and underlined with the slogan " aids is a mass murderer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 09.09.2009 new film focuses on olympics gender row in nazi germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian urzendowsky and karoline herfurth play two athletes in the film berlin ' 36 a new film set to open in germany this week tells the true but little-known story of how the nazis barred a female jewish high-jumper from the 1936 olympics and replaced her with a male athlete dressed as a woman . called " berlin ' 36 , " the film by german director kaspar heidelbach , tells the story of record-breaking jewish high-jumper gretel bergmann who fled nazi germany in 1933 and emigrated to britain . bergmann went on to win the british high-jumping title but was forced to return to germany in the run-up to the 1936 olympics in berlin .
the film shows how the nazis were put under pressure by the united states , which threatened to boycott the olympic games if germany failed to field any jewish athletes . in a bid to save face and get international respectability , the nazi leadership selected bergmann to participate in the games .
they made it clear her family left behind in germany would suffer the consequences if she refused . an unusually muscular replacement bergmann , played in the film by young german actress karoline herfurth , returned to germany and broke the german high-jump record ahead of the olympics . but just days before the start of the 1936 olympics , the nazis barred bergmann , a favorite for gold , from the games , saying her performances had n't been satisfactory .
the nazis wanted to ensure that hitler would not be embarrassed by a jewish athlete winning a gold medal for germany . the dramatic turnabout came after the ship carrying us athletes had set sail for germany .
by way of consolation , bergmann was given a spectator 's ticket . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bergmann 's competition in the film is a fictional character based on ratjen the nazis replaced bergmann with " aryan " athletes elfriede kaun and dora ratjen .
the two won third and fourth place respectively in the high-jump .
but two years later , it emerged that ratjen , who had a deep , gruff voice , was in fact male . in 1938 , still posing as a woman , ratjen set a new world high jump record for women of 1.70m - but was disqualified after a doctor discovered that he had strapped up his genitals .
he was stripped of his title , his performances were expunged from the records , and he was quickly conscripted into the army . the film shows bergmann 's trainer waldmann , played by popular german actor axel prahl , being replaced by a nazi loyalist who brings in a manly-looking athlete to replace high-jumper bergmann . the film does n't just show how bergmann was discriminated against and sidelined but also touches on how she becomes friends with ratjen .
it portrays ratjen as a tormented person who knows that he is not a woman but tries fearfully to hide the fact . a scene in the film shows actress herfurth coming upon marie ketteler , a fictional character based on dora ratjen and played by actor sebastian urzendowsky , in the shower and discovering that she is a man . bergmann : " i had no idea " in reality , it is not clear whether the nazis were aware that dora ratjen was in fact " hermann " ratjen .
bergmann , who emigrated to the united states in 1937 and still lives there , said she herself had no idea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film shows the athletes - seen here at berlin 's olympic stadium - becoming friends " i never suspected anything , " the now 95-year-old told the german news magazine der spiegel .
" we all wondered why she never appeared naked in the shower .
to be so shy at the age of 17 seemed grotesque .
but we just thought : well , she 's weird , she 's strange . " the film is interspersed with interviews with the real gretel bergmann .
the 25-year-old herfurth , hailed as an upcoming acting star in germany , is reported to have trained for a year to perfect her form for the long-jumping scenes . the film 's germany premiere , held in berlin in august , coincided with the row over the gender of south african athlete caster semenya , which marred the world athletics championships in the very stadium where the 1936 olympics were held . cheated of gold ? after emigrating to the united states , bergmann went on to win several more high-jumping titles .
she vowed never to return to germany again or speak the language . but more than 60 years later , bergmann did return to germany .
in 1999 , she accepted a prestigious award in frankfurt that recognized her sporting achievements .
and she made a second trip to her hometown laupheim in southwestern germany when a stadium there was named after her . but bergmann said she remains certain that she was cheated of an olympic gold medal by the nazis . " i would have won gold , nothing less , " she told der spiegel .
" i wanted to show to the germans and to the world that jews were not these terrible people , not fat , ugly and disgusting as were people , " she said . " i wanted to show that a jewish girl could beat the germans .
in front of 10,000 people . " the film " berlin 36 " opens across cinemas in germany on sept .

in a bid to curb the illegal trade in human organs , the government has now launched an official organ donation scheme .
it hopes this will encourage people to become voluntary donors . the chinese vice minister of health , huang jiefu , announced that about 65 percent of the organs transplanted in chinese hospitals come from convicts put to death for various crimes .
china does not release any figures on the number of executions , but amnesty international estimates that over 1,700 prisoners were executed in 2008 , making china the world leader as far as the implementation of the death penalty is concerned . dr. wenyi wang is from the washington-based rights group doctors against forced organ harvesting , who graduated from a chinese medical school and saw the way organs are removed from the executed prisoners , explains : “ the surgeon who is the chief of the residence goes to the executive prisoner 's site where they execute the people by gunshot .
then they immediately transfer the prisoners into the room and extract the organs . ”
prisoners denied of basic rights some chinese officials however claim that the people condemned to die give written consent that they are willing to allow their organs to be donated .
dr. francis delmonico , advisory for human transplantation , of world health organization argues : “ not for a moment do i believe that this person is voluntarily giving .
here is a human reality that executions are now being fuelled by the need for human organs . ” the chinese traditionally believe that their body should be complete when they die so that it can be reincarnated for their next life without any physical disabilities .
this makes organ donation among ordinary chinese very much a taboo subject , even today .
so , china still relies heavily on organs taken from executed prisoners .
critics say that a lot of young people are being sentenced to death for what people in the west would regard as relatively minor offenses , just to keep the supply of organs moving .
dr. wenyi wang explains : “ the person i first met in dealing with executed prisoners , when i was an intern in surgery , was very young , 18 years old and healthy .
basically his crime was that he had raped a woman who happened to be the daughter of the governor of our hometown .
so they gave a phone call to the public security bureau and in three days , he was given the death sentence without any trial .
in china the executed prisoners are considered to be an enemy of the country and have no rights .
the government can do whatever it wants . ”
health hazards there are a lot of health hazards associated with taking organs from executed prisoners .
dr. francis delmonico explains : “ the person that ’ s being executed could have tuberculosis , hepatitis or other transmissible diseases that go by their being in the environment of the prison .
one of the hazards of obtaining an organ from someone that ’ s being executed is to not know what transmissible disease might come along with the organ . ”
but with the government 's new scheme for the donation of organs , experts believe the situation will improve and that it will become more difficult for foreigners to come to china from rich countries in order to get a transplant .
they also argue that international action should be taken to put an end to the illegal practice of transplant tourism .

nearly two-thirds of china 's transplanted organs come from executed prisoners , the chinese state media reported last week .
in a bid to curb the illegal trade in human organs , the government has now launched an official organ donation scheme .
it hopes this will encourage people to become voluntary donors . the chinese vice minister of health , huang jiefu , announced that about 65 percent of the organs transplanted in chinese hospitals come from convicts put to death for various crimes .
china does not release any figures on the number of executions , but amnesty international estimates that over 1,700 prisoners were executed in 2008 , making china the world leader as far as the implementation of the death penalty is concerned . dr. wenyi wang is from the washington-based rights group doctors against forced organ harvesting , who graduated from a chinese medical school and saw the way organs are removed from the executed prisoners , explains : “ the surgeon who is the chief of the residence goes to the executive prisoner 's site where they execute the people by gunshot .
then they immediately transfer the prisoners into the room and extract the organs . ”
prisoners denied of basic rights some chinese officials however claim that the people condemned to die give written consent that they are willing to allow their organs to be donated .
dr. francis delmonico , advisory for human transplantation , of world health organization argues : “ not for a moment do i believe that this person is voluntarily giving .
here is a human reality that executions are now being fuelled by the need for human organs . ” the chinese traditionally believe that their body should be complete when they die so that it can be reincarnated for their next life without any physical disabilities .
this makes organ donation among ordinary chinese very much a taboo subject , even today .
so , china still relies heavily on organs taken from executed prisoners .
critics say that a lot of young people are being sentenced to death for what people in the west would regard as relatively minor offenses , just to keep the supply of organs moving .
dr. wenyi wang explains : “ the person i first met in dealing with executed prisoners , when i was an intern in surgery , was very young , 18 years old and healthy .
basically his crime was that he had raped a woman who happened to be the daughter of the governor of our hometown .
so they gave a phone call to the public security bureau and in three days , he was given the death sentence without any trial .
in china the executed prisoners are considered to be an enemy of the country and have no rights .
the government can do whatever it wants . ”
health hazards there are a lot of health hazards associated with taking organs from executed prisoners .
dr. francis delmonico explains : “ the person that ’ s being executed could have tuberculosis , hepatitis or other transmissible diseases that go by their being in the environment of the prison .
one of the hazards of obtaining an organ from someone that ’ s being executed is to not know what transmissible disease might come along with the organ . ”
but with the government 's new scheme for the donation of organs , experts believe the situation will improve and that it will become more difficult for foreigners to come to china from rich countries in order to get a transplant .
they also argue that international action should be taken to put an end to the illegal practice of transplant tourism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 09.09.2009 parents ' jobs are most important factor in fighting eu child poverty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty has far-reaching consequences for children growing up in europe having parents who work is the most important factor in preventing child poverty in europe .
but what can the eu do to alleviate child poverty ?
guidelines are available , but it 's mostly down to individual countries . the fight against child poverty in the eu is , first and foremost , a matter for individual states .
yet following the lisbon strategy , a development plan set out by the european council in 2000 , eu governments have promised to place children at the center of political dealings .
furthermore , the european commission has set out criteria defining child poverty , how it arises , spreads and how it can be combated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty can lead to social exclusion for many children the most recent report on child poverty by the commission was published in february 2008 ; in other words , before the financial crisis began .
the figures are likely to have worsened in the meantime .
then 19 million children in the eu were classified as poor , on average every fifth child .
the eu defines poor as earning 60 percent of the average income in each respective member state .
for a family in germany with two children , that means 1,600 euros -lrb- $ 2,300 -rrb- per month .
poverty impacts all areas of life the eu is keen to stress , however , that this does not just mean money as a means to consume , rather that child poverty takes away access to education -lrb- and therefore a good start in life -rrb- , damages health and excludes youngsters from a large part of cultural and social life .
that is another point brussels stresses : child poverty is a negative economic factor for each country .
it 's not just about sympathy and justice , but rather that economic policy should have a vested interest in nurturing and supporting children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployed parents are the greatest cause of child poverty the eu commission is especially concerned about unemployment .
out-of-work parents are the biggest cause of child poverty .
this leads to a vicious cycle that is hard to escape .
negative factors in families suffering from unemployment are often passed down from generation to generation .
according to the report , immigrant families are most at risk .
they suffer not only disproportionately from difficult financial circumstances , but also their children experience social and cultural exclusion .
policy solutions are the key the eu recommends to individual states a host of social , economic and cultural policies , including active employment and childcare policies , financial aid for families and integrated education and health policies .
and it has lauded the european states that lead in the fight against child poverty .
the scandinavian countries , the netherlands , austria , cyprus and slovenia all came out favorably in the commission 's report - in other words , not just rich countries .
they received praise for their comprehensive policies as the relatively high level and effectiveness of their welfare systems ran parallel with active employment policies and good childcare options .
italy , britain and spain came out the worst , with germany somewhere in the middle .

a message on the popular website said that the clip had been removed " due to terms of violation , " without giving any further details .
the spot , which was produced by the hamburg-based advertizing agency " das comitee " and launched by the aids awareness group regenbogen last week , runs just over 90 seconds .
it shows a couple having sex in a murky room .
to begin with , the focus is on body parts gliding over white bed sheets combined with the occasional shot of the woman 's face .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this poster is similar to the final scene of the ad as the proceedings begin to reach a climax , the camera zooms in on the man , who suddenly lifts his head .
his face is that of nazi leader adolf hitler .
the spot ends with the sentence : " aids is a mass murderer .
protect yourself . "
the ad has provoked outrage among aids groups and jewish organizations who have slammed the spot as being tasteless .
" the disgusting spot ... derides the victims of national socialism and compares people suffering from hiv to mass murderers , " said carsten schatz , the chairman of deutsche aids hilfe , germany 's main hiv / aids charity .
schatz also criticized the video for not giving information on how to protect oneself against hiv or other sexually transmitted diseases .
the spot 's originators said they could not understand what all the fuss was about .
they have apologized , but are unwilling to take the campaign spot offline - the video is still available at www.aids-is-a-mass-murderer.com.
" we never intended to depict those who suffer from aids or hiv as mass murderers .
we wanted to give a face to the disease , " said regenbogen 's jan schwertner .
bildunterschrift : the dictators josef stalin , left , and saddam hussein also feature in the campaign " the campaign was designed to make people sit up and get the issue back on the agenda and stop the trend toward unprotected sexual intercourse , " the group said in a statement on its website .

but two-thirds of germans say they do n't want to be immunized . in the latest step to fight an anticipated breakout of the h1n1 swine flu virus , germany 's 16 state health ministers have announced they plan to order another 18 million vaccination units .
that 's enough to immunize nine million more people and ensures there is enough stock should demand surge later in the year .
the health ministers have already ordered 50 million swine flu vaccinations for 25 million people , as each person requires two doses of the vaccine .
that means there will be enough vaccine to cover 40 percent of the german population .
the latest order is subject to funding being available .
the thorny question of who will bear the cost of this – the federal government , the health insurers , the state health departments or local authorities – is being discussed at a special working group meeting in berlin on wednesday .
two-thirds reject swine flu immunization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans are not convinced that swine flu is a threat a new study conducted by the forsa institute for dak , one of germany 's largest health insurers , revealed that a surprising number of germans do not plan to get immunized .
in the study of 1,001 people aged between 18 and 60 years , 62 percent said they would " definitely not , " or " almost definitely not " let themselves be vaccinated this autumn when the first swine flu vaccines become available .
eighty-two percent of germans said that swine flu poses a " fairly low " or " very low " danger .
bavarians , in germany 's south , in particular rejected vaccination .
only nine percent said they would " definitely " go to their doctor to be immunized compared to 14 percent of germans on average .
it 's a different picture in eastern germany , where almost a quarter of those who took part in the study said they were " definitely " going to get immunized .
" if the situation changes in the next few weeks , than we expect the number of people prepared to vaccinate themselves to increase sharply , " said horst boelle , the director of the claims department at dak .
are vaccinations worth the risk ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german medical association urges a rethink the german medical association is urging the government to reassess its mass vaccinations plan , the largest such scheme in postwar history .
" many people have already had swine flu and never even noticed that had it , " said frank ulrich montgomery , the association 's vice president .
montgomery also questioned whether the risks of vaccinating outweigh those of actually getting swine flu .
swine flu is highly infectious but it produces fairly mild symptoms and no one in germany has died of it so far .
" the disease could take a turn for the worse , and claim its first fatalities , " said deputy health minister klaus theo schroeder .
" i have the impression that we are now able to do that which we need to do in the next few weeks , " he added .
the first vaccinations are expected to be available in october and more units will be delivered on a weekly basis .
schroeder said mass vaccinations should be completed by the end of january or early february next year .
testing of the vaccine is ongoing .
in one pilot study , it was shown that a single vaccination was enough to provide protection in 80 percent of all test persons. wl / dpa / afp / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

joerg tauss maintains his innocence , saying he was conducting research . state prosecutors in the southern city of karlsruhe accuse tauss of having acquired , distributed , and possessed child pornography 102 times between may 2007 and january 2009 .
an investigation was carried out earlier this year after evidence was found in tauss ' office , including mobile phone pictures and dvds of underage sex .
but prosecutors could not press charges until parliament voted to repeal his immunity status , which happened on tuesday . fifty-six-year-old tauss is also accused of having shared child pornography with others via email in six cases , according to prosecutors .
the former spd politician has repeatedly denied the charges , insisting that he was merely conducting research as part of his efforts to break up a child pornography ring .
in response , prosecutors said investigators had found " no evidence of this claim . "
tauss resigned his position after the scandal broke and later joined the pirate party , a swedish-based group that advocates for more freedom on the internet .
he has resisted calls to step down from parliament .
tauss is expected to lose his seat in germany 's parliamentary elections on september 27. vj / ap / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but what can the eu do to alleviate child poverty ?
guidelines are available , but it 's mostly down to individual countries . the fight against child poverty in the eu is , first and foremost , a matter for individual states .
yet following the lisbon strategy , a development plan set out by the european council in 2000 , eu governments have promised to place children at the center of political dealings .
furthermore , the european commission has set out criteria defining child poverty , how it arises , spreads and how it can be combated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty can lead to social exclusion for many children the most recent report on child poverty by the commission was published in february 2008 ; in other words , before the financial crisis began .
the figures are likely to have worsened in the meantime .
then 19 million children in the eu were classified as poor , on average every fifth child .
the eu defines poor as earning 60 percent of the average income in each respective member state .
for a family in germany with two children , that means 1,600 euros -lrb- $ 2,300 -rrb- per month .
poverty impacts all areas of life the eu is keen to stress , however , that this does not just mean money as a means to consume , rather that child poverty takes away access to education -lrb- and therefore a good start in life -rrb- , damages health and excludes youngsters from a large part of cultural and social life .
that is another point brussels stresses : child poverty is a negative economic factor for each country .
it 's not just about sympathy and justice , but rather that economic policy should have a vested interest in nurturing and supporting children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployed parents are the greatest cause of child poverty the eu commission is especially concerned about unemployment .
out-of-work parents are the biggest cause of child poverty .
this leads to a vicious cycle that is hard to escape .
negative factors in families suffering from unemployment are often passed down from generation to generation .
according to the report , immigrant families are most at risk .
they suffer not only disproportionately from difficult financial circumstances , but also their children experience social and cultural exclusion .
policy solutions are the key the eu recommends to individual states a host of social , economic and cultural policies , including active employment and childcare policies , financial aid for families and integrated education and health policies .
and it has lauded the european states that lead in the fight against child poverty .
the scandinavian countries , the netherlands , austria , cyprus and slovenia all came out favorably in the commission 's report - in other words , not just rich countries .
they received praise for their comprehensive policies as the relatively high level and effectiveness of their welfare systems ran parallel with active employment policies and good childcare options .
italy , britain and spain came out the worst , with germany somewhere in the middle .

experts believe european models may help him formulate a system which will work for americans . healthcare reform has become obama 's top domestic priority in recent months as millions of americans look to their president to make good on one of his key pledges in his election campaign .
the pressure on obama to overhaul the country 's $ 2.5 trillion -lrb- 1.7 trillion euros -rrb- healthcare system is intensifying as he prepares to address congress on sept .
9 to outline his latest vision and gears himself for what could turn out to be a bitter battle between democrats and republicans set to a background of public skepticism .
healthcare experts believe that obama has no other choice but to press on with his ambitious plans .
few believe that he will be able to achieve all that he has promised .
at the same time they say he ca n't afford to abandon his plans with so much public opinion and political currency at stake .
" obama wo n't abandon his plans , he simply ca n't afford to , " uwe reinhardt , professor for healthcare economics at princeton university told deutsche welle .
" he ca n't do all the things he said he could do .
the most he can do this year is to make sure that of the 47 million uninsured people in the us , maybe 20 million will be helped to get insurance . "
claus wendt , project director at the mannheim center for european social policy research , agrees that a solution must be found - and fast .
" obama has to do something , " wendt told deutsche welle .
" today , 16 percent of the total economy is spent on healthcare and this will only increase .
in ten years , it will be more than 20 percent .
take the situation with medicare , the insurance system for the elderly - it is very expensive .
if obama does nothing , then caring for the elderly will become even more costly as the population ages and this will be an even bigger burden on the economy . "
uninsured americans demand expensive healthcare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost 50 million americans have no healthcare cover in a country that prides itself on providing equal opportunities for all , it 's a shock to find that almost 50 million americans are without any type of healthcare .
yet that does n't stop them from making undue demands , according to professor reinhardt .
" americans do imagine themselves to have an enormous range of rights , " he said , " but at the same time they are skimpy on responsibility .
their thinking is that no one has the right to tell them to purchase insurance but when they 're sick and not insured they have the right to healthcare that may cost $ 200,000 .
i do n't think you would find that many germans to be so juvenile about it , " he said .
with such political and public pressure growing , obama will have to come up with a reform plan which brings both sides of the political spectrum together and eases the concerns of the american population .
with his critics citing all manner of evils from communism to nazi germany in their opposition to anything resembling public healthcare , obama needs to look for a model that the us can accept and one which will work in its complex healthcare arena .
both reinhardt and wendt believe obama should look towards europe when considering his next move .
european models offer compromise solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's model offers hope but is difficult politically " it was recently written in the new york times that the best model for the reform of the insurance system was that of germany , which does n't have a government-run plan but where there are private health funds , " reinhardt said .
" they compete but within a regulatory structure which makes that competition fair and humane .
" you could pick either the german system , the dutch system - even more so as they allow for profit-orientated insurance companies - or the swiss system , " he continued .
" all these systems are fairly similar in having a structured , regulated market for private insurers , either non-profit or profit-making . " " but i think a mixture of the dutch and german systems would be perfect for the insurance reform in the us , " he added . " it 's a shame that instead of having a rational discussion on the german system or taking a plane load of senators and congressmen and flying them over there , you have this shouting match over euthanasia , and pictures of hitler being waved about .
it has descended into quite an ugly scene . "
wendt agrees that that the german model is a political hot potato in the us and that the dutch healthcare system could provide obama with the compromise model he is looking for .
" i do n't think it 's a good idea to refer to the german model in the us for political reasons , " wendt said .
" in general , i would say that the german model in comparison to the us model is in quite good shape because germans have competition between different plans and the patients can choose between different plans and healthcare providers .
" but the dutch model might be a good option for the us , " he continued .
" this would show that a new healthcare system could be run through private organizations and as a publicly-run concern , which is a fear in some circles in the us .
the swiss model may also work as the insurance business is conducted by private organizations , and this could be implemented in the american healthcare system . "
obama needs to explain his plans , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is accused of not explaining his plans for health should obama choose to follow a european model or combine a number of them in a plan to suit the american healthcare landscape , he is going to have to sell it to the people , something many americans have accused the president of failing to do so far .
a cbs news poll recently said most americans think obama has not clearly explained his plans to overhaul the system .
" obama is a very intelligent man but i would not be surprised if he 's not that well informed on the european healthcare systems , " said reinhardt .
" the big mistake he has made is that he has n't been able to explain to people in simple terms what he wants to do and appeal to that big , broad centrist middle class .
and because it is a big unknown , everyone expects the worst .
you have educated , intelligent people like the catholic bishops believing that obama 's plan will lead to old people having their life-support systems turned off .
this information vacuum is president obama 's fault .
he should have taken hold of this issue much earlier . "

they made it clear her family left behind in germany would suffer the consequences if she refused . an unusually muscular replacement bergmann , played in the film by young german actress karoline herfurth , returned to germany and broke the german high-jump record ahead of the olympics . but just days before the start of the 1936 olympics , the nazis barred bergmann , a favorite for gold , from the games , saying her performances had n't been satisfactory .
the nazis wanted to ensure that hitler would not be embarrassed by a jewish athlete winning a gold medal for germany . the dramatic turnabout came after the ship carrying us athletes had set sail for germany .
by way of consolation , bergmann was given a spectator 's ticket . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bergmann 's competition in the film is a fictional character based on ratjen the nazis replaced bergmann with " aryan " athletes elfriede kaun and dora ratjen .
the two won third and fourth place respectively in the high-jump .
but two years later , it emerged that ratjen , who had a deep , gruff voice , was in fact male . in 1938 , still posing as a woman , ratjen set a new world high jump record for women of 1.70m - but was disqualified after a doctor discovered that he had strapped up his genitals .
he was stripped of his title , his performances were expunged from the records , and he was quickly conscripted into the army . the film shows bergmann 's trainer waldmann , played by popular german actor axel prahl , being replaced by a nazi loyalist who brings in a manly-looking athlete to replace high-jumper bergmann . the film does n't just show how bergmann was discriminated against and sidelined but also touches on how she becomes friends with ratjen .
it portrays ratjen as a tormented person who knows that he is not a woman but tries fearfully to hide the fact . a scene in the film shows actress herfurth coming upon marie ketteler , a fictional character based on dora ratjen and played by actor sebastian urzendowsky , in the shower and discovering that she is a man . bergmann : " i had no idea " in reality , it is not clear whether the nazis were aware that dora ratjen was in fact " hermann " ratjen .
bergmann , who emigrated to the united states in 1937 and still lives there , said she herself had no idea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film shows the athletes - seen here at berlin 's olympic stadium - becoming friends " i never suspected anything , " the now 95-year-old told the german news magazine der spiegel .
" we all wondered why she never appeared naked in the shower .
to be so shy at the age of 17 seemed grotesque .
but we just thought : well , she 's weird , she 's strange . " the film is interspersed with interviews with the real gretel bergmann .
the 25-year-old herfurth , hailed as an upcoming acting star in germany , is reported to have trained for a year to perfect her form for the long-jumping scenes . the film 's germany premiere , held in berlin in august , coincided with the row over the gender of south african athlete caster semenya , which marred the world athletics championships in the very stadium where the 1936 olympics were held . cheated of gold ? after emigrating to the united states , bergmann went on to win several more high-jumping titles .
she vowed never to return to germany again or speak the language . but more than 60 years later , bergmann did return to germany .
in 1999 , she accepted a prestigious award in frankfurt that recognized her sporting achievements .
and she made a second trip to her hometown laupheim in southwestern germany when a stadium there was named after her . but bergmann said she remains certain that she was cheated of an olympic gold medal by the nazis . " i would have won gold , nothing less , " she told der spiegel .
" i wanted to show to the germans and to the world that jews were not these terrible people , not fat , ugly and disgusting as were people , " she said . " i wanted to show that a jewish girl could beat the germans .
in front of 10,000 people . " the film " berlin 36 " opens across cinemas in germany on sept .

viewpoint professor steve field chairman of the royal college of gps it is estimated that two million britons are currently buying drugs over the internet and doctors are increasingly having to treat them for bad side effects .
in this week 's scrubbing up , the chairman of the royal college of gps , professor steve field , says the only way for anyone to safely buy drugs this way is to talk to their gp or pharmacist first . "
gps have always known that medication bought from the internet is a potential minefield and recent studies are showing just how risky it is .
a shocking survey has confirmed this is a major problem .
a poll in gp magazine found that one in four gps have treated patients for adverse reactions to medicines they have brought online .
in addition , 85 % of doctors surveyed believe there needs to be more regulation . "
products bought online can do harm even if they are the genuine article " read your comments whatever the true scale of the problem , the danger of buying drugs from a non-professional source is obvious .
counterfeit medication is common , and you just do not know what is going to be in those little pills - it could be anything from sugar to rat poison .
products bought online can do harm even if they are the genuine article .
side effect risk the medication might be impure and have a higher dosage than expected , and the risk of side effects , overdose and / or interaction with other medication is worrying .
for example , weight loss drugs have clear criteria for pharmacists to sell or gps prescribe .
they should only be used by patients with a certain body mass index and have to be used in conjunction with a healthy diet and exercise .
the absorption of fat soluble vitamins can have nasty side-effects and could be abused by children or those with eating disorders .
another risk is that research and testing on drugs can throw up new evidence on drugs , but that information can be slow to reach the general public .
in my own practice i have seen young men who have ordered steroids online without knowing the full effects and are suffering health problems as a result .
the same goes for ordering viagra online .
patients might not know what dose they have taken , and it can interact with other drugs to have side effects which can include raising blood pressure , headaches and the potential for sudden hearing loss .

viewpoint professor steve field chairman of the royal college of gps viagra pills are often bought over the internet it is estimated that two million britons are currently buying drugs over the internet and doctors are increasingly having to treat them for bad side effects .
in this week 's scrubbing up , the chairman of the royal college of gps , professor steve field , says the only way for anyone to safely buy drugs this way is to talk to their gp or pharmacist first .
gps have always known that medication bought from the internet is a potential minefield and recent studies are showing just how risky it is .
a shocking survey has confirmed this is a major problem .
a poll in gp magazine found that one in four gps have treated patients for adverse reactions to medicines they have brought online .
in addition , 85 % of doctors surveyed believe there needs to be more regulation .
products bought online can do harm even if they are the genuine article read your comments whatever the true scale of the problem , the danger of buying drugs from a non-professional source is obvious .
counterfeit medication is common , and you just do not know what is going to be in those little pills - it could be anything from sugar to rat poison .
products bought online can do harm even if they are the genuine article .
side effect risk the medication might be impure and have a higher dosage than expected , and the risk of side effects , overdose and / or interaction with other medication is worrying .
for example , weight loss drugs have clear criteria for pharmacists to sell or gps prescribe .
they should only be used by patients with a certain body mass index and have to be used in conjunction with a healthy diet and exercise .
the absorption of fat soluble vitamins can have nasty side-effects and could be abused by children or those with eating disorders .
another risk is that research and testing on drugs can throw up new evidence on drugs , but that information can be slow to reach the general public .
in my own practice i have seen young men who have ordered steroids online without knowing the full effects and are suffering health problems as a result .
the same goes for ordering viagra online .
patients might not know what dose they have taken , and it can interact with other drugs to have side effects which can include raising blood pressure , headaches and the potential for sudden hearing loss .
aggressive advertising there are a number of reasons why people might turn to the internet for medication .
aggressive advertising campaigns and stories on " wonder " weight loss pills in magazines can tempt people to bypass their gp or pharmacist .
we are even seeing unscrupulous operators preying on fears over swine flu , targeting the vulnerable and insecure with fake tamiflu .
your gp is there to be non-judgmental , supportive and helpful my advice to people thinking about ordering drugs online is simple - talk to your gp or pharmacist .
your regular doctor knows you , your background and your health history , and what treatment is right for you .
everybody is different .

advertisement the survey which spoke to 200 businesses across wales showed an increase in tourism over the summer tourism operators have given a cautious welcome to welsh assembly government figures indicating that wales enjoyed a successful summer .
the survey of 200 tourism firms found that 39 % experienced an upturn in custom on last year 's figures , while 42 % said that trade had got no worse .
but businesses want more to be done to ensure visitors return and some have criticised local authority facilities .
the welsh local government association said councils had to balance concerns .
there was widespread praise from industry insiders for a worldwide television advertising campaign featuring welsh comedian rhod gilbert , made by visit wales , the tourism arm of the assembly government .
they also commended the way the assembly government marketed wales through major sporting events such as the millennium stadium fa cup finals , the first ashes test at the swalec stadium and the 2010 ryder cup .
case study dai morgan , general manager , harbourmaster hotel , aberaeron " we 've been much busier than we thought we were going to be .
the summer months in general have been really kind to us and it 's just the weather that 's been unkind .
business has been as brisk and the hotel has been at or nearly at full occupancy throughout the summer .
it 's been constant since june and through july , and august has been similar .
i suppose we 've seen a slight growth each year .
we 've seen more people from the continent , ireland and the united states here this year .
but there 's also been a few more from wales and england here too , at a time when it 's more expensive to travel abroad . "
but john wake , director of the mid wales tourism partnership and a tourism consultant said that visitors ' feedback about facilities like tourist information centres and public toilets in wales was " underwhelming " .
" many local authorities have closed or cut back their tourist information centres to save costs , but as a result they 're cutting the throats of the businesses which depend on them for publicity , " said mr wake .
" basic things like public toilets either do n't exist at all , or are in revolting conditions , and often shut by five or six o 'clock in the afternoon .
" litter is a major problem in the cities , and in rural areas it 's extremely difficult to travel anywhere , thanks to the lack of joined up thinking in public transport . "
a welsh local government association spokesman said a number of tourist information centres had closed in recent years because of a long-term decline in enquiries to the centres .
" increasingly , tourists visiting wales are using the internet to access high quality , helpful information about places to stay and visit in wales prior to their trip , " he said .
" whilst all local authorities prioritise tourism and understand the valuable contribution it makes to wales economically and culturally , authorities are facing increasing financial pressures and must balance competing local priorities . "
dewi davies , director of the tourism partnership , north wales , said businesses were also concerned about the weather following a third consecutive below-par summer .
" this time round we probably did benefit from the predictions of a barbecue summer , which never quite materialised , " he said .
tourism survey 39 % report an increase in guest / visitor numbers 42 % achieved same level of business as last year 19 % report a decrease 35 % report an increase in turnover 45 % say turnover stayed the same 46 % felt success was due to more people staying in the uk 50 % + camping and caravan firms report increase in numbers 34 % reported last minute bookings 36 % said visitors were spending slightly less source : visit wales " but the danger for the future is that the public are now putting less faith in the longer-term forecasts , and holding off on booking until a day or two before in many cases , until they can see for themselves what the weather 's going to be like . "
the figures show that families are moving away from week or fortnight-long holidays , preferring multiple long weekends instead .
more than half of all welsh caravan and camp sites reported an increase in profits , but hotels and high-end self-catering accommodation felt the pinch .
heritage minister alun ffred jones said he was delighted by the figures , particularly by those which showed visitors were returning to wales .
" it is also interesting to note that 20 % of those surveyed identified repeat business as a reason for an increase in business , this is very important to the success of the industry as people will return for a quality experience time and again , " he said .
visit wales launches its autumn campaign , wales unpackaged , later .
