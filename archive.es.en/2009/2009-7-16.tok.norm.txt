according to chinese media reports , the nigerian businessman had overstayed his visa .
the case - the first of its kind - has highlighted the plight of the growing number of african immigrants in china . officially , some 20,000 africans live in china , mostly traders and students .
but unofficial estimates suggest that 20,000 might be living in the southern city of guangzhou alone .
most are from nigeria .
alexander demissie , an ethiopian who does research on african-chinese relations at bochum university in germany , explains : “ basically , they are middlemen .
they set the connection between the chinese manufacturers and the african traders .
most of the time , these nigerians living in guangzhou are highly-educated and speak very good chinese because they studied at the universities . ”
“ sun yatsen university in guangzhou is one of the famous universities where you can find a lot of african students .
it ’ s of course easier for them to have access to the chinese market because of the language .
this helps the african traders coming to china for two weeks or three weeks to buy goods . ”
as china has been very keen on promoting trade and political relations with african countries , visa regulations tend to be generous , says demissie : “ people can easily get a chinese visa , as soon as they can prove that they are traders or students . ”
he adds that this incident should not have happened and says such problems are unusual .
police is tougher with africans on the other hand , he says , the police does tend to be tough with african immigrants and “ africans do face harsher controls inside china than people from other countries . ”
he wenping , an africa specialist at the chinese academy of social sciences in beijing , says that many africans are better integrated in china than westerners .
“ the africans , both traders and students find it easier to overcome the language barrier than europeans and americans . ”
“ i ’ ve come across so many people who speak perfectly fluent chinese .
they find it easier to master the different tones we have in our chinese pronunciation .
they easily adapt to the local environment in the chinese cities , and chinese food is no problem for them . ”
africans not always accepted by chinese society but alexander demissie , who has also lived in china , says other issues can create difficulties : “ from my own experience , it ’ s not easy as an african to have a chinese girlfriend , for example .
of course , if you live in one country , you will take part in the social life , you might also get a chinese girlfriend and so on . ”
but he says people around might not consider this in a friendly light , adding that some people act rudely or badly towards africans in china .
demissie says there are also occasional street fights between groups of africans and of chinese , and that there is a general lack of knowledge about africa among ordinary people in china .
but with growing exposure through trade and political links , this seems likely to change in the foreseeable future .

according to chinese media reports , the nigerian businessman had overstayed his visa .
the case - the first of its kind - has highlighted the plight of the growing number of african immigrants in china . officially , some 20,000 africans live in china , mostly traders and students .
but unofficial estimates suggest that 20,000 might be living in the southern city of guangzhou alone .
most are from nigeria .
alexander demissie , an ethiopian who does research on african-chinese relations at bochum university in germany , explains : “ basically , they are middlemen .
they set the connection between the chinese manufacturers and the african traders .
most of the time , these nigerians living in guangzhou are highly-educated and speak very good chinese because they studied at the universities . ”
“ sun yatsen university in guangzhou is one of the famous universities where you can find a lot of african students .
it ’ s of course easier for them to have access to the chinese market because of the language .
this helps the african traders coming to china for two weeks or three weeks to buy goods . ”
as china has been very keen on promoting trade and political relations with african countries , visa regulations tend to be generous , says demissie : “ people can easily get a chinese visa , as soon as they can prove that they are traders or students . ”
he adds that this incident should not have happened and says such problems are unusual .
police is tougher with africans on the other hand , he says , the police does tend to be tough with african immigrants and “ africans do face harsher controls inside china than people from other countries . ”
he wenping , an africa specialist at the chinese academy of social sciences in beijing , says that many africans are better integrated in china than westerners .
“ the africans , both traders and students find it easier to overcome the language barrier than europeans and americans . ”
“ i ’ ve come across so many people who speak perfectly fluent chinese .
they find it easier to master the different tones we have in our chinese pronunciation .
they easily adapt to the local environment in the chinese cities , and chinese food is no problem for them . ”
africans not always accepted by chinese society but alexander demissie , who has also lived in china , says other issues can create difficulties : “ from my own experience , it ’ s not easy as an african to have a chinese girlfriend , for example .
of course , if you live in one country , you will take part in the social life , you might also get a chinese girlfriend and so on . ”
but he says people around might not consider this in a friendly light , adding that some people act rudely or badly towards africans in china .
demissie says there are also occasional street fights between groups of africans and of chinese , and that there is a general lack of knowledge about africa among ordinary people in china .
but with growing exposure through trade and political links , this seems likely to change in the foreseeable future .

eu-members most affected are demanding that their eu partners share responsibility . during a meeting in stockholm on thursday , eu interior ministers addressed europe 's illegal immigration problem .
all agree that something needs to be done to alleviate the stress on mediterranean countries , but not all can agree how .
" two issues are the most important : one is the creation of a common european asylum system , which would mean that we would have increased solidarity between member states and more shared responsibility , " said sweden 's migration minister tobias billstrom , who led the informal meeting .
" the second thing is the question of legal migration : we need to open more ways for people to come to europe and work here , " billstrom added .
according to eu justice commissioner jacques barrot , all member states support efforts to strengthen the eu border-control agency frontex .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece has come under fire for deporting migrants in need of asylum .
pictured : prime minister costas karamanlis every year , thousands of people from africa , the middle east and central asia risk their lives crossing the mediterranean sea for a chance at a better life in europe . the united nations high commission for refugees estimates that in 2008 alone , more than 67,000 people tried to enter europe illegally via the mediterranean .
the influx has caused a major strain on the reception services of four eu-member states in particular - cyprus , greece , italy and malta - and they have repeatedly called for other european countries to shoulder some of the burden .
more solidarity needed eu leaders first called for greater cooperation with european countries most affected by illegal migration during a june meeting , but they also maintained that such efforts should be voluntary .
critics of that viewpoint , such as cypriot interior minister neoklis sylikiotis , say that relying on voluntary assistance is n't sustainable in the long term .
" it is time that we have more solidarity from the other member countries , " said sylikiotis .
" countries that are the first point of contact should not have to shoulder the entire problem . "
italy 's interior minister roberto maroni shared sylikiotis ' feelings , stating that " burden sharing " should be one of the top priorities for the eu 's new five-year plan on justice issues , also discussed in stockholm .
however , many countries outside of the mediterranean zone believe that instead of focusing on greater cooperation within the eu , the bloc should be working with migrants ' countries of origin to reduce the number of people wanting to leave in the first place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu interior ministers met in stockholm for a meeting on justice and home affairs eu members have often been critized for their handling of illegal migrants , who may not necessarily be escaping economic hardship , but who face political persecution or violence in their homeland .
the un , human rights groups , and the vatican have all publically denounced italy and greece for sending back migrants who were in need of asylum .
the german refugee organization " pro-asylum " has also criticized other eu members for not doing enough .
" countries like germany can no longer sit on their hands ... an unbureaucratic and speedy distribution of those seeking protection - like those stranded in greece - is a question of humanity and solidarity .

five members of the left green party therefore rejected the proposition , including jon bjarnason , the minister of agriculture and fisheries . other left-green deputies including finance minister steingrimur sigfusson , however , displayed political pragmatism by voting for the eu membership application along government lines .

iceland 's government plans to launch its eu membership bid in brussels before the end of this month . the icelandic parliament , the althingi , gave the green light for the government to bid for membership in the european union , with 33 of the nation 's 63 parliamentarians voting in favor of the proposal . a total of 32 votes were required to pass the proposal , but opposition to the move was limited to 28 lawmakers , while another two abstained .
thursday 's narrow victory came as a relief to crisis-stricken prime minister johanna sigurdardottir , who hopes to stabilize iceland 's economy by joining the 27-member bloc .
in the end , however , it will be the citizens of iceland who will have the final word on whether the government pursues membership .
if and when iceland completes successful accession negotiations with the european union , the question will then be put to the people in a referendum .
divisions within the government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister sigurdardottir says only eu membership can save iceland 's economy the governing coalition itself remained divided over the benefits of eu membership for iceland – a country which is dramatically affected by the economic crisis .
while sigurdardottir 's social democrats have always campaigned for joining the bloc , their left-green coalition partners are traditionally opposed to the idea .
five members of the left green party therefore rejected the proposition , including jon bjarnason , the minister of agriculture and fisheries . other left-green deputies including finance minister steingrimur sigfusson , however , displayed political pragmatism by voting for the eu membership application along government lines . " an overwhelming majority wants this eu issue to be dealt with , " sigfusson said .
pros and cons one of the main eu pull factors for the large majority of icelanders is the chance to drop the icelandic krona as a currency .
it shed nearly half its value in the wake of last year 's financial crash , while inflation rose to over 12 percent .
as a small island state with just 320.000 citizens , iceland relies heavily on imports .
the strongest opposition to iceland 's eu membership comes from the fishing and agricultural industries .
they are opposed to handing over the control over iceland 's lucrative fishing grounds to brussels .
" we would no longer be the lawmakers on how we run our fishing industry .
this is the key element for us .
and we just do n't see any need for an application when you know what the outcome is going to be , " said sigurdur sverrisson from the federation of icelandic fishing vessel owners -lrb- liu -rrb- .
if and how iceland could keep the control over this vital part of the economy while having to join the – currently unsuccessful - common eu fisheries policy will be one of the most important and tricky questions during the accession talks .
popular support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurosceptic protests in reykjavik were low-key according to the most recent figures , around 70 percent of icelanders support the launch of eu accession talks .
" i would like to talk and find out what we can get and what we 'd have to give , " is an often-heard comment on reykjavik 's streets these days .
the nation remains divided over the prospect of full membership in the bloc , however , with many citizens complaining about a lack of information .
unlike norway , iceland has never applied to the eu because the majority of politicians were against it .
" what we have seen in the last few months is a shift in political leadership rather than a great shift in the public opinion , although the public opinion for membership of course strengthened due to the economic crisis , " concludes adalsteinn leifsson from reykjavik university .
hope for speedy progress iceland 's foreign minister össur skarpedinsson , a leading social democrat , has already outlined an ambitious agenda for the accession procedures .
iceland plans to launch its application in time for the next meeting of the eu foreign ministers on july 27 .
the fact that iceland is already a member of the european economic area -lrb- eea -rrb- and the border-free schengen zone means accession talks are likely to be relatively short .
around two thirds of all icelandic legislation is already in line with eu rules .
it is widely viewed as favorable for iceland that another nordic country , sweden , currently holds the eu presidency .
" we do n't hide the fact that we want our friends to support us , " said skarpedinsson .
the swedes support a speedy negotiation process with iceland , and eu officials mentioned 2011 or 2012 as possible accession dates .
a referendum will be held , meaning the icelandic citizens will have the last say in the matter .

" i 'm an architect and a utopist , " said luc schuiten .
the architect lives and works in brussels and believes that the city , like so many others , has no future if something does not change soon .
" you can not feel good in light of all the environmental pollution and the grim perspectives for the future , " said the 65-year-old visionary .
" so , i try to envision alternatives . "
for the first time ever , drafts and designs by the relatively unknown architect are on display in a large show in brussels .
the entrance to the " vegetal city " installation is composed of an archway made of branches adorned with little yellow lights that blink to the sound of a heartbeat pulsing from speakers .
beyond the entrance , visitors will find architectural models and drawings of balanced , colorful , almost fairy tale-like cities and people who have managed to live in harmony with nature .
round , flowing shapes that weave into one another are schuiten 's trademark .
leaves inspire design bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schuiten 's vertical gardens " the ' vertical gardens ' are a project that would help to heal the city 's wounds , " schuiten said , his eyes sparkling .
he would like to create green areas that span over walkways and platforms and up the sides of buildings .
" the idea is that the vegetation here can be used as herbal or plant sculptures that exude a sense of poetry , " he mused .
" they are a space to withdraw to , a peaceful place where we can discover what we are missing - nature . "
none of schuiten 's visions have yet been turned into reality , even though many of them could be realized if someone had the courage to do so , he said .
the architect has , however , been designing and building private energy-efficient homes made from environmental materials since the 1970s .
nature is his inspiration .
" nature is the only thing that is sustainable , and when we use living materials to build our homes , we are automatically developing things further by employing that same sustainability , " the architect said .
he calls it " archiborescence " - this connection between architecture and arborescence , or " tree structure . "
on the road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the man and his car-bike - advertising his show in brussels to advertise his visions to a larger public , the architect began driving an electric-powered three-wheeler around the city of brussels .
the two-seater vehicle with the exhibition logo on the side looks like a combination of recumbent bicycle and car , and is steered using two joysticks .
" no noise , no pollution , " the designer said as he eased the vehicle from the sidewalk into the street , catching the glances of curious pedestrians and car drivers along the way .
" when i travel more than 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- , i have to pedal , " he explains .
" but i love pedaling - it keeps me in shape .
i can also conserve energy as i travel , and can have fun all at the same time . "
left up to the architect , people in the future would only drive small , electric cars that access their power from tracks along the street .
trucks would have special power trailers attached to them . living his dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luc schuiten calls himself a utopist arriving at his home in brussels ' suburbs , schuiten parks his vehicle in the garage .
the elegant facade of the old townhouse masks a wood-dominated interior designed in schuiten 's flowing style .
a window stretching over two stories looks out into the lush garden .
schuiten sits down to work in his studio attached to the townhouse .
among all the carefully marked drawers and binders are his sketchbooks that stand at the ready beside hundreds of other books lined up on shelves .
ideas spring to mind quickly , he said .
in a matter of seconds , one tiny sketch can lead to a vast vision for an entire city .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 16.07.2009 iceland 's parliament approves eu membership bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland could become an eu member within three years parliamentarians in iceland have paved the way for accession talks with the european union .
iceland 's government plans to launch its eu membership bid in brussels before the end of this month . the icelandic parliament , the althingi , gave the green light for the government to bid for membership in the european union , with 33 of the nation 's 63 parliamentarians voting in favor of the proposal . a total of 32 votes were required to pass the proposal , but opposition to the move was limited to 28 lawmakers , while another two abstained .
thursday 's narrow victory came as a relief to crisis-stricken prime minister johanna sigurdardottir , who hopes to stabilize iceland 's economy by joining the 27-member bloc .
in the end , however , it will be the citizens of iceland who will have the final word on whether the government pursues membership .
if and when iceland completes successful accession negotiations with the european union , the question will then be put to the people in a referendum .
divisions within the government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister sigurdardottir says only eu membership can save iceland 's economy the governing coalition itself remained divided over the benefits of eu membership for iceland – a country which is dramatically affected by the economic crisis .
while sigurdardottir 's social democrats have always campaigned for joining the bloc , their left-green coalition partners are traditionally opposed to the idea .
five members of the left green party therefore rejected the proposition , including jon bjarnason , the minister of agriculture and fisheries . other left-green deputies including finance minister steingrimur sigfusson , however , displayed political pragmatism by voting for the eu membership application along government lines . " an overwhelming majority wants this eu issue to be dealt with , " sigfusson said .
pros and cons one of the main eu pull factors for the large majority of icelanders is the chance to drop the icelandic krona as a currency .
it shed nearly half its value in the wake of last year 's financial crash , while inflation rose to over 12 percent .
as a small island state with just 320.000 citizens , iceland relies heavily on imports .
the strongest opposition to iceland 's eu membership comes from the fishing and agricultural industries .
they are opposed to handing over the control over iceland 's lucrative fishing grounds to brussels .
" we would no longer be the lawmakers on how we run our fishing industry .
this is the key element for us .
and we just do n't see any need for an application when you know what the outcome is going to be , " said sigurdur sverrisson from the federation of icelandic fishing vessel owners -lrb- liu -rrb- .
if and how iceland could keep the control over this vital part of the economy while having to join the – currently unsuccessful - common eu fisheries policy will be one of the most important and tricky questions during the accession talks .
popular support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurosceptic protests in reykjavik were low-key according to the most recent figures , around 70 percent of icelanders support the launch of eu accession talks .
" i would like to talk and find out what we can get and what we 'd have to give , " is an often-heard comment on reykjavik 's streets these days .
the nation remains divided over the prospect of full membership in the bloc , however , with many citizens complaining about a lack of information .
unlike norway , iceland has never applied to the eu because the majority of politicians were against it .
" what we have seen in the last few months is a shift in political leadership rather than a great shift in the public opinion , although the public opinion for membership of course strengthened due to the economic crisis , " concludes adalsteinn leifsson from reykjavik university .
hope for speedy progress iceland 's foreign minister össur skarpedinsson , a leading social democrat , has already outlined an ambitious agenda for the accession procedures .
iceland plans to launch its application in time for the next meeting of the eu foreign ministers on july 27 .
the fact that iceland is already a member of the european economic area -lrb- eea -rrb- and the border-free schengen zone means accession talks are likely to be relatively short .
around two thirds of all icelandic legislation is already in line with eu rules .
it is widely viewed as favorable for iceland that another nordic country , sweden , currently holds the eu presidency .
" we do n't hide the fact that we want our friends to support us , " said skarpedinsson .
the swedes support a speedy negotiation process with iceland , and eu officials mentioned 2011 or 2012 as possible accession dates .
a referendum will be held , meaning the icelandic citizens will have the last say in the matter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 16.07.2009 natural architecture : green visions for inner-city spaces großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the woven city by luc schuiten - many designs resemble trees buildings with grass growing on the rooftops , little brooks running through pedestrian zones , homes built from tree roots - it may sound utopian , but a belgian architect says it 's all possible . " i 'm an architect and a utopist , " said luc schuiten .
the architect lives and works in brussels and believes that the city , like so many others , has no future if something does not change soon .
" you can not feel good in light of all the environmental pollution and the grim perspectives for the future , " said the 65-year-old visionary .
" so , i try to envision alternatives . "
for the first time ever , drafts and designs by the relatively unknown architect are on display in a large show in brussels .
the entrance to the " vegetal city " installation is composed of an archway made of branches adorned with little yellow lights that blink to the sound of a heartbeat pulsing from speakers .
beyond the entrance , visitors will find architectural models and drawings of balanced , colorful , almost fairy tale-like cities and people who have managed to live in harmony with nature .
round , flowing shapes that weave into one another are schuiten 's trademark .
leaves inspire design bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schuiten 's vertical gardens " the ' vertical gardens ' are a project that would help to heal the city 's wounds , " schuiten said , his eyes sparkling .
he would like to create green areas that span over walkways and platforms and up the sides of buildings .
" the idea is that the vegetation here can be used as herbal or plant sculptures that exude a sense of poetry , " he mused .
" they are a space to withdraw to , a peaceful place where we can discover what we are missing - nature . "
none of schuiten 's visions have yet been turned into reality , even though many of them could be realized if someone had the courage to do so , he said .
the architect has , however , been designing and building private energy-efficient homes made from environmental materials since the 1970s .
nature is his inspiration .
" nature is the only thing that is sustainable , and when we use living materials to build our homes , we are automatically developing things further by employing that same sustainability , " the architect said .
he calls it " archiborescence " - this connection between architecture and arborescence , or " tree structure . "
on the road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the man and his car-bike - advertising his show in brussels to advertise his visions to a larger public , the architect began driving an electric-powered three-wheeler around the city of brussels .
the two-seater vehicle with the exhibition logo on the side looks like a combination of recumbent bicycle and car , and is steered using two joysticks .
" no noise , no pollution , " the designer said as he eased the vehicle from the sidewalk into the street , catching the glances of curious pedestrians and car drivers along the way .
" when i travel more than 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- , i have to pedal , " he explains .
" but i love pedaling - it keeps me in shape .
i can also conserve energy as i travel , and can have fun all at the same time . "
left up to the architect , people in the future would only drive small , electric cars that access their power from tracks along the street .
trucks would have special power trailers attached to them . living his dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luc schuiten calls himself a utopist arriving at his home in brussels ' suburbs , schuiten parks his vehicle in the garage .
the elegant facade of the old townhouse masks a wood-dominated interior designed in schuiten 's flowing style .
a window stretching over two stories looks out into the lush garden .
schuiten sits down to work in his studio attached to the townhouse .
among all the carefully marked drawers and binders are his sketchbooks that stand at the ready beside hundreds of other books lined up on shelves .
ideas spring to mind quickly , he said .
in a matter of seconds , one tiny sketch can lead to a vast vision for an entire city .

" i 'm an architect and a utopist , " said luc schuiten .
the architect lives and works in brussels and believes that the city , like so many others , has no future if something does not change soon .
" you can not feel good in light of all the environmental pollution and the grim perspectives for the future , " said the 65-year-old visionary .
" so , i try to envision alternatives . "
for the first time ever , drafts and designs by the relatively unknown architect are on display in a large show in brussels .
the entrance to the " vegetal city " installation is composed of an archway made of branches adorned with little yellow lights that blink to the sound of a heartbeat pulsing from speakers .
beyond the entrance , visitors will find architectural models and drawings of balanced , colorful , almost fairy tale-like cities and people who have managed to live in harmony with nature .
round , flowing shapes that weave into one another are schuiten 's trademark .
leaves inspire design bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schuiten 's vertical gardens " the ' vertical gardens ' are a project that would help to heal the city 's wounds , " schuiten said , his eyes sparkling .
he would like to create green areas that span over walkways and platforms and up the sides of buildings .
" the idea is that the vegetation here can be used as herbal or plant sculptures that exude a sense of poetry , " he mused .
" they are a space to withdraw to , a peaceful place where we can discover what we are missing - nature . "
none of schuiten 's visions have yet been turned into reality , even though many of them could be realized if someone had the courage to do so , he said .
the architect has , however , been designing and building private energy-efficient homes made from environmental materials since the 1970s .
nature is his inspiration .
" nature is the only thing that is sustainable , and when we use living materials to build our homes , we are automatically developing things further by employing that same sustainability , " the architect said .
he calls it " archiborescence " - this connection between architecture and arborescence , or " tree structure . "
on the road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the man and his car-bike - advertising his show in brussels to advertise his visions to a larger public , the architect began driving an electric-powered three-wheeler around the city of brussels .
the two-seater vehicle with the exhibition logo on the side looks like a combination of recumbent bicycle and car , and is steered using two joysticks .
" no noise , no pollution , " the designer said as he eased the vehicle from the sidewalk into the street , catching the glances of curious pedestrians and car drivers along the way .
" when i travel more than 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- , i have to pedal , " he explains .
" but i love pedaling - it keeps me in shape .
i can also conserve energy as i travel , and can have fun all at the same time . "
left up to the architect , people in the future would only drive small , electric cars that access their power from tracks along the street .
trucks would have special power trailers attached to them . living his dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luc schuiten calls himself a utopist arriving at his home in brussels ' suburbs , schuiten parks his vehicle in the garage .
the elegant facade of the old townhouse masks a wood-dominated interior designed in schuiten 's flowing style .
a window stretching over two stories looks out into the lush garden .
schuiten sits down to work in his studio attached to the townhouse .
among all the carefully marked drawers and binders are his sketchbooks that stand at the ready beside hundreds of other books lined up on shelves .
ideas spring to mind quickly , he said .
in a matter of seconds , one tiny sketch can lead to a vast vision for an entire city .

eu-members most affected are demanding that their eu partners share responsibility . during a meeting in stockholm on thursday , eu interior ministers addressed europe 's illegal immigration problem .
all agree that something needs to be done to alleviate the stress on mediterranean countries , but not all can agree how .
" two issues are the most important : one is the creation of a common european asylum system , which would mean that we would have increased solidarity between member states and more shared responsibility , " said sweden 's migration minister tobias billstrom , who led the informal meeting .
" the second thing is the question of legal migration : we need to open more ways for people to come to europe and work here , " billstrom added .
according to eu justice commissioner jacques barrot , all member states support efforts to strengthen the eu border-control agency frontex .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece has come under fire for deporting migrants in need of asylum .
pictured : prime minister costas karamanlis every year , thousands of people from africa , the middle east and central asia risk their lives crossing the mediterranean sea for a chance at a better life in europe . the united nations high commission for refugees estimates that in 2008 alone , more than 67,000 people tried to enter europe illegally via the mediterranean .
the influx has caused a major strain on the reception services of four eu-member states in particular - cyprus , greece , italy and malta - and they have repeatedly called for other european countries to shoulder some of the burden .
more solidarity needed eu leaders first called for greater cooperation with european countries most affected by illegal migration during a june meeting , but they also maintained that such efforts should be voluntary .
critics of that viewpoint , such as cypriot interior minister neoklis sylikiotis , say that relying on voluntary assistance is n't sustainable in the long term .
" it is time that we have more solidarity from the other member countries , " said sylikiotis .
" countries that are the first point of contact should not have to shoulder the entire problem . "
italy 's interior minister roberto maroni shared sylikiotis ' feelings , stating that " burden sharing " should be one of the top priorities for the eu 's new five-year plan on justice issues , also discussed in stockholm .
however , many countries outside of the mediterranean zone believe that instead of focusing on greater cooperation within the eu , the bloc should be working with migrants ' countries of origin to reduce the number of people wanting to leave in the first place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu interior ministers met in stockholm for a meeting on justice and home affairs eu members have often been critized for their handling of illegal migrants , who may not necessarily be escaping economic hardship , but who face political persecution or violence in their homeland .
the un , human rights groups , and the vatican have all publically denounced italy and greece for sending back migrants who were in need of asylum .
the german refugee organization " pro-asylum " has also criticized other eu members for not doing enough .
" countries like germany can no longer sit on their hands ... an unbureaucratic and speedy distribution of those seeking protection - like those stranded in greece - is a question of humanity and solidarity .

eu-members most affected are demanding that their eu partners share responsibility . during a meeting in stockholm on thursday , eu interior ministers addressed europe 's illegal immigration problem .
all agree that something needs to be done to alleviate the stress on mediterranean countries , but not all can agree how .
" two issues are the most important : one is the creation of a common european asylum system , which would mean that we would have increased solidarity between member states and more shared responsibility , " said sweden 's migration minister tobias billstrom , who led the informal meeting .
" the second thing is the question of legal migration : we need to open more ways for people to come to europe and work here , " billstrom added .
according to eu justice commissioner jacques barrot , all member states support efforts to strengthen the eu border-control agency frontex .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece has come under fire for deporting migrants in need of asylum .
pictured : prime minister costas karamanlis every year , thousands of people from africa , the middle east and central asia risk their lives crossing the mediterranean sea for a chance at a better life in europe . the united nations high commission for refugees estimates that in 2008 alone , more than 67,000 people tried to enter europe illegally via the mediterranean .
the influx has caused a major strain on the reception services of four eu-member states in particular - cyprus , greece , italy and malta - and they have repeatedly called for other european countries to shoulder some of the burden .
more solidarity needed eu leaders first called for greater cooperation with european countries most affected by illegal migration during a june meeting , but they also maintained that such efforts should be voluntary .
critics of that viewpoint , such as cypriot interior minister neoklis sylikiotis , say that relying on voluntary assistance is n't sustainable in the long term .
" it is time that we have more solidarity from the other member countries , " said sylikiotis .
" countries that are the first point of contact should not have to shoulder the entire problem . "
italy 's interior minister roberto maroni shared sylikiotis ' feelings , stating that " burden sharing " should be one of the top priorities for the eu 's new five-year plan on justice issues , also discussed in stockholm .
however , many countries outside of the mediterranean zone believe that instead of focusing on greater cooperation within the eu , the bloc should be working with migrants ' countries of origin to reduce the number of people wanting to leave in the first place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu interior ministers met in stockholm for a meeting on justice and home affairs eu members have often been critized for their handling of illegal migrants , who may not necessarily be escaping economic hardship , but who face political persecution or violence in their homeland .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 16.07.2009 iceland 's parliament approves eu membership bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland could become an eu member within three years parliamentarians in iceland have paved the way for accession talks with the european union .
iceland 's government plans to launch its eu membership bid in brussels before the end of this month . the icelandic parliament , the althingi , gave the green light for the government to bid for membership in the european union , with 33 of the nation 's 63 parliamentarians voting in favor of the proposal . a total of 32 votes were required to pass the proposal , but opposition to the move was limited to 28 lawmakers , while another two abstained .
thursday 's narrow victory came as a relief to crisis-stricken prime minister johanna sigurdardottir , who hopes to stabilize iceland 's economy by joining the 27-member bloc .
in the end , however , it will be the citizens of iceland who will have the final word on whether the government pursues membership .
if and when iceland completes successful accession negotiations with the european union , the question will then be put to the people in a referendum .
divisions within the government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister sigurdardottir says only eu membership can save iceland 's economy the governing coalition itself remained divided over the benefits of eu membership for iceland – a country which is dramatically affected by the economic crisis .
while sigurdardottir 's social democrats have always campaigned for joining the bloc , their left-green coalition partners are traditionally opposed to the idea .
five members of the left green party therefore rejected the proposition , including jon bjarnason , the minister of agriculture and fisheries . other left-green deputies including finance minister steingrimur sigfusson , however , displayed political pragmatism by voting for the eu membership application along government lines . " an overwhelming majority wants this eu issue to be dealt with , " sigfusson said .
pros and cons one of the main eu pull factors for the large majority of icelanders is the chance to drop the icelandic krona as a currency .
it shed nearly half its value in the wake of last year 's financial crash , while inflation rose to over 12 percent .
as a small island state with just 320.000 citizens , iceland relies heavily on imports .
the strongest opposition to iceland 's eu membership comes from the fishing and agricultural industries .
they are opposed to handing over the control over iceland 's lucrative fishing grounds to brussels .
" we would no longer be the lawmakers on how we run our fishing industry .
this is the key element for us .
and we just do n't see any need for an application when you know what the outcome is going to be , " said sigurdur sverrisson from the federation of icelandic fishing vessel owners -lrb- liu -rrb- .
if and how iceland could keep the control over this vital part of the economy while having to join the – currently unsuccessful - common eu fisheries policy will be one of the most important and tricky questions during the accession talks .
popular support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurosceptic protests in reykjavik were low-key according to the most recent figures , around 70 percent of icelanders support the launch of eu accession talks .
" i would like to talk and find out what we can get and what we 'd have to give , " is an often-heard comment on reykjavik 's streets these days .
the nation remains divided over the prospect of full membership in the bloc , however , with many citizens complaining about a lack of information .
unlike norway , iceland has never applied to the eu because the majority of politicians were against it .
" what we have seen in the last few months is a shift in political leadership rather than a great shift in the public opinion , although the public opinion for membership of course strengthened due to the economic crisis , " concludes adalsteinn leifsson from reykjavik university .
hope for speedy progress iceland 's foreign minister össur skarpedinsson , a leading social democrat , has already outlined an ambitious agenda for the accession procedures .
iceland plans to launch its application in time for the next meeting of the eu foreign ministers on july 27 .
the fact that iceland is already a member of the european economic area -lrb- eea -rrb- and the border-free schengen zone means accession talks are likely to be relatively short .
around two thirds of all icelandic legislation is already in line with eu rules .
it is widely viewed as favorable for iceland that another nordic country , sweden , currently holds the eu presidency .
" we do n't hide the fact that we want our friends to support us , " said skarpedinsson .
the swedes support a speedy negotiation process with iceland , and eu officials mentioned 2011 or 2012 as possible accession dates .
a referendum will be held , meaning the icelandic citizens will have the last say in the matter .

the strongest opposition to iceland 's eu membership comes from the fishing and agricultural industries .
they are opposed to handing over the control over iceland 's lucrative fishing grounds to brussels .
" we would no longer be the lawmakers on how we run our fishing industry .
this is the key element for us .
and we just do n't see any need for an application when you know what the outcome is going to be , " said sigurdur sverrisson from the federation of icelandic fishing vessel owners -lrb- liu -rrb- .
if and how iceland could keep the control over this vital part of the economy while having to join the – currently unsuccessful - common eu fisheries policy will be one of the most important and tricky questions during the accession talks .
popular support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurosceptic protests in reykjavik were low-key according to the most recent figures , around 70 percent of icelanders support the launch of eu accession talks .
" i would like to talk and find out what we can get and what we 'd have to give , " is an often-heard comment on reykjavik 's streets these days .
the nation remains divided over the prospect of full membership in the bloc , however , with many citizens complaining about a lack of information .
unlike norway , iceland has never applied to the eu because the majority of politicians were against it .
" what we have seen in the last few months is a shift in political leadership rather than a great shift in the public opinion , although the public opinion for membership of course strengthened due to the economic crisis , " concludes adalsteinn leifsson from reykjavik university .
hope for speedy progress iceland 's foreign minister össur skarpedinsson , a leading social democrat , has already outlined an ambitious agenda for the accession procedures .
iceland plans to launch its application in time for the next meeting of the eu foreign ministers on july 27 .
the fact that iceland is already a member of the european economic area -lrb- eea -rrb- and the border-free schengen zone means accession talks are likely to be relatively short .
around two thirds of all icelandic legislation is already in line with eu rules .
it is widely viewed as favorable for iceland that another nordic country , sweden , currently holds the eu presidency .
" we do n't hide the fact that we want our friends to support us , " said skarpedinsson .
the swedes support a speedy negotiation process with iceland , and eu officials mentioned 2011 or 2012 as possible accession dates .
a referendum will be held , meaning the icelandic citizens will have the last say in the matter .

the two leaders also addressed the touchy topic of human rights . the two leaders met near the southern city of munich before being joined by key members of both governments , including the ministers for the interior , environment and economy . the killing of russian human rights activist natalya estemirova in chechnya on wednesday featured prominently in the meeting .
speaking at a news conference with russian president dmitry medvedev on thursday , german chancellor angela merkel described estemirova 's killing as an " unacceptable event . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estemirova 's killing has sparked international outrage merkel said that the murder had " played a role " in her talks with the russian president , who she said had assured her that " everything would be done to clear everything up . "
estemirova was the latest in a string of campaigners to be killed in russia .
thursday 's talks were part of the semi-annual top-level intergovernmental consultations between the two countries known as the " petersburg dialog . "
merkel signals support for magna-sberbank bid the two leaders also discussed foreign policy issues such as iran and north korea and the fight against terrorism , human trafficking and organized crime .
but the meeting was dominated by the two countries ' substantial and growing economic ties which have been hit by the global financial crisis . germany is russia 's single biggest trading partner with bilateral turnover amounting to around 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- last year .

she said it presents " excellent starting points " but added that her government still needs to " clear up " questions .
berlin agreed in late may to support a bid for a majority stake in opel by magna , which has teamed up with state-owned russian bank sberbank and russia 's second-largest auto maker gaz . an estimated 26,000 german jobs are at stake .
medvedev said his government supported the magna-sberbank bid for opel .
" we are interested and optimistic about this project and will do everything to realize it , " he said .
but general motors has also received interest from brussels-based investment group rhj international and from china 's beijing automotive industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- for opel , throwing the deal into some doubt .
trade issues dominate the two governments also signed a slew of economic partnership deals , including a 500-million-euro -lrb- $ 357 million -rrb- credit agreement .
the agreements included a joint declaration on energy cooperation and an agreement between russian railways and siemens to establish a joint venture to produce locomotives .
in addition , frankfurt airport operator fraport is to participate in the expansion of the airport in st petersburg .
the two leaders did not comment on news reports that russian oil giant gazprom is interested in a takeover of bankrupt german shipyards in the northern cities of wismar and rostock .

the two leaders also addressed the touchy topic of human rights . the two leaders met near the southern city of munich before being joined by key members of both governments , including the ministers for the interior , environment and economy . the killing of russian human rights activist natalya estemirova in chechnya on wednesday featured prominently in the meeting .
speaking at a news conference with russian president dmitry medvedev on thursday , german chancellor angela merkel described estemirova 's killing as an " unacceptable event . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estemirova 's killing has sparked international outrage merkel said that the murder had " played a role " in her talks with the russian president , who she said had assured her that " everything would be done to clear everything up . "
estemirova was the latest in a string of campaigners to be killed in russia .
thursday 's talks were part of the semi-annual top-level intergovernmental consultations between the two countries known as the " petersburg dialog . "
merkel signals support for magna-sberbank bid the two leaders also discussed foreign policy issues such as iran and north korea and the fight against terrorism , human trafficking and organized crime .
but the meeting was dominated by the two countries ' substantial and growing economic ties which have been hit by the global financial crisis . germany is russia 's single biggest trading partner with bilateral turnover amounting to around 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- last year .
but sergei prikhodko , the kremlin 's chief foreign policy aide , told reporters this week that trade between germany and russia more than halved in the first quarter of 2009 compared with the same period last year .
merkel said the strategic partnership between russia and germany is a " central element " in overcoming the economic crisis .
a pressing economic issue was the possible takeover of troubled german carmaker opel by russian-backed canadian auto parts maker magna international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's sberbank , together with canada 's magna , is interested in troubled car maker opel merkel appeared to back the magna-sberbank bid .
she said it presents " excellent starting points " but added that her government still needs to " clear up " questions .
berlin agreed in late may to support a bid for a majority stake in opel by magna , which has teamed up with state-owned russian bank sberbank and russia 's second-largest auto maker gaz . an estimated 26,000 german jobs are at stake .
medvedev said his government supported the magna-sberbank bid for opel .
" we are interested and optimistic about this project and will do everything to realize it , " he said .
but general motors has also received interest from brussels-based investment group rhj international and from china 's beijing automotive industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- for opel , throwing the deal into some doubt .
trade issues dominate the two governments also signed a slew of economic partnership deals , including a 500-million-euro -lrb- $ 357 million -rrb- credit agreement .
the agreements included a joint declaration on energy cooperation and an agreement between russian railways and siemens to establish a joint venture to produce locomotives .
in addition , frankfurt airport operator fraport is to participate in the expansion of the airport in st petersburg .
the two leaders did not comment on news reports that russian oil giant gazprom is interested in a takeover of bankrupt german shipyards in the northern cities of wismar and rostock .
energy security on the agenda the two leaders also discussed energy security issues .
russia supplies a quarters of europe 's gas needs and germany is europe 's biggest customer for russian gas .
merkel signaled that she was keen to avoid another row with russia over gas supplies .
the german leader stressed the importance of the nord stream gas pipeline , an ambitious project to deliver siberian gas to europe under the baltic sea .
" we think this project is strategically important and necessary , " merkel said .
russia says the nord stream gas pipeline is part of its plan to increase gas volumes and step up the reliability of russian gas supplies to europe , now largely dependent on russia 's thorny political relations with ex-soviet ukraine. sp / dpa / reuters / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's sberbank , together with canada 's magna , is interested in troubled car maker opel merkel appeared to back the magna-sberbank bid .
she said it presents " excellent starting points " but added that her government still needs to " clear up " questions .
berlin agreed in late may to support a bid for a majority stake in opel by magna , which has teamed up with state-owned russian bank sberbank and russia 's second-largest auto maker gaz . an estimated 26,000 german jobs are at stake .
medvedev said his government supported the magna-sberbank bid for opel .
" we are interested and optimistic about this project and will do everything to realize it , " he said .
but general motors has also received interest from brussels-based investment group rhj international and from china 's beijing automotive industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- for opel , throwing the deal into some doubt .
trade issues dominate the two governments also signed a slew of economic partnership deals , including a 500-million-euro -lrb- $ 357 million -rrb- credit agreement .
the agreements included a joint declaration on energy cooperation and an agreement between russian railways and siemens to establish a joint venture to produce locomotives .
in addition , frankfurt airport operator fraport is to participate in the expansion of the airport in st petersburg .
the two leaders did not comment on news reports that russian oil giant gazprom is interested in a takeover of bankrupt german shipyards in the northern cities of wismar and rostock .
energy security on the agenda the two leaders also discussed energy security issues .
russia supplies a quarters of europe 's gas needs and germany is europe 's biggest customer for russian gas .
merkel signaled that she was keen to avoid another row with russia over gas supplies .
the german leader stressed the importance of the nord stream gas pipeline , an ambitious project to deliver siberian gas to europe under the baltic sea .
" we think this project is strategically important and necessary , " merkel said .
russia says the nord stream gas pipeline is part of its plan to increase gas volumes and step up the reliability of russian gas supplies to europe , now largely dependent on russia 's thorny political relations with ex-soviet ukraine. sp / dpa / reuters / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at the beginning of the 1990s , the government introduced a new family planning policy .
it included concrete goals for reducing the birth-rate by using more modern methods of contraception .
hanoi also called on help from germany . the german organisation for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , the kfw , a german government-owned development bank and inwent , a german capacity-building non-profit organisation , have been supporting the vietnamese ministry of health since 1994 .
" the different institutes work practically hand-in-hand , ” explains günther riethmacher , gtz country director in hanoi .
“ the gtz does consulting and helps build up consulting points by training personnel .
the kfw invests in the infrastructure , and for example provides money to supply contraception . ”
“ the german development service has individual experts that offer advice at a provincial level and inwent gives courses about how health policy can become part of national strategy .

family planning needs to be key priority the high abortion rate has also been halved .
this is another indication that the efforts to provide advice have paid off .
such successes can only happen if family planning is a key priority of the partner country .
riethmacher says this is certainly the case in vietnam : " what can be said over and over is that we have been well received and what is also important for the success of other projects is that the vietnamese government follows its own development policies and then seeks individual countries , such as germany , to help it promote its development work . ”

at the beginning of the 1990s , the government introduced a new family planning policy .
it included concrete goals for reducing the birth-rate by using more modern methods of contraception .
hanoi also called on help from germany . the german organisation for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , the kfw , a german government-owned development bank and inwent , a german capacity-building non-profit organisation , have been supporting the vietnamese ministry of health since 1994 .
" the different institutes work practically hand-in-hand , ” explains günther riethmacher , gtz country director in hanoi .
“ the gtz does consulting and helps build up consulting points by training personnel .
the kfw invests in the infrastructure , and for example provides money to supply contraception . ”
“ the german development service has individual experts that offer advice at a provincial level and inwent gives courses about how health policy can become part of national strategy .
each institute brings its own expertise to such programmes . ”
significant results in 15 years the results are significant .
the average birth-rate has gone down to 1.9 children per family over the past 15 years .
“ advice on contraception , on condoms as well as the pill , is well accepted .
three out of four married women now admit they use contraception .
that ’ s similar to the figure in germany . “ promoting the use of condoms can kill two birds with one stone - this cheap and easy form of contraception helps reduce pregnancies and also prevent sexually-transmitted diseases , including hiv-aids .
general awareness campaigns about hiv-aids have been very successful : “ 90 percent of the population now admits they know the main ways of getting infected .
we measure our achievements according to these concrete things and then we can really say that something has happened and we have made a positive contribution . ”
family planning needs to be key priority the high abortion rate has also been halved .
this is another indication that the efforts to provide advice have paid off .
such successes can only happen if family planning is a key priority of the partner country .
riethmacher says this is certainly the case in vietnam : " what can be said over and over is that we have been well received and what is also important for the success of other projects is that the vietnamese government follows its own development policies and then seeks individual countries , such as germany , to help it promote its development work . ”
germany also offers advice on family planning policy in other asian countries , such as pakistan and the philippines .

according to chinese media reports , the nigerian businessman had overstayed his visa .
the case - the first of its kind - has highlighted the plight of the growing number of african immigrants in china . officially , some 20,000 africans live in china , mostly traders and students .
but unofficial estimates suggest that 20,000 might be living in the southern city of guangzhou alone .
most are from nigeria .
alexander demissie , an ethiopian who does research on african-chinese relations at bochum university in germany , explains : “ basically , they are middlemen .
they set the connection between the chinese manufacturers and the african traders .
most of the time , these nigerians living in guangzhou are highly-educated and speak very good chinese because they studied at the universities . ”
“ sun yatsen university in guangzhou is one of the famous universities where you can find a lot of african students .
it ’ s of course easier for them to have access to the chinese market because of the language .
this helps the african traders coming to china for two weeks or three weeks to buy goods . ”
as china has been very keen on promoting trade and political relations with african countries , visa regulations tend to be generous , says demissie : “ people can easily get a chinese visa , as soon as they can prove that they are traders or students . ”
he adds that this incident should not have happened and says such problems are unusual .
police is tougher with africans on the other hand , he says , the police does tend to be tough with african immigrants and “ africans do face harsher controls inside china than people from other countries . ”
he wenping , an africa specialist at the chinese academy of social sciences in beijing , says that many africans are better integrated in china than westerners .
“ the africans , both traders and students find it easier to overcome the language barrier than europeans and americans . ”
“ i ’ ve come across so many people who speak perfectly fluent chinese .
they find it easier to master the different tones we have in our chinese pronunciation .
they easily adapt to the local environment in the chinese cities , and chinese food is no problem for them . ”
africans not always accepted by chinese society but alexander demissie , who has also lived in china , says other issues can create difficulties : “ from my own experience , it ’ s not easy as an african to have a chinese girlfriend , for example .
of course , if you live in one country , you will take part in the social life , you might also get a chinese girlfriend and so on . ”
but he says people around might not consider this in a friendly light , adding that some people act rudely or badly towards africans in china .
demissie says there are also occasional street fights between groups of africans and of chinese , and that there is a general lack of knowledge about africa among ordinary people in china .
but with growing exposure through trade and political links , this seems likely to change in the foreseeable future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 16.07.2009 more & more african immigrants in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of african students and traders in china is increasing steadily more than 100 africans protested for hours outside a police station in china 's guangzhou city on wednesday after a nigerian man fell to his death trying to escape from a visa check .
according to chinese media reports , the nigerian businessman had overstayed his visa .
the case - the first of its kind - has highlighted the plight of the growing number of african immigrants in china . officially , some 20,000 africans live in china , mostly traders and students .
but unofficial estimates suggest that 20,000 might be living in the southern city of guangzhou alone .
most are from nigeria .
alexander demissie , an ethiopian who does research on african-chinese relations at bochum university in germany , explains : “ basically , they are middlemen .
they set the connection between the chinese manufacturers and the african traders .
most of the time , these nigerians living in guangzhou are highly-educated and speak very good chinese because they studied at the universities . ”
“ sun yatsen university in guangzhou is one of the famous universities where you can find a lot of african students .
it ’ s of course easier for them to have access to the chinese market because of the language .
this helps the african traders coming to china for two weeks or three weeks to buy goods . ”
as china has been very keen on promoting trade and political relations with african countries , visa regulations tend to be generous , says demissie : “ people can easily get a chinese visa , as soon as they can prove that they are traders or students . ”
he adds that this incident should not have happened and says such problems are unusual .
police is tougher with africans on the other hand , he says , the police does tend to be tough with african immigrants and “ africans do face harsher controls inside china than people from other countries . ”
he wenping , an africa specialist at the chinese academy of social sciences in beijing , says that many africans are better integrated in china than westerners .
“ the africans , both traders and students find it easier to overcome the language barrier than europeans and americans . ”
“ i ’ ve come across so many people who speak perfectly fluent chinese .
they find it easier to master the different tones we have in our chinese pronunciation .
they easily adapt to the local environment in the chinese cities , and chinese food is no problem for them . ”
africans not always accepted by chinese society but alexander demissie , who has also lived in china , says other issues can create difficulties : “ from my own experience , it ’ s not easy as an african to have a chinese girlfriend , for example .
of course , if you live in one country , you will take part in the social life , you might also get a chinese girlfriend and so on . ”
but he says people around might not consider this in a friendly light , adding that some people act rudely or badly towards africans in china .
demissie says there are also occasional street fights between groups of africans and of chinese , and that there is a general lack of knowledge about africa among ordinary people in china .
but with growing exposure through trade and political links , this seems likely to change in the foreseeable future .

at the beginning of the 1990s , the government introduced a new family planning policy .
it included concrete goals for reducing the birth-rate by using more modern methods of contraception .
hanoi also called on help from germany . the german organisation for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , the kfw , a german government-owned development bank and inwent , a german capacity-building non-profit organisation , have been supporting the vietnamese ministry of health since 1994 .
" the different institutes work practically hand-in-hand , ” explains günther riethmacher , gtz country director in hanoi .
“ the gtz does consulting and helps build up consulting points by training personnel .
the kfw invests in the infrastructure , and for example provides money to supply contraception . ”
“ the german development service has individual experts that offer advice at a provincial level and inwent gives courses about how health policy can become part of national strategy .
each institute brings its own expertise to such programmes . ”
significant results in 15 years the results are significant .
the average birth-rate has gone down to 1.9 children per family over the past 15 years .
“ advice on contraception , on condoms as well as the pill , is well accepted .
three out of four married women now admit they use contraception .
that ’ s similar to the figure in germany . “ promoting the use of condoms can kill two birds with one stone - this cheap and easy form of contraception helps reduce pregnancies and also prevent sexually-transmitted diseases , including hiv-aids .
general awareness campaigns about hiv-aids have been very successful : “ 90 percent of the population now admits they know the main ways of getting infected .
we measure our achievements according to these concrete things and then we can really say that something has happened and we have made a positive contribution . ”
family planning needs to be key priority the high abortion rate has also been halved .
this is another indication that the efforts to provide advice have paid off .
such successes can only happen if family planning is a key priority of the partner country .
riethmacher says this is certainly the case in vietnam : " what can be said over and over is that we have been well received and what is also important for the success of other projects is that the vietnamese government follows its own development policies and then seeks individual countries , such as germany , to help it promote its development work . ”
germany also offers advice on family planning policy in other asian countries , such as pakistan and the philippines .

iceland 's government plans to launch its eu membership bid in brussels before the end of this month . the icelandic parliament , the althingi , gave the green light for the government to bid for membership in the european union , with 33 of the nation 's 63 parliamentarians voting in favor of the proposal . a total of 32 votes were required to pass the proposal , but opposition to the move was limited to 28 lawmakers , while another two abstained .
thursday 's narrow victory came as a relief to crisis-stricken prime minister johanna sigurdardottir , who hopes to stabilize iceland 's economy by joining the 27-member bloc .
in the end , however , it will be the citizens of iceland who will have the final word on whether the government pursues membership .

divisions within the government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister sigurdardottir says only eu membership can save iceland 's economy the governing coalition itself remained divided over the benefits of eu membership for iceland – a country which is dramatically affected by the economic crisis .
while sigurdardottir 's social democrats have always campaigned for joining the bloc , their left-green coalition partners are traditionally opposed to the idea .
five members of the left green party therefore rejected the proposition , including jon bjarnason , the minister of agriculture and fisheries . other left-green deputies including finance minister steingrimur sigfusson , however , displayed political pragmatism by voting for the eu membership application along government lines . " an overwhelming majority wants this eu issue to be dealt with , " sigfusson said .
pros and cons one of the main eu pull factors for the large majority of icelanders is the chance to drop the icelandic krona as a currency .

as a small island state with just 320.000 citizens , iceland relies heavily on imports .
the strongest opposition to iceland 's eu membership comes from the fishing and agricultural industries .
they are opposed to handing over the control over iceland 's lucrative fishing grounds to brussels .
" we would no longer be the lawmakers on how we run our fishing industry .
this is the key element for us .

if and how iceland could keep the control over this vital part of the economy while having to join the – currently unsuccessful - common eu fisheries policy will be one of the most important and tricky questions during the accession talks .

"
estemirova 's murder " draws attention to the necessity of protecting human rights defenders in russia , " the council 's statement added .
the council 's statement follows a similar condemnation from the eu presidency , currently held by sweden , which took over the rotating six-month presidency of the 27-nation bloc on july 1 .
" we condemn that brutal act and call for the authorities to try to establish who is responsible and take the action that is called for , " said swedish foreign minister carl bildt .
" the presidency urges the russian authorities to swiftly and thoroughly investigate the murder of natalya estemirova and to bring the perpetrators to justice .
her murder draws attention to the necessity of protecting human rights defenders in russia . "
the newly elected president of the european parliament , jerzy buzek , also called on moscow to investigate the murder .
" we in the european parliament have appreciated her work in the fields of human rights , promoting democratic accountability and the implementation of the rule of law , " he said .
" we strongly call on the authorities of the russian federation to start a fully fledged inquiry into her death and do their utmost to bring those responsible for this tragic death to face justice . "

" the murder of our human rights activist is of course a very sad event , " medvedev said . " in contrast to earlier incidences , it is clear in this case : the murder was connected to her activity -lrb- as an activist -rrb- . "
" she spoke the truth and openly , sometimes toughly described some processes that happen in this country , " medvedev added .
" that is the value of a rights activist - even if these things are not pleasant and uncomfortable for the authorities . "
merkel told reporters gathered at munich 's schleissheim palace that the killing was " an unacceptable event . "
" i think that on the russian side , everything must be done to catch the killer , " she said .

" natalia estemirova was a courageous fighter for human rights in the north caucasus .
those behind the act must now be quickly captured and the planners exposed , " steinmeier added .
the leaders of the greens bloc in the eu assembly also released a statement .
" we deplore the cowardly murder of the exceptional and dedicated human rights activist natalya estemirova , " the statement read .
the statement called " for a full and independent investigation into her abduction and murder .
the russian judiciary system must put an end to its dismal track record on such cases and for once act urgently and with due diligence . "
estemirova , 50 , was abducted on wednesday morning by unknown persons after leaving her home in grozny , the capital of the republic of chechnya .
her body was found near the city of nazran in ingushetia , the region bordering on chechnya , itar-tass news agency said , citing the regional interior ministry .

" we in the european parliament have appreciated her work in the fields of human rights , promoting democratic accountability and the implementation of the rule of law , " he said .
" we strongly call on the authorities of the russian federation to start a fully fledged inquiry into her death and do their utmost to bring those responsible for this tragic death to face justice . "

" she spoke the truth and openly , sometimes toughly described some processes that happen in this country , " medvedev added .
" that is the value of a rights activist - even if these things are not pleasant and uncomfortable for the authorities . "

the leaders of the greens bloc in the eu assembly also released a statement .
" we deplore the cowardly murder of the exceptional and dedicated human rights activist natalya estemirova , " the statement read .
the statement called " for a full and independent investigation into her abduction and murder .
the russian judiciary system must put an end to its dismal track record on such cases and for once act urgently and with due diligence . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 16.07.2009 belgium seeks caps on public financing for royal family großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seventy percent of belgians believe that too much tax money goes to the royal family belgian lawmakers are drafting a bill to reduce the amount of public money being spent to support the royal family , which currently receives 12 million euros per year . while the royal family still finds broad support in the country , many people agree that their government allowance should be reduced .
citing a profact agency study , afp reported that " seventy percent of belgians find that too much tax money goes to the royal family , and one-third want to get rid of the government allowance altogether . "
the debate over whether or not the government should restrict the number of royal family members receiving a government allowance first arose in the senate ten years ago . however , reforms failed to pass without a political majority , and the debate died down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law on royal financing would not affect king albert , queen paola , or their three children one reason the issue has come up again , according to christian laporte , royal watcher for la libre belgique , is that the royal family keeps expanding .
" the debate was always present , of course , in the society , and there is also another important fact for tomorrow , and that fact is that there are now not just three princes , but twelve or thirteen , " said laporte .
this same concern has been echoed across europe .
therefore , when public debate over royal financing was re-ignited in belgium ten months ago , lawmakers decided to call-in constitutional experts from other european monarchies to help reach a compromise . in the proposed law , all monarchs would be banned from receiving state cash and perks - except for the monarch , his or her spouse , and heir to the throne .
however , the changes would not go into effect until the end of king albert 's reign , which means all three of his children will still be entitled to government stipends for the rest of their lives .
two years ago , king albert 's youngest son , prince laurent caused a stir when he was alleged to have used taxpayers ' money to refurbish his villa .
however , royal watcher christian laporte says that the prince was never convicted of the allegations in court . " we could n't say that prince laurent has problems , because he has not been condemned .
he went alone to give testimony , and he went out of the court as free as when he came in - of course , " said laporte . flemish nationalists have been some of the most outspoken opponents of the monarchy - and as separatists - reject it as a symbol of belgian unity .
a couple of flemish politicians have sparked controversy with their remarks on the royal family .
on his first day on the job , flemish parliamentary speaker jan peumans announced that he refused to attend any royal receptions .
" it 's very simple , " peumans remarked .
" i promised my father i would n't do things like this .
if other people want to go – no problem – i would never accept a belgian medal either .
it 's my right . "
in addition to the 12 million euros per year in pay and benefits that the royal family reportedly receives , flemish nationalist lawmaker jan jambon has claimed that they get another 16 million euros in hidden costs from other government budgets .
a republican movement was also founded by french-speaking belgians , but it does not appear to have gained much momentum .
the draft bill to cap royal allowances by contrast has found broad bi-partisan support .

eu-members most affected are demanding that their eu partners share responsibility . during a meeting in stockholm on thursday , eu interior ministers addressed europe 's illegal immigration problem .
all agree that something needs to be done to alleviate the stress on mediterranean countries , but not all can agree how .
" two issues are the most important : one is the creation of a common european asylum system , which would mean that we would have increased solidarity between member states and more shared responsibility , " said sweden 's migration minister tobias billstrom , who led the informal meeting .
" the second thing is the question of legal migration : we need to open more ways for people to come to europe and work here , " billstrom added .
according to eu justice commissioner jacques barrot , all member states support efforts to strengthen the eu border-control agency frontex .

the influx has caused a major strain on the reception services of four eu-member states in particular - cyprus , greece , italy and malta - and they have repeatedly called for other european countries to shoulder some of the burden .
more solidarity needed eu leaders first called for greater cooperation with european countries most affected by illegal migration during a june meeting , but they also maintained that such efforts should be voluntary .
critics of that viewpoint , such as cypriot interior minister neoklis sylikiotis , say that relying on voluntary assistance is n't sustainable in the long term .
" it is time that we have more solidarity from the other member countries , " said sylikiotis .
" countries that are the first point of contact should not have to shoulder the entire problem . "
italy 's interior minister roberto maroni shared sylikiotis ' feelings , stating that " burden sharing " should be one of the top priorities for the eu 's new five-year plan on justice issues , also discussed in stockholm .
however , many countries outside of the mediterranean zone believe that instead of focusing on greater cooperation within the eu , the bloc should be working with migrants ' countries of origin to reduce the number of people wanting to leave in the first place .

eu-members most affected are demanding that their eu partners share responsibility . during a meeting in stockholm on thursday , eu interior ministers addressed europe 's illegal immigration problem .
all agree that something needs to be done to alleviate the stress on mediterranean countries , but not all can agree how .
" two issues are the most important : one is the creation of a common european asylum system , which would mean that we would have increased solidarity between member states and more shared responsibility , " said sweden 's migration minister tobias billstrom , who led the informal meeting .
" the second thing is the question of legal migration : we need to open more ways for people to come to europe and work here , " billstrom added .
according to eu justice commissioner jacques barrot , all member states support efforts to strengthen the eu border-control agency frontex .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece has come under fire for deporting migrants in need of asylum .
pictured : prime minister costas karamanlis every year , thousands of people from africa , the middle east and central asia risk their lives crossing the mediterranean sea for a chance at a better life in europe . the united nations high commission for refugees estimates that in 2008 alone , more than 67,000 people tried to enter europe illegally via the mediterranean .
the influx has caused a major strain on the reception services of four eu-member states in particular - cyprus , greece , italy and malta - and they have repeatedly called for other european countries to shoulder some of the burden .
more solidarity needed eu leaders first called for greater cooperation with european countries most affected by illegal migration during a june meeting , but they also maintained that such efforts should be voluntary .
critics of that viewpoint , such as cypriot interior minister neoklis sylikiotis , say that relying on voluntary assistance is n't sustainable in the long term .
" it is time that we have more solidarity from the other member countries , " said sylikiotis .
" countries that are the first point of contact should not have to shoulder the entire problem . "
italy 's interior minister roberto maroni shared sylikiotis ' feelings , stating that " burden sharing " should be one of the top priorities for the eu 's new five-year plan on justice issues , also discussed in stockholm .
however , many countries outside of the mediterranean zone believe that instead of focusing on greater cooperation within the eu , the bloc should be working with migrants ' countries of origin to reduce the number of people wanting to leave in the first place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu interior ministers met in stockholm for a meeting on justice and home affairs eu members have often been critized for their handling of illegal migrants , who may not necessarily be escaping economic hardship , but who face political persecution or violence in their homeland .
the un , human rights groups , and the vatican have all publically denounced italy and greece for sending back migrants who were in need of asylum .
the german refugee organization " pro-asylum " has also criticized other eu members for not doing enough .

the move comes just 10 weeks before national elections in germany .
carstensen said lawmakers were expected to vote on the dissolution in the capital kiel on monday , and that he wanted to call an early election on sept .
27 to coincide with the federal election .
social democrats to resist dissolution however , the spd has pledged to vote against the proposal for dissolution of the parliament .
without a two-thirds majority vote , the proposal will not succeed . " the spd will stick to the coalition agreement .
there is no reason to dissolve the state assembly , " the spd 's state leader ralf stegener told german television .
" if the state premier does n't think he can carry on , he can resign . " premier carstensen however said he had tried hard to work with the spd and had informed his fellow christian democrat chancellor angela merkel of the dire situation in the state . " what i 've gone through in the last weeks brings one to the edge , " carstensen said . state coalition woes mirror those of federal government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's grand coalition between the conservatives and social democrats has been strained the two parties have ruled together in an awkward coalition since 2005 .
they have clashed over bonus payments to banking executives at the state-owned hsh nordbank and malfunctions at the kruemmel nuclear power plant . schleswig-holstein 's coalition woes mirrors bickering in the federal grand coalition and could signal an end to the cdu-spd partnership after the election . the deputy chairman of the cdu 's federal parliamentary group , wolfgang bosbach , said threat of a stalemate in schleswig-holstein highlights the fact that germany 's two major parties are uncomfortable bedfellows . " this is a signal for berlin , " bosbach told the online edition of newspaper handelsblatt .
" the call for a new election shows that a grand coalition is not a permanent solution . "
merkel is appealing to voters to use september 's federal election to dump the spd and allow the cdu to form a coalition government with the liberal free democrats. sp / dpa / ap / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" i 'm an architect and a utopist , " said luc schuiten .
the architect lives and works in brussels and believes that the city , like so many others , has no future if something does not change soon .
" you can not feel good in light of all the environmental pollution and the grim perspectives for the future , " said the 65-year-old visionary .
" so , i try to envision alternatives . "
for the first time ever , drafts and designs by the relatively unknown architect are on display in a large show in brussels .
the entrance to the " vegetal city " installation is composed of an archway made of branches adorned with little yellow lights that blink to the sound of a heartbeat pulsing from speakers .

none of schuiten 's visions have yet been turned into reality , even though many of them could be realized if someone had the courage to do so , he said .
the architect has , however , been designing and building private energy-efficient homes made from environmental materials since the 1970s .
nature is his inspiration .
" nature is the only thing that is sustainable , and when we use living materials to build our homes , we are automatically developing things further by employing that same sustainability , " the architect said .

on the road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the man and his car-bike - advertising his show in brussels to advertise his visions to a larger public , the architect began driving an electric-powered three-wheeler around the city of brussels .
the two-seater vehicle with the exhibition logo on the side looks like a combination of recumbent bicycle and car , and is steered using two joysticks .
" no noise , no pollution , " the designer said as he eased the vehicle from the sidewalk into the street , catching the glances of curious pedestrians and car drivers along the way .
" when i travel more than 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- , i have to pedal , " he explains .
" but i love pedaling - it keeps me in shape .
i can also conserve energy as i travel , and can have fun all at the same time . "

" i 'm an architect and a utopist , " said luc schuiten .
the architect lives and works in brussels and believes that the city , like so many others , has no future if something does not change soon .
" you can not feel good in light of all the environmental pollution and the grim perspectives for the future , " said the 65-year-old visionary .
" so , i try to envision alternatives . "
for the first time ever , drafts and designs by the relatively unknown architect are on display in a large show in brussels .
the entrance to the " vegetal city " installation is composed of an archway made of branches adorned with little yellow lights that blink to the sound of a heartbeat pulsing from speakers .
beyond the entrance , visitors will find architectural models and drawings of balanced , colorful , almost fairy tale-like cities and people who have managed to live in harmony with nature .
round , flowing shapes that weave into one another are schuiten 's trademark .

he would like to create green areas that span over walkways and platforms and up the sides of buildings .
" the idea is that the vegetation here can be used as herbal or plant sculptures that exude a sense of poetry , " he mused .
" they are a space to withdraw to , a peaceful place where we can discover what we are missing - nature . "
none of schuiten 's visions have yet been turned into reality , even though many of them could be realized if someone had the courage to do so , he said .
the architect has , however , been designing and building private energy-efficient homes made from environmental materials since the 1970s .
nature is his inspiration .

eu-members most affected are demanding that their eu partners share responsibility . during a meeting in stockholm on thursday , eu interior ministers addressed europe 's illegal immigration problem .
all agree that something needs to be done to alleviate the stress on mediterranean countries , but not all can agree how .
" two issues are the most important : one is the creation of a common european asylum system , which would mean that we would have increased solidarity between member states and more shared responsibility , " said sweden 's migration minister tobias billstrom , who led the informal meeting .
" the second thing is the question of legal migration : we need to open more ways for people to come to europe and work here , " billstrom added .
according to eu justice commissioner jacques barrot , all member states support efforts to strengthen the eu border-control agency frontex .

the influx has caused a major strain on the reception services of four eu-member states in particular - cyprus , greece , italy and malta - and they have repeatedly called for other european countries to shoulder some of the burden .
more solidarity needed eu leaders first called for greater cooperation with european countries most affected by illegal migration during a june meeting , but they also maintained that such efforts should be voluntary .
critics of that viewpoint , such as cypriot interior minister neoklis sylikiotis , say that relying on voluntary assistance is n't sustainable in the long term .
" it is time that we have more solidarity from the other member countries , " said sylikiotis .
" countries that are the first point of contact should not have to shoulder the entire problem . "
italy 's interior minister roberto maroni shared sylikiotis ' feelings , stating that " burden sharing " should be one of the top priorities for the eu 's new five-year plan on justice issues , also discussed in stockholm .

the two leaders also addressed the touchy topic of human rights . the two leaders met near the southern city of munich before being joined by key members of both governments , including the ministers for the interior , environment and economy . the killing of russian human rights activist natalya estemirova in chechnya on wednesday featured prominently in the meeting .
speaking at a news conference with russian president dmitry medvedev on thursday , german chancellor angela merkel described estemirova 's killing as an " unacceptable event . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estemirova 's killing has sparked international outrage merkel said that the murder had " played a role " in her talks with the russian president , who she said had assured her that " everything would be done to clear everything up . "
estemirova was the latest in a string of campaigners to be killed in russia .
thursday 's talks were part of the semi-annual top-level intergovernmental consultations between the two countries known as the " petersburg dialog . "
merkel signals support for magna-sberbank bid the two leaders also discussed foreign policy issues such as iran and north korea and the fight against terrorism , human trafficking and organized crime .
but the meeting was dominated by the two countries ' substantial and growing economic ties which have been hit by the global financial crisis . germany is russia 's single biggest trading partner with bilateral turnover amounting to around 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- last year .
but sergei prikhodko , the kremlin 's chief foreign policy aide , told reporters this week that trade between germany and russia more than halved in the first quarter of 2009 compared with the same period last year .
merkel said the strategic partnership between russia and germany is a " central element " in overcoming the economic crisis .
a pressing economic issue was the possible takeover of troubled german carmaker opel by russian-backed canadian auto parts maker magna international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's sberbank , together with canada 's magna , is interested in troubled car maker opel merkel appeared to back the magna-sberbank bid .
she said it presents " excellent starting points " but added that her government still needs to " clear up " questions .
berlin agreed in late may to support a bid for a majority stake in opel by magna , which has teamed up with state-owned russian bank sberbank and russia 's second-largest auto maker gaz . an estimated 26,000 german jobs are at stake .
medvedev said his government supported the magna-sberbank bid for opel .
" we are interested and optimistic about this project and will do everything to realize it , " he said .
but general motors has also received interest from brussels-based investment group rhj international and from china 's beijing automotive industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- for opel , throwing the deal into some doubt .
trade issues dominate the two governments also signed a slew of economic partnership deals , including a 500-million-euro -lrb- $ 357 million -rrb- credit agreement .
the agreements included a joint declaration on energy cooperation and an agreement between russian railways and siemens to establish a joint venture to produce locomotives .
in addition , frankfurt airport operator fraport is to participate in the expansion of the airport in st petersburg .
the two leaders did not comment on news reports that russian oil giant gazprom is interested in a takeover of bankrupt german shipyards in the northern cities of wismar and rostock .
energy security on the agenda the two leaders also discussed energy security issues .
russia supplies a quarters of europe 's gas needs and germany is europe 's biggest customer for russian gas .
merkel signaled that she was keen to avoid another row with russia over gas supplies .
the german leader stressed the importance of the nord stream gas pipeline , an ambitious project to deliver siberian gas to europe under the baltic sea .
" we think this project is strategically important and necessary , " merkel said .
russia says the nord stream gas pipeline is part of its plan to increase gas volumes and step up the reliability of russian gas supplies to europe , now largely dependent on russia 's thorny political relations with ex-soviet ukraine. sp / dpa / reuters / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the two leaders also addressed the touchy topic of human rights . the two leaders met near the southern city of munich before being joined by key members of both governments , including the ministers for the interior , environment and economy . the killing of russian human rights activist natalya estemirova in chechnya on wednesday featured prominently in the meeting .
speaking at a news conference with russian president dmitry medvedev on thursday , german chancellor angela merkel described estemirova 's killing as an " unacceptable event . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estemirova 's killing has sparked international outrage merkel said that the murder had " played a role " in her talks with the russian president , who she said had assured her that " everything would be done to clear everything up . "
estemirova was the latest in a string of campaigners to be killed in russia .
thursday 's talks were part of the semi-annual top-level intergovernmental consultations between the two countries known as the " petersburg dialog . "
merkel signals support for magna-sberbank bid the two leaders also discussed foreign policy issues such as iran and north korea and the fight against terrorism , human trafficking and organized crime .
but the meeting was dominated by the two countries ' substantial and growing economic ties which have been hit by the global financial crisis . germany is russia 's single biggest trading partner with bilateral turnover amounting to around 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- last year .
but sergei prikhodko , the kremlin 's chief foreign policy aide , told reporters this week that trade between germany and russia more than halved in the first quarter of 2009 compared with the same period last year .
merkel said the strategic partnership between russia and germany is a " central element " in overcoming the economic crisis .
a pressing economic issue was the possible takeover of troubled german carmaker opel by russian-backed canadian auto parts maker magna international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's sberbank , together with canada 's magna , is interested in troubled car maker opel merkel appeared to back the magna-sberbank bid .
she said it presents " excellent starting points " but added that her government still needs to " clear up " questions .
berlin agreed in late may to support a bid for a majority stake in opel by magna , which has teamed up with state-owned russian bank sberbank and russia 's second-largest auto maker gaz . an estimated 26,000 german jobs are at stake .
medvedev said his government supported the magna-sberbank bid for opel .
" we are interested and optimistic about this project and will do everything to realize it , " he said .
but general motors has also received interest from brussels-based investment group rhj international and from china 's beijing automotive industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- for opel , throwing the deal into some doubt .
trade issues dominate the two governments also signed a slew of economic partnership deals , including a 500-million-euro -lrb- $ 357 million -rrb- credit agreement .
the agreements included a joint declaration on energy cooperation and an agreement between russian railways and siemens to establish a joint venture to produce locomotives .
in addition , frankfurt airport operator fraport is to participate in the expansion of the airport in st petersburg .
the two leaders did not comment on news reports that russian oil giant gazprom is interested in a takeover of bankrupt german shipyards in the northern cities of wismar and rostock .
energy security on the agenda the two leaders also discussed energy security issues .
russia supplies a quarters of europe 's gas needs and germany is europe 's biggest customer for russian gas .
merkel signaled that she was keen to avoid another row with russia over gas supplies .
the german leader stressed the importance of the nord stream gas pipeline , an ambitious project to deliver siberian gas to europe under the baltic sea .
" we think this project is strategically important and necessary , " merkel said .
russia says the nord stream gas pipeline is part of its plan to increase gas volumes and step up the reliability of russian gas supplies to europe , now largely dependent on russia 's thorny political relations with ex-soviet ukraine. sp / dpa / reuters / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's sberbank , together with canada 's magna , is interested in troubled car maker opel merkel appeared to back the magna-sberbank bid .
she said it presents " excellent starting points " but added that her government still needs to " clear up " questions .
berlin agreed in late may to support a bid for a majority stake in opel by magna , which has teamed up with state-owned russian bank sberbank and russia 's second-largest auto maker gaz . an estimated 26,000 german jobs are at stake .
medvedev said his government supported the magna-sberbank bid for opel .
" we are interested and optimistic about this project and will do everything to realize it , " he said .
but general motors has also received interest from brussels-based investment group rhj international and from china 's beijing automotive industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- for opel , throwing the deal into some doubt .
trade issues dominate the two governments also signed a slew of economic partnership deals , including a 500-million-euro -lrb- $ 357 million -rrb- credit agreement .
the agreements included a joint declaration on energy cooperation and an agreement between russian railways and siemens to establish a joint venture to produce locomotives .
in addition , frankfurt airport operator fraport is to participate in the expansion of the airport in st petersburg .
the two leaders did not comment on news reports that russian oil giant gazprom is interested in a takeover of bankrupt german shipyards in the northern cities of wismar and rostock .
energy security on the agenda the two leaders also discussed energy security issues .
russia supplies a quarters of europe 's gas needs and germany is europe 's biggest customer for russian gas .
merkel signaled that she was keen to avoid another row with russia over gas supplies .
the german leader stressed the importance of the nord stream gas pipeline , an ambitious project to deliver siberian gas to europe under the baltic sea .
" we think this project is strategically important and necessary , " merkel said .
russia says the nord stream gas pipeline is part of its plan to increase gas volumes and step up the reliability of russian gas supplies to europe , now largely dependent on russia 's thorny political relations with ex-soviet ukraine. sp / dpa / reuters / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

iceland 's government plans to launch its eu membership bid in brussels before the end of this month . the icelandic parliament , the althingi , gave the green light for the government to bid for membership in the european union , with 33 of the nation 's 63 parliamentarians voting in favor of the proposal . a total of 32 votes were required to pass the proposal , but opposition to the move was limited to 28 lawmakers , while another two abstained .
thursday 's narrow victory came as a relief to crisis-stricken prime minister johanna sigurdardottir , who hopes to stabilize iceland 's economy by joining the 27-member bloc .
in the end , however , it will be the citizens of iceland who will have the final word on whether the government pursues membership .
if and when iceland completes successful accession negotiations with the european union , the question will then be put to the people in a referendum .
divisions within the government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister sigurdardottir says only eu membership can save iceland 's economy the governing coalition itself remained divided over the benefits of eu membership for iceland – a country which is dramatically affected by the economic crisis .
while sigurdardottir 's social democrats have always campaigned for joining the bloc , their left-green coalition partners are traditionally opposed to the idea .
five members of the left green party therefore rejected the proposition , including jon bjarnason , the minister of agriculture and fisheries . other left-green deputies including finance minister steingrimur sigfusson , however , displayed political pragmatism by voting for the eu membership application along government lines . " an overwhelming majority wants this eu issue to be dealt with , " sigfusson said .
pros and cons one of the main eu pull factors for the large majority of icelanders is the chance to drop the icelandic krona as a currency .
it shed nearly half its value in the wake of last year 's financial crash , while inflation rose to over 12 percent .
as a small island state with just 320.000 citizens , iceland relies heavily on imports .
the strongest opposition to iceland 's eu membership comes from the fishing and agricultural industries .
they are opposed to handing over the control over iceland 's lucrative fishing grounds to brussels .
" we would no longer be the lawmakers on how we run our fishing industry .
this is the key element for us .
and we just do n't see any need for an application when you know what the outcome is going to be , " said sigurdur sverrisson from the federation of icelandic fishing vessel owners -lrb- liu -rrb- .
if and how iceland could keep the control over this vital part of the economy while having to join the – currently unsuccessful - common eu fisheries policy will be one of the most important and tricky questions during the accession talks .
popular support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurosceptic protests in reykjavik were low-key according to the most recent figures , around 70 percent of icelanders support the launch of eu accession talks .
" i would like to talk and find out what we can get and what we 'd have to give , " is an often-heard comment on reykjavik 's streets these days .
the nation remains divided over the prospect of full membership in the bloc , however , with many citizens complaining about a lack of information .
unlike norway , iceland has never applied to the eu because the majority of politicians were against it .
" what we have seen in the last few months is a shift in political leadership rather than a great shift in the public opinion , although the public opinion for membership of course strengthened due to the economic crisis , " concludes adalsteinn leifsson from reykjavik university .
hope for speedy progress iceland 's foreign minister össur skarpedinsson , a leading social democrat , has already outlined an ambitious agenda for the accession procedures .
iceland plans to launch its application in time for the next meeting of the eu foreign ministers on july 27 .
the fact that iceland is already a member of the european economic area -lrb- eea -rrb- and the border-free schengen zone means accession talks are likely to be relatively short .
around two thirds of all icelandic legislation is already in line with eu rules .
it is widely viewed as favorable for iceland that another nordic country , sweden , currently holds the eu presidency .
" we do n't hide the fact that we want our friends to support us , " said skarpedinsson .
the swedes support a speedy negotiation process with iceland , and eu officials mentioned 2011 or 2012 as possible accession dates .
a referendum will be held , meaning the icelandic citizens will have the last say in the matter .

certainly not the tourist magnet it is as home to the world 's third largest gothic church .
with all the visitors , though , comes a lot of dirt . cologne 's magnificent cathedral is eye candy for goth fans .
on a sunny day , its blackish spires contrast starkly against a bright blue sky .
the clouds on an overcast day , on the other hand , seem to swallow the steeples as they shoot up to the heavens . all that beauty costs time and money , however . while the some 100 million tourists who travel to the city on the rhine river - nearly 6.5 million of whom visit the cathedral - help fill the municipal coffers each year , millions of euros must be spent on the church 's maintenance . along with their money , visitors to the cathedral -lrb- known as the koelner dom in german -rrb- drag in substantial quantities of dirt , which does n't just cover the floor , but also the church 's countless statues , mosaics and other artworks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral is one of many churches in cologne no ordinary cleaning personnel would do for sweeping away all the dust . " my daily equipment consists of a vacuum cleaner , various paintbrushes , dusting towels , a headlamp , scalpel , sponges and fiberglass pens , " said bettina grimm , germany 's only female specialist in the field of plaster restoration .
" i also use mortar and pigments when more restorative work has to be done . " she was given the title putzrestauratorin by the cathedral 's master builder barbara schock-werner as a play on words : putz in german means " plaster " but the verb putzen means " to clean .

the two leaders also addressed the touchy topic of human rights . the two leaders met near the southern city of munich before being joined by key members of both governments , including the ministers for the interior , environment and economy . the killing of russian human rights activist natalya estemirova in chechnya on wednesday featured prominently in the meeting .
speaking at a news conference with russian president dmitry medvedev on thursday , german chancellor angela merkel described estemirova 's killing as an " unacceptable event . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estemirova 's killing has sparked international outrage merkel said that the murder had " played a role " in her talks with the russian president , who she said had assured her that " everything would be done to clear everything up . "
estemirova was the latest in a string of campaigners to be killed in russia .
thursday 's talks were part of the semi-annual top-level intergovernmental consultations between the two countries known as the " petersburg dialog . "
merkel signals support for magna-sberbank bid the two leaders also discussed foreign policy issues such as iran and north korea and the fight against terrorism , human trafficking and organized crime .
but the meeting was dominated by the two countries ' substantial and growing economic ties which have been hit by the global financial crisis . germany is russia 's single biggest trading partner with bilateral turnover amounting to around 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- last year .
but sergei prikhodko , the kremlin 's chief foreign policy aide , told reporters this week that trade between germany and russia more than halved in the first quarter of 2009 compared with the same period last year .
merkel said the strategic partnership between russia and germany is a " central element " in overcoming the economic crisis .
a pressing economic issue was the possible takeover of troubled german carmaker opel by russian-backed canadian auto parts maker magna international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's sberbank , together with canada 's magna , is interested in troubled car maker opel merkel appeared to back the magna-sberbank bid .
she said it presents " excellent starting points " but added that her government still needs to " clear up " questions .
berlin agreed in late may to support a bid for a majority stake in opel by magna , which has teamed up with state-owned russian bank sberbank and russia 's second-largest auto maker gaz . an estimated 26,000 german jobs are at stake .
medvedev said his government supported the magna-sberbank bid for opel .
" we are interested and optimistic about this project and will do everything to realize it , " he said .
but general motors has also received interest from brussels-based investment group rhj international and from china 's beijing automotive industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- for opel , throwing the deal into some doubt .
trade issues dominate the two governments also signed a slew of economic partnership deals , including a 500-million-euro -lrb- $ 357 million -rrb- credit agreement .
the agreements included a joint declaration on energy cooperation and an agreement between russian railways and siemens to establish a joint venture to produce locomotives .
in addition , frankfurt airport operator fraport is to participate in the expansion of the airport in st petersburg .
the two leaders did not comment on news reports that russian oil giant gazprom is interested in a takeover of bankrupt german shipyards in the northern cities of wismar and rostock .
energy security on the agenda the two leaders also discussed energy security issues .
russia supplies a quarters of europe 's gas needs and germany is europe 's biggest customer for russian gas .
merkel signaled that she was keen to avoid another row with russia over gas supplies .
the german leader stressed the importance of the nord stream gas pipeline , an ambitious project to deliver siberian gas to europe under the baltic sea .
" we think this project is strategically important and necessary , " merkel said .
russia says the nord stream gas pipeline is part of its plan to increase gas volumes and step up the reliability of russian gas supplies to europe , now largely dependent on russia 's thorny political relations with ex-soviet ukraine. sp / dpa / reuters / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
estemirova 's murder " draws attention to the necessity of protecting human rights defenders in russia , " the council 's statement added .
the council 's statement follows a similar condemnation from the eu presidency , currently held by sweden , which took over the rotating six-month presidency of the 27-nation bloc on july 1 .

" she spoke the truth and openly , sometimes toughly described some processes that happen in this country , " medvedev added .
" that is the value of a rights activist - even if these things are not pleasant and uncomfortable for the authorities . "

" we deplore the cowardly murder of the exceptional and dedicated human rights activist natalya estemirova , " the statement read .

according to chinese media reports , the nigerian businessman had overstayed his visa .
the case - the first of its kind - has highlighted the plight of the growing number of african immigrants in china . officially , some 20,000 africans live in china , mostly traders and students .
but unofficial estimates suggest that 20,000 might be living in the southern city of guangzhou alone .
most are from nigeria .
alexander demissie , an ethiopian who does research on african-chinese relations at bochum university in germany , explains : “ basically , they are middlemen .
they set the connection between the chinese manufacturers and the african traders .
most of the time , these nigerians living in guangzhou are highly-educated and speak very good chinese because they studied at the universities . ”
“ sun yatsen university in guangzhou is one of the famous universities where you can find a lot of african students .
it ’ s of course easier for them to have access to the chinese market because of the language .
this helps the african traders coming to china for two weeks or three weeks to buy goods . ”
as china has been very keen on promoting trade and political relations with african countries , visa regulations tend to be generous , says demissie : “ people can easily get a chinese visa , as soon as they can prove that they are traders or students . ”
he adds that this incident should not have happened and says such problems are unusual .
police is tougher with africans on the other hand , he says , the police does tend to be tough with african immigrants and “ africans do face harsher controls inside china than people from other countries . ”
he wenping , an africa specialist at the chinese academy of social sciences in beijing , says that many africans are better integrated in china than westerners .
“ the africans , both traders and students find it easier to overcome the language barrier than europeans and americans . ”
“ i ’ ve come across so many people who speak perfectly fluent chinese .
they find it easier to master the different tones we have in our chinese pronunciation .
they easily adapt to the local environment in the chinese cities , and chinese food is no problem for them . ”
africans not always accepted by chinese society but alexander demissie , who has also lived in china , says other issues can create difficulties : “ from my own experience , it ’ s not easy as an african to have a chinese girlfriend , for example .
of course , if you live in one country , you will take part in the social life , you might also get a chinese girlfriend and so on . ”
but he says people around might not consider this in a friendly light , adding that some people act rudely or badly towards africans in china .
demissie says there are also occasional street fights between groups of africans and of chinese , and that there is a general lack of knowledge about africa among ordinary people in china .
but with growing exposure through trade and political links , this seems likely to change in the foreseeable future .

certainly not the tourist magnet it is as home to the world 's third largest gothic church .
with all the visitors , though , comes a lot of dirt . cologne 's magnificent cathedral is eye candy for goth fans .
on a sunny day , its blackish spires contrast starkly against a bright blue sky .
the clouds on an overcast day , on the other hand , seem to swallow the steeples as they shoot up to the heavens . all that beauty costs time and money , however . while the some 100 million tourists who travel to the city on the rhine river - nearly 6.5 million of whom visit the cathedral - help fill the municipal coffers each year , millions of euros must be spent on the church 's maintenance . along with their money , visitors to the cathedral -lrb- known as the koelner dom in german -rrb- drag in substantial quantities of dirt , which does n't just cover the floor , but also the church 's countless statues , mosaics and other artworks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral is one of many churches in cologne no ordinary cleaning personnel would do for sweeping away all the dust . " my daily equipment consists of a vacuum cleaner , various paintbrushes , dusting towels , a headlamp , scalpel , sponges and fiberglass pens , " said bettina grimm , germany 's only female specialist in the field of plaster restoration .
" i also use mortar and pigments when more restorative work has to be done . " she was given the title putzrestauratorin by the cathedral 's master builder barbara schock-werner as a play on words : putz in german means " plaster " but the verb putzen means " to clean . " more than blowing off the dust restorative specialist grimm looks more like an archeologist than part of the cleaning crew as she sets about her task with both precision and a gentle touch .
holding a small paintbrush in one hand and the vacuum cleaner in the other , she carefully removes tiny particles of dust from valuable statues .
in this business , normal cleaning detergents are completely off-limits . grimm works together with some 60 stone masons , sculptors , carpenters , painters , electricians , locksmiths , glass restorers and gold and silversmiths to keep the cathedral shining .
it 's a tall order , considering the toll both the city pollution and thousands of visitors take on the 800-year-old dom each day . as the sole person responsible for " dusting " in the cathedral , grimm must cover over 6,000 square meters -lrb- around 64,500 square feet -rrb- of space . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restoration work on the cathedral is a balancing act " i have to dust off seven choir chapels and the choir stall and at the end of the week , on fridays , i have to do the wood carvings and the cushions so that everything is sparkling clean for mass on sunday , " grimm said . " i also have to clean the stations of the cross , " she added .
" actually , i 'm always trying to catch up because there are not enough hours in the day .

citing a profact agency study , afp reported that " seventy percent of belgians find that too much tax money goes to the royal family , and one-third want to get rid of the government allowance altogether . "
the debate over whether or not the government should restrict the number of royal family members receiving a government allowance first arose in the senate ten years ago . however , reforms failed to pass without a political majority , and the debate died down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law on royal financing would not affect king albert , queen paola , or their three children one reason the issue has come up again , according to christian laporte , royal watcher for la libre belgique , is that the royal family keeps expanding .
" the debate was always present , of course , in the society , and there is also another important fact for tomorrow , and that fact is that there are now not just three princes , but twelve or thirteen , " said laporte .
this same concern has been echoed across europe .
therefore , when public debate over royal financing was re-ignited in belgium ten months ago , lawmakers decided to call-in constitutional experts from other european monarchies to help reach a compromise . in the proposed law , all monarchs would be banned from receiving state cash and perks - except for the monarch , his or her spouse , and heir to the throne .
however , the changes would not go into effect until the end of king albert 's reign , which means all three of his children will still be entitled to government stipends for the rest of their lives .
two years ago , king albert 's youngest son , prince laurent caused a stir when he was alleged to have used taxpayers ' money to refurbish his villa .
however , royal watcher christian laporte says that the prince was never convicted of the allegations in court . " we could n't say that prince laurent has problems , because he has not been condemned .
he went alone to give testimony , and he went out of the court as free as when he came in - of course , " said laporte . flemish nationalists have been some of the most outspoken opponents of the monarchy - and as separatists - reject it as a symbol of belgian unity .
a couple of flemish politicians have sparked controversy with their remarks on the royal family .
on his first day on the job , flemish parliamentary speaker jan peumans announced that he refused to attend any royal receptions .
" it 's very simple , " peumans remarked .
" i promised my father i would n't do things like this .
if other people want to go – no problem – i would never accept a belgian medal either .
it 's my right . "
in addition to the 12 million euros per year in pay and benefits that the royal family reportedly receives , flemish nationalist lawmaker jan jambon has claimed that they get another 16 million euros in hidden costs from other government budgets .
a republican movement was also founded by french-speaking belgians , but it does not appear to have gained much momentum .
the draft bill to cap royal allowances by contrast has found broad bi-partisan support .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 16.07.2009 more & more african immigrants in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of african students and traders in china is increasing steadily more than 100 africans protested for hours outside a police station in china 's guangzhou city on wednesday after a nigerian man fell to his death trying to escape from a visa check .
according to chinese media reports , the nigerian businessman had overstayed his visa .
the case - the first of its kind - has highlighted the plight of the growing number of african immigrants in china . officially , some 20,000 africans live in china , mostly traders and students .
but unofficial estimates suggest that 20,000 might be living in the southern city of guangzhou alone .
most are from nigeria .
alexander demissie , an ethiopian who does research on african-chinese relations at bochum university in germany , explains : “ basically , they are middlemen .
they set the connection between the chinese manufacturers and the african traders .
most of the time , these nigerians living in guangzhou are highly-educated and speak very good chinese because they studied at the universities . ”
“ sun yatsen university in guangzhou is one of the famous universities where you can find a lot of african students .
it ’ s of course easier for them to have access to the chinese market because of the language .
this helps the african traders coming to china for two weeks or three weeks to buy goods . ”
as china has been very keen on promoting trade and political relations with african countries , visa regulations tend to be generous , says demissie : “ people can easily get a chinese visa , as soon as they can prove that they are traders or students . ”
he adds that this incident should not have happened and says such problems are unusual .
police is tougher with africans on the other hand , he says , the police does tend to be tough with african immigrants and “ africans do face harsher controls inside china than people from other countries . ”
he wenping , an africa specialist at the chinese academy of social sciences in beijing , says that many africans are better integrated in china than westerners .
“ the africans , both traders and students find it easier to overcome the language barrier than europeans and americans . ”
“ i ’ ve come across so many people who speak perfectly fluent chinese .
they find it easier to master the different tones we have in our chinese pronunciation .
they easily adapt to the local environment in the chinese cities , and chinese food is no problem for them . ”
africans not always accepted by chinese society but alexander demissie , who has also lived in china , says other issues can create difficulties : “ from my own experience , it ’ s not easy as an african to have a chinese girlfriend , for example .
of course , if you live in one country , you will take part in the social life , you might also get a chinese girlfriend and so on . ”
but he says people around might not consider this in a friendly light , adding that some people act rudely or badly towards africans in china .
demissie says there are also occasional street fights between groups of africans and of chinese , and that there is a general lack of knowledge about africa among ordinary people in china .
but with growing exposure through trade and political links , this seems likely to change in the foreseeable future .

according to chinese media reports , the nigerian businessman had overstayed his visa .
the case - the first of its kind - has highlighted the plight of the growing number of african immigrants in china . officially , some 20,000 africans live in china , mostly traders and students .
but unofficial estimates suggest that 20,000 might be living in the southern city of guangzhou alone .
most are from nigeria .
alexander demissie , an ethiopian who does research on african-chinese relations at bochum university in germany , explains : “ basically , they are middlemen .
they set the connection between the chinese manufacturers and the african traders .
most of the time , these nigerians living in guangzhou are highly-educated and speak very good chinese because they studied at the universities . ”
“ sun yatsen university in guangzhou is one of the famous universities where you can find a lot of african students .
it ’ s of course easier for them to have access to the chinese market because of the language .
this helps the african traders coming to china for two weeks or three weeks to buy goods . ”
as china has been very keen on promoting trade and political relations with african countries , visa regulations tend to be generous , says demissie : “ people can easily get a chinese visa , as soon as they can prove that they are traders or students . ”
he adds that this incident should not have happened and says such problems are unusual .
police is tougher with africans on the other hand , he says , the police does tend to be tough with african immigrants and “ africans do face harsher controls inside china than people from other countries . ”
he wenping , an africa specialist at the chinese academy of social sciences in beijing , says that many africans are better integrated in china than westerners .
“ the africans , both traders and students find it easier to overcome the language barrier than europeans and americans . ”
“ i ’ ve come across so many people who speak perfectly fluent chinese .
they find it easier to master the different tones we have in our chinese pronunciation .
they easily adapt to the local environment in the chinese cities , and chinese food is no problem for them . ”
africans not always accepted by chinese society but alexander demissie , who has also lived in china , says other issues can create difficulties : “ from my own experience , it ’ s not easy as an african to have a chinese girlfriend , for example .
of course , if you live in one country , you will take part in the social life , you might also get a chinese girlfriend and so on . ”
but he says people around might not consider this in a friendly light , adding that some people act rudely or badly towards africans in china .
demissie says there are also occasional street fights between groups of africans and of chinese , and that there is a general lack of knowledge about africa among ordinary people in china .
but with growing exposure through trade and political links , this seems likely to change in the foreseeable future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 16.07.2009 more & more african immigrants in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of african students and traders in china is increasing steadily more than 100 africans protested for hours outside a police station in china 's guangzhou city on wednesday after a nigerian man fell to his death trying to escape from a visa check .
according to chinese media reports , the nigerian businessman had overstayed his visa .
the case - the first of its kind - has highlighted the plight of the growing number of african immigrants in china . officially , some 20,000 africans live in china , mostly traders and students .
but unofficial estimates suggest that 20,000 might be living in the southern city of guangzhou alone .
most are from nigeria .
alexander demissie , an ethiopian who does research on african-chinese relations at bochum university in germany , explains : “ basically , they are middlemen .
they set the connection between the chinese manufacturers and the african traders .
most of the time , these nigerians living in guangzhou are highly-educated and speak very good chinese because they studied at the universities . ”
“ sun yatsen university in guangzhou is one of the famous universities where you can find a lot of african students .
it ’ s of course easier for them to have access to the chinese market because of the language .
this helps the african traders coming to china for two weeks or three weeks to buy goods . ”
as china has been very keen on promoting trade and political relations with african countries , visa regulations tend to be generous , says demissie : “ people can easily get a chinese visa , as soon as they can prove that they are traders or students . ”
he adds that this incident should not have happened and says such problems are unusual .
police is tougher with africans on the other hand , he says , the police does tend to be tough with african immigrants and “ africans do face harsher controls inside china than people from other countries . ”
he wenping , an africa specialist at the chinese academy of social sciences in beijing , says that many africans are better integrated in china than westerners .
“ the africans , both traders and students find it easier to overcome the language barrier than europeans and americans . ”
“ i ’ ve come across so many people who speak perfectly fluent chinese .
they find it easier to master the different tones we have in our chinese pronunciation .
they easily adapt to the local environment in the chinese cities , and chinese food is no problem for them . ”
africans not always accepted by chinese society but alexander demissie , who has also lived in china , says other issues can create difficulties : “ from my own experience , it ’ s not easy as an african to have a chinese girlfriend , for example .
of course , if you live in one country , you will take part in the social life , you might also get a chinese girlfriend and so on . ”
but he says people around might not consider this in a friendly light , adding that some people act rudely or badly towards africans in china .
demissie says there are also occasional street fights between groups of africans and of chinese , and that there is a general lack of knowledge about africa among ordinary people in china .
but with growing exposure through trade and political links , this seems likely to change in the foreseeable future .

the two leaders also addressed the touchy topic of human rights . the two leaders met near the southern city of munich before being joined by key members of both governments , including the ministers for the interior , environment and economy . the killing of russian human rights activist natalya estemirova in chechnya on wednesday featured prominently in the meeting .
speaking at a news conference with russian president dmitry medvedev on thursday , german chancellor angela merkel described estemirova 's killing as an " unacceptable event . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estemirova 's killing has sparked international outrage merkel said that the murder had " played a role " in her talks with the russian president , who she said had assured her that " everything would be done to clear everything up . "
estemirova was the latest in a string of campaigners to be killed in russia .
thursday 's talks were part of the semi-annual top-level intergovernmental consultations between the two countries known as the " petersburg dialog . "
merkel signals support for magna-sberbank bid the two leaders also discussed foreign policy issues such as iran and north korea and the fight against terrorism , human trafficking and organized crime .
but the meeting was dominated by the two countries ' substantial and growing economic ties which have been hit by the global financial crisis . germany is russia 's single biggest trading partner with bilateral turnover amounting to around 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- last year .
but sergei prikhodko , the kremlin 's chief foreign policy aide , told reporters this week that trade between germany and russia more than halved in the first quarter of 2009 compared with the same period last year .
merkel said the strategic partnership between russia and germany is a " central element " in overcoming the economic crisis .
a pressing economic issue was the possible takeover of troubled german carmaker opel by russian-backed canadian auto parts maker magna international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's sberbank , together with canada 's magna , is interested in troubled car maker opel merkel appeared to back the magna-sberbank bid .
she said it presents " excellent starting points " but added that her government still needs to " clear up " questions .
berlin agreed in late may to support a bid for a majority stake in opel by magna , which has teamed up with state-owned russian bank sberbank and russia 's second-largest auto maker gaz . an estimated 26,000 german jobs are at stake .
medvedev said his government supported the magna-sberbank bid for opel .
" we are interested and optimistic about this project and will do everything to realize it , " he said .
but general motors has also received interest from brussels-based investment group rhj international and from china 's beijing automotive industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- for opel , throwing the deal into some doubt .
trade issues dominate the two governments also signed a slew of economic partnership deals , including a 500-million-euro -lrb- $ 357 million -rrb- credit agreement .
the agreements included a joint declaration on energy cooperation and an agreement between russian railways and siemens to establish a joint venture to produce locomotives .
in addition , frankfurt airport operator fraport is to participate in the expansion of the airport in st petersburg .
the two leaders did not comment on news reports that russian oil giant gazprom is interested in a takeover of bankrupt german shipyards in the northern cities of wismar and rostock .
energy security on the agenda the two leaders also discussed energy security issues .
russia supplies a quarters of europe 's gas needs and germany is europe 's biggest customer for russian gas .
merkel signaled that she was keen to avoid another row with russia over gas supplies .
the german leader stressed the importance of the nord stream gas pipeline , an ambitious project to deliver siberian gas to europe under the baltic sea .
" we think this project is strategically important and necessary , " merkel said .
russia says the nord stream gas pipeline is part of its plan to increase gas volumes and step up the reliability of russian gas supplies to europe , now largely dependent on russia 's thorny political relations with ex-soviet ukraine. sp / dpa / reuters / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i 'm an architect and a utopist , " said luc schuiten .
the architect lives and works in brussels and believes that the city , like so many others , has no future if something does not change soon .
" you can not feel good in light of all the environmental pollution and the grim perspectives for the future , " said the 65-year-old visionary .
" so , i try to envision alternatives . "
for the first time ever , drafts and designs by the relatively unknown architect are on display in a large show in brussels .
the entrance to the " vegetal city " installation is composed of an archway made of branches adorned with little yellow lights that blink to the sound of a heartbeat pulsing from speakers .
beyond the entrance , visitors will find architectural models and drawings of balanced , colorful , almost fairy tale-like cities and people who have managed to live in harmony with nature .
round , flowing shapes that weave into one another are schuiten 's trademark .
leaves inspire design bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schuiten 's vertical gardens " the ' vertical gardens ' are a project that would help to heal the city 's wounds , " schuiten said , his eyes sparkling .
he would like to create green areas that span over walkways and platforms and up the sides of buildings .
" the idea is that the vegetation here can be used as herbal or plant sculptures that exude a sense of poetry , " he mused .
" they are a space to withdraw to , a peaceful place where we can discover what we are missing - nature . "
none of schuiten 's visions have yet been turned into reality , even though many of them could be realized if someone had the courage to do so , he said .
the architect has , however , been designing and building private energy-efficient homes made from environmental materials since the 1970s .
nature is his inspiration .
" nature is the only thing that is sustainable , and when we use living materials to build our homes , we are automatically developing things further by employing that same sustainability , " the architect said .
he calls it " archiborescence " - this connection between architecture and arborescence , or " tree structure . "
on the road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the man and his car-bike - advertising his show in brussels to advertise his visions to a larger public , the architect began driving an electric-powered three-wheeler around the city of brussels .
the two-seater vehicle with the exhibition logo on the side looks like a combination of recumbent bicycle and car , and is steered using two joysticks .
" no noise , no pollution , " the designer said as he eased the vehicle from the sidewalk into the street , catching the glances of curious pedestrians and car drivers along the way .
" when i travel more than 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- , i have to pedal , " he explains .
" but i love pedaling - it keeps me in shape .
i can also conserve energy as i travel , and can have fun all at the same time . "
left up to the architect , people in the future would only drive small , electric cars that access their power from tracks along the street .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 16.07.2009 belgium seeks caps on public financing for royal family großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seventy percent of belgians believe that too much tax money goes to the royal family belgian lawmakers are drafting a bill to reduce the amount of public money being spent to support the royal family , which currently receives 12 million euros per year . while the royal family still finds broad support in the country , many people agree that their government allowance should be reduced .
citing a profact agency study , afp reported that " seventy percent of belgians find that too much tax money goes to the royal family , and one-third want to get rid of the government allowance altogether . "
the debate over whether or not the government should restrict the number of royal family members receiving a government allowance first arose in the senate ten years ago . however , reforms failed to pass without a political majority , and the debate died down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law on royal financing would not affect king albert , queen paola , or their three children one reason the issue has come up again , according to christian laporte , royal watcher for la libre belgique , is that the royal family keeps expanding .
" the debate was always present , of course , in the society , and there is also another important fact for tomorrow , and that fact is that there are now not just three princes , but twelve or thirteen , " said laporte .
this same concern has been echoed across europe .
therefore , when public debate over royal financing was re-ignited in belgium ten months ago , lawmakers decided to call-in constitutional experts from other european monarchies to help reach a compromise . in the proposed law , all monarchs would be banned from receiving state cash and perks - except for the monarch , his or her spouse , and heir to the throne .
however , the changes would not go into effect until the end of king albert 's reign , which means all three of his children will still be entitled to government stipends for the rest of their lives .
two years ago , king albert 's youngest son , prince laurent caused a stir when he was alleged to have used taxpayers ' money to refurbish his villa .
however , royal watcher christian laporte says that the prince was never convicted of the allegations in court . " we could n't say that prince laurent has problems , because he has not been condemned .
he went alone to give testimony , and he went out of the court as free as when he came in - of course , " said laporte . flemish nationalists have been some of the most outspoken opponents of the monarchy - and as separatists - reject it as a symbol of belgian unity .
a couple of flemish politicians have sparked controversy with their remarks on the royal family .
on his first day on the job , flemish parliamentary speaker jan peumans announced that he refused to attend any royal receptions .
" it 's very simple , " peumans remarked .
" i promised my father i would n't do things like this .
if other people want to go – no problem – i would never accept a belgian medal either .
it 's my right . "
in addition to the 12 million euros per year in pay and benefits that the royal family reportedly receives , flemish nationalist lawmaker jan jambon has claimed that they get another 16 million euros in hidden costs from other government budgets .
a republican movement was also founded by french-speaking belgians , but it does not appear to have gained much momentum .
the draft bill to cap royal allowances by contrast has found broad bi-partisan support .

eu-members most affected are demanding that their eu partners share responsibility . during a meeting in stockholm on thursday , eu interior ministers addressed europe 's illegal immigration problem .
all agree that something needs to be done to alleviate the stress on mediterranean countries , but not all can agree how .
" two issues are the most important : one is the creation of a common european asylum system , which would mean that we would have increased solidarity between member states and more shared responsibility , " said sweden 's migration minister tobias billstrom , who led the informal meeting .
" the second thing is the question of legal migration : we need to open more ways for people to come to europe and work here , " billstrom added .
according to eu justice commissioner jacques barrot , all member states support efforts to strengthen the eu border-control agency frontex .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece has come under fire for deporting migrants in need of asylum .
pictured : prime minister costas karamanlis every year , thousands of people from africa , the middle east and central asia risk their lives crossing the mediterranean sea for a chance at a better life in europe . the united nations high commission for refugees estimates that in 2008 alone , more than 67,000 people tried to enter europe illegally via the mediterranean .
the influx has caused a major strain on the reception services of four eu-member states in particular - cyprus , greece , italy and malta - and they have repeatedly called for other european countries to shoulder some of the burden .
more solidarity needed eu leaders first called for greater cooperation with european countries most affected by illegal migration during a june meeting , but they also maintained that such efforts should be voluntary .
critics of that viewpoint , such as cypriot interior minister neoklis sylikiotis , say that relying on voluntary assistance is n't sustainable in the long term .
" it is time that we have more solidarity from the other member countries , " said sylikiotis .
" countries that are the first point of contact should not have to shoulder the entire problem . "
italy 's interior minister roberto maroni shared sylikiotis ' feelings , stating that " burden sharing " should be one of the top priorities for the eu 's new five-year plan on justice issues , also discussed in stockholm .
however , many countries outside of the mediterranean zone believe that instead of focusing on greater cooperation within the eu , the bloc should be working with migrants ' countries of origin to reduce the number of people wanting to leave in the first place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu interior ministers met in stockholm for a meeting on justice and home affairs eu members have often been critized for their handling of illegal migrants , who may not necessarily be escaping economic hardship , but who face political persecution or violence in their homeland .
the un , human rights groups , and the vatican have all publically denounced italy and greece for sending back migrants who were in need of asylum .
the german refugee organization " pro-asylum " has also criticized other eu members for not doing enough .
" countries like germany can no longer sit on their hands ... an unbureaucratic and speedy distribution of those seeking protection - like those stranded in greece - is a question of humanity and solidarity .

" the second thing is the question of legal migration : we need to open more ways for people to come to europe and work here , " billstrom added .
according to eu justice commissioner jacques barrot , all member states support efforts to strengthen the eu border-control agency frontex .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece has come under fire for deporting migrants in need of asylum .
pictured : prime minister costas karamanlis every year , thousands of people from africa , the middle east and central asia risk their lives crossing the mediterranean sea for a chance at a better life in europe . the united nations high commission for refugees estimates that in 2008 alone , more than 67,000 people tried to enter europe illegally via the mediterranean .
the influx has caused a major strain on the reception services of four eu-member states in particular - cyprus , greece , italy and malta - and they have repeatedly called for other european countries to shoulder some of the burden .
more solidarity needed eu leaders first called for greater cooperation with european countries most affected by illegal migration during a june meeting , but they also maintained that such efforts should be voluntary .
critics of that viewpoint , such as cypriot interior minister neoklis sylikiotis , say that relying on voluntary assistance is n't sustainable in the long term .
" it is time that we have more solidarity from the other member countries , " said sylikiotis .
" countries that are the first point of contact should not have to shoulder the entire problem . "
italy 's interior minister roberto maroni shared sylikiotis ' feelings , stating that " burden sharing " should be one of the top priorities for the eu 's new five-year plan on justice issues , also discussed in stockholm .
however , many countries outside of the mediterranean zone believe that instead of focusing on greater cooperation within the eu , the bloc should be working with migrants ' countries of origin to reduce the number of people wanting to leave in the first place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu interior ministers met in stockholm for a meeting on justice and home affairs eu members have often been critized for their handling of illegal migrants , who may not necessarily be escaping economic hardship , but who face political persecution or violence in their homeland .
the un , human rights groups , and the vatican have all publically denounced italy and greece for sending back migrants who were in need of asylum .
the german refugee organization " pro-asylum " has also criticized other eu members for not doing enough .
" countries like germany can no longer sit on their hands ... an unbureaucratic and speedy distribution of those seeking protection - like those stranded in greece - is a question of humanity and solidarity .

the move comes just 10 weeks before national elections in germany .
carstensen said lawmakers were expected to vote on the dissolution in the capital kiel on monday , and that he wanted to call an early election on sept .

social democrats to resist dissolution however , the spd has pledged to vote against the proposal for dissolution of the parliament .
without a two-thirds majority vote , the proposal will not succeed . " the spd will stick to the coalition agreement .
there is no reason to dissolve the state assembly , " the spd 's state leader ralf stegener told german television .
" if the state premier does n't think he can carry on , he can resign .

" this is a signal for berlin , " bosbach told the online edition of newspaper handelsblatt .
" the call for a new election shows that a grand coalition is not a permanent solution . "
merkel is appealing to voters to use september 's federal election to dump the spd and allow the cdu to form a coalition government with the liberal free democrats. sp / dpa / ap / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 07 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the two leaders also addressed the touchy topic of human rights . the two leaders met near the southern city of munich before being joined by key members of both governments , including the ministers for the interior , environment and economy . the killing of russian human rights activist natalya estemirova in chechnya on wednesday featured prominently in the meeting .
speaking at a news conference with russian president dmitry medvedev on thursday , german chancellor angela merkel described estemirova 's killing as an " unacceptable event . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estemirova 's killing has sparked international outrage merkel said that the murder had " played a role " in her talks with the russian president , who she said had assured her that " everything would be done to clear everything up . "
estemirova was the latest in a string of campaigners to be killed in russia .
thursday 's talks were part of the semi-annual top-level intergovernmental consultations between the two countries known as the " petersburg dialog . "
merkel signals support for magna-sberbank bid the two leaders also discussed foreign policy issues such as iran and north korea and the fight against terrorism , human trafficking and organized crime .

but sergei prikhodko , the kremlin 's chief foreign policy aide , told reporters this week that trade between germany and russia more than halved in the first quarter of 2009 compared with the same period last year .
merkel said the strategic partnership between russia and germany is a " central element " in overcoming the economic crisis .
a pressing economic issue was the possible takeover of troubled german carmaker opel by russian-backed canadian auto parts maker magna international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's sberbank , together with canada 's magna , is interested in troubled car maker opel merkel appeared to back the magna-sberbank bid .
she said it presents " excellent starting points " but added that her government still needs to " clear up " questions .
berlin agreed in late may to support a bid for a majority stake in opel by magna , which has teamed up with state-owned russian bank sberbank and russia 's second-largest auto maker gaz . an estimated 26,000 german jobs are at stake .
medvedev said his government supported the magna-sberbank bid for opel .
" we are interested and optimistic about this project and will do everything to realize it , " he said .
but general motors has also received interest from brussels-based investment group rhj international and from china 's beijing automotive industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- for opel , throwing the deal into some doubt .
trade issues dominate the two governments also signed a slew of economic partnership deals , including a 500-million-euro -lrb- $ 357 million -rrb- credit agreement .
the agreements included a joint declaration on energy cooperation and an agreement between russian railways and siemens to establish a joint venture to produce locomotives .
in addition , frankfurt airport operator fraport is to participate in the expansion of the airport in st petersburg .
the two leaders did not comment on news reports that russian oil giant gazprom is interested in a takeover of bankrupt german shipyards in the northern cities of wismar and rostock .

the two leaders also addressed the touchy topic of human rights . the two leaders met near the southern city of munich before being joined by key members of both governments , including the ministers for the interior , environment and economy . the killing of russian human rights activist natalya estemirova in chechnya on wednesday featured prominently in the meeting .
speaking at a news conference with russian president dmitry medvedev on thursday , german chancellor angela merkel described estemirova 's killing as an " unacceptable event . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estemirova 's killing has sparked international outrage merkel said that the murder had " played a role " in her talks with the russian president , who she said had assured her that " everything would be done to clear everything up . "
estemirova was the latest in a string of campaigners to be killed in russia .
thursday 's talks were part of the semi-annual top-level intergovernmental consultations between the two countries known as the " petersburg dialog . "
merkel signals support for magna-sberbank bid the two leaders also discussed foreign policy issues such as iran and north korea and the fight against terrorism , human trafficking and organized crime .
but the meeting was dominated by the two countries ' substantial and growing economic ties which have been hit by the global financial crisis . germany is russia 's single biggest trading partner with bilateral turnover amounting to around 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- last year .
but sergei prikhodko , the kremlin 's chief foreign policy aide , told reporters this week that trade between germany and russia more than halved in the first quarter of 2009 compared with the same period last year .
merkel said the strategic partnership between russia and germany is a " central element " in overcoming the economic crisis .
a pressing economic issue was the possible takeover of troubled german carmaker opel by russian-backed canadian auto parts maker magna international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's sberbank , together with canada 's magna , is interested in troubled car maker opel merkel appeared to back the magna-sberbank bid .
she said it presents " excellent starting points " but added that her government still needs to " clear up " questions .
berlin agreed in late may to support a bid for a majority stake in opel by magna , which has teamed up with state-owned russian bank sberbank and russia 's second-largest auto maker gaz . an estimated 26,000 german jobs are at stake .
medvedev said his government supported the magna-sberbank bid for opel .
" we are interested and optimistic about this project and will do everything to realize it , " he said .
but general motors has also received interest from brussels-based investment group rhj international and from china 's beijing automotive industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- for opel , throwing the deal into some doubt .
trade issues dominate the two governments also signed a slew of economic partnership deals , including a 500-million-euro -lrb- $ 357 million -rrb- credit agreement .
the agreements included a joint declaration on energy cooperation and an agreement between russian railways and siemens to establish a joint venture to produce locomotives .
in addition , frankfurt airport operator fraport is to participate in the expansion of the airport in st petersburg .
the two leaders did not comment on news reports that russian oil giant gazprom is interested in a takeover of bankrupt german shipyards in the northern cities of wismar and rostock .
energy security on the agenda the two leaders also discussed energy security issues .
russia supplies a quarters of europe 's gas needs and germany is europe 's biggest customer for russian gas .
merkel signaled that she was keen to avoid another row with russia over gas supplies .
the german leader stressed the importance of the nord stream gas pipeline , an ambitious project to deliver siberian gas to europe under the baltic sea .
" we think this project is strategically important and necessary , " merkel said .
russia says the nord stream gas pipeline is part of its plan to increase gas volumes and step up the reliability of russian gas supplies to europe , now largely dependent on russia 's thorny political relations with ex-soviet ukraine. sp / dpa / reuters / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu-members most affected are demanding that their eu partners share responsibility . during a meeting in stockholm on thursday , eu interior ministers addressed europe 's illegal immigration problem .
all agree that something needs to be done to alleviate the stress on mediterranean countries , but not all can agree how .
" two issues are the most important : one is the creation of a common european asylum system , which would mean that we would have increased solidarity between member states and more shared responsibility , " said sweden 's migration minister tobias billstrom , who led the informal meeting .
" the second thing is the question of legal migration : we need to open more ways for people to come to europe and work here , " billstrom added .
according to eu justice commissioner jacques barrot , all member states support efforts to strengthen the eu border-control agency frontex .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece has come under fire for deporting migrants in need of asylum .
pictured : prime minister costas karamanlis every year , thousands of people from africa , the middle east and central asia risk their lives crossing the mediterranean sea for a chance at a better life in europe . the united nations high commission for refugees estimates that in 2008 alone , more than 67,000 people tried to enter europe illegally via the mediterranean .
the influx has caused a major strain on the reception services of four eu-member states in particular - cyprus , greece , italy and malta - and they have repeatedly called for other european countries to shoulder some of the burden .
more solidarity needed eu leaders first called for greater cooperation with european countries most affected by illegal migration during a june meeting , but they also maintained that such efforts should be voluntary .
critics of that viewpoint , such as cypriot interior minister neoklis sylikiotis , say that relying on voluntary assistance is n't sustainable in the long term .
" it is time that we have more solidarity from the other member countries , " said sylikiotis .
" countries that are the first point of contact should not have to shoulder the entire problem . "
italy 's interior minister roberto maroni shared sylikiotis ' feelings , stating that " burden sharing " should be one of the top priorities for the eu 's new five-year plan on justice issues , also discussed in stockholm .
however , many countries outside of the mediterranean zone believe that instead of focusing on greater cooperation within the eu , the bloc should be working with migrants ' countries of origin to reduce the number of people wanting to leave in the first place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu interior ministers met in stockholm for a meeting on justice and home affairs eu members have often been critized for their handling of illegal migrants , who may not necessarily be escaping economic hardship , but who face political persecution or violence in their homeland .
the un , human rights groups , and the vatican have all publically denounced italy and greece for sending back migrants who were in need of asylum .
the german refugee organization " pro-asylum " has also criticized other eu members for not doing enough .

eu-members most affected are demanding that their eu partners share responsibility . during a meeting in stockholm on thursday , eu interior ministers addressed europe 's illegal immigration problem .
all agree that something needs to be done to alleviate the stress on mediterranean countries , but not all can agree how .
" two issues are the most important : one is the creation of a common european asylum system , which would mean that we would have increased solidarity between member states and more shared responsibility , " said sweden 's migration minister tobias billstrom , who led the informal meeting .
" the second thing is the question of legal migration : we need to open more ways for people to come to europe and work here , " billstrom added .
according to eu justice commissioner jacques barrot , all member states support efforts to strengthen the eu border-control agency frontex .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece has come under fire for deporting migrants in need of asylum .
pictured : prime minister costas karamanlis every year , thousands of people from africa , the middle east and central asia risk their lives crossing the mediterranean sea for a chance at a better life in europe . the united nations high commission for refugees estimates that in 2008 alone , more than 67,000 people tried to enter europe illegally via the mediterranean .
the influx has caused a major strain on the reception services of four eu-member states in particular - cyprus , greece , italy and malta - and they have repeatedly called for other european countries to shoulder some of the burden .
more solidarity needed eu leaders first called for greater cooperation with european countries most affected by illegal migration during a june meeting , but they also maintained that such efforts should be voluntary .
critics of that viewpoint , such as cypriot interior minister neoklis sylikiotis , say that relying on voluntary assistance is n't sustainable in the long term .
" it is time that we have more solidarity from the other member countries , " said sylikiotis .
" countries that are the first point of contact should not have to shoulder the entire problem . "
italy 's interior minister roberto maroni shared sylikiotis ' feelings , stating that " burden sharing " should be one of the top priorities for the eu 's new five-year plan on justice issues , also discussed in stockholm .
however , many countries outside of the mediterranean zone believe that instead of focusing on greater cooperation within the eu , the bloc should be working with migrants ' countries of origin to reduce the number of people wanting to leave in the first place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu interior ministers met in stockholm for a meeting on justice and home affairs eu members have often been critized for their handling of illegal migrants , who may not necessarily be escaping economic hardship , but who face political persecution or violence in their homeland .
the un , human rights groups , and the vatican have all publically denounced italy and greece for sending back migrants who were in need of asylum .
the german refugee organization " pro-asylum " has also criticized other eu members for not doing enough .

the two leaders also addressed the touchy topic of human rights . the two leaders met near the southern city of munich before being joined by key members of both governments , including the ministers for the interior , environment and economy . the killing of russian human rights activist natalya estemirova in chechnya on wednesday featured prominently in the meeting .
speaking at a news conference with russian president dmitry medvedev on thursday , german chancellor angela merkel described estemirova 's killing as an " unacceptable event . "

estemirova was the latest in a string of campaigners to be killed in russia .
thursday 's talks were part of the semi-annual top-level intergovernmental consultations between the two countries known as the " petersburg dialog . "
merkel signals support for magna-sberbank bid the two leaders also discussed foreign policy issues such as iran and north korea and the fight against terrorism , human trafficking and organized crime .
but the meeting was dominated by the two countries ' substantial and growing economic ties which have been hit by the global financial crisis . germany is russia 's single biggest trading partner with bilateral turnover amounting to around 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- last year .
but sergei prikhodko , the kremlin 's chief foreign policy aide , told reporters this week that trade between germany and russia more than halved in the first quarter of 2009 compared with the same period last year .

berlin agreed in late may to support a bid for a majority stake in opel by magna , which has teamed up with state-owned russian bank sberbank and russia 's second-largest auto maker gaz . an estimated 26,000 german jobs are at stake .
medvedev said his government supported the magna-sberbank bid for opel .
" we are interested and optimistic about this project and will do everything to realize it , " he said .
but general motors has also received interest from brussels-based investment group rhj international and from china 's beijing automotive industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- for opel , throwing the deal into some doubt .
trade issues dominate the two governments also signed a slew of economic partnership deals , including a 500-million-euro -lrb- $ 357 million -rrb- credit agreement .
the agreements included a joint declaration on energy cooperation and an agreement between russian railways and siemens to establish a joint venture to produce locomotives .
in addition , frankfurt airport operator fraport is to participate in the expansion of the airport in st petersburg .

the two leaders also addressed the touchy topic of human rights . the two leaders met near the southern city of munich before being joined by key members of both governments , including the ministers for the interior , environment and economy . the killing of russian human rights activist natalya estemirova in chechnya on wednesday featured prominently in the meeting .
speaking at a news conference with russian president dmitry medvedev on thursday , german chancellor angela merkel described estemirova 's killing as an " unacceptable event . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estemirova 's killing has sparked international outrage merkel said that the murder had " played a role " in her talks with the russian president , who she said had assured her that " everything would be done to clear everything up . "
estemirova was the latest in a string of campaigners to be killed in russia .
thursday 's talks were part of the semi-annual top-level intergovernmental consultations between the two countries known as the " petersburg dialog . "
merkel signals support for magna-sberbank bid the two leaders also discussed foreign policy issues such as iran and north korea and the fight against terrorism , human trafficking and organized crime .
but the meeting was dominated by the two countries ' substantial and growing economic ties which have been hit by the global financial crisis . germany is russia 's single biggest trading partner with bilateral turnover amounting to around 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- last year .
but sergei prikhodko , the kremlin 's chief foreign policy aide , told reporters this week that trade between germany and russia more than halved in the first quarter of 2009 compared with the same period last year .
merkel said the strategic partnership between russia and germany is a " central element " in overcoming the economic crisis .
a pressing economic issue was the possible takeover of troubled german carmaker opel by russian-backed canadian auto parts maker magna international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's sberbank , together with canada 's magna , is interested in troubled car maker opel merkel appeared to back the magna-sberbank bid .
she said it presents " excellent starting points " but added that her government still needs to " clear up " questions .
berlin agreed in late may to support a bid for a majority stake in opel by magna , which has teamed up with state-owned russian bank sberbank and russia 's second-largest auto maker gaz . an estimated 26,000 german jobs are at stake .
medvedev said his government supported the magna-sberbank bid for opel .
" we are interested and optimistic about this project and will do everything to realize it , " he said .
but general motors has also received interest from brussels-based investment group rhj international and from china 's beijing automotive industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- for opel , throwing the deal into some doubt .
trade issues dominate the two governments also signed a slew of economic partnership deals , including a 500-million-euro -lrb- $ 357 million -rrb- credit agreement .
the agreements included a joint declaration on energy cooperation and an agreement between russian railways and siemens to establish a joint venture to produce locomotives .
in addition , frankfurt airport operator fraport is to participate in the expansion of the airport in st petersburg .
the two leaders did not comment on news reports that russian oil giant gazprom is interested in a takeover of bankrupt german shipyards in the northern cities of wismar and rostock .
energy security on the agenda the two leaders also discussed energy security issues .
russia supplies a quarters of europe 's gas needs and germany is europe 's biggest customer for russian gas .
merkel signaled that she was keen to avoid another row with russia over gas supplies .
the german leader stressed the importance of the nord stream gas pipeline , an ambitious project to deliver siberian gas to europe under the baltic sea .
" we think this project is strategically important and necessary , " merkel said .
russia says the nord stream gas pipeline is part of its plan to increase gas volumes and step up the reliability of russian gas supplies to europe , now largely dependent on russia 's thorny political relations with ex-soviet ukraine. sp / dpa / reuters / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

iceland 's government plans to launch its eu membership bid in brussels before the end of this month . the icelandic parliament , the althingi , gave the green light for the government to bid for membership in the european union , with 33 of the nation 's 63 parliamentarians voting in favor of the proposal . a total of 32 votes were required to pass the proposal , but opposition to the move was limited to 28 lawmakers , while another two abstained .
thursday 's narrow victory came as a relief to crisis-stricken prime minister johanna sigurdardottir , who hopes to stabilize iceland 's economy by joining the 27-member bloc .
in the end , however , it will be the citizens of iceland who will have the final word on whether the government pursues membership .
if and when iceland completes successful accession negotiations with the european union , the question will then be put to the people in a referendum .
divisions within the government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister sigurdardottir says only eu membership can save iceland 's economy the governing coalition itself remained divided over the benefits of eu membership for iceland – a country which is dramatically affected by the economic crisis .
while sigurdardottir 's social democrats have always campaigned for joining the bloc , their left-green coalition partners are traditionally opposed to the idea .
five members of the left green party therefore rejected the proposition , including jon bjarnason , the minister of agriculture and fisheries . other left-green deputies including finance minister steingrimur sigfusson , however , displayed political pragmatism by voting for the eu membership application along government lines . " an overwhelming majority wants this eu issue to be dealt with , " sigfusson said .
pros and cons one of the main eu pull factors for the large majority of icelanders is the chance to drop the icelandic krona as a currency .
it shed nearly half its value in the wake of last year 's financial crash , while inflation rose to over 12 percent .
as a small island state with just 320.000 citizens , iceland relies heavily on imports .
the strongest opposition to iceland 's eu membership comes from the fishing and agricultural industries .
they are opposed to handing over the control over iceland 's lucrative fishing grounds to brussels .
" we would no longer be the lawmakers on how we run our fishing industry .
this is the key element for us .
and we just do n't see any need for an application when you know what the outcome is going to be , " said sigurdur sverrisson from the federation of icelandic fishing vessel owners -lrb- liu -rrb- .
if and how iceland could keep the control over this vital part of the economy while having to join the – currently unsuccessful - common eu fisheries policy will be one of the most important and tricky questions during the accession talks .
popular support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurosceptic protests in reykjavik were low-key according to the most recent figures , around 70 percent of icelanders support the launch of eu accession talks .
" i would like to talk and find out what we can get and what we 'd have to give , " is an often-heard comment on reykjavik 's streets these days .
the nation remains divided over the prospect of full membership in the bloc , however , with many citizens complaining about a lack of information .
unlike norway , iceland has never applied to the eu because the majority of politicians were against it .
" what we have seen in the last few months is a shift in political leadership rather than a great shift in the public opinion , although the public opinion for membership of course strengthened due to the economic crisis , " concludes adalsteinn leifsson from reykjavik university .
hope for speedy progress iceland 's foreign minister össur skarpedinsson , a leading social democrat , has already outlined an ambitious agenda for the accession procedures .
iceland plans to launch its application in time for the next meeting of the eu foreign ministers on july 27 .
the fact that iceland is already a member of the european economic area -lrb- eea -rrb- and the border-free schengen zone means accession talks are likely to be relatively short .
around two thirds of all icelandic legislation is already in line with eu rules .
it is widely viewed as favorable for iceland that another nordic country , sweden , currently holds the eu presidency .
" we do n't hide the fact that we want our friends to support us , " said skarpedinsson .
the swedes support a speedy negotiation process with iceland , and eu officials mentioned 2011 or 2012 as possible accession dates .
a referendum will be held , meaning the icelandic citizens will have the last say in the matter .

eu-members most affected are demanding that their eu partners share responsibility . during a meeting in stockholm on thursday , eu interior ministers addressed europe 's illegal immigration problem .
all agree that something needs to be done to alleviate the stress on mediterranean countries , but not all can agree how .
" two issues are the most important : one is the creation of a common european asylum system , which would mean that we would have increased solidarity between member states and more shared responsibility , " said sweden 's migration minister tobias billstrom , who led the informal meeting .
" the second thing is the question of legal migration : we need to open more ways for people to come to europe and work here , " billstrom added .

eu-members most affected are demanding that their eu partners share responsibility . during a meeting in stockholm on thursday , eu interior ministers addressed europe 's illegal immigration problem .
all agree that something needs to be done to alleviate the stress on mediterranean countries , but not all can agree how .
" two issues are the most important : one is the creation of a common european asylum system , which would mean that we would have increased solidarity between member states and more shared responsibility , " said sweden 's migration minister tobias billstrom , who led the informal meeting .
" the second thing is the question of legal migration : we need to open more ways for people to come to europe and work here , " billstrom added .
according to eu justice commissioner jacques barrot , all member states support efforts to strengthen the eu border-control agency frontex .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece has come under fire for deporting migrants in need of asylum .
pictured : prime minister costas karamanlis every year , thousands of people from africa , the middle east and central asia risk their lives crossing the mediterranean sea for a chance at a better life in europe . the united nations high commission for refugees estimates that in 2008 alone , more than 67,000 people tried to enter europe illegally via the mediterranean .
the influx has caused a major strain on the reception services of four eu-member states in particular - cyprus , greece , italy and malta - and they have repeatedly called for other european countries to shoulder some of the burden .
more solidarity needed eu leaders first called for greater cooperation with european countries most affected by illegal migration during a june meeting , but they also maintained that such efforts should be voluntary .
critics of that viewpoint , such as cypriot interior minister neoklis sylikiotis , say that relying on voluntary assistance is n't sustainable in the long term .
" it is time that we have more solidarity from the other member countries , " said sylikiotis .
" countries that are the first point of contact should not have to shoulder the entire problem . "
italy 's interior minister roberto maroni shared sylikiotis ' feelings , stating that " burden sharing " should be one of the top priorities for the eu 's new five-year plan on justice issues , also discussed in stockholm .
however , many countries outside of the mediterranean zone believe that instead of focusing on greater cooperation within the eu , the bloc should be working with migrants ' countries of origin to reduce the number of people wanting to leave in the first place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu interior ministers met in stockholm for a meeting on justice and home affairs eu members have often been critized for their handling of illegal migrants , who may not necessarily be escaping economic hardship , but who face political persecution or violence in their homeland .
the un , human rights groups , and the vatican have all publically denounced italy and greece for sending back migrants who were in need of asylum .
the german refugee organization " pro-asylum " has also criticized other eu members for not doing enough .

thursday 's talks were part of the semi-annual top-level intergovernmental consultations between the two countries known as the " petersburg dialog . "
merkel signals support for magna-sberbank bid the two leaders also discussed foreign policy issues such as iran and north korea and the fight against terrorism , human trafficking and organized crime .
but the meeting was dominated by the two countries ' substantial and growing economic ties which have been hit by the global financial crisis . germany is russia 's single biggest trading partner with bilateral turnover amounting to around 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- last year .
but sergei prikhodko , the kremlin 's chief foreign policy aide , told reporters this week that trade between germany and russia more than halved in the first quarter of 2009 compared with the same period last year .
merkel said the strategic partnership between russia and germany is a " central element " in overcoming the economic crisis .
a pressing economic issue was the possible takeover of troubled german carmaker opel by russian-backed canadian auto parts maker magna international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's sberbank , together with canada 's magna , is interested in troubled car maker opel merkel appeared to back the magna-sberbank bid .
she said it presents " excellent starting points " but added that her government still needs to " clear up " questions .
berlin agreed in late may to support a bid for a majority stake in opel by magna , which has teamed up with state-owned russian bank sberbank and russia 's second-largest auto maker gaz . an estimated 26,000 german jobs are at stake .
medvedev said his government supported the magna-sberbank bid for opel .
" we are interested and optimistic about this project and will do everything to realize it , " he said .
but general motors has also received interest from brussels-based investment group rhj international and from china 's beijing automotive industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- for opel , throwing the deal into some doubt .
trade issues dominate the two governments also signed a slew of economic partnership deals , including a 500-million-euro -lrb- $ 357 million -rrb- credit agreement .
the agreements included a joint declaration on energy cooperation and an agreement between russian railways and siemens to establish a joint venture to produce locomotives .
in addition , frankfurt airport operator fraport is to participate in the expansion of the airport in st petersburg .
the two leaders did not comment on news reports that russian oil giant gazprom is interested in a takeover of bankrupt german shipyards in the northern cities of wismar and rostock .
energy security on the agenda the two leaders also discussed energy security issues .
russia supplies a quarters of europe 's gas needs and germany is europe 's biggest customer for russian gas .
merkel signaled that she was keen to avoid another row with russia over gas supplies .
the german leader stressed the importance of the nord stream gas pipeline , an ambitious project to deliver siberian gas to europe under the baltic sea .
" we think this project is strategically important and necessary , " merkel said .
russia says the nord stream gas pipeline is part of its plan to increase gas volumes and step up the reliability of russian gas supplies to europe , now largely dependent on russia 's thorny political relations with ex-soviet ukraine. sp / dpa / reuters / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the two leaders also addressed the touchy topic of human rights . the two leaders met near the southern city of munich before being joined by key members of both governments , including the ministers for the interior , environment and economy . the killing of russian human rights activist natalya estemirova in chechnya on wednesday featured prominently in the meeting .
speaking at a news conference with russian president dmitry medvedev on thursday , german chancellor angela merkel described estemirova 's killing as an " unacceptable event . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estemirova 's killing has sparked international outrage merkel said that the murder had " played a role " in her talks with the russian president , who she said had assured her that " everything would be done to clear everything up . "
estemirova was the latest in a string of campaigners to be killed in russia .
thursday 's talks were part of the semi-annual top-level intergovernmental consultations between the two countries known as the " petersburg dialog . "
merkel signals support for magna-sberbank bid the two leaders also discussed foreign policy issues such as iran and north korea and the fight against terrorism , human trafficking and organized crime .
but the meeting was dominated by the two countries ' substantial and growing economic ties which have been hit by the global financial crisis . germany is russia 's single biggest trading partner with bilateral turnover amounting to around 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- last year .
but sergei prikhodko , the kremlin 's chief foreign policy aide , told reporters this week that trade between germany and russia more than halved in the first quarter of 2009 compared with the same period last year .
merkel said the strategic partnership between russia and germany is a " central element " in overcoming the economic crisis .
a pressing economic issue was the possible takeover of troubled german carmaker opel by russian-backed canadian auto parts maker magna international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's sberbank , together with canada 's magna , is interested in troubled car maker opel merkel appeared to back the magna-sberbank bid .
she said it presents " excellent starting points " but added that her government still needs to " clear up " questions .
berlin agreed in late may to support a bid for a majority stake in opel by magna , which has teamed up with state-owned russian bank sberbank and russia 's second-largest auto maker gaz . an estimated 26,000 german jobs are at stake .
medvedev said his government supported the magna-sberbank bid for opel .
" we are interested and optimistic about this project and will do everything to realize it , " he said .
but general motors has also received interest from brussels-based investment group rhj international and from china 's beijing automotive industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- for opel , throwing the deal into some doubt .
trade issues dominate the two governments also signed a slew of economic partnership deals , including a 500-million-euro -lrb- $ 357 million -rrb- credit agreement .
the agreements included a joint declaration on energy cooperation and an agreement between russian railways and siemens to establish a joint venture to produce locomotives .
in addition , frankfurt airport operator fraport is to participate in the expansion of the airport in st petersburg .
the two leaders did not comment on news reports that russian oil giant gazprom is interested in a takeover of bankrupt german shipyards in the northern cities of wismar and rostock .
energy security on the agenda the two leaders also discussed energy security issues .
russia supplies a quarters of europe 's gas needs and germany is europe 's biggest customer for russian gas .
merkel signaled that she was keen to avoid another row with russia over gas supplies .
the german leader stressed the importance of the nord stream gas pipeline , an ambitious project to deliver siberian gas to europe under the baltic sea .
" we think this project is strategically important and necessary , " merkel said .
russia says the nord stream gas pipeline is part of its plan to increase gas volumes and step up the reliability of russian gas supplies to europe , now largely dependent on russia 's thorny political relations with ex-soviet ukraine. sp / dpa / reuters / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i 'm an architect and a utopist , " said luc schuiten .
the architect lives and works in brussels and believes that the city , like so many others , has no future if something does not change soon .
" you can not feel good in light of all the environmental pollution and the grim perspectives for the future , " said the 65-year-old visionary .
" so , i try to envision alternatives . "
for the first time ever , drafts and designs by the relatively unknown architect are on display in a large show in brussels .
the entrance to the " vegetal city " installation is composed of an archway made of branches adorned with little yellow lights that blink to the sound of a heartbeat pulsing from speakers .
beyond the entrance , visitors will find architectural models and drawings of balanced , colorful , almost fairy tale-like cities and people who have managed to live in harmony with nature .
round , flowing shapes that weave into one another are schuiten 's trademark .
leaves inspire design bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schuiten 's vertical gardens " the ' vertical gardens ' are a project that would help to heal the city 's wounds , " schuiten said , his eyes sparkling .
he would like to create green areas that span over walkways and platforms and up the sides of buildings .
" the idea is that the vegetation here can be used as herbal or plant sculptures that exude a sense of poetry , " he mused .
" they are a space to withdraw to , a peaceful place where we can discover what we are missing - nature . "
none of schuiten 's visions have yet been turned into reality , even though many of them could be realized if someone had the courage to do so , he said .
the architect has , however , been designing and building private energy-efficient homes made from environmental materials since the 1970s .
nature is his inspiration .
" nature is the only thing that is sustainable , and when we use living materials to build our homes , we are automatically developing things further by employing that same sustainability , " the architect said .
he calls it " archiborescence " - this connection between architecture and arborescence , or " tree structure . "
on the road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the man and his car-bike - advertising his show in brussels to advertise his visions to a larger public , the architect began driving an electric-powered three-wheeler around the city of brussels .
the two-seater vehicle with the exhibition logo on the side looks like a combination of recumbent bicycle and car , and is steered using two joysticks .
" no noise , no pollution , " the designer said as he eased the vehicle from the sidewalk into the street , catching the glances of curious pedestrians and car drivers along the way .
" when i travel more than 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- , i have to pedal , " he explains .
" but i love pedaling - it keeps me in shape .
i can also conserve energy as i travel , and can have fun all at the same time . "
left up to the architect , people in the future would only drive small , electric cars that access their power from tracks along the street .
trucks would have special power trailers attached to them . living his dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luc schuiten calls himself a utopist arriving at his home in brussels ' suburbs , schuiten parks his vehicle in the garage .
the elegant facade of the old townhouse masks a wood-dominated interior designed in schuiten 's flowing style .
a window stretching over two stories looks out into the lush garden .
schuiten sits down to work in his studio attached to the townhouse .
among all the carefully marked drawers and binders are his sketchbooks that stand at the ready beside hundreds of other books lined up on shelves .
ideas spring to mind quickly , he said .

the two leaders also addressed the touchy topic of human rights . the two leaders met near the southern city of munich before being joined by key members of both governments , including the ministers for the interior , environment and economy . the killing of russian human rights activist natalya estemirova in chechnya on wednesday featured prominently in the meeting .
speaking at a news conference with russian president dmitry medvedev on thursday , german chancellor angela merkel described estemirova 's killing as an " unacceptable event . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estemirova 's killing has sparked international outrage merkel said that the murder had " played a role " in her talks with the russian president , who she said had assured her that " everything would be done to clear everything up . "
estemirova was the latest in a string of campaigners to be killed in russia .
thursday 's talks were part of the semi-annual top-level intergovernmental consultations between the two countries known as the " petersburg dialog . "
merkel signals support for magna-sberbank bid the two leaders also discussed foreign policy issues such as iran and north korea and the fight against terrorism , human trafficking and organized crime .
but the meeting was dominated by the two countries ' substantial and growing economic ties which have been hit by the global financial crisis . germany is russia 's single biggest trading partner with bilateral turnover amounting to around 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- last year .
but sergei prikhodko , the kremlin 's chief foreign policy aide , told reporters this week that trade between germany and russia more than halved in the first quarter of 2009 compared with the same period last year .
merkel said the strategic partnership between russia and germany is a " central element " in overcoming the economic crisis .
a pressing economic issue was the possible takeover of troubled german carmaker opel by russian-backed canadian auto parts maker magna international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's sberbank , together with canada 's magna , is interested in troubled car maker opel merkel appeared to back the magna-sberbank bid .
she said it presents " excellent starting points " but added that her government still needs to " clear up " questions .
berlin agreed in late may to support a bid for a majority stake in opel by magna , which has teamed up with state-owned russian bank sberbank and russia 's second-largest auto maker gaz . an estimated 26,000 german jobs are at stake .
medvedev said his government supported the magna-sberbank bid for opel .
" we are interested and optimistic about this project and will do everything to realize it , " he said .
but general motors has also received interest from brussels-based investment group rhj international and from china 's beijing automotive industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- for opel , throwing the deal into some doubt .
trade issues dominate the two governments also signed a slew of economic partnership deals , including a 500-million-euro -lrb- $ 357 million -rrb- credit agreement .
the agreements included a joint declaration on energy cooperation and an agreement between russian railways and siemens to establish a joint venture to produce locomotives .
in addition , frankfurt airport operator fraport is to participate in the expansion of the airport in st petersburg .
the two leaders did not comment on news reports that russian oil giant gazprom is interested in a takeover of bankrupt german shipyards in the northern cities of wismar and rostock .
energy security on the agenda the two leaders also discussed energy security issues .
russia supplies a quarters of europe 's gas needs and germany is europe 's biggest customer for russian gas .
merkel signaled that she was keen to avoid another row with russia over gas supplies .
the german leader stressed the importance of the nord stream gas pipeline , an ambitious project to deliver siberian gas to europe under the baltic sea .
" we think this project is strategically important and necessary , " merkel said .
russia says the nord stream gas pipeline is part of its plan to increase gas volumes and step up the reliability of russian gas supplies to europe , now largely dependent on russia 's thorny political relations with ex-soviet ukraine. sp / dpa / reuters / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
estemirova 's murder " draws attention to the necessity of protecting human rights defenders in russia , " the council 's statement added .
the council 's statement follows a similar condemnation from the eu presidency , currently held by sweden , which took over the rotating six-month presidency of the 27-nation bloc on july 1 .
" we condemn that brutal act and call for the authorities to try to establish who is responsible and take the action that is called for , " said swedish foreign minister carl bildt .
" the presidency urges the russian authorities to swiftly and thoroughly investigate the murder of natalya estemirova and to bring the perpetrators to justice .
her murder draws attention to the necessity of protecting human rights defenders in russia . "
the newly elected president of the european parliament , jerzy buzek , also called on moscow to investigate the murder .
" we in the european parliament have appreciated her work in the fields of human rights , promoting democratic accountability and the implementation of the rule of law , " he said .
" we strongly call on the authorities of the russian federation to start a fully fledged inquiry into her death and do their utmost to bring those responsible for this tragic death to face justice . "
medvedev and merkel discuss murder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev and merkel spoke about the murder during their meeting in munich meanwhile , russian president dmitry medvedev and german chancellor angela merkel discussed estemirova 's murder at a press conference following bilateral talks in munich on thursday .
" the murder of our human rights activist is of course a very sad event , " medvedev said . " in contrast to earlier incidences , it is clear in this case : the murder was connected to her activity -lrb- as an activist -rrb- . "
" she spoke the truth and openly , sometimes toughly described some processes that happen in this country , " medvedev added .
" that is the value of a rights activist - even if these things are not pleasant and uncomfortable for the authorities . "
merkel told reporters gathered at munich 's schleissheim palace that the killing was " an unacceptable event . "
" i think that on the russian side , everything must be done to catch the killer , " she said .
steinmeier , eu greens add voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier made germany 's stance very clear german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also condemned the murder .
“ i am dismayed over the murder of natalia estemirova and strongly condemn this cowardly act , ” steinmeier said in a statement released by the foreign office .
" natalia estemirova was a courageous fighter for human rights in the north caucasus .
those behind the act must now be quickly captured and the planners exposed , " steinmeier added .
the leaders of the greens bloc in the eu assembly also released a statement .
" we deplore the cowardly murder of the exceptional and dedicated human rights activist natalya estemirova , " the statement read .

"
estemirova 's murder " draws attention to the necessity of protecting human rights defenders in russia , " the council 's statement added .
the council 's statement follows a similar condemnation from the eu presidency , currently held by sweden , which took over the rotating six-month presidency of the 27-nation bloc on july 1 .
" we condemn that brutal act and call for the authorities to try to establish who is responsible and take the action that is called for , " said swedish foreign minister carl bildt .
" the presidency urges the russian authorities to swiftly and thoroughly investigate the murder of natalya estemirova and to bring the perpetrators to justice .
her murder draws attention to the necessity of protecting human rights defenders in russia . "
the newly elected president of the european parliament , jerzy buzek , also called on moscow to investigate the murder .
" we in the european parliament have appreciated her work in the fields of human rights , promoting democratic accountability and the implementation of the rule of law , " he said .
" we strongly call on the authorities of the russian federation to start a fully fledged inquiry into her death and do their utmost to bring those responsible for this tragic death to face justice . "

" she spoke the truth and openly , sometimes toughly described some processes that happen in this country , " medvedev added .
" that is the value of a rights activist - even if these things are not pleasant and uncomfortable for the authorities . "

the leaders of the greens bloc in the eu assembly also released a statement .
" we deplore the cowardly murder of the exceptional and dedicated human rights activist natalya estemirova , " the statement read .
the statement called " for a full and independent investigation into her abduction and murder .
the russian judiciary system must put an end to its dismal track record on such cases and for once act urgently and with due diligence . "

" i 'm an architect and a utopist , " said luc schuiten .
the architect lives and works in brussels and believes that the city , like so many others , has no future if something does not change soon .
" you can not feel good in light of all the environmental pollution and the grim perspectives for the future , " said the 65-year-old visionary .
" so , i try to envision alternatives . "
for the first time ever , drafts and designs by the relatively unknown architect are on display in a large show in brussels .
the entrance to the " vegetal city " installation is composed of an archway made of branches adorned with little yellow lights that blink to the sound of a heartbeat pulsing from speakers .
beyond the entrance , visitors will find architectural models and drawings of balanced , colorful , almost fairy tale-like cities and people who have managed to live in harmony with nature .
round , flowing shapes that weave into one another are schuiten 's trademark .
leaves inspire design bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schuiten 's vertical gardens " the ' vertical gardens ' are a project that would help to heal the city 's wounds , " schuiten said , his eyes sparkling .
he would like to create green areas that span over walkways and platforms and up the sides of buildings .
" the idea is that the vegetation here can be used as herbal or plant sculptures that exude a sense of poetry , " he mused .
" they are a space to withdraw to , a peaceful place where we can discover what we are missing - nature . "
none of schuiten 's visions have yet been turned into reality , even though many of them could be realized if someone had the courage to do so , he said .
the architect has , however , been designing and building private energy-efficient homes made from environmental materials since the 1970s .
nature is his inspiration .
" nature is the only thing that is sustainable , and when we use living materials to build our homes , we are automatically developing things further by employing that same sustainability , " the architect said .
he calls it " archiborescence " - this connection between architecture and arborescence , or " tree structure . "
on the road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the man and his car-bike - advertising his show in brussels to advertise his visions to a larger public , the architect began driving an electric-powered three-wheeler around the city of brussels .
the two-seater vehicle with the exhibition logo on the side looks like a combination of recumbent bicycle and car , and is steered using two joysticks .
" no noise , no pollution , " the designer said as he eased the vehicle from the sidewalk into the street , catching the glances of curious pedestrians and car drivers along the way .
" when i travel more than 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- , i have to pedal , " he explains .
" but i love pedaling - it keeps me in shape .
i can also conserve energy as i travel , and can have fun all at the same time . "
left up to the architect , people in the future would only drive small , electric cars that access their power from tracks along the street .

iceland 's government plans to launch its eu membership bid in brussels before the end of this month . the icelandic parliament , the althingi , gave the green light for the government to bid for membership in the european union , with 33 of the nation 's 63 parliamentarians voting in favor of the proposal . a total of 32 votes were required to pass the proposal , but opposition to the move was limited to 28 lawmakers , while another two abstained .
thursday 's narrow victory came as a relief to crisis-stricken prime minister johanna sigurdardottir , who hopes to stabilize iceland 's economy by joining the 27-member bloc .
in the end , however , it will be the citizens of iceland who will have the final word on whether the government pursues membership .
if and when iceland completes successful accession negotiations with the european union , the question will then be put to the people in a referendum .
divisions within the government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister sigurdardottir says only eu membership can save iceland 's economy the governing coalition itself remained divided over the benefits of eu membership for iceland – a country which is dramatically affected by the economic crisis .
while sigurdardottir 's social democrats have always campaigned for joining the bloc , their left-green coalition partners are traditionally opposed to the idea .
five members of the left green party therefore rejected the proposition , including jon bjarnason , the minister of agriculture and fisheries . other left-green deputies including finance minister steingrimur sigfusson , however , displayed political pragmatism by voting for the eu membership application along government lines . " an overwhelming majority wants this eu issue to be dealt with , " sigfusson said .
pros and cons one of the main eu pull factors for the large majority of icelanders is the chance to drop the icelandic krona as a currency .
it shed nearly half its value in the wake of last year 's financial crash , while inflation rose to over 12 percent .
as a small island state with just 320.000 citizens , iceland relies heavily on imports .
the strongest opposition to iceland 's eu membership comes from the fishing and agricultural industries .
they are opposed to handing over the control over iceland 's lucrative fishing grounds to brussels .
" we would no longer be the lawmakers on how we run our fishing industry .
this is the key element for us .
and we just do n't see any need for an application when you know what the outcome is going to be , " said sigurdur sverrisson from the federation of icelandic fishing vessel owners -lrb- liu -rrb- .
if and how iceland could keep the control over this vital part of the economy while having to join the – currently unsuccessful - common eu fisheries policy will be one of the most important and tricky questions during the accession talks .
popular support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurosceptic protests in reykjavik were low-key according to the most recent figures , around 70 percent of icelanders support the launch of eu accession talks .
" i would like to talk and find out what we can get and what we 'd have to give , " is an often-heard comment on reykjavik 's streets these days .
the nation remains divided over the prospect of full membership in the bloc , however , with many citizens complaining about a lack of information .
unlike norway , iceland has never applied to the eu because the majority of politicians were against it .
" what we have seen in the last few months is a shift in political leadership rather than a great shift in the public opinion , although the public opinion for membership of course strengthened due to the economic crisis , " concludes adalsteinn leifsson from reykjavik university .
hope for speedy progress iceland 's foreign minister össur skarpedinsson , a leading social democrat , has already outlined an ambitious agenda for the accession procedures .
iceland plans to launch its application in time for the next meeting of the eu foreign ministers on july 27 .
the fact that iceland is already a member of the european economic area -lrb- eea -rrb- and the border-free schengen zone means accession talks are likely to be relatively short .
around two thirds of all icelandic legislation is already in line with eu rules .
it is widely viewed as favorable for iceland that another nordic country , sweden , currently holds the eu presidency .
" we do n't hide the fact that we want our friends to support us , " said skarpedinsson .
the swedes support a speedy negotiation process with iceland , and eu officials mentioned 2011 or 2012 as possible accession dates .
a referendum will be held , meaning the icelandic citizens will have the last say in the matter .

certainly not the tourist magnet it is as home to the world 's third largest gothic church .
with all the visitors , though , comes a lot of dirt . cologne 's magnificent cathedral is eye candy for goth fans .
on a sunny day , its blackish spires contrast starkly against a bright blue sky .
the clouds on an overcast day , on the other hand , seem to swallow the steeples as they shoot up to the heavens . all that beauty costs time and money , however . while the some 100 million tourists who travel to the city on the rhine river - nearly 6.5 million of whom visit the cathedral - help fill the municipal coffers each year , millions of euros must be spent on the church 's maintenance . along with their money , visitors to the cathedral -lrb- known as the koelner dom in german -rrb- drag in substantial quantities of dirt , which does n't just cover the floor , but also the church 's countless statues , mosaics and other artworks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral is one of many churches in cologne no ordinary cleaning personnel would do for sweeping away all the dust . " my daily equipment consists of a vacuum cleaner , various paintbrushes , dusting towels , a headlamp , scalpel , sponges and fiberglass pens , " said bettina grimm , germany 's only female specialist in the field of plaster restoration .
" i also use mortar and pigments when more restorative work has to be done . " she was given the title putzrestauratorin by the cathedral 's master builder barbara schock-werner as a play on words : putz in german means " plaster " but the verb putzen means " to clean . " more than blowing off the dust restorative specialist grimm looks more like an archeologist than part of the cleaning crew as she sets about her task with both precision and a gentle touch .
holding a small paintbrush in one hand and the vacuum cleaner in the other , she carefully removes tiny particles of dust from valuable statues .
in this business , normal cleaning detergents are completely off-limits . grimm works together with some 60 stone masons , sculptors , carpenters , painters , electricians , locksmiths , glass restorers and gold and silversmiths to keep the cathedral shining .
it 's a tall order , considering the toll both the city pollution and thousands of visitors take on the 800-year-old dom each day . as the sole person responsible for " dusting " in the cathedral , grimm must cover over 6,000 square meters -lrb- around 64,500 square feet -rrb- of space . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restoration work on the cathedral is a balancing act " i have to dust off seven choir chapels and the choir stall and at the end of the week , on fridays , i have to do the wood carvings and the cushions so that everything is sparkling clean for mass on sunday , " grimm said . " i also have to clean the stations of the cross , " she added .
" actually , i 'm always trying to catch up because there are not enough hours in the day . " architectural and advertising icon the cathedral 's annual budget is between six and seven million euros -lrb- $ 8 to 9.4 million -rrb- , which mostly goes to the staff . all the money and maintenance efforts , however , pay off since the cologne cathedral is one of the most popular tourist destinations in germany .
cologne would not be cologne without the city 's landmark , said josef sommer , managing director of the cologne tourist office koelntourismus . " the cathedral is inherent to cologne , " he said .
" that 's been the case since the middle ages , since the time the architectural drafts were made for this outstanding cathedral .
cologne 's reputation and its attractiveness as a tourist destination are closely connected to the church . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dom is home to many nooks and crannies waiting to be dusted off the cologne cathedral was named a world heritage site by unesco in 1996 .
according to the united nations agency , the dom embodies the high gothic architectural style like no other cathedral in the world in its purity and perfection . construction of the church began in 1248 and was not completed until 1880 .
since its completion , its 150-meter-high -lrb- 492-foot -rrb- spires have become the city 's trademark - so much so that even companies use the spires as advertising icons . one could almost say that the city of cologne thrives financially from the cathedral . " about 5.5 billion euros are generated in the tourism industry in cologne , " said sommer .
" that means that without tourists , who also come to see the cathedral , 5.5 billion euros fewer would be spent in this city . " in other words , every cent spent to keep the cathedral sparkling is a cent spent to keep the city going . author : frank gazon -lrb- als -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

citing a profact agency study , afp reported that " seventy percent of belgians find that too much tax money goes to the royal family , and one-third want to get rid of the government allowance altogether . "
the debate over whether or not the government should restrict the number of royal family members receiving a government allowance first arose in the senate ten years ago . however , reforms failed to pass without a political majority , and the debate died down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law on royal financing would not affect king albert , queen paola , or their three children one reason the issue has come up again , according to christian laporte , royal watcher for la libre belgique , is that the royal family keeps expanding .
" the debate was always present , of course , in the society , and there is also another important fact for tomorrow , and that fact is that there are now not just three princes , but twelve or thirteen , " said laporte .
this same concern has been echoed across europe .
therefore , when public debate over royal financing was re-ignited in belgium ten months ago , lawmakers decided to call-in constitutional experts from other european monarchies to help reach a compromise . in the proposed law , all monarchs would be banned from receiving state cash and perks - except for the monarch , his or her spouse , and heir to the throne .
however , the changes would not go into effect until the end of king albert 's reign , which means all three of his children will still be entitled to government stipends for the rest of their lives .
two years ago , king albert 's youngest son , prince laurent caused a stir when he was alleged to have used taxpayers ' money to refurbish his villa .
however , royal watcher christian laporte says that the prince was never convicted of the allegations in court . " we could n't say that prince laurent has problems , because he has not been condemned .
he went alone to give testimony , and he went out of the court as free as when he came in - of course , " said laporte . flemish nationalists have been some of the most outspoken opponents of the monarchy - and as separatists - reject it as a symbol of belgian unity .
a couple of flemish politicians have sparked controversy with their remarks on the royal family .
on his first day on the job , flemish parliamentary speaker jan peumans announced that he refused to attend any royal receptions .
" it 's very simple , " peumans remarked .
" i promised my father i would n't do things like this .
if other people want to go – no problem – i would never accept a belgian medal either .
it 's my right . "
in addition to the 12 million euros per year in pay and benefits that the royal family reportedly receives , flemish nationalist lawmaker jan jambon has claimed that they get another 16 million euros in hidden costs from other government budgets .
a republican movement was also founded by french-speaking belgians , but it does not appear to have gained much momentum .
the draft bill to cap royal allowances by contrast has found broad bi-partisan support .

certainly not the tourist magnet it is as home to the world 's third largest gothic church .
with all the visitors , though , comes a lot of dirt . cologne 's magnificent cathedral is eye candy for goth fans .
on a sunny day , its blackish spires contrast starkly against a bright blue sky .
the clouds on an overcast day , on the other hand , seem to swallow the steeples as they shoot up to the heavens . all that beauty costs time and money , however . while the some 100 million tourists who travel to the city on the rhine river - nearly 6.5 million of whom visit the cathedral - help fill the municipal coffers each year , millions of euros must be spent on the church 's maintenance . along with their money , visitors to the cathedral -lrb- known as the koelner dom in german -rrb- drag in substantial quantities of dirt , which does n't just cover the floor , but also the church 's countless statues , mosaics and other artworks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral is one of many churches in cologne no ordinary cleaning personnel would do for sweeping away all the dust . " my daily equipment consists of a vacuum cleaner , various paintbrushes , dusting towels , a headlamp , scalpel , sponges and fiberglass pens , " said bettina grimm , germany 's only female specialist in the field of plaster restoration .
" i also use mortar and pigments when more restorative work has to be done . " she was given the title putzrestauratorin by the cathedral 's master builder barbara schock-werner as a play on words : putz in german means " plaster " but the verb putzen means " to clean . " more than blowing off the dust restorative specialist grimm looks more like an archeologist than part of the cleaning crew as she sets about her task with both precision and a gentle touch .
holding a small paintbrush in one hand and the vacuum cleaner in the other , she carefully removes tiny particles of dust from valuable statues .
in this business , normal cleaning detergents are completely off-limits . grimm works together with some 60 stone masons , sculptors , carpenters , painters , electricians , locksmiths , glass restorers and gold and silversmiths to keep the cathedral shining .
it 's a tall order , considering the toll both the city pollution and thousands of visitors take on the 800-year-old dom each day . as the sole person responsible for " dusting " in the cathedral , grimm must cover over 6,000 square meters -lrb- around 64,500 square feet -rrb- of space . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restoration work on the cathedral is a balancing act " i have to dust off seven choir chapels and the choir stall and at the end of the week , on fridays , i have to do the wood carvings and the cushions so that everything is sparkling clean for mass on sunday , " grimm said . " i also have to clean the stations of the cross , " she added .
" actually , i 'm always trying to catch up because there are not enough hours in the day . " architectural and advertising icon the cathedral 's annual budget is between six and seven million euros -lrb- $ 8 to 9.4 million -rrb- , which mostly goes to the staff . all the money and maintenance efforts , however , pay off since the cologne cathedral is one of the most popular tourist destinations in germany .
cologne would not be cologne without the city 's landmark , said josef sommer , managing director of the cologne tourist office koelntourismus . " the cathedral is inherent to cologne , " he said .
" that 's been the case since the middle ages , since the time the architectural drafts were made for this outstanding cathedral .
cologne 's reputation and its attractiveness as a tourist destination are closely connected to the church . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dom is home to many nooks and crannies waiting to be dusted off the cologne cathedral was named a world heritage site by unesco in 1996 .
according to the united nations agency , the dom embodies the high gothic architectural style like no other cathedral in the world in its purity and perfection . construction of the church began in 1248 and was not completed until 1880 .
since its completion , its 150-meter-high -lrb- 492-foot -rrb- spires have become the city 's trademark - so much so that even companies use the spires as advertising icons . one could almost say that the city of cologne thrives financially from the cathedral . " about 5.5 billion euros are generated in the tourism industry in cologne , " said sommer .
" that means that without tourists , who also come to see the cathedral , 5.5 billion euros fewer would be spent in this city . " in other words , every cent spent to keep the cathedral sparkling is a cent spent to keep the city going . author : frank gazon -lrb- als -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move comes just 10 weeks before national elections in germany .
carstensen said lawmakers were expected to vote on the dissolution in the capital kiel on monday , and that he wanted to call an early election on sept .
27 to coincide with the federal election .
social democrats to resist dissolution however , the spd has pledged to vote against the proposal for dissolution of the parliament .
without a two-thirds majority vote , the proposal will not succeed . " the spd will stick to the coalition agreement .
there is no reason to dissolve the state assembly , " the spd 's state leader ralf stegener told german television .
" if the state premier does n't think he can carry on , he can resign . " premier carstensen however said he had tried hard to work with the spd and had informed his fellow christian democrat chancellor angela merkel of the dire situation in the state . " what i 've gone through in the last weeks brings one to the edge , " carstensen said . state coalition woes mirror those of federal government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's grand coalition between the conservatives and social democrats has been strained the two parties have ruled together in an awkward coalition since 2005 .
they have clashed over bonus payments to banking executives at the state-owned hsh nordbank and malfunctions at the kruemmel nuclear power plant . schleswig-holstein 's coalition woes mirrors bickering in the federal grand coalition and could signal an end to the cdu-spd partnership after the election . the deputy chairman of the cdu 's federal parliamentary group , wolfgang bosbach , said threat of a stalemate in schleswig-holstein highlights the fact that germany 's two major parties are uncomfortable bedfellows . " this is a signal for berlin , " bosbach told the online edition of newspaper handelsblatt .
" the call for a new election shows that a grand coalition is not a permanent solution . "
merkel is appealing to voters to use september 's federal election to dump the spd and allow the cdu to form a coalition government with the liberal free democrats. sp / dpa / ap / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

certainly not the tourist magnet it is as home to the world 's third largest gothic church .
with all the visitors , though , comes a lot of dirt . cologne 's magnificent cathedral is eye candy for goth fans .
on a sunny day , its blackish spires contrast starkly against a bright blue sky .
the clouds on an overcast day , on the other hand , seem to swallow the steeples as they shoot up to the heavens . all that beauty costs time and money , however . while the some 100 million tourists who travel to the city on the rhine river - nearly 6.5 million of whom visit the cathedral - help fill the municipal coffers each year , millions of euros must be spent on the church 's maintenance . along with their money , visitors to the cathedral -lrb- known as the koelner dom in german -rrb- drag in substantial quantities of dirt , which does n't just cover the floor , but also the church 's countless statues , mosaics and other artworks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral is one of many churches in cologne no ordinary cleaning personnel would do for sweeping away all the dust . " my daily equipment consists of a vacuum cleaner , various paintbrushes , dusting towels , a headlamp , scalpel , sponges and fiberglass pens , " said bettina grimm , germany 's only female specialist in the field of plaster restoration .
" i also use mortar and pigments when more restorative work has to be done . " she was given the title putzrestauratorin by the cathedral 's master builder barbara schock-werner as a play on words : putz in german means " plaster " but the verb putzen means " to clean . " more than blowing off the dust restorative specialist grimm looks more like an archeologist than part of the cleaning crew as she sets about her task with both precision and a gentle touch .
holding a small paintbrush in one hand and the vacuum cleaner in the other , she carefully removes tiny particles of dust from valuable statues .
in this business , normal cleaning detergents are completely off-limits . grimm works together with some 60 stone masons , sculptors , carpenters , painters , electricians , locksmiths , glass restorers and gold and silversmiths to keep the cathedral shining .
it 's a tall order , considering the toll both the city pollution and thousands of visitors take on the 800-year-old dom each day . as the sole person responsible for " dusting " in the cathedral , grimm must cover over 6,000 square meters -lrb- around 64,500 square feet -rrb- of space . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restoration work on the cathedral is a balancing act " i have to dust off seven choir chapels and the choir stall and at the end of the week , on fridays , i have to do the wood carvings and the cushions so that everything is sparkling clean for mass on sunday , " grimm said . " i also have to clean the stations of the cross , " she added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 16.07.2009 belgium seeks caps on public financing for royal family großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seventy percent of belgians believe that too much tax money goes to the royal family belgian lawmakers are drafting a bill to reduce the amount of public money being spent to support the royal family , which currently receives 12 million euros per year . while the royal family still finds broad support in the country , many people agree that their government allowance should be reduced .
citing a profact agency study , afp reported that " seventy percent of belgians find that too much tax money goes to the royal family , and one-third want to get rid of the government allowance altogether . "
the debate over whether or not the government should restrict the number of royal family members receiving a government allowance first arose in the senate ten years ago . however , reforms failed to pass without a political majority , and the debate died down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law on royal financing would not affect king albert , queen paola , or their three children one reason the issue has come up again , according to christian laporte , royal watcher for la libre belgique , is that the royal family keeps expanding .
" the debate was always present , of course , in the society , and there is also another important fact for tomorrow , and that fact is that there are now not just three princes , but twelve or thirteen , " said laporte .
this same concern has been echoed across europe .
therefore , when public debate over royal financing was re-ignited in belgium ten months ago , lawmakers decided to call-in constitutional experts from other european monarchies to help reach a compromise . in the proposed law , all monarchs would be banned from receiving state cash and perks - except for the monarch , his or her spouse , and heir to the throne .
however , the changes would not go into effect until the end of king albert 's reign , which means all three of his children will still be entitled to government stipends for the rest of their lives .
two years ago , king albert 's youngest son , prince laurent caused a stir when he was alleged to have used taxpayers ' money to refurbish his villa .
however , royal watcher christian laporte says that the prince was never convicted of the allegations in court . " we could n't say that prince laurent has problems , because he has not been condemned .
he went alone to give testimony , and he went out of the court as free as when he came in - of course , " said laporte . flemish nationalists have been some of the most outspoken opponents of the monarchy - and as separatists - reject it as a symbol of belgian unity .
a couple of flemish politicians have sparked controversy with their remarks on the royal family .
on his first day on the job , flemish parliamentary speaker jan peumans announced that he refused to attend any royal receptions .
" it 's very simple , " peumans remarked .
" i promised my father i would n't do things like this .
if other people want to go – no problem – i would never accept a belgian medal either .
it 's my right . "
in addition to the 12 million euros per year in pay and benefits that the royal family reportedly receives , flemish nationalist lawmaker jan jambon has claimed that they get another 16 million euros in hidden costs from other government budgets .
a republican movement was also founded by french-speaking belgians , but it does not appear to have gained much momentum .
the draft bill to cap royal allowances by contrast has found broad bi-partisan support .

the move comes just 10 weeks before national elections in germany .
carstensen said lawmakers were expected to vote on the dissolution in the capital kiel on monday , and that he wanted to call an early election on sept .
27 to coincide with the federal election .
social democrats to resist dissolution however , the spd has pledged to vote against the proposal for dissolution of the parliament .
without a two-thirds majority vote , the proposal will not succeed . " the spd will stick to the coalition agreement .
there is no reason to dissolve the state assembly , " the spd 's state leader ralf stegener told german television .
" if the state premier does n't think he can carry on , he can resign . " premier carstensen however said he had tried hard to work with the spd and had informed his fellow christian democrat chancellor angela merkel of the dire situation in the state . " what i 've gone through in the last weeks brings one to the edge , " carstensen said . state coalition woes mirror those of federal government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's grand coalition between the conservatives and social democrats has been strained the two parties have ruled together in an awkward coalition since 2005 .
they have clashed over bonus payments to banking executives at the state-owned hsh nordbank and malfunctions at the kruemmel nuclear power plant . schleswig-holstein 's coalition woes mirrors bickering in the federal grand coalition and could signal an end to the cdu-spd partnership after the election . the deputy chairman of the cdu 's federal parliamentary group , wolfgang bosbach , said threat of a stalemate in schleswig-holstein highlights the fact that germany 's two major parties are uncomfortable bedfellows . " this is a signal for berlin , " bosbach told the online edition of newspaper handelsblatt .
" the call for a new election shows that a grand coalition is not a permanent solution . "
merkel is appealing to voters to use september 's federal election to dump the spd and allow the cdu to form a coalition government with the liberal free democrats. sp / dpa / ap / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

certainly not the tourist magnet it is as home to the world 's third largest gothic church .
with all the visitors , though , comes a lot of dirt . cologne 's magnificent cathedral is eye candy for goth fans .
on a sunny day , its blackish spires contrast starkly against a bright blue sky .
the clouds on an overcast day , on the other hand , seem to swallow the steeples as they shoot up to the heavens . all that beauty costs time and money , however . while the some 100 million tourists who travel to the city on the rhine river - nearly 6.5 million of whom visit the cathedral - help fill the municipal coffers each year , millions of euros must be spent on the church 's maintenance . along with their money , visitors to the cathedral -lrb- known as the koelner dom in german -rrb- drag in substantial quantities of dirt , which does n't just cover the floor , but also the church 's countless statues , mosaics and other artworks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral is one of many churches in cologne no ordinary cleaning personnel would do for sweeping away all the dust . " my daily equipment consists of a vacuum cleaner , various paintbrushes , dusting towels , a headlamp , scalpel , sponges and fiberglass pens , " said bettina grimm , germany 's only female specialist in the field of plaster restoration .
" i also use mortar and pigments when more restorative work has to be done . " she was given the title putzrestauratorin by the cathedral 's master builder barbara schock-werner as a play on words : putz in german means " plaster " but the verb putzen means " to clean . " more than blowing off the dust restorative specialist grimm looks more like an archeologist than part of the cleaning crew as she sets about her task with both precision and a gentle touch .
holding a small paintbrush in one hand and the vacuum cleaner in the other , she carefully removes tiny particles of dust from valuable statues .
in this business , normal cleaning detergents are completely off-limits . grimm works together with some 60 stone masons , sculptors , carpenters , painters , electricians , locksmiths , glass restorers and gold and silversmiths to keep the cathedral shining .
it 's a tall order , considering the toll both the city pollution and thousands of visitors take on the 800-year-old dom each day . as the sole person responsible for " dusting " in the cathedral , grimm must cover over 6,000 square meters -lrb- around 64,500 square feet -rrb- of space . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restoration work on the cathedral is a balancing act " i have to dust off seven choir chapels and the choir stall and at the end of the week , on fridays , i have to do the wood carvings and the cushions so that everything is sparkling clean for mass on sunday , " grimm said . " i also have to clean the stations of the cross , " she added .
" actually , i 'm always trying to catch up because there are not enough hours in the day . " architectural and advertising icon the cathedral 's annual budget is between six and seven million euros -lrb- $ 8 to 9.4 million -rrb- , which mostly goes to the staff . all the money and maintenance efforts , however , pay off since the cologne cathedral is one of the most popular tourist destinations in germany .
cologne would not be cologne without the city 's landmark , said josef sommer , managing director of the cologne tourist office koelntourismus . " the cathedral is inherent to cologne , " he said .
" that 's been the case since the middle ages , since the time the architectural drafts were made for this outstanding cathedral .

according to the united nations agency , the dom embodies the high gothic architectural style like no other cathedral in the world in its purity and perfection . construction of the church began in 1248 and was not completed until 1880 .
since its completion , its 150-meter-high -lrb- 492-foot -rrb- spires have become the city 's trademark - so much so that even companies use the spires as advertising icons . one could almost say that the city of cologne thrives financially from the cathedral . " about 5.5 billion euros are generated in the tourism industry in cologne , " said sommer .

the move comes just 10 weeks before national elections in germany .
carstensen said lawmakers were expected to vote on the dissolution in the capital kiel on monday , and that he wanted to call an early election on sept .
27 to coincide with the federal election .
social democrats to resist dissolution however , the spd has pledged to vote against the proposal for dissolution of the parliament .
without a two-thirds majority vote , the proposal will not succeed . " the spd will stick to the coalition agreement .
there is no reason to dissolve the state assembly , " the spd 's state leader ralf stegener told german television .
" if the state premier does n't think he can carry on , he can resign . " premier carstensen however said he had tried hard to work with the spd and had informed his fellow christian democrat chancellor angela merkel of the dire situation in the state . " what i 've gone through in the last weeks brings one to the edge , " carstensen said . state coalition woes mirror those of federal government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's grand coalition between the conservatives and social democrats has been strained the two parties have ruled together in an awkward coalition since 2005 .
they have clashed over bonus payments to banking executives at the state-owned hsh nordbank and malfunctions at the kruemmel nuclear power plant . schleswig-holstein 's coalition woes mirrors bickering in the federal grand coalition and could signal an end to the cdu-spd partnership after the election . the deputy chairman of the cdu 's federal parliamentary group , wolfgang bosbach , said threat of a stalemate in schleswig-holstein highlights the fact that germany 's two major parties are uncomfortable bedfellows . " this is a signal for berlin , " bosbach told the online edition of newspaper handelsblatt .
" the call for a new election shows that a grand coalition is not a permanent solution . "
merkel is appealing to voters to use september 's federal election to dump the spd and allow the cdu to form a coalition government with the liberal free democrats. sp / dpa / ap / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to chinese media reports , the nigerian businessman had overstayed his visa .
the case - the first of its kind - has highlighted the plight of the growing number of african immigrants in china . officially , some 20,000 africans live in china , mostly traders and students .
but unofficial estimates suggest that 20,000 might be living in the southern city of guangzhou alone .
most are from nigeria .
alexander demissie , an ethiopian who does research on african-chinese relations at bochum university in germany , explains : “ basically , they are middlemen .
they set the connection between the chinese manufacturers and the african traders .
most of the time , these nigerians living in guangzhou are highly-educated and speak very good chinese because they studied at the universities . ”
“ sun yatsen university in guangzhou is one of the famous universities where you can find a lot of african students .
it ’ s of course easier for them to have access to the chinese market because of the language .
this helps the african traders coming to china for two weeks or three weeks to buy goods . ”
as china has been very keen on promoting trade and political relations with african countries , visa regulations tend to be generous , says demissie : “ people can easily get a chinese visa , as soon as they can prove that they are traders or students . ”
he adds that this incident should not have happened and says such problems are unusual .
police is tougher with africans on the other hand , he says , the police does tend to be tough with african immigrants and “ africans do face harsher controls inside china than people from other countries . ”
he wenping , an africa specialist at the chinese academy of social sciences in beijing , says that many africans are better integrated in china than westerners .
“ the africans , both traders and students find it easier to overcome the language barrier than europeans and americans . ”
“ i ’ ve come across so many people who speak perfectly fluent chinese .
they find it easier to master the different tones we have in our chinese pronunciation .
they easily adapt to the local environment in the chinese cities , and chinese food is no problem for them . ”
africans not always accepted by chinese society but alexander demissie , who has also lived in china , says other issues can create difficulties : “ from my own experience , it ’ s not easy as an african to have a chinese girlfriend , for example .
of course , if you live in one country , you will take part in the social life , you might also get a chinese girlfriend and so on . ”
but he says people around might not consider this in a friendly light , adding that some people act rudely or badly towards africans in china .
demissie says there are also occasional street fights between groups of africans and of chinese , and that there is a general lack of knowledge about africa among ordinary people in china .
but with growing exposure through trade and political links , this seems likely to change in the foreseeable future .

according to chinese media reports , the nigerian businessman had overstayed his visa .
the case - the first of its kind - has highlighted the plight of the growing number of african immigrants in china . officially , some 20,000 africans live in china , mostly traders and students .
but unofficial estimates suggest that 20,000 might be living in the southern city of guangzhou alone .
most are from nigeria .
alexander demissie , an ethiopian who does research on african-chinese relations at bochum university in germany , explains : “ basically , they are middlemen .
they set the connection between the chinese manufacturers and the african traders .
most of the time , these nigerians living in guangzhou are highly-educated and speak very good chinese because they studied at the universities . ”
“ sun yatsen university in guangzhou is one of the famous universities where you can find a lot of african students .
it ’ s of course easier for them to have access to the chinese market because of the language .
this helps the african traders coming to china for two weeks or three weeks to buy goods . ”
as china has been very keen on promoting trade and political relations with african countries , visa regulations tend to be generous , says demissie : “ people can easily get a chinese visa , as soon as they can prove that they are traders or students . ”
he adds that this incident should not have happened and says such problems are unusual .
police is tougher with africans on the other hand , he says , the police does tend to be tough with african immigrants and “ africans do face harsher controls inside china than people from other countries . ”
he wenping , an africa specialist at the chinese academy of social sciences in beijing , says that many africans are better integrated in china than westerners .
“ the africans , both traders and students find it easier to overcome the language barrier than europeans and americans . ”
“ i ’ ve come across so many people who speak perfectly fluent chinese .
they find it easier to master the different tones we have in our chinese pronunciation .
they easily adapt to the local environment in the chinese cities , and chinese food is no problem for them . ”
africans not always accepted by chinese society but alexander demissie , who has also lived in china , says other issues can create difficulties : “ from my own experience , it ’ s not easy as an african to have a chinese girlfriend , for example .
of course , if you live in one country , you will take part in the social life , you might also get a chinese girlfriend and so on . ”
but he says people around might not consider this in a friendly light , adding that some people act rudely or badly towards africans in china .
demissie says there are also occasional street fights between groups of africans and of chinese , and that there is a general lack of knowledge about africa among ordinary people in china .
but with growing exposure through trade and political links , this seems likely to change in the foreseeable future .

at the beginning of the 1990s , the government introduced a new family planning policy .
it included concrete goals for reducing the birth-rate by using more modern methods of contraception .
hanoi also called on help from germany . the german organisation for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , the kfw , a german government-owned development bank and inwent , a german capacity-building non-profit organisation , have been supporting the vietnamese ministry of health since 1994 .
" the different institutes work practically hand-in-hand , ” explains günther riethmacher , gtz country director in hanoi .
“ the gtz does consulting and helps build up consulting points by training personnel .
the kfw invests in the infrastructure , and for example provides money to supply contraception . ”
“ the german development service has individual experts that offer advice at a provincial level and inwent gives courses about how health policy can become part of national strategy .
each institute brings its own expertise to such programmes . ”
significant results in 15 years the results are significant .
the average birth-rate has gone down to 1.9 children per family over the past 15 years .
“ advice on contraception , on condoms as well as the pill , is well accepted .
three out of four married women now admit they use contraception .
that ’ s similar to the figure in germany . “ promoting the use of condoms can kill two birds with one stone - this cheap and easy form of contraception helps reduce pregnancies and also prevent sexually-transmitted diseases , including hiv-aids .
general awareness campaigns about hiv-aids have been very successful : “ 90 percent of the population now admits they know the main ways of getting infected .
we measure our achievements according to these concrete things and then we can really say that something has happened and we have made a positive contribution . ”
family planning needs to be key priority the high abortion rate has also been halved .
this is another indication that the efforts to provide advice have paid off .
such successes can only happen if family planning is a key priority of the partner country .
riethmacher says this is certainly the case in vietnam : " what can be said over and over is that we have been well received and what is also important for the success of other projects is that the vietnamese government follows its own development policies and then seeks individual countries , such as germany , to help it promote its development work . ”

at the beginning of the 1990s , the government introduced a new family planning policy .

" the different institutes work practically hand-in-hand , ” explains günther riethmacher , gtz country director in hanoi .
“ the gtz does consulting and helps build up consulting points by training personnel .
the kfw invests in the infrastructure , and for example provides money to supply contraception . ”

riethmacher says this is certainly the case in vietnam : " what can be said over and over is that we have been well received and what is also important for the success of other projects is that the vietnamese government follows its own development policies and then seeks individual countries , such as germany , to help it promote its development work . ”

eu-members most affected are demanding that their eu partners share responsibility . during a meeting in stockholm on thursday , eu interior ministers addressed europe 's illegal immigration problem .
all agree that something needs to be done to alleviate the stress on mediterranean countries , but not all can agree how .
" two issues are the most important : one is the creation of a common european asylum system , which would mean that we would have increased solidarity between member states and more shared responsibility , " said sweden 's migration minister tobias billstrom , who led the informal meeting .
" the second thing is the question of legal migration : we need to open more ways for people to come to europe and work here , " billstrom added .
according to eu justice commissioner jacques barrot , all member states support efforts to strengthen the eu border-control agency frontex .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece has come under fire for deporting migrants in need of asylum .
pictured : prime minister costas karamanlis every year , thousands of people from africa , the middle east and central asia risk their lives crossing the mediterranean sea for a chance at a better life in europe . the united nations high commission for refugees estimates that in 2008 alone , more than 67,000 people tried to enter europe illegally via the mediterranean .
the influx has caused a major strain on the reception services of four eu-member states in particular - cyprus , greece , italy and malta - and they have repeatedly called for other european countries to shoulder some of the burden .
more solidarity needed eu leaders first called for greater cooperation with european countries most affected by illegal migration during a june meeting , but they also maintained that such efforts should be voluntary .
critics of that viewpoint , such as cypriot interior minister neoklis sylikiotis , say that relying on voluntary assistance is n't sustainable in the long term .
" it is time that we have more solidarity from the other member countries , " said sylikiotis .
" countries that are the first point of contact should not have to shoulder the entire problem . "
italy 's interior minister roberto maroni shared sylikiotis ' feelings , stating that " burden sharing " should be one of the top priorities for the eu 's new five-year plan on justice issues , also discussed in stockholm .
however , many countries outside of the mediterranean zone believe that instead of focusing on greater cooperation within the eu , the bloc should be working with migrants ' countries of origin to reduce the number of people wanting to leave in the first place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu interior ministers met in stockholm for a meeting on justice and home affairs eu members have often been critized for their handling of illegal migrants , who may not necessarily be escaping economic hardship , but who face political persecution or violence in their homeland .
the un , human rights groups , and the vatican have all publically denounced italy and greece for sending back migrants who were in need of asylum .
the german refugee organization " pro-asylum " has also criticized other eu members for not doing enough .
" countries like germany can no longer sit on their hands ... an unbureaucratic and speedy distribution of those seeking protection - like those stranded in greece - is a question of humanity and solidarity .

the two leaders also addressed the touchy topic of human rights . the two leaders met near the southern city of munich before being joined by key members of both governments , including the ministers for the interior , environment and economy . the killing of russian human rights activist natalya estemirova in chechnya on wednesday featured prominently in the meeting .
speaking at a news conference with russian president dmitry medvedev on thursday , german chancellor angela merkel described estemirova 's killing as an " unacceptable event . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estemirova 's killing has sparked international outrage merkel said that the murder had " played a role " in her talks with the russian president , who she said had assured her that " everything would be done to clear everything up . "
estemirova was the latest in a string of campaigners to be killed in russia .
thursday 's talks were part of the semi-annual top-level intergovernmental consultations between the two countries known as the " petersburg dialog . "
merkel signals support for magna-sberbank bid the two leaders also discussed foreign policy issues such as iran and north korea and the fight against terrorism , human trafficking and organized crime .
but the meeting was dominated by the two countries ' substantial and growing economic ties which have been hit by the global financial crisis . germany is russia 's single biggest trading partner with bilateral turnover amounting to around 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- last year .
but sergei prikhodko , the kremlin 's chief foreign policy aide , told reporters this week that trade between germany and russia more than halved in the first quarter of 2009 compared with the same period last year .
merkel said the strategic partnership between russia and germany is a " central element " in overcoming the economic crisis .
a pressing economic issue was the possible takeover of troubled german carmaker opel by russian-backed canadian auto parts maker magna international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's sberbank , together with canada 's magna , is interested in troubled car maker opel merkel appeared to back the magna-sberbank bid .
she said it presents " excellent starting points " but added that her government still needs to " clear up " questions .
berlin agreed in late may to support a bid for a majority stake in opel by magna , which has teamed up with state-owned russian bank sberbank and russia 's second-largest auto maker gaz . an estimated 26,000 german jobs are at stake .
medvedev said his government supported the magna-sberbank bid for opel .
" we are interested and optimistic about this project and will do everything to realize it , " he said .
but general motors has also received interest from brussels-based investment group rhj international and from china 's beijing automotive industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- for opel , throwing the deal into some doubt .
trade issues dominate the two governments also signed a slew of economic partnership deals , including a 500-million-euro -lrb- $ 357 million -rrb- credit agreement .
the agreements included a joint declaration on energy cooperation and an agreement between russian railways and siemens to establish a joint venture to produce locomotives .
in addition , frankfurt airport operator fraport is to participate in the expansion of the airport in st petersburg .
the two leaders did not comment on news reports that russian oil giant gazprom is interested in a takeover of bankrupt german shipyards in the northern cities of wismar and rostock .
energy security on the agenda the two leaders also discussed energy security issues .
russia supplies a quarters of europe 's gas needs and germany is europe 's biggest customer for russian gas .
merkel signaled that she was keen to avoid another row with russia over gas supplies .
the german leader stressed the importance of the nord stream gas pipeline , an ambitious project to deliver siberian gas to europe under the baltic sea .
" we think this project is strategically important and necessary , " merkel said .
russia says the nord stream gas pipeline is part of its plan to increase gas volumes and step up the reliability of russian gas supplies to europe , now largely dependent on russia 's thorny political relations with ex-soviet ukraine. sp / dpa / reuters / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

speaking at a news conference with russian president dmitry medvedev on thursday , german chancellor angela merkel described estemirova 's killing as an " unacceptable event . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estemirova 's killing has sparked international outrage merkel said that the murder had " played a role " in her talks with the russian president , who she said had assured her that " everything would be done to clear everything up . "
estemirova was the latest in a string of campaigners to be killed in russia .
thursday 's talks were part of the semi-annual top-level intergovernmental consultations between the two countries known as the " petersburg dialog . "
merkel signals support for magna-sberbank bid the two leaders also discussed foreign policy issues such as iran and north korea and the fight against terrorism , human trafficking and organized crime .
but the meeting was dominated by the two countries ' substantial and growing economic ties which have been hit by the global financial crisis . germany is russia 's single biggest trading partner with bilateral turnover amounting to around 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- last year .
but sergei prikhodko , the kremlin 's chief foreign policy aide , told reporters this week that trade between germany and russia more than halved in the first quarter of 2009 compared with the same period last year .
merkel said the strategic partnership between russia and germany is a " central element " in overcoming the economic crisis .
a pressing economic issue was the possible takeover of troubled german carmaker opel by russian-backed canadian auto parts maker magna international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's sberbank , together with canada 's magna , is interested in troubled car maker opel merkel appeared to back the magna-sberbank bid .
she said it presents " excellent starting points " but added that her government still needs to " clear up " questions .
berlin agreed in late may to support a bid for a majority stake in opel by magna , which has teamed up with state-owned russian bank sberbank and russia 's second-largest auto maker gaz . an estimated 26,000 german jobs are at stake .
medvedev said his government supported the magna-sberbank bid for opel .
" we are interested and optimistic about this project and will do everything to realize it , " he said .
but general motors has also received interest from brussels-based investment group rhj international and from china 's beijing automotive industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- for opel , throwing the deal into some doubt .
trade issues dominate the two governments also signed a slew of economic partnership deals , including a 500-million-euro -lrb- $ 357 million -rrb- credit agreement .
the agreements included a joint declaration on energy cooperation and an agreement between russian railways and siemens to establish a joint venture to produce locomotives .
in addition , frankfurt airport operator fraport is to participate in the expansion of the airport in st petersburg .
the two leaders did not comment on news reports that russian oil giant gazprom is interested in a takeover of bankrupt german shipyards in the northern cities of wismar and rostock .
energy security on the agenda the two leaders also discussed energy security issues .
russia supplies a quarters of europe 's gas needs and germany is europe 's biggest customer for russian gas .
merkel signaled that she was keen to avoid another row with russia over gas supplies .
the german leader stressed the importance of the nord stream gas pipeline , an ambitious project to deliver siberian gas to europe under the baltic sea .
" we think this project is strategically important and necessary , " merkel said .
russia says the nord stream gas pipeline is part of its plan to increase gas volumes and step up the reliability of russian gas supplies to europe , now largely dependent on russia 's thorny political relations with ex-soviet ukraine. sp / dpa / reuters / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 16.07.2009 iceland 's parliament approves eu membership bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland could become an eu member within three years parliamentarians in iceland have paved the way for accession talks with the european union .
iceland 's government plans to launch its eu membership bid in brussels before the end of this month . the icelandic parliament , the althingi , gave the green light for the government to bid for membership in the european union , with 33 of the nation 's 63 parliamentarians voting in favor of the proposal . a total of 32 votes were required to pass the proposal , but opposition to the move was limited to 28 lawmakers , while another two abstained .
thursday 's narrow victory came as a relief to crisis-stricken prime minister johanna sigurdardottir , who hopes to stabilize iceland 's economy by joining the 27-member bloc .
in the end , however , it will be the citizens of iceland who will have the final word on whether the government pursues membership .
if and when iceland completes successful accession negotiations with the european union , the question will then be put to the people in a referendum .
divisions within the government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister sigurdardottir says only eu membership can save iceland 's economy the governing coalition itself remained divided over the benefits of eu membership for iceland – a country which is dramatically affected by the economic crisis .
while sigurdardottir 's social democrats have always campaigned for joining the bloc , their left-green coalition partners are traditionally opposed to the idea .
five members of the left green party therefore rejected the proposition , including jon bjarnason , the minister of agriculture and fisheries . other left-green deputies including finance minister steingrimur sigfusson , however , displayed political pragmatism by voting for the eu membership application along government lines . " an overwhelming majority wants this eu issue to be dealt with , " sigfusson said .
pros and cons one of the main eu pull factors for the large majority of icelanders is the chance to drop the icelandic krona as a currency .
it shed nearly half its value in the wake of last year 's financial crash , while inflation rose to over 12 percent .
as a small island state with just 320.000 citizens , iceland relies heavily on imports .
the strongest opposition to iceland 's eu membership comes from the fishing and agricultural industries .
they are opposed to handing over the control over iceland 's lucrative fishing grounds to brussels .
" we would no longer be the lawmakers on how we run our fishing industry .
this is the key element for us .
and we just do n't see any need for an application when you know what the outcome is going to be , " said sigurdur sverrisson from the federation of icelandic fishing vessel owners -lrb- liu -rrb- .
if and how iceland could keep the control over this vital part of the economy while having to join the – currently unsuccessful - common eu fisheries policy will be one of the most important and tricky questions during the accession talks .
popular support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurosceptic protests in reykjavik were low-key according to the most recent figures , around 70 percent of icelanders support the launch of eu accession talks .
" i would like to talk and find out what we can get and what we 'd have to give , " is an often-heard comment on reykjavik 's streets these days .
the nation remains divided over the prospect of full membership in the bloc , however , with many citizens complaining about a lack of information .
unlike norway , iceland has never applied to the eu because the majority of politicians were against it .
" what we have seen in the last few months is a shift in political leadership rather than a great shift in the public opinion , although the public opinion for membership of course strengthened due to the economic crisis , " concludes adalsteinn leifsson from reykjavik university .
hope for speedy progress iceland 's foreign minister össur skarpedinsson , a leading social democrat , has already outlined an ambitious agenda for the accession procedures .
iceland plans to launch its application in time for the next meeting of the eu foreign ministers on july 27 .
the fact that iceland is already a member of the european economic area -lrb- eea -rrb- and the border-free schengen zone means accession talks are likely to be relatively short .
around two thirds of all icelandic legislation is already in line with eu rules .
it is widely viewed as favorable for iceland that another nordic country , sweden , currently holds the eu presidency .
" we do n't hide the fact that we want our friends to support us , " said skarpedinsson .
the swedes support a speedy negotiation process with iceland , and eu officials mentioned 2011 or 2012 as possible accession dates .
a referendum will be held , meaning the icelandic citizens will have the last say in the matter .

" i 'm an architect and a utopist , " said luc schuiten .
the architect lives and works in brussels and believes that the city , like so many others , has no future if something does not change soon .
" you can not feel good in light of all the environmental pollution and the grim perspectives for the future , " said the 65-year-old visionary .

the entrance to the " vegetal city " installation is composed of an archway made of branches adorned with little yellow lights that blink to the sound of a heartbeat pulsing from speakers .

he would like to create green areas that span over walkways and platforms and up the sides of buildings .
" the idea is that the vegetation here can be used as herbal or plant sculptures that exude a sense of poetry , " he mused .
" they are a space to withdraw to , a peaceful place where we can discover what we are missing - nature . "
none of schuiten 's visions have yet been turned into reality , even though many of them could be realized if someone had the courage to do so , he said .
the architect has , however , been designing and building private energy-efficient homes made from environmental materials since the 1970s .
nature is his inspiration .
" nature is the only thing that is sustainable , and when we use living materials to build our homes , we are automatically developing things further by employing that same sustainability , " the architect said .
he calls it " archiborescence " - this connection between architecture and arborescence , or " tree structure . "
on the road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the man and his car-bike - advertising his show in brussels to advertise his visions to a larger public , the architect began driving an electric-powered three-wheeler around the city of brussels .
the two-seater vehicle with the exhibition logo on the side looks like a combination of recumbent bicycle and car , and is steered using two joysticks .
" no noise , no pollution , " the designer said as he eased the vehicle from the sidewalk into the street , catching the glances of curious pedestrians and car drivers along the way .
" when i travel more than 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- , i have to pedal , " he explains .
" but i love pedaling - it keeps me in shape .
i can also conserve energy as i travel , and can have fun all at the same time . "

a window stretching over two stories looks out into the lush garden .
schuiten sits down to work in his studio attached to the townhouse .

the move comes just 10 weeks before national elections in germany .
carstensen said lawmakers were expected to vote on the dissolution in the capital kiel on monday , and that he wanted to call an early election on sept .
27 to coincide with the federal election .
social democrats to resist dissolution however , the spd has pledged to vote against the proposal for dissolution of the parliament .
without a two-thirds majority vote , the proposal will not succeed . " the spd will stick to the coalition agreement .
there is no reason to dissolve the state assembly , " the spd 's state leader ralf stegener told german television .
" if the state premier does n't think he can carry on , he can resign . " premier carstensen however said he had tried hard to work with the spd and had informed his fellow christian democrat chancellor angela merkel of the dire situation in the state . " what i 've gone through in the last weeks brings one to the edge , " carstensen said . state coalition woes mirror those of federal government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's grand coalition between the conservatives and social democrats has been strained the two parties have ruled together in an awkward coalition since 2005 .
they have clashed over bonus payments to banking executives at the state-owned hsh nordbank and malfunctions at the kruemmel nuclear power plant . schleswig-holstein 's coalition woes mirrors bickering in the federal grand coalition and could signal an end to the cdu-spd partnership after the election . the deputy chairman of the cdu 's federal parliamentary group , wolfgang bosbach , said threat of a stalemate in schleswig-holstein highlights the fact that germany 's two major parties are uncomfortable bedfellows . " this is a signal for berlin , " bosbach told the online edition of newspaper handelsblatt .
" the call for a new election shows that a grand coalition is not a permanent solution . "
merkel is appealing to voters to use september 's federal election to dump the spd and allow the cdu to form a coalition government with the liberal free democrats. sp / dpa / ap / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

citing a profact agency study , afp reported that " seventy percent of belgians find that too much tax money goes to the royal family , and one-third want to get rid of the government allowance altogether . "
the debate over whether or not the government should restrict the number of royal family members receiving a government allowance first arose in the senate ten years ago . however , reforms failed to pass without a political majority , and the debate died down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law on royal financing would not affect king albert , queen paola , or their three children one reason the issue has come up again , according to christian laporte , royal watcher for la libre belgique , is that the royal family keeps expanding .
" the debate was always present , of course , in the society , and there is also another important fact for tomorrow , and that fact is that there are now not just three princes , but twelve or thirteen , " said laporte .
this same concern has been echoed across europe .
therefore , when public debate over royal financing was re-ignited in belgium ten months ago , lawmakers decided to call-in constitutional experts from other european monarchies to help reach a compromise . in the proposed law , all monarchs would be banned from receiving state cash and perks - except for the monarch , his or her spouse , and heir to the throne .
however , the changes would not go into effect until the end of king albert 's reign , which means all three of his children will still be entitled to government stipends for the rest of their lives .
two years ago , king albert 's youngest son , prince laurent caused a stir when he was alleged to have used taxpayers ' money to refurbish his villa .
however , royal watcher christian laporte says that the prince was never convicted of the allegations in court . " we could n't say that prince laurent has problems , because he has not been condemned .
he went alone to give testimony , and he went out of the court as free as when he came in - of course , " said laporte . flemish nationalists have been some of the most outspoken opponents of the monarchy - and as separatists - reject it as a symbol of belgian unity .
a couple of flemish politicians have sparked controversy with their remarks on the royal family .
on his first day on the job , flemish parliamentary speaker jan peumans announced that he refused to attend any royal receptions .
" it 's very simple , " peumans remarked .
" i promised my father i would n't do things like this .
if other people want to go – no problem – i would never accept a belgian medal either .
it 's my right . "
in addition to the 12 million euros per year in pay and benefits that the royal family reportedly receives , flemish nationalist lawmaker jan jambon has claimed that they get another 16 million euros in hidden costs from other government budgets .
a republican movement was also founded by french-speaking belgians , but it does not appear to have gained much momentum .
the draft bill to cap royal allowances by contrast has found broad bi-partisan support .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 16.07.2009 belgium seeks caps on public financing for royal family großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seventy percent of belgians believe that too much tax money goes to the royal family belgian lawmakers are drafting a bill to reduce the amount of public money being spent to support the royal family , which currently receives 12 million euros per year . while the royal family still finds broad support in the country , many people agree that their government allowance should be reduced .
citing a profact agency study , afp reported that " seventy percent of belgians find that too much tax money goes to the royal family , and one-third want to get rid of the government allowance altogether . "
the debate over whether or not the government should restrict the number of royal family members receiving a government allowance first arose in the senate ten years ago . however , reforms failed to pass without a political majority , and the debate died down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law on royal financing would not affect king albert , queen paola , or their three children one reason the issue has come up again , according to christian laporte , royal watcher for la libre belgique , is that the royal family keeps expanding .
" the debate was always present , of course , in the society , and there is also another important fact for tomorrow , and that fact is that there are now not just three princes , but twelve or thirteen , " said laporte .
this same concern has been echoed across europe .
therefore , when public debate over royal financing was re-ignited in belgium ten months ago , lawmakers decided to call-in constitutional experts from other european monarchies to help reach a compromise . in the proposed law , all monarchs would be banned from receiving state cash and perks - except for the monarch , his or her spouse , and heir to the throne .
however , the changes would not go into effect until the end of king albert 's reign , which means all three of his children will still be entitled to government stipends for the rest of their lives .
two years ago , king albert 's youngest son , prince laurent caused a stir when he was alleged to have used taxpayers ' money to refurbish his villa .
however , royal watcher christian laporte says that the prince was never convicted of the allegations in court . " we could n't say that prince laurent has problems , because he has not been condemned .
he went alone to give testimony , and he went out of the court as free as when he came in - of course , " said laporte . flemish nationalists have been some of the most outspoken opponents of the monarchy - and as separatists - reject it as a symbol of belgian unity .
a couple of flemish politicians have sparked controversy with their remarks on the royal family .
on his first day on the job , flemish parliamentary speaker jan peumans announced that he refused to attend any royal receptions .
" it 's very simple , " peumans remarked .
" i promised my father i would n't do things like this .
if other people want to go – no problem – i would never accept a belgian medal either .
it 's my right . "
in addition to the 12 million euros per year in pay and benefits that the royal family reportedly receives , flemish nationalist lawmaker jan jambon has claimed that they get another 16 million euros in hidden costs from other government budgets .
a republican movement was also founded by french-speaking belgians , but it does not appear to have gained much momentum .

certainly not the tourist magnet it is as home to the world 's third largest gothic church .
with all the visitors , though , comes a lot of dirt . cologne 's magnificent cathedral is eye candy for goth fans .
on a sunny day , its blackish spires contrast starkly against a bright blue sky .
the clouds on an overcast day , on the other hand , seem to swallow the steeples as they shoot up to the heavens . all that beauty costs time and money , however . while the some 100 million tourists who travel to the city on the rhine river - nearly 6.5 million of whom visit the cathedral - help fill the municipal coffers each year , millions of euros must be spent on the church 's maintenance . along with their money , visitors to the cathedral -lrb- known as the koelner dom in german -rrb- drag in substantial quantities of dirt , which does n't just cover the floor , but also the church 's countless statues , mosaics and other artworks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral is one of many churches in cologne no ordinary cleaning personnel would do for sweeping away all the dust . " my daily equipment consists of a vacuum cleaner , various paintbrushes , dusting towels , a headlamp , scalpel , sponges and fiberglass pens , " said bettina grimm , germany 's only female specialist in the field of plaster restoration .
" i also use mortar and pigments when more restorative work has to be done . " she was given the title putzrestauratorin by the cathedral 's master builder barbara schock-werner as a play on words : putz in german means " plaster " but the verb putzen means " to clean . " more than blowing off the dust restorative specialist grimm looks more like an archeologist than part of the cleaning crew as she sets about her task with both precision and a gentle touch .
holding a small paintbrush in one hand and the vacuum cleaner in the other , she carefully removes tiny particles of dust from valuable statues .
in this business , normal cleaning detergents are completely off-limits . grimm works together with some 60 stone masons , sculptors , carpenters , painters , electricians , locksmiths , glass restorers and gold and silversmiths to keep the cathedral shining .
it 's a tall order , considering the toll both the city pollution and thousands of visitors take on the 800-year-old dom each day . as the sole person responsible for " dusting " in the cathedral , grimm must cover over 6,000 square meters -lrb- around 64,500 square feet -rrb- of space . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restoration work on the cathedral is a balancing act " i have to dust off seven choir chapels and the choir stall and at the end of the week , on fridays , i have to do the wood carvings and the cushions so that everything is sparkling clean for mass on sunday , " grimm said . " i also have to clean the stations of the cross , " she added .
" actually , i 'm always trying to catch up because there are not enough hours in the day . " architectural and advertising icon the cathedral 's annual budget is between six and seven million euros -lrb- $ 8 to 9.4 million -rrb- , which mostly goes to the staff . all the money and maintenance efforts , however , pay off since the cologne cathedral is one of the most popular tourist destinations in germany .
cologne would not be cologne without the city 's landmark , said josef sommer , managing director of the cologne tourist office koelntourismus . " the cathedral is inherent to cologne , " he said .
" that 's been the case since the middle ages , since the time the architectural drafts were made for this outstanding cathedral .
cologne 's reputation and its attractiveness as a tourist destination are closely connected to the church . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dom is home to many nooks and crannies waiting to be dusted off the cologne cathedral was named a world heritage site by unesco in 1996 .
according to the united nations agency , the dom embodies the high gothic architectural style like no other cathedral in the world in its purity and perfection . construction of the church began in 1248 and was not completed until 1880 .
since its completion , its 150-meter-high -lrb- 492-foot -rrb- spires have become the city 's trademark - so much so that even companies use the spires as advertising icons . one could almost say that the city of cologne thrives financially from the cathedral . " about 5.5 billion euros are generated in the tourism industry in cologne , " said sommer .
" that means that without tourists , who also come to see the cathedral , 5.5 billion euros fewer would be spent in this city . " in other words , every cent spent to keep the cathedral sparkling is a cent spent to keep the city going . author : frank gazon -lrb- als -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu-members most affected are demanding that their eu partners share responsibility . during a meeting in stockholm on thursday , eu interior ministers addressed europe 's illegal immigration problem .
all agree that something needs to be done to alleviate the stress on mediterranean countries , but not all can agree how .
" two issues are the most important : one is the creation of a common european asylum system , which would mean that we would have increased solidarity between member states and more shared responsibility , " said sweden 's migration minister tobias billstrom , who led the informal meeting .
" the second thing is the question of legal migration : we need to open more ways for people to come to europe and work here , " billstrom added .
according to eu justice commissioner jacques barrot , all member states support efforts to strengthen the eu border-control agency frontex .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece has come under fire for deporting migrants in need of asylum .
pictured : prime minister costas karamanlis every year , thousands of people from africa , the middle east and central asia risk their lives crossing the mediterranean sea for a chance at a better life in europe . the united nations high commission for refugees estimates that in 2008 alone , more than 67,000 people tried to enter europe illegally via the mediterranean .
the influx has caused a major strain on the reception services of four eu-member states in particular - cyprus , greece , italy and malta - and they have repeatedly called for other european countries to shoulder some of the burden .
more solidarity needed eu leaders first called for greater cooperation with european countries most affected by illegal migration during a june meeting , but they also maintained that such efforts should be voluntary .
critics of that viewpoint , such as cypriot interior minister neoklis sylikiotis , say that relying on voluntary assistance is n't sustainable in the long term .
" it is time that we have more solidarity from the other member countries , " said sylikiotis .
" countries that are the first point of contact should not have to shoulder the entire problem . "
italy 's interior minister roberto maroni shared sylikiotis ' feelings , stating that " burden sharing " should be one of the top priorities for the eu 's new five-year plan on justice issues , also discussed in stockholm .
however , many countries outside of the mediterranean zone believe that instead of focusing on greater cooperation within the eu , the bloc should be working with migrants ' countries of origin to reduce the number of people wanting to leave in the first place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu interior ministers met in stockholm for a meeting on justice and home affairs eu members have often been critized for their handling of illegal migrants , who may not necessarily be escaping economic hardship , but who face political persecution or violence in their homeland .
the un , human rights groups , and the vatican have all publically denounced italy and greece for sending back migrants who were in need of asylum .
the german refugee organization " pro-asylum " has also criticized other eu members for not doing enough .

" the second thing is the question of legal migration : we need to open more ways for people to come to europe and work here , " billstrom added .

eu-members most affected are demanding that their eu partners share responsibility . during a meeting in stockholm on thursday , eu interior ministers addressed europe 's illegal immigration problem .
all agree that something needs to be done to alleviate the stress on mediterranean countries , but not all can agree how .
" two issues are the most important : one is the creation of a common european asylum system , which would mean that we would have increased solidarity between member states and more shared responsibility , " said sweden 's migration minister tobias billstrom , who led the informal meeting .
" the second thing is the question of legal migration : we need to open more ways for people to come to europe and work here , " billstrom added .
according to eu justice commissioner jacques barrot , all member states support efforts to strengthen the eu border-control agency frontex .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece has come under fire for deporting migrants in need of asylum .
pictured : prime minister costas karamanlis every year , thousands of people from africa , the middle east and central asia risk their lives crossing the mediterranean sea for a chance at a better life in europe . the united nations high commission for refugees estimates that in 2008 alone , more than 67,000 people tried to enter europe illegally via the mediterranean .
the influx has caused a major strain on the reception services of four eu-member states in particular - cyprus , greece , italy and malta - and they have repeatedly called for other european countries to shoulder some of the burden .
more solidarity needed eu leaders first called for greater cooperation with european countries most affected by illegal migration during a june meeting , but they also maintained that such efforts should be voluntary .
critics of that viewpoint , such as cypriot interior minister neoklis sylikiotis , say that relying on voluntary assistance is n't sustainable in the long term .
" it is time that we have more solidarity from the other member countries , " said sylikiotis .
" countries that are the first point of contact should not have to shoulder the entire problem . "
italy 's interior minister roberto maroni shared sylikiotis ' feelings , stating that " burden sharing " should be one of the top priorities for the eu 's new five-year plan on justice issues , also discussed in stockholm .
however , many countries outside of the mediterranean zone believe that instead of focusing on greater cooperation within the eu , the bloc should be working with migrants ' countries of origin to reduce the number of people wanting to leave in the first place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu interior ministers met in stockholm for a meeting on justice and home affairs eu members have often been critized for their handling of illegal migrants , who may not necessarily be escaping economic hardship , but who face political persecution or violence in their homeland .
the un , human rights groups , and the vatican have all publically denounced italy and greece for sending back migrants who were in need of asylum .
the german refugee organization " pro-asylum " has also criticized other eu members for not doing enough .
" countries like germany can no longer sit on their hands ... an unbureaucratic and speedy distribution of those seeking protection - like those stranded in greece - is a question of humanity and solidarity .

all agree that something needs to be done to alleviate the stress on mediterranean countries , but not all can agree how .
" two issues are the most important : one is the creation of a common european asylum system , which would mean that we would have increased solidarity between member states and more shared responsibility , " said sweden 's migration minister tobias billstrom , who led the informal meeting .
" the second thing is the question of legal migration : we need to open more ways for people to come to europe and work here , " billstrom added .
according to eu justice commissioner jacques barrot , all member states support efforts to strengthen the eu border-control agency frontex .

pictured : prime minister costas karamanlis every year , thousands of people from africa , the middle east and central asia risk their lives crossing the mediterranean sea for a chance at a better life in europe . the united nations high commission for refugees estimates that in 2008 alone , more than 67,000 people tried to enter europe illegally via the mediterranean .
the influx has caused a major strain on the reception services of four eu-member states in particular - cyprus , greece , italy and malta - and they have repeatedly called for other european countries to shoulder some of the burden .
more solidarity needed eu leaders first called for greater cooperation with european countries most affected by illegal migration during a june meeting , but they also maintained that such efforts should be voluntary .
critics of that viewpoint , such as cypriot interior minister neoklis sylikiotis , say that relying on voluntary assistance is n't sustainable in the long term .
" it is time that we have more solidarity from the other member countries , " said sylikiotis .
" countries that are the first point of contact should not have to shoulder the entire problem . "
italy 's interior minister roberto maroni shared sylikiotis ' feelings , stating that " burden sharing " should be one of the top priorities for the eu 's new five-year plan on justice issues , also discussed in stockholm .
however , many countries outside of the mediterranean zone believe that instead of focusing on greater cooperation within the eu , the bloc should be working with migrants ' countries of origin to reduce the number of people wanting to leave in the first place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu interior ministers met in stockholm for a meeting on justice and home affairs eu members have often been critized for their handling of illegal migrants , who may not necessarily be escaping economic hardship , but who face political persecution or violence in their homeland .

the german refugee organization " pro-asylum " has also criticized other eu members for not doing enough .

the two leaders also addressed the touchy topic of human rights . the two leaders met near the southern city of munich before being joined by key members of both governments , including the ministers for the interior , environment and economy . the killing of russian human rights activist natalya estemirova in chechnya on wednesday featured prominently in the meeting .
speaking at a news conference with russian president dmitry medvedev on thursday , german chancellor angela merkel described estemirova 's killing as an " unacceptable event . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estemirova 's killing has sparked international outrage merkel said that the murder had " played a role " in her talks with the russian president , who she said had assured her that " everything would be done to clear everything up . "
estemirova was the latest in a string of campaigners to be killed in russia .
thursday 's talks were part of the semi-annual top-level intergovernmental consultations between the two countries known as the " petersburg dialog . "
merkel signals support for magna-sberbank bid the two leaders also discussed foreign policy issues such as iran and north korea and the fight against terrorism , human trafficking and organized crime .
but the meeting was dominated by the two countries ' substantial and growing economic ties which have been hit by the global financial crisis . germany is russia 's single biggest trading partner with bilateral turnover amounting to around 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- last year .
but sergei prikhodko , the kremlin 's chief foreign policy aide , told reporters this week that trade between germany and russia more than halved in the first quarter of 2009 compared with the same period last year .
merkel said the strategic partnership between russia and germany is a " central element " in overcoming the economic crisis .
a pressing economic issue was the possible takeover of troubled german carmaker opel by russian-backed canadian auto parts maker magna international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's sberbank , together with canada 's magna , is interested in troubled car maker opel merkel appeared to back the magna-sberbank bid .
she said it presents " excellent starting points " but added that her government still needs to " clear up " questions .
berlin agreed in late may to support a bid for a majority stake in opel by magna , which has teamed up with state-owned russian bank sberbank and russia 's second-largest auto maker gaz . an estimated 26,000 german jobs are at stake .
medvedev said his government supported the magna-sberbank bid for opel .
" we are interested and optimistic about this project and will do everything to realize it , " he said .
but general motors has also received interest from brussels-based investment group rhj international and from china 's beijing automotive industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- for opel , throwing the deal into some doubt .
trade issues dominate the two governments also signed a slew of economic partnership deals , including a 500-million-euro -lrb- $ 357 million -rrb- credit agreement .
the agreements included a joint declaration on energy cooperation and an agreement between russian railways and siemens to establish a joint venture to produce locomotives .
in addition , frankfurt airport operator fraport is to participate in the expansion of the airport in st petersburg .
the two leaders did not comment on news reports that russian oil giant gazprom is interested in a takeover of bankrupt german shipyards in the northern cities of wismar and rostock .
energy security on the agenda the two leaders also discussed energy security issues .
russia supplies a quarters of europe 's gas needs and germany is europe 's biggest customer for russian gas .
merkel signaled that she was keen to avoid another row with russia over gas supplies .
the german leader stressed the importance of the nord stream gas pipeline , an ambitious project to deliver siberian gas to europe under the baltic sea .
" we think this project is strategically important and necessary , " merkel said .
russia says the nord stream gas pipeline is part of its plan to increase gas volumes and step up the reliability of russian gas supplies to europe , now largely dependent on russia 's thorny political relations with ex-soviet ukraine. sp / dpa / reuters / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the two leaders also addressed the touchy topic of human rights . the two leaders met near the southern city of munich before being joined by key members of both governments , including the ministers for the interior , environment and economy . the killing of russian human rights activist natalya estemirova in chechnya on wednesday featured prominently in the meeting .
speaking at a news conference with russian president dmitry medvedev on thursday , german chancellor angela merkel described estemirova 's killing as an " unacceptable event . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estemirova 's killing has sparked international outrage merkel said that the murder had " played a role " in her talks with the russian president , who she said had assured her that " everything would be done to clear everything up . "
estemirova was the latest in a string of campaigners to be killed in russia .
thursday 's talks were part of the semi-annual top-level intergovernmental consultations between the two countries known as the " petersburg dialog . "
merkel signals support for magna-sberbank bid the two leaders also discussed foreign policy issues such as iran and north korea and the fight against terrorism , human trafficking and organized crime .
but the meeting was dominated by the two countries ' substantial and growing economic ties which have been hit by the global financial crisis . germany is russia 's single biggest trading partner with bilateral turnover amounting to around 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- last year .
but sergei prikhodko , the kremlin 's chief foreign policy aide , told reporters this week that trade between germany and russia more than halved in the first quarter of 2009 compared with the same period last year .
merkel said the strategic partnership between russia and germany is a " central element " in overcoming the economic crisis .
a pressing economic issue was the possible takeover of troubled german carmaker opel by russian-backed canadian auto parts maker magna international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's sberbank , together with canada 's magna , is interested in troubled car maker opel merkel appeared to back the magna-sberbank bid .
she said it presents " excellent starting points " but added that her government still needs to " clear up " questions .
berlin agreed in late may to support a bid for a majority stake in opel by magna , which has teamed up with state-owned russian bank sberbank and russia 's second-largest auto maker gaz . an estimated 26,000 german jobs are at stake .
medvedev said his government supported the magna-sberbank bid for opel .
" we are interested and optimistic about this project and will do everything to realize it , " he said .
but general motors has also received interest from brussels-based investment group rhj international and from china 's beijing automotive industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- for opel , throwing the deal into some doubt .

iceland 's government plans to launch its eu membership bid in brussels before the end of this month . the icelandic parliament , the althingi , gave the green light for the government to bid for membership in the european union , with 33 of the nation 's 63 parliamentarians voting in favor of the proposal . a total of 32 votes were required to pass the proposal , but opposition to the move was limited to 28 lawmakers , while another two abstained .
thursday 's narrow victory came as a relief to crisis-stricken prime minister johanna sigurdardottir , who hopes to stabilize iceland 's economy by joining the 27-member bloc .
in the end , however , it will be the citizens of iceland who will have the final word on whether the government pursues membership .
if and when iceland completes successful accession negotiations with the european union , the question will then be put to the people in a referendum .
divisions within the government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister sigurdardottir says only eu membership can save iceland 's economy the governing coalition itself remained divided over the benefits of eu membership for iceland – a country which is dramatically affected by the economic crisis .
while sigurdardottir 's social democrats have always campaigned for joining the bloc , their left-green coalition partners are traditionally opposed to the idea .
five members of the left green party therefore rejected the proposition , including jon bjarnason , the minister of agriculture and fisheries . other left-green deputies including finance minister steingrimur sigfusson , however , displayed political pragmatism by voting for the eu membership application along government lines . " an overwhelming majority wants this eu issue to be dealt with , " sigfusson said .
pros and cons one of the main eu pull factors for the large majority of icelanders is the chance to drop the icelandic krona as a currency .
it shed nearly half its value in the wake of last year 's financial crash , while inflation rose to over 12 percent .
as a small island state with just 320.000 citizens , iceland relies heavily on imports .
the strongest opposition to iceland 's eu membership comes from the fishing and agricultural industries .
they are opposed to handing over the control over iceland 's lucrative fishing grounds to brussels .
" we would no longer be the lawmakers on how we run our fishing industry .
this is the key element for us .
and we just do n't see any need for an application when you know what the outcome is going to be , " said sigurdur sverrisson from the federation of icelandic fishing vessel owners -lrb- liu -rrb- .
if and how iceland could keep the control over this vital part of the economy while having to join the – currently unsuccessful - common eu fisheries policy will be one of the most important and tricky questions during the accession talks .
popular support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurosceptic protests in reykjavik were low-key according to the most recent figures , around 70 percent of icelanders support the launch of eu accession talks .
" i would like to talk and find out what we can get and what we 'd have to give , " is an often-heard comment on reykjavik 's streets these days .
the nation remains divided over the prospect of full membership in the bloc , however , with many citizens complaining about a lack of information .
unlike norway , iceland has never applied to the eu because the majority of politicians were against it .
" what we have seen in the last few months is a shift in political leadership rather than a great shift in the public opinion , although the public opinion for membership of course strengthened due to the economic crisis , " concludes adalsteinn leifsson from reykjavik university .
hope for speedy progress iceland 's foreign minister össur skarpedinsson , a leading social democrat , has already outlined an ambitious agenda for the accession procedures .
iceland plans to launch its application in time for the next meeting of the eu foreign ministers on july 27 .
the fact that iceland is already a member of the european economic area -lrb- eea -rrb- and the border-free schengen zone means accession talks are likely to be relatively short .
around two thirds of all icelandic legislation is already in line with eu rules .
it is widely viewed as favorable for iceland that another nordic country , sweden , currently holds the eu presidency .
" we do n't hide the fact that we want our friends to support us , " said skarpedinsson .
the swedes support a speedy negotiation process with iceland , and eu officials mentioned 2011 or 2012 as possible accession dates .
a referendum will be held , meaning the icelandic citizens will have the last say in the matter .

iceland 's government plans to launch its eu membership bid in brussels before the end of this month . the icelandic parliament , the althingi , gave the green light for the government to bid for membership in the european union , with 33 of the nation 's 63 parliamentarians voting in favor of the proposal . a total of 32 votes were required to pass the proposal , but opposition to the move was limited to 28 lawmakers , while another two abstained .
thursday 's narrow victory came as a relief to crisis-stricken prime minister johanna sigurdardottir , who hopes to stabilize iceland 's economy by joining the 27-member bloc .
in the end , however , it will be the citizens of iceland who will have the final word on whether the government pursues membership .
if and when iceland completes successful accession negotiations with the european union , the question will then be put to the people in a referendum .
divisions within the government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister sigurdardottir says only eu membership can save iceland 's economy the governing coalition itself remained divided over the benefits of eu membership for iceland – a country which is dramatically affected by the economic crisis .
while sigurdardottir 's social democrats have always campaigned for joining the bloc , their left-green coalition partners are traditionally opposed to the idea .
five members of the left green party therefore rejected the proposition , including jon bjarnason , the minister of agriculture and fisheries . other left-green deputies including finance minister steingrimur sigfusson , however , displayed political pragmatism by voting for the eu membership application along government lines . " an overwhelming majority wants this eu issue to be dealt with , " sigfusson said .
pros and cons one of the main eu pull factors for the large majority of icelanders is the chance to drop the icelandic krona as a currency .
it shed nearly half its value in the wake of last year 's financial crash , while inflation rose to over 12 percent .
as a small island state with just 320.000 citizens , iceland relies heavily on imports .
the strongest opposition to iceland 's eu membership comes from the fishing and agricultural industries .
they are opposed to handing over the control over iceland 's lucrative fishing grounds to brussels .
" we would no longer be the lawmakers on how we run our fishing industry .
this is the key element for us .
and we just do n't see any need for an application when you know what the outcome is going to be , " said sigurdur sverrisson from the federation of icelandic fishing vessel owners -lrb- liu -rrb- .
if and how iceland could keep the control over this vital part of the economy while having to join the – currently unsuccessful - common eu fisheries policy will be one of the most important and tricky questions during the accession talks .
popular support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurosceptic protests in reykjavik were low-key according to the most recent figures , around 70 percent of icelanders support the launch of eu accession talks .
" i would like to talk and find out what we can get and what we 'd have to give , " is an often-heard comment on reykjavik 's streets these days .
the nation remains divided over the prospect of full membership in the bloc , however , with many citizens complaining about a lack of information .
unlike norway , iceland has never applied to the eu because the majority of politicians were against it .
" what we have seen in the last few months is a shift in political leadership rather than a great shift in the public opinion , although the public opinion for membership of course strengthened due to the economic crisis , " concludes adalsteinn leifsson from reykjavik university .
hope for speedy progress iceland 's foreign minister össur skarpedinsson , a leading social democrat , has already outlined an ambitious agenda for the accession procedures .
iceland plans to launch its application in time for the next meeting of the eu foreign ministers on july 27 .
the fact that iceland is already a member of the european economic area -lrb- eea -rrb- and the border-free schengen zone means accession talks are likely to be relatively short .
around two thirds of all icelandic legislation is already in line with eu rules .
it is widely viewed as favorable for iceland that another nordic country , sweden , currently holds the eu presidency .
" we do n't hide the fact that we want our friends to support us , " said skarpedinsson .
the swedes support a speedy negotiation process with iceland , and eu officials mentioned 2011 or 2012 as possible accession dates .

" i 'm an architect and a utopist , " said luc schuiten .
the architect lives and works in brussels and believes that the city , like so many others , has no future if something does not change soon .
" you can not feel good in light of all the environmental pollution and the grim perspectives for the future , " said the 65-year-old visionary .
" so , i try to envision alternatives . "
for the first time ever , drafts and designs by the relatively unknown architect are on display in a large show in brussels .
the entrance to the " vegetal city " installation is composed of an archway made of branches adorned with little yellow lights that blink to the sound of a heartbeat pulsing from speakers .
beyond the entrance , visitors will find architectural models and drawings of balanced , colorful , almost fairy tale-like cities and people who have managed to live in harmony with nature .
round , flowing shapes that weave into one another are schuiten 's trademark .
leaves inspire design bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schuiten 's vertical gardens " the ' vertical gardens ' are a project that would help to heal the city 's wounds , " schuiten said , his eyes sparkling .
he would like to create green areas that span over walkways and platforms and up the sides of buildings .
" the idea is that the vegetation here can be used as herbal or plant sculptures that exude a sense of poetry , " he mused .
" they are a space to withdraw to , a peaceful place where we can discover what we are missing - nature . "
none of schuiten 's visions have yet been turned into reality , even though many of them could be realized if someone had the courage to do so , he said .
the architect has , however , been designing and building private energy-efficient homes made from environmental materials since the 1970s .
nature is his inspiration .
" nature is the only thing that is sustainable , and when we use living materials to build our homes , we are automatically developing things further by employing that same sustainability , " the architect said .
he calls it " archiborescence " - this connection between architecture and arborescence , or " tree structure . "
on the road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the man and his car-bike - advertising his show in brussels to advertise his visions to a larger public , the architect began driving an electric-powered three-wheeler around the city of brussels .
the two-seater vehicle with the exhibition logo on the side looks like a combination of recumbent bicycle and car , and is steered using two joysticks .
" no noise , no pollution , " the designer said as he eased the vehicle from the sidewalk into the street , catching the glances of curious pedestrians and car drivers along the way .
" when i travel more than 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- , i have to pedal , " he explains .
" but i love pedaling - it keeps me in shape .
i can also conserve energy as i travel , and can have fun all at the same time . "
left up to the architect , people in the future would only drive small , electric cars that access their power from tracks along the street .
trucks would have special power trailers attached to them . living his dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luc schuiten calls himself a utopist arriving at his home in brussels ' suburbs , schuiten parks his vehicle in the garage .
the elegant facade of the old townhouse masks a wood-dominated interior designed in schuiten 's flowing style .
a window stretching over two stories looks out into the lush garden .
schuiten sits down to work in his studio attached to the townhouse .
among all the carefully marked drawers and binders are his sketchbooks that stand at the ready beside hundreds of other books lined up on shelves .

" i 'm an architect and a utopist , " said luc schuiten .
the architect lives and works in brussels and believes that the city , like so many others , has no future if something does not change soon .
" you can not feel good in light of all the environmental pollution and the grim perspectives for the future , " said the 65-year-old visionary .
" so , i try to envision alternatives . "
for the first time ever , drafts and designs by the relatively unknown architect are on display in a large show in brussels .
the entrance to the " vegetal city " installation is composed of an archway made of branches adorned with little yellow lights that blink to the sound of a heartbeat pulsing from speakers .
beyond the entrance , visitors will find architectural models and drawings of balanced , colorful , almost fairy tale-like cities and people who have managed to live in harmony with nature .
round , flowing shapes that weave into one another are schuiten 's trademark .
leaves inspire design bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schuiten 's vertical gardens " the ' vertical gardens ' are a project that would help to heal the city 's wounds , " schuiten said , his eyes sparkling .
he would like to create green areas that span over walkways and platforms and up the sides of buildings .
" the idea is that the vegetation here can be used as herbal or plant sculptures that exude a sense of poetry , " he mused .
" they are a space to withdraw to , a peaceful place where we can discover what we are missing - nature . "
none of schuiten 's visions have yet been turned into reality , even though many of them could be realized if someone had the courage to do so , he said .
the architect has , however , been designing and building private energy-efficient homes made from environmental materials since the 1970s .
nature is his inspiration .
" nature is the only thing that is sustainable , and when we use living materials to build our homes , we are automatically developing things further by employing that same sustainability , " the architect said .
he calls it " archiborescence " - this connection between architecture and arborescence , or " tree structure . "
on the road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the man and his car-bike - advertising his show in brussels to advertise his visions to a larger public , the architect began driving an electric-powered three-wheeler around the city of brussels .
the two-seater vehicle with the exhibition logo on the side looks like a combination of recumbent bicycle and car , and is steered using two joysticks .
" no noise , no pollution , " the designer said as he eased the vehicle from the sidewalk into the street , catching the glances of curious pedestrians and car drivers along the way .
" when i travel more than 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- , i have to pedal , " he explains .
" but i love pedaling - it keeps me in shape .
i can also conserve energy as i travel , and can have fun all at the same time . "
left up to the architect , people in the future would only drive small , electric cars that access their power from tracks along the street .
trucks would have special power trailers attached to them . living his dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luc schuiten calls himself a utopist arriving at his home in brussels ' suburbs , schuiten parks his vehicle in the garage .
the elegant facade of the old townhouse masks a wood-dominated interior designed in schuiten 's flowing style .
a window stretching over two stories looks out into the lush garden .
schuiten sits down to work in his studio attached to the townhouse .
among all the carefully marked drawers and binders are his sketchbooks that stand at the ready beside hundreds of other books lined up on shelves .
ideas spring to mind quickly , he said .

iceland 's government plans to launch its eu membership bid in brussels before the end of this month . the icelandic parliament , the althingi , gave the green light for the government to bid for membership in the european union , with 33 of the nation 's 63 parliamentarians voting in favor of the proposal . a total of 32 votes were required to pass the proposal , but opposition to the move was limited to 28 lawmakers , while another two abstained .
thursday 's narrow victory came as a relief to crisis-stricken prime minister johanna sigurdardottir , who hopes to stabilize iceland 's economy by joining the 27-member bloc .
in the end , however , it will be the citizens of iceland who will have the final word on whether the government pursues membership .
if and when iceland completes successful accession negotiations with the european union , the question will then be put to the people in a referendum .
divisions within the government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister sigurdardottir says only eu membership can save iceland 's economy the governing coalition itself remained divided over the benefits of eu membership for iceland – a country which is dramatically affected by the economic crisis .
while sigurdardottir 's social democrats have always campaigned for joining the bloc , their left-green coalition partners are traditionally opposed to the idea .
five members of the left green party therefore rejected the proposition , including jon bjarnason , the minister of agriculture and fisheries . other left-green deputies including finance minister steingrimur sigfusson , however , displayed political pragmatism by voting for the eu membership application along government lines . " an overwhelming majority wants this eu issue to be dealt with , " sigfusson said .
pros and cons one of the main eu pull factors for the large majority of icelanders is the chance to drop the icelandic krona as a currency .
it shed nearly half its value in the wake of last year 's financial crash , while inflation rose to over 12 percent .
as a small island state with just 320.000 citizens , iceland relies heavily on imports .
the strongest opposition to iceland 's eu membership comes from the fishing and agricultural industries .
they are opposed to handing over the control over iceland 's lucrative fishing grounds to brussels .
" we would no longer be the lawmakers on how we run our fishing industry .
this is the key element for us .
and we just do n't see any need for an application when you know what the outcome is going to be , " said sigurdur sverrisson from the federation of icelandic fishing vessel owners -lrb- liu -rrb- .
if and how iceland could keep the control over this vital part of the economy while having to join the – currently unsuccessful - common eu fisheries policy will be one of the most important and tricky questions during the accession talks .
popular support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurosceptic protests in reykjavik were low-key according to the most recent figures , around 70 percent of icelanders support the launch of eu accession talks .
" i would like to talk and find out what we can get and what we 'd have to give , " is an often-heard comment on reykjavik 's streets these days .
the nation remains divided over the prospect of full membership in the bloc , however , with many citizens complaining about a lack of information .
unlike norway , iceland has never applied to the eu because the majority of politicians were against it .
" what we have seen in the last few months is a shift in political leadership rather than a great shift in the public opinion , although the public opinion for membership of course strengthened due to the economic crisis , " concludes adalsteinn leifsson from reykjavik university .
hope for speedy progress iceland 's foreign minister össur skarpedinsson , a leading social democrat , has already outlined an ambitious agenda for the accession procedures .
iceland plans to launch its application in time for the next meeting of the eu foreign ministers on july 27 .
the fact that iceland is already a member of the european economic area -lrb- eea -rrb- and the border-free schengen zone means accession talks are likely to be relatively short .
around two thirds of all icelandic legislation is already in line with eu rules .
it is widely viewed as favorable for iceland that another nordic country , sweden , currently holds the eu presidency .
" we do n't hide the fact that we want our friends to support us , " said skarpedinsson .
the swedes support a speedy negotiation process with iceland , and eu officials mentioned 2011 or 2012 as possible accession dates .
a referendum will be held , meaning the icelandic citizens will have the last say in the matter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 16.07.2009 belgium seeks caps on public financing for royal family großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seventy percent of belgians believe that too much tax money goes to the royal family belgian lawmakers are drafting a bill to reduce the amount of public money being spent to support the royal family , which currently receives 12 million euros per year . while the royal family still finds broad support in the country , many people agree that their government allowance should be reduced .
citing a profact agency study , afp reported that " seventy percent of belgians find that too much tax money goes to the royal family , and one-third want to get rid of the government allowance altogether . "
the debate over whether or not the government should restrict the number of royal family members receiving a government allowance first arose in the senate ten years ago . however , reforms failed to pass without a political majority , and the debate died down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law on royal financing would not affect king albert , queen paola , or their three children one reason the issue has come up again , according to christian laporte , royal watcher for la libre belgique , is that the royal family keeps expanding .
" the debate was always present , of course , in the society , and there is also another important fact for tomorrow , and that fact is that there are now not just three princes , but twelve or thirteen , " said laporte .
this same concern has been echoed across europe .
therefore , when public debate over royal financing was re-ignited in belgium ten months ago , lawmakers decided to call-in constitutional experts from other european monarchies to help reach a compromise . in the proposed law , all monarchs would be banned from receiving state cash and perks - except for the monarch , his or her spouse , and heir to the throne .
however , the changes would not go into effect until the end of king albert 's reign , which means all three of his children will still be entitled to government stipends for the rest of their lives .
two years ago , king albert 's youngest son , prince laurent caused a stir when he was alleged to have used taxpayers ' money to refurbish his villa .
however , royal watcher christian laporte says that the prince was never convicted of the allegations in court . " we could n't say that prince laurent has problems , because he has not been condemned .
he went alone to give testimony , and he went out of the court as free as when he came in - of course , " said laporte . flemish nationalists have been some of the most outspoken opponents of the monarchy - and as separatists - reject it as a symbol of belgian unity .
a couple of flemish politicians have sparked controversy with their remarks on the royal family .
on his first day on the job , flemish parliamentary speaker jan peumans announced that he refused to attend any royal receptions .
" it 's very simple , " peumans remarked .
" i promised my father i would n't do things like this .
if other people want to go – no problem – i would never accept a belgian medal either .
it 's my right . "
in addition to the 12 million euros per year in pay and benefits that the royal family reportedly receives , flemish nationalist lawmaker jan jambon has claimed that they get another 16 million euros in hidden costs from other government budgets .
a republican movement was also founded by french-speaking belgians , but it does not appear to have gained much momentum .
the draft bill to cap royal allowances by contrast has found broad bi-partisan support .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 16.07.2009 natural architecture : green visions for inner-city spaces großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the woven city by luc schuiten - many designs resemble trees buildings with grass growing on the rooftops , little brooks running through pedestrian zones , homes built from tree roots - it may sound utopian , but a belgian architect says it 's all possible . " i 'm an architect and a utopist , " said luc schuiten .
the architect lives and works in brussels and believes that the city , like so many others , has no future if something does not change soon .
" you can not feel good in light of all the environmental pollution and the grim perspectives for the future , " said the 65-year-old visionary .
" so , i try to envision alternatives . "
for the first time ever , drafts and designs by the relatively unknown architect are on display in a large show in brussels .
the entrance to the " vegetal city " installation is composed of an archway made of branches adorned with little yellow lights that blink to the sound of a heartbeat pulsing from speakers .
beyond the entrance , visitors will find architectural models and drawings of balanced , colorful , almost fairy tale-like cities and people who have managed to live in harmony with nature .
round , flowing shapes that weave into one another are schuiten 's trademark .
leaves inspire design bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schuiten 's vertical gardens " the ' vertical gardens ' are a project that would help to heal the city 's wounds , " schuiten said , his eyes sparkling .
he would like to create green areas that span over walkways and platforms and up the sides of buildings .
" the idea is that the vegetation here can be used as herbal or plant sculptures that exude a sense of poetry , " he mused .
" they are a space to withdraw to , a peaceful place where we can discover what we are missing - nature . "
none of schuiten 's visions have yet been turned into reality , even though many of them could be realized if someone had the courage to do so , he said .
the architect has , however , been designing and building private energy-efficient homes made from environmental materials since the 1970s .
nature is his inspiration .
" nature is the only thing that is sustainable , and when we use living materials to build our homes , we are automatically developing things further by employing that same sustainability , " the architect said .
he calls it " archiborescence " - this connection between architecture and arborescence , or " tree structure . "
on the road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the man and his car-bike - advertising his show in brussels to advertise his visions to a larger public , the architect began driving an electric-powered three-wheeler around the city of brussels .
the two-seater vehicle with the exhibition logo on the side looks like a combination of recumbent bicycle and car , and is steered using two joysticks .
" no noise , no pollution , " the designer said as he eased the vehicle from the sidewalk into the street , catching the glances of curious pedestrians and car drivers along the way .
" when i travel more than 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- , i have to pedal , " he explains .
" but i love pedaling - it keeps me in shape .
i can also conserve energy as i travel , and can have fun all at the same time . "
left up to the architect , people in the future would only drive small , electric cars that access their power from tracks along the street .
trucks would have special power trailers attached to them . living his dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luc schuiten calls himself a utopist arriving at his home in brussels ' suburbs , schuiten parks his vehicle in the garage .
the elegant facade of the old townhouse masks a wood-dominated interior designed in schuiten 's flowing style .
a window stretching over two stories looks out into the lush garden .
schuiten sits down to work in his studio attached to the townhouse .
among all the carefully marked drawers and binders are his sketchbooks that stand at the ready beside hundreds of other books lined up on shelves .
ideas spring to mind quickly , he said .
in a matter of seconds , one tiny sketch can lead to a vast vision for an entire city .

" i 'm an architect and a utopist , " said luc schuiten .
the architect lives and works in brussels and believes that the city , like so many others , has no future if something does not change soon .
" you can not feel good in light of all the environmental pollution and the grim perspectives for the future , " said the 65-year-old visionary .
" so , i try to envision alternatives . "
for the first time ever , drafts and designs by the relatively unknown architect are on display in a large show in brussels .
the entrance to the " vegetal city " installation is composed of an archway made of branches adorned with little yellow lights that blink to the sound of a heartbeat pulsing from speakers .
beyond the entrance , visitors will find architectural models and drawings of balanced , colorful , almost fairy tale-like cities and people who have managed to live in harmony with nature .
round , flowing shapes that weave into one another are schuiten 's trademark .

he would like to create green areas that span over walkways and platforms and up the sides of buildings .
" the idea is that the vegetation here can be used as herbal or plant sculptures that exude a sense of poetry , " he mused .
" they are a space to withdraw to , a peaceful place where we can discover what we are missing - nature . "
none of schuiten 's visions have yet been turned into reality , even though many of them could be realized if someone had the courage to do so , he said .
the architect has , however , been designing and building private energy-efficient homes made from environmental materials since the 1970s .
nature is his inspiration .
" nature is the only thing that is sustainable , and when we use living materials to build our homes , we are automatically developing things further by employing that same sustainability , " the architect said .
he calls it " archiborescence " - this connection between architecture and arborescence , or " tree structure . "
on the road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the man and his car-bike - advertising his show in brussels to advertise his visions to a larger public , the architect began driving an electric-powered three-wheeler around the city of brussels .
the two-seater vehicle with the exhibition logo on the side looks like a combination of recumbent bicycle and car , and is steered using two joysticks .
" no noise , no pollution , " the designer said as he eased the vehicle from the sidewalk into the street , catching the glances of curious pedestrians and car drivers along the way .
" when i travel more than 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- , i have to pedal , " he explains .
" but i love pedaling - it keeps me in shape .
i can also conserve energy as i travel , and can have fun all at the same time . "

estemirova 's murder " draws attention to the necessity of protecting human rights defenders in russia , " the council 's statement added .
the council 's statement follows a similar condemnation from the eu presidency , currently held by sweden , which took over the rotating six-month presidency of the 27-nation bloc on july 1 .

" we in the european parliament have appreciated her work in the fields of human rights , promoting democratic accountability and the implementation of the rule of law , " he said .

" she spoke the truth and openly , sometimes toughly described some processes that happen in this country , " medvedev added .
" that is the value of a rights activist - even if these things are not pleasant and uncomfortable for the authorities . "

the leaders of the greens bloc in the eu assembly also released a statement .
" we deplore the cowardly murder of the exceptional and dedicated human rights activist natalya estemirova , " the statement read .
the statement called " for a full and independent investigation into her abduction and murder .
the russian judiciary system must put an end to its dismal track record on such cases and for once act urgently and with due diligence . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 16.07.2009 iceland 's parliament approves eu membership bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland could become an eu member within three years parliamentarians in iceland have paved the way for accession talks with the european union .
iceland 's government plans to launch its eu membership bid in brussels before the end of this month . the icelandic parliament , the althingi , gave the green light for the government to bid for membership in the european union , with 33 of the nation 's 63 parliamentarians voting in favor of the proposal . a total of 32 votes were required to pass the proposal , but opposition to the move was limited to 28 lawmakers , while another two abstained .
thursday 's narrow victory came as a relief to crisis-stricken prime minister johanna sigurdardottir , who hopes to stabilize iceland 's economy by joining the 27-member bloc .
in the end , however , it will be the citizens of iceland who will have the final word on whether the government pursues membership .
if and when iceland completes successful accession negotiations with the european union , the question will then be put to the people in a referendum .
divisions within the government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister sigurdardottir says only eu membership can save iceland 's economy the governing coalition itself remained divided over the benefits of eu membership for iceland – a country which is dramatically affected by the economic crisis .
while sigurdardottir 's social democrats have always campaigned for joining the bloc , their left-green coalition partners are traditionally opposed to the idea .
five members of the left green party therefore rejected the proposition , including jon bjarnason , the minister of agriculture and fisheries . other left-green deputies including finance minister steingrimur sigfusson , however , displayed political pragmatism by voting for the eu membership application along government lines . " an overwhelming majority wants this eu issue to be dealt with , " sigfusson said .
pros and cons one of the main eu pull factors for the large majority of icelanders is the chance to drop the icelandic krona as a currency .
it shed nearly half its value in the wake of last year 's financial crash , while inflation rose to over 12 percent .
as a small island state with just 320.000 citizens , iceland relies heavily on imports .
the strongest opposition to iceland 's eu membership comes from the fishing and agricultural industries .
they are opposed to handing over the control over iceland 's lucrative fishing grounds to brussels .
" we would no longer be the lawmakers on how we run our fishing industry .
this is the key element for us .
and we just do n't see any need for an application when you know what the outcome is going to be , " said sigurdur sverrisson from the federation of icelandic fishing vessel owners -lrb- liu -rrb- .
if and how iceland could keep the control over this vital part of the economy while having to join the – currently unsuccessful - common eu fisheries policy will be one of the most important and tricky questions during the accession talks .
popular support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurosceptic protests in reykjavik were low-key according to the most recent figures , around 70 percent of icelanders support the launch of eu accession talks .
" i would like to talk and find out what we can get and what we 'd have to give , " is an often-heard comment on reykjavik 's streets these days .
the nation remains divided over the prospect of full membership in the bloc , however , with many citizens complaining about a lack of information .
unlike norway , iceland has never applied to the eu because the majority of politicians were against it .
" what we have seen in the last few months is a shift in political leadership rather than a great shift in the public opinion , although the public opinion for membership of course strengthened due to the economic crisis , " concludes adalsteinn leifsson from reykjavik university .
hope for speedy progress iceland 's foreign minister össur skarpedinsson , a leading social democrat , has already outlined an ambitious agenda for the accession procedures .
iceland plans to launch its application in time for the next meeting of the eu foreign ministers on july 27 .
the fact that iceland is already a member of the european economic area -lrb- eea -rrb- and the border-free schengen zone means accession talks are likely to be relatively short .
around two thirds of all icelandic legislation is already in line with eu rules .
it is widely viewed as favorable for iceland that another nordic country , sweden , currently holds the eu presidency .
" we do n't hide the fact that we want our friends to support us , " said skarpedinsson .
the swedes support a speedy negotiation process with iceland , and eu officials mentioned 2011 or 2012 as possible accession dates .
a referendum will be held , meaning the icelandic citizens will have the last say in the matter .

" we do n't hide the fact that we want our friends to support us , " said skarpedinsson .
the swedes support a speedy negotiation process with iceland , and eu officials mentioned 2011 or 2012 as possible accession dates .
a referendum will be held , meaning the icelandic citizens will have the last say in the matter .

"
estemirova 's murder " draws attention to the necessity of protecting human rights defenders in russia , " the council 's statement added .
the council 's statement follows a similar condemnation from the eu presidency , currently held by sweden , which took over the rotating six-month presidency of the 27-nation bloc on july 1 .
" we condemn that brutal act and call for the authorities to try to establish who is responsible and take the action that is called for , " said swedish foreign minister carl bildt .
" the presidency urges the russian authorities to swiftly and thoroughly investigate the murder of natalya estemirova and to bring the perpetrators to justice .
her murder draws attention to the necessity of protecting human rights defenders in russia . "
the newly elected president of the european parliament , jerzy buzek , also called on moscow to investigate the murder .
" we in the european parliament have appreciated her work in the fields of human rights , promoting democratic accountability and the implementation of the rule of law , " he said .
" we strongly call on the authorities of the russian federation to start a fully fledged inquiry into her death and do their utmost to bring those responsible for this tragic death to face justice . "

" the murder of our human rights activist is of course a very sad event , " medvedev said . " in contrast to earlier incidences , it is clear in this case : the murder was connected to her activity -lrb- as an activist -rrb- . "
" she spoke the truth and openly , sometimes toughly described some processes that happen in this country , " medvedev added .
" that is the value of a rights activist - even if these things are not pleasant and uncomfortable for the authorities . "
merkel told reporters gathered at munich 's schleissheim palace that the killing was " an unacceptable event . "
" i think that on the russian side , everything must be done to catch the killer , " she said .
steinmeier , eu greens add voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier made germany 's stance very clear german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also condemned the murder .
“ i am dismayed over the murder of natalia estemirova and strongly condemn this cowardly act , ” steinmeier said in a statement released by the foreign office .
" natalia estemirova was a courageous fighter for human rights in the north caucasus .
those behind the act must now be quickly captured and the planners exposed , " steinmeier added .
the leaders of the greens bloc in the eu assembly also released a statement .
" we deplore the cowardly murder of the exceptional and dedicated human rights activist natalya estemirova , " the statement read .
the statement called " for a full and independent investigation into her abduction and murder .
the russian judiciary system must put an end to its dismal track record on such cases and for once act urgently and with due diligence . "
estemirova , 50 , was abducted on wednesday morning by unknown persons after leaving her home in grozny , the capital of the republic of chechnya .
her body was found near the city of nazran in ingushetia , the region bordering on chechnya , itar-tass news agency said , citing the regional interior ministry .

iceland 's government plans to launch its eu membership bid in brussels before the end of this month . the icelandic parliament , the althingi , gave the green light for the government to bid for membership in the european union , with 33 of the nation 's 63 parliamentarians voting in favor of the proposal . a total of 32 votes were required to pass the proposal , but opposition to the move was limited to 28 lawmakers , while another two abstained .
thursday 's narrow victory came as a relief to crisis-stricken prime minister johanna sigurdardottir , who hopes to stabilize iceland 's economy by joining the 27-member bloc .
in the end , however , it will be the citizens of iceland who will have the final word on whether the government pursues membership .
if and when iceland completes successful accession negotiations with the european union , the question will then be put to the people in a referendum .
divisions within the government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister sigurdardottir says only eu membership can save iceland 's economy the governing coalition itself remained divided over the benefits of eu membership for iceland – a country which is dramatically affected by the economic crisis .
while sigurdardottir 's social democrats have always campaigned for joining the bloc , their left-green coalition partners are traditionally opposed to the idea .
five members of the left green party therefore rejected the proposition , including jon bjarnason , the minister of agriculture and fisheries . other left-green deputies including finance minister steingrimur sigfusson , however , displayed political pragmatism by voting for the eu membership application along government lines . " an overwhelming majority wants this eu issue to be dealt with , " sigfusson said .
pros and cons one of the main eu pull factors for the large majority of icelanders is the chance to drop the icelandic krona as a currency .
it shed nearly half its value in the wake of last year 's financial crash , while inflation rose to over 12 percent .
as a small island state with just 320.000 citizens , iceland relies heavily on imports .
the strongest opposition to iceland 's eu membership comes from the fishing and agricultural industries .
they are opposed to handing over the control over iceland 's lucrative fishing grounds to brussels .
" we would no longer be the lawmakers on how we run our fishing industry .
this is the key element for us .
and we just do n't see any need for an application when you know what the outcome is going to be , " said sigurdur sverrisson from the federation of icelandic fishing vessel owners -lrb- liu -rrb- .
if and how iceland could keep the control over this vital part of the economy while having to join the – currently unsuccessful - common eu fisheries policy will be one of the most important and tricky questions during the accession talks .

the nation remains divided over the prospect of full membership in the bloc , however , with many citizens complaining about a lack of information .
unlike norway , iceland has never applied to the eu because the majority of politicians were against it .
" what we have seen in the last few months is a shift in political leadership rather than a great shift in the public opinion , although the public opinion for membership of course strengthened due to the economic crisis , " concludes adalsteinn leifsson from reykjavik university .
hope for speedy progress iceland 's foreign minister össur skarpedinsson , a leading social democrat , has already outlined an ambitious agenda for the accession procedures .
iceland plans to launch its application in time for the next meeting of the eu foreign ministers on july 27 .
the fact that iceland is already a member of the european economic area -lrb- eea -rrb- and the border-free schengen zone means accession talks are likely to be relatively short .
around two thirds of all icelandic legislation is already in line with eu rules .
it is widely viewed as favorable for iceland that another nordic country , sweden , currently holds the eu presidency .
" we do n't hide the fact that we want our friends to support us , " said skarpedinsson .
the swedes support a speedy negotiation process with iceland , and eu officials mentioned 2011 or 2012 as possible accession dates .
a referendum will be held , meaning the icelandic citizens will have the last say in the matter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 16.07.2009 belgium seeks caps on public financing for royal family großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seventy percent of belgians believe that too much tax money goes to the royal family belgian lawmakers are drafting a bill to reduce the amount of public money being spent to support the royal family , which currently receives 12 million euros per year . while the royal family still finds broad support in the country , many people agree that their government allowance should be reduced .
citing a profact agency study , afp reported that " seventy percent of belgians find that too much tax money goes to the royal family , and one-third want to get rid of the government allowance altogether . "
the debate over whether or not the government should restrict the number of royal family members receiving a government allowance first arose in the senate ten years ago . however , reforms failed to pass without a political majority , and the debate died down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law on royal financing would not affect king albert , queen paola , or their three children one reason the issue has come up again , according to christian laporte , royal watcher for la libre belgique , is that the royal family keeps expanding .
" the debate was always present , of course , in the society , and there is also another important fact for tomorrow , and that fact is that there are now not just three princes , but twelve or thirteen , " said laporte .
this same concern has been echoed across europe .
therefore , when public debate over royal financing was re-ignited in belgium ten months ago , lawmakers decided to call-in constitutional experts from other european monarchies to help reach a compromise . in the proposed law , all monarchs would be banned from receiving state cash and perks - except for the monarch , his or her spouse , and heir to the throne .
however , the changes would not go into effect until the end of king albert 's reign , which means all three of his children will still be entitled to government stipends for the rest of their lives .
two years ago , king albert 's youngest son , prince laurent caused a stir when he was alleged to have used taxpayers ' money to refurbish his villa .
however , royal watcher christian laporte says that the prince was never convicted of the allegations in court . " we could n't say that prince laurent has problems , because he has not been condemned .
he went alone to give testimony , and he went out of the court as free as when he came in - of course , " said laporte . flemish nationalists have been some of the most outspoken opponents of the monarchy - and as separatists - reject it as a symbol of belgian unity .
a couple of flemish politicians have sparked controversy with their remarks on the royal family .
on his first day on the job , flemish parliamentary speaker jan peumans announced that he refused to attend any royal receptions .
" it 's very simple , " peumans remarked .
" i promised my father i would n't do things like this .
if other people want to go – no problem – i would never accept a belgian medal either .
it 's my right . "
in addition to the 12 million euros per year in pay and benefits that the royal family reportedly receives , flemish nationalist lawmaker jan jambon has claimed that they get another 16 million euros in hidden costs from other government budgets .
a republican movement was also founded by french-speaking belgians , but it does not appear to have gained much momentum .
the draft bill to cap royal allowances by contrast has found broad bi-partisan support .

the move comes just 10 weeks before national elections in germany .

social democrats to resist dissolution however , the spd has pledged to vote against the proposal for dissolution of the parliament .

there is no reason to dissolve the state assembly , " the spd 's state leader ralf stegener told german television .
" if the state premier does n't think he can carry on , he can resign . " premier carstensen however said he had tried hard to work with the spd and had informed his fellow christian democrat chancellor angela merkel of the dire situation in the state . " what i 've gone through in the last weeks brings one to the edge , " carstensen said . state coalition woes mirror those of federal government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's grand coalition between the conservatives and social democrats has been strained the two parties have ruled together in an awkward coalition since 2005 .
they have clashed over bonus payments to banking executives at the state-owned hsh nordbank and malfunctions at the kruemmel nuclear power plant . schleswig-holstein 's coalition woes mirrors bickering in the federal grand coalition and could signal an end to the cdu-spd partnership after the election . the deputy chairman of the cdu 's federal parliamentary group , wolfgang bosbach , said threat of a stalemate in schleswig-holstein highlights the fact that germany 's two major parties are uncomfortable bedfellows . " this is a signal for berlin , " bosbach told the online edition of newspaper handelsblatt .
" the call for a new election shows that a grand coalition is not a permanent solution . "
merkel is appealing to voters to use september 's federal election to dump the spd and allow the cdu to form a coalition government with the liberal free democrats. sp / dpa / ap / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

iceland 's government plans to launch its eu membership bid in brussels before the end of this month . the icelandic parliament , the althingi , gave the green light for the government to bid for membership in the european union , with 33 of the nation 's 63 parliamentarians voting in favor of the proposal . a total of 32 votes were required to pass the proposal , but opposition to the move was limited to 28 lawmakers , while another two abstained .
thursday 's narrow victory came as a relief to crisis-stricken prime minister johanna sigurdardottir , who hopes to stabilize iceland 's economy by joining the 27-member bloc .
in the end , however , it will be the citizens of iceland who will have the final word on whether the government pursues membership .
if and when iceland completes successful accession negotiations with the european union , the question will then be put to the people in a referendum .

certainly not the tourist magnet it is as home to the world 's third largest gothic church .
with all the visitors , though , comes a lot of dirt . cologne 's magnificent cathedral is eye candy for goth fans .
on a sunny day , its blackish spires contrast starkly against a bright blue sky .
the clouds on an overcast day , on the other hand , seem to swallow the steeples as they shoot up to the heavens . all that beauty costs time and money , however . while the some 100 million tourists who travel to the city on the rhine river - nearly 6.5 million of whom visit the cathedral - help fill the municipal coffers each year , millions of euros must be spent on the church 's maintenance . along with their money , visitors to the cathedral -lrb- known as the koelner dom in german -rrb- drag in substantial quantities of dirt , which does n't just cover the floor , but also the church 's countless statues , mosaics and other artworks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral is one of many churches in cologne no ordinary cleaning personnel would do for sweeping away all the dust . " my daily equipment consists of a vacuum cleaner , various paintbrushes , dusting towels , a headlamp , scalpel , sponges and fiberglass pens , " said bettina grimm , germany 's only female specialist in the field of plaster restoration .
" i also use mortar and pigments when more restorative work has to be done . " she was given the title putzrestauratorin by the cathedral 's master builder barbara schock-werner as a play on words : putz in german means " plaster " but the verb putzen means " to clean . " more than blowing off the dust restorative specialist grimm looks more like an archeologist than part of the cleaning crew as she sets about her task with both precision and a gentle touch .
holding a small paintbrush in one hand and the vacuum cleaner in the other , she carefully removes tiny particles of dust from valuable statues .
in this business , normal cleaning detergents are completely off-limits . grimm works together with some 60 stone masons , sculptors , carpenters , painters , electricians , locksmiths , glass restorers and gold and silversmiths to keep the cathedral shining .
it 's a tall order , considering the toll both the city pollution and thousands of visitors take on the 800-year-old dom each day . as the sole person responsible for " dusting " in the cathedral , grimm must cover over 6,000 square meters -lrb- around 64,500 square feet -rrb- of space . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restoration work on the cathedral is a balancing act " i have to dust off seven choir chapels and the choir stall and at the end of the week , on fridays , i have to do the wood carvings and the cushions so that everything is sparkling clean for mass on sunday , " grimm said . " i also have to clean the stations of the cross , " she added .
" actually , i 'm always trying to catch up because there are not enough hours in the day . " architectural and advertising icon the cathedral 's annual budget is between six and seven million euros -lrb- $ 8 to 9.4 million -rrb- , which mostly goes to the staff . all the money and maintenance efforts , however , pay off since the cologne cathedral is one of the most popular tourist destinations in germany .
cologne would not be cologne without the city 's landmark , said josef sommer , managing director of the cologne tourist office koelntourismus . " the cathedral is inherent to cologne , " he said .
" that 's been the case since the middle ages , since the time the architectural drafts were made for this outstanding cathedral .
cologne 's reputation and its attractiveness as a tourist destination are closely connected to the church . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dom is home to many nooks and crannies waiting to be dusted off the cologne cathedral was named a world heritage site by unesco in 1996 .
according to the united nations agency , the dom embodies the high gothic architectural style like no other cathedral in the world in its purity and perfection . construction of the church began in 1248 and was not completed until 1880 .
since its completion , its 150-meter-high -lrb- 492-foot -rrb- spires have become the city 's trademark - so much so that even companies use the spires as advertising icons . one could almost say that the city of cologne thrives financially from the cathedral . " about 5.5 billion euros are generated in the tourism industry in cologne , " said sommer .
" that means that without tourists , who also come to see the cathedral , 5.5 billion euros fewer would be spent in this city . " in other words , every cent spent to keep the cathedral sparkling is a cent spent to keep the city going . author : frank gazon -lrb- als -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move comes just 10 weeks before national elections in germany .
carstensen said lawmakers were expected to vote on the dissolution in the capital kiel on monday , and that he wanted to call an early election on sept .
27 to coincide with the federal election .
social democrats to resist dissolution however , the spd has pledged to vote against the proposal for dissolution of the parliament .
without a two-thirds majority vote , the proposal will not succeed . " the spd will stick to the coalition agreement .
there is no reason to dissolve the state assembly , " the spd 's state leader ralf stegener told german television .
" if the state premier does n't think he can carry on , he can resign . " premier carstensen however said he had tried hard to work with the spd and had informed his fellow christian democrat chancellor angela merkel of the dire situation in the state . " what i 've gone through in the last weeks brings one to the edge , " carstensen said . state coalition woes mirror those of federal government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's grand coalition between the conservatives and social democrats has been strained the two parties have ruled together in an awkward coalition since 2005 .
they have clashed over bonus payments to banking executives at the state-owned hsh nordbank and malfunctions at the kruemmel nuclear power plant . schleswig-holstein 's coalition woes mirrors bickering in the federal grand coalition and could signal an end to the cdu-spd partnership after the election . the deputy chairman of the cdu 's federal parliamentary group , wolfgang bosbach , said threat of a stalemate in schleswig-holstein highlights the fact that germany 's two major parties are uncomfortable bedfellows . " this is a signal for berlin , " bosbach told the online edition of newspaper handelsblatt .
" the call for a new election shows that a grand coalition is not a permanent solution . "
merkel is appealing to voters to use september 's federal election to dump the spd and allow the cdu to form a coalition government with the liberal free democrats. sp / dpa / ap / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the move comes just 10 weeks before national elections in germany .
carstensen said lawmakers were expected to vote on the dissolution in the capital kiel on monday , and that he wanted to call an early election on sept .
27 to coincide with the federal election .
social democrats to resist dissolution however , the spd has pledged to vote against the proposal for dissolution of the parliament .
without a two-thirds majority vote , the proposal will not succeed . " the spd will stick to the coalition agreement .
there is no reason to dissolve the state assembly , " the spd 's state leader ralf stegener told german television .
" if the state premier does n't think he can carry on , he can resign . " premier carstensen however said he had tried hard to work with the spd and had informed his fellow christian democrat chancellor angela merkel of the dire situation in the state . " what i 've gone through in the last weeks brings one to the edge , " carstensen said . state coalition woes mirror those of federal government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's grand coalition between the conservatives and social democrats has been strained the two parties have ruled together in an awkward coalition since 2005 .
they have clashed over bonus payments to banking executives at the state-owned hsh nordbank and malfunctions at the kruemmel nuclear power plant . schleswig-holstein 's coalition woes mirrors bickering in the federal grand coalition and could signal an end to the cdu-spd partnership after the election . the deputy chairman of the cdu 's federal parliamentary group , wolfgang bosbach , said threat of a stalemate in schleswig-holstein highlights the fact that germany 's two major parties are uncomfortable bedfellows . " this is a signal for berlin , " bosbach told the online edition of newspaper handelsblatt .
" the call for a new election shows that a grand coalition is not a permanent solution . "
merkel is appealing to voters to use september 's federal election to dump the spd and allow the cdu to form a coalition government with the liberal free democrats. sp / dpa / ap / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 16.07.2009 more & more african immigrants in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of african students and traders in china is increasing steadily more than 100 africans protested for hours outside a police station in china 's guangzhou city on wednesday after a nigerian man fell to his death trying to escape from a visa check .
according to chinese media reports , the nigerian businessman had overstayed his visa .
the case - the first of its kind - has highlighted the plight of the growing number of african immigrants in china . officially , some 20,000 africans live in china , mostly traders and students .
but unofficial estimates suggest that 20,000 might be living in the southern city of guangzhou alone .
most are from nigeria .
alexander demissie , an ethiopian who does research on african-chinese relations at bochum university in germany , explains : “ basically , they are middlemen .
they set the connection between the chinese manufacturers and the african traders .
most of the time , these nigerians living in guangzhou are highly-educated and speak very good chinese because they studied at the universities . ”
“ sun yatsen university in guangzhou is one of the famous universities where you can find a lot of african students .
it ’ s of course easier for them to have access to the chinese market because of the language .
this helps the african traders coming to china for two weeks or three weeks to buy goods . ”
as china has been very keen on promoting trade and political relations with african countries , visa regulations tend to be generous , says demissie : “ people can easily get a chinese visa , as soon as they can prove that they are traders or students . ”
he adds that this incident should not have happened and says such problems are unusual .
police is tougher with africans on the other hand , he says , the police does tend to be tough with african immigrants and “ africans do face harsher controls inside china than people from other countries . ”
he wenping , an africa specialist at the chinese academy of social sciences in beijing , says that many africans are better integrated in china than westerners .
“ the africans , both traders and students find it easier to overcome the language barrier than europeans and americans . ”
“ i ’ ve come across so many people who speak perfectly fluent chinese .
they find it easier to master the different tones we have in our chinese pronunciation .
they easily adapt to the local environment in the chinese cities , and chinese food is no problem for them . ”
africans not always accepted by chinese society but alexander demissie , who has also lived in china , says other issues can create difficulties : “ from my own experience , it ’ s not easy as an african to have a chinese girlfriend , for example .
of course , if you live in one country , you will take part in the social life , you might also get a chinese girlfriend and so on . ”
but he says people around might not consider this in a friendly light , adding that some people act rudely or badly towards africans in china .
demissie says there are also occasional street fights between groups of africans and of chinese , and that there is a general lack of knowledge about africa among ordinary people in china .
but with growing exposure through trade and political links , this seems likely to change in the foreseeable future .

at the beginning of the 1990s , the government introduced a new family planning policy .
it included concrete goals for reducing the birth-rate by using more modern methods of contraception .
hanoi also called on help from germany . the german organisation for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , the kfw , a german government-owned development bank and inwent , a german capacity-building non-profit organisation , have been supporting the vietnamese ministry of health since 1994 .
" the different institutes work practically hand-in-hand , ” explains günther riethmacher , gtz country director in hanoi .
“ the gtz does consulting and helps build up consulting points by training personnel .
the kfw invests in the infrastructure , and for example provides money to supply contraception . ”
“ the german development service has individual experts that offer advice at a provincial level and inwent gives courses about how health policy can become part of national strategy .
each institute brings its own expertise to such programmes . ”
significant results in 15 years the results are significant .
the average birth-rate has gone down to 1.9 children per family over the past 15 years .
“ advice on contraception , on condoms as well as the pill , is well accepted .
three out of four married women now admit they use contraception .
that ’ s similar to the figure in germany . “ promoting the use of condoms can kill two birds with one stone - this cheap and easy form of contraception helps reduce pregnancies and also prevent sexually-transmitted diseases , including hiv-aids .
general awareness campaigns about hiv-aids have been very successful : “ 90 percent of the population now admits they know the main ways of getting infected .
we measure our achievements according to these concrete things and then we can really say that something has happened and we have made a positive contribution . ”
family planning needs to be key priority the high abortion rate has also been halved .
this is another indication that the efforts to provide advice have paid off .
such successes can only happen if family planning is a key priority of the partner country .
riethmacher says this is certainly the case in vietnam : " what can be said over and over is that we have been well received and what is also important for the success of other projects is that the vietnamese government follows its own development policies and then seeks individual countries , such as germany , to help it promote its development work . ”
germany also offers advice on family planning policy in other asian countries , such as pakistan and the philippines .

germany also offers advice on family planning policy in other asian countries , such as pakistan and the philippines .

according to chinese media reports , the nigerian businessman had overstayed his visa .
the case - the first of its kind - has highlighted the plight of the growing number of african immigrants in china . officially , some 20,000 africans live in china , mostly traders and students .
but unofficial estimates suggest that 20,000 might be living in the southern city of guangzhou alone .
most are from nigeria .
alexander demissie , an ethiopian who does research on african-chinese relations at bochum university in germany , explains : “ basically , they are middlemen .
they set the connection between the chinese manufacturers and the african traders .
most of the time , these nigerians living in guangzhou are highly-educated and speak very good chinese because they studied at the universities . ”
“ sun yatsen university in guangzhou is one of the famous universities where you can find a lot of african students .
it ’ s of course easier for them to have access to the chinese market because of the language .
this helps the african traders coming to china for two weeks or three weeks to buy goods . ”
as china has been very keen on promoting trade and political relations with african countries , visa regulations tend to be generous , says demissie : “ people can easily get a chinese visa , as soon as they can prove that they are traders or students . ”
he adds that this incident should not have happened and says such problems are unusual .
police is tougher with africans on the other hand , he says , the police does tend to be tough with african immigrants and “ africans do face harsher controls inside china than people from other countries . ”
he wenping , an africa specialist at the chinese academy of social sciences in beijing , says that many africans are better integrated in china than westerners .
“ the africans , both traders and students find it easier to overcome the language barrier than europeans and americans . ”
“ i ’ ve come across so many people who speak perfectly fluent chinese .
they find it easier to master the different tones we have in our chinese pronunciation .
they easily adapt to the local environment in the chinese cities , and chinese food is no problem for them . ”
africans not always accepted by chinese society but alexander demissie , who has also lived in china , says other issues can create difficulties : “ from my own experience , it ’ s not easy as an african to have a chinese girlfriend , for example .
of course , if you live in one country , you will take part in the social life , you might also get a chinese girlfriend and so on . ”
but he says people around might not consider this in a friendly light , adding that some people act rudely or badly towards africans in china .
demissie says there are also occasional street fights between groups of africans and of chinese , and that there is a general lack of knowledge about africa among ordinary people in china .
but with growing exposure through trade and political links , this seems likely to change in the foreseeable future .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
berlin rejects ahmadinejad 's islamophobia accusations while this murder can never be excused , it is clear that ahmadinedjad is only looking for a target for his own aggression , that he 's trying to rally his own people -lrb- who by now would n't accept him as one of them since he is killing and torturing his own people -rrb- against a so-called threat from outside .
i , as a german , do n't feel proud about this happening in a german court , but we had a nazi regime some 60 years ago and we do n't want it back ! - thomas born , germany egyptian woman 's courtroom murder prompts merkel , mubarak meeting the german government 's response to the murder was not sufficient . it 's not just about that extremist axel w. , it 's about how the guards at the courtroom responded to the attack .
i mean how come a criminal gets the chance to stab a civilian 18 times and then attack another person -lrb- the husband -rrb- in a fully equipped courtroom ? it does n't make sense !
that mother did nothing , said nothing , harmed no one ... she just wore a headscarf . may her soul rest in peace and may justice prevail . - aya thabet , egypt why was n't the participant in a court hearing searched for weapons ?
how could he smuggle a knife into the proceedings ?
at the time of the murder , where were the authorities : the judge , policemen who supposedly must keep order during the hearing ?
and the policeman , supposedly in the courtroom to keep order , was not able to distinguish between the aggressor and the victim 's husband ?
all these unanswered questions make one wonder about the kind of justice being imparted in german courtrooms these days . - guillermo , thailand i believe the response of the german officials was very weak and very late .
i guess they intentionally tried not to highlight the subject because of the origin of the victim and the place where the crime took place .
but they were forced later to demonstrate their sorrow and shock regarding what happened after the strong and angry reaction of egyptians all over the world . - sameh shams , egypt how in the name of heaven was this woman stabbed in a court room ?
do n't the german courts have security systems like metal detectors while going into the building ?
i find that hard to believe that the court had no such system .
that woman would be alive today if they had a detection system , or else the security people were very lax . - john stuhr , us this was a very sad and painful crime , especially for the victims .
germany 's response i think is sufficient .
the perpetrator should face the maximum penalty allowed under german law .
however , i think that sometimes german law overall is not severe enough for such crimes .
islam -lrb- or any other group -rrb- should not be singled out for special treatment .
all crime , be it rape , murder , assault , etc . , are “ hate ” crimes .
what other reason is there to commit them ?
to distinguish one group above another would be prejudice ; it elevates the chosen group to a special status while demeaning the rest of society .
the best way to deal with this or any such severe crime is to have more stringent sentencing and longer jail times .
concerning egypt 's response , egypt has laws concerning the christians -lrb- e.g. copts -rrb- living there , yet harassment and persecution of those christians continues unabated while the egyptian government turns a blind eye to the harassment and persecution .
for egypt to say anything is hypocritical .
egypt needs to work on their own country and rectify their own problems with hatred and intolerance before condemning other countries . – d. papadakis , us i think people like " axel w. " are a disgrace to democracy in such a country like germany which is built upon democracy and justice . such people should bear the consequences of their deeds - which i think in that case should be death .
" axel w. " commited this murder with no respect for the court , the country in which he resides , the helpless woman , nor any human being at all .
islamophobia exists because the media spread falsehoods about islam , muslims and even arabs .
now i 'm really terrified by the fact that my life could be in danger in a country like germany which i like very much . - mahmoud , egypt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

certainly not the tourist magnet it is as home to the world 's third largest gothic church .
with all the visitors , though , comes a lot of dirt . cologne 's magnificent cathedral is eye candy for goth fans .
on a sunny day , its blackish spires contrast starkly against a bright blue sky .
the clouds on an overcast day , on the other hand , seem to swallow the steeples as they shoot up to the heavens . all that beauty costs time and money , however . while the some 100 million tourists who travel to the city on the rhine river - nearly 6.5 million of whom visit the cathedral - help fill the municipal coffers each year , millions of euros must be spent on the church 's maintenance . along with their money , visitors to the cathedral -lrb- known as the koelner dom in german -rrb- drag in substantial quantities of dirt , which does n't just cover the floor , but also the church 's countless statues , mosaics and other artworks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral is one of many churches in cologne no ordinary cleaning personnel would do for sweeping away all the dust . " my daily equipment consists of a vacuum cleaner , various paintbrushes , dusting towels , a headlamp , scalpel , sponges and fiberglass pens , " said bettina grimm , germany 's only female specialist in the field of plaster restoration .
" i also use mortar and pigments when more restorative work has to be done . " she was given the title putzrestauratorin by the cathedral 's master builder barbara schock-werner as a play on words : putz in german means " plaster " but the verb putzen means " to clean . " more than blowing off the dust restorative specialist grimm looks more like an archeologist than part of the cleaning crew as she sets about her task with both precision and a gentle touch .
holding a small paintbrush in one hand and the vacuum cleaner in the other , she carefully removes tiny particles of dust from valuable statues .
in this business , normal cleaning detergents are completely off-limits . grimm works together with some 60 stone masons , sculptors , carpenters , painters , electricians , locksmiths , glass restorers and gold and silversmiths to keep the cathedral shining .
it 's a tall order , considering the toll both the city pollution and thousands of visitors take on the 800-year-old dom each day . as the sole person responsible for " dusting " in the cathedral , grimm must cover over 6,000 square meters -lrb- around 64,500 square feet -rrb- of space . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restoration work on the cathedral is a balancing act " i have to dust off seven choir chapels and the choir stall and at the end of the week , on fridays , i have to do the wood carvings and the cushions so that everything is sparkling clean for mass on sunday , " grimm said . " i also have to clean the stations of the cross , " she added .
" actually , i 'm always trying to catch up because there are not enough hours in the day . " architectural and advertising icon the cathedral 's annual budget is between six and seven million euros -lrb- $ 8 to 9.4 million -rrb- , which mostly goes to the staff . all the money and maintenance efforts , however , pay off since the cologne cathedral is one of the most popular tourist destinations in germany .
cologne would not be cologne without the city 's landmark , said josef sommer , managing director of the cologne tourist office koelntourismus . " the cathedral is inherent to cologne , " he said .
" that 's been the case since the middle ages , since the time the architectural drafts were made for this outstanding cathedral .
cologne 's reputation and its attractiveness as a tourist destination are closely connected to the church . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dom is home to many nooks and crannies waiting to be dusted off the cologne cathedral was named a world heritage site by unesco in 1996 .
according to the united nations agency , the dom embodies the high gothic architectural style like no other cathedral in the world in its purity and perfection . construction of the church began in 1248 and was not completed until 1880 .
since its completion , its 150-meter-high -lrb- 492-foot -rrb- spires have become the city 's trademark - so much so that even companies use the spires as advertising icons . one could almost say that the city of cologne thrives financially from the cathedral . " about 5.5 billion euros are generated in the tourism industry in cologne , " said sommer .
" that means that without tourists , who also come to see the cathedral , 5.5 billion euros fewer would be spent in this city . " in other words , every cent spent to keep the cathedral sparkling is a cent spent to keep the city going . author : frank gazon -lrb- als -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the two leaders also addressed the touchy topic of human rights . the two leaders met near the southern city of munich before being joined by key members of both governments , including the ministers for the interior , environment and economy . the killing of russian human rights activist natalya estemirova in chechnya on wednesday featured prominently in the meeting .
speaking at a news conference with russian president dmitry medvedev on thursday , german chancellor angela merkel described estemirova 's killing as an " unacceptable event . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estemirova 's killing has sparked international outrage merkel said that the murder had " played a role " in her talks with the russian president , who she said had assured her that " everything would be done to clear everything up . "
estemirova was the latest in a string of campaigners to be killed in russia .
thursday 's talks were part of the semi-annual top-level intergovernmental consultations between the two countries known as the " petersburg dialog . "
merkel signals support for magna-sberbank bid the two leaders also discussed foreign policy issues such as iran and north korea and the fight against terrorism , human trafficking and organized crime .
but the meeting was dominated by the two countries ' substantial and growing economic ties which have been hit by the global financial crisis . germany is russia 's single biggest trading partner with bilateral turnover amounting to around 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- last year .
but sergei prikhodko , the kremlin 's chief foreign policy aide , told reporters this week that trade between germany and russia more than halved in the first quarter of 2009 compared with the same period last year .
merkel said the strategic partnership between russia and germany is a " central element " in overcoming the economic crisis .
a pressing economic issue was the possible takeover of troubled german carmaker opel by russian-backed canadian auto parts maker magna international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's sberbank , together with canada 's magna , is interested in troubled car maker opel merkel appeared to back the magna-sberbank bid .
she said it presents " excellent starting points " but added that her government still needs to " clear up " questions .
berlin agreed in late may to support a bid for a majority stake in opel by magna , which has teamed up with state-owned russian bank sberbank and russia 's second-largest auto maker gaz . an estimated 26,000 german jobs are at stake .
medvedev said his government supported the magna-sberbank bid for opel .
" we are interested and optimistic about this project and will do everything to realize it , " he said .
but general motors has also received interest from brussels-based investment group rhj international and from china 's beijing automotive industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- for opel , throwing the deal into some doubt .
trade issues dominate the two governments also signed a slew of economic partnership deals , including a 500-million-euro -lrb- $ 357 million -rrb- credit agreement .
the agreements included a joint declaration on energy cooperation and an agreement between russian railways and siemens to establish a joint venture to produce locomotives .
in addition , frankfurt airport operator fraport is to participate in the expansion of the airport in st petersburg .
the two leaders did not comment on news reports that russian oil giant gazprom is interested in a takeover of bankrupt german shipyards in the northern cities of wismar and rostock .
energy security on the agenda the two leaders also discussed energy security issues .
russia supplies a quarters of europe 's gas needs and germany is europe 's biggest customer for russian gas .
merkel signaled that she was keen to avoid another row with russia over gas supplies .
the german leader stressed the importance of the nord stream gas pipeline , an ambitious project to deliver siberian gas to europe under the baltic sea .
" we think this project is strategically important and necessary , " merkel said .
russia says the nord stream gas pipeline is part of its plan to increase gas volumes and step up the reliability of russian gas supplies to europe , now largely dependent on russia 's thorny political relations with ex-soviet ukraine. sp / dpa / reuters / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu-members most affected are demanding that their eu partners share responsibility . during a meeting in stockholm on thursday , eu interior ministers addressed europe 's illegal immigration problem .
all agree that something needs to be done to alleviate the stress on mediterranean countries , but not all can agree how .
" two issues are the most important : one is the creation of a common european asylum system , which would mean that we would have increased solidarity between member states and more shared responsibility , " said sweden 's migration minister tobias billstrom , who led the informal meeting .
" the second thing is the question of legal migration : we need to open more ways for people to come to europe and work here , " billstrom added .
according to eu justice commissioner jacques barrot , all member states support efforts to strengthen the eu border-control agency frontex .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece has come under fire for deporting migrants in need of asylum .
pictured : prime minister costas karamanlis every year , thousands of people from africa , the middle east and central asia risk their lives crossing the mediterranean sea for a chance at a better life in europe . the united nations high commission for refugees estimates that in 2008 alone , more than 67,000 people tried to enter europe illegally via the mediterranean .
the influx has caused a major strain on the reception services of four eu-member states in particular - cyprus , greece , italy and malta - and they have repeatedly called for other european countries to shoulder some of the burden .
more solidarity needed eu leaders first called for greater cooperation with european countries most affected by illegal migration during a june meeting , but they also maintained that such efforts should be voluntary .
critics of that viewpoint , such as cypriot interior minister neoklis sylikiotis , say that relying on voluntary assistance is n't sustainable in the long term .
" it is time that we have more solidarity from the other member countries , " said sylikiotis .
" countries that are the first point of contact should not have to shoulder the entire problem . "
italy 's interior minister roberto maroni shared sylikiotis ' feelings , stating that " burden sharing " should be one of the top priorities for the eu 's new five-year plan on justice issues , also discussed in stockholm .
however , many countries outside of the mediterranean zone believe that instead of focusing on greater cooperation within the eu , the bloc should be working with migrants ' countries of origin to reduce the number of people wanting to leave in the first place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu interior ministers met in stockholm for a meeting on justice and home affairs eu members have often been critized for their handling of illegal migrants , who may not necessarily be escaping economic hardship , but who face political persecution or violence in their homeland .
the un , human rights groups , and the vatican have all publically denounced italy and greece for sending back migrants who were in need of asylum .
the german refugee organization " pro-asylum " has also criticized other eu members for not doing enough .
" countries like germany can no longer sit on their hands ... an unbureaucratic and speedy distribution of those seeking protection - like those stranded in greece - is a question of humanity and solidarity .

techcrunch has made public some of the 310 bits of material it was sent .
it posted information about twitter 's financial projections and products .
" we are in touch with our legal counsel about what this theft means for twitter , the hacker and anyone who accepts ... or publishes these stolen documents , " said twitter 's biz stone .
in a blog posting he wrote that " about a month ago , an administrative employee here at twitter was targeted and her personal email account was hacked .
" from the personal account , we believe the hacker was able to gain information which allowed access to this employee 's google apps account which contained docs , calendars and other google apps twitter relies on for sharing notes , spreadsheets , ideas , financial details and more within the company . "
mr stone , twitter 's co-founder , went on to stress that " the attack had nothing to do with any vulnerability in google apps " . "
beyond the issue of journalistic ethics , the whole incident also raises interesting questions about the security of cloud computing " rory cellan-jones read rory 's blog in full he said this was more to do with " twitter being in enough of a spotlight that folks who work here can be a target " .
in his blog post , mr stone underlined the need for increased online security within the company and for staff to ensure their passwords are robust .
it is believed a french hacker who goes by the moniker " hacker croll " illegally accessed the files online by guessing staff members ' passwords .
" news value " a number of technology blogs were offered the documents for publication in what is now being dubbed " twittergate " in some online forums .
techcrunch , one of the most respected blogs in silicon valley , has set off a firestorm of criticism and debate over its decision to post some of the material .
it started things off with what it called a " softball " and published details about a reality tv show involving twitter .
details of such a programme were made public in may .
that was followed by documents relating to an internal twitter financial forecast that the company said is no longer accurate .
" there is clearly an ethical line here that we do n't want to cross , and the vast majority of these documents are n't going to be published , at least by us .
" but a few of the documents have so much news value that we think it 's appropriate to publish them , " wrote techcrunch editor and founder michael arrington mr arrington noted the site received a deluge of comments on the issue and said " many users say this is " stolen " information and therefore should n't be published .
we disagree .
" we publish confidential information almost every day on techcrunch .
this is stuff that is also " stolen , " usually leaked by an employee or someone else close to the company . "
the techcrunch founder cited examples of stories it has covered in the past that involved information it had acquired and also those covered by newspapers like the wall street journal that had done a similar thing .
mr arrington said that he has also consulted lawyers about the laws that cover trade secrets and the receipt of stolen goods .
" embarrassing " many in the technology industry said this latest episode points to the potent reminder of how much information is stored in the cloud and the vulnerability or otherwise of that data .
the hacker has claimed to have wanted to teach people to be more careful and in a message to the french blog korben , wrote that his attack could make internet users " conscious that no one is protected on the net . "
" the security breach exploited " an easy-to-guess password and recovery question , which is one of the simplest ways to make a username and password combination really insecure , " said phil wainewright of zdnet.com " unfortunately , users wo n't wise up until the cloud providers force them to . "
in a study last year the security firm sophos found that 40 % of internet users use the same password for every website they access .
the affair has put google on the defensive because the information was stored in google apps , an online package of productivity software that includes email , spreadsheets and calendars .
the company issued a blog post .
while it highlighted the need for strong security , it said it could not discuss individual uses or customers .
twitter 's mr stone tried to play down the importance of the information being touted around the web .
" obviously , these docs are not polished or ready for prime time and they 're certainly not revealing some big , secret plan for taking over the world .
" this is " akin to having your underwear drawer rifled : embarrassing , but no one 's really going to be surprised about what 's in there . "
that is an apt apology , " mr stone said .
at the social media blog mashable , adam ostrow agreed .
" it 's another embarrassing moment in twitter 's torrid growth , but nothing that 's likely to bring the house down . "

details of such a programme were made public in may .
that was followed by documents relating to an internal twitter financial forecast that the company said is no longer accurate .
" there is clearly an ethical line here that we do n't want to cross , and the vast majority of these documents are n't going to be published , at least by us .
" but a few of the documents have so much news value that we think it 's appropriate to publish them , " wrote techcrunch editor and founder michael arrington mr arrington noted the site received a deluge of comments on the issue and said " many users say this is " stolen " information and therefore should n't be published .
we disagree .
" we publish confidential information almost every day on techcrunch .
this is stuff that is also " stolen , " usually leaked by an employee or someone else close to the company . "
the techcrunch founder cited examples of stories it has covered in the past that involved information it had acquired and also those covered by newspapers like the wall street journal that had done a similar thing .
mr arrington said that he has also consulted lawyers about the laws that cover trade secrets and the receipt of stolen goods .
" embarrassing " many in the technology industry said this latest episode points to the potent reminder of how much information is stored in the cloud and the vulnerability or otherwise of that data .
the hacker has claimed to have wanted to teach people to be more careful and in a message to the french blog korben , wrote that his attack could make internet users " conscious that no one is protected on the net . "
twitter needs to force users to wise up , said one analyst " the security breach exploited " an easy-to-guess password and recovery question , which is one of the simplest ways to make a username and password combination really insecure , " said phil wainewright of zdnet.com " unfortunately , users wo n't wise up until the cloud providers force them to . "
in a study last year the security firm sophos found that 40 % of internet users use the same password for every website they access .
the affair has put google on the defensive because the information was stored in google apps , an online package of productivity software that includes email , spreadsheets and calendars .
the company issued a blog post .
while it highlighted the need for strong security , it said it could not discuss individual uses or customers .
twitter 's mr stone tried to play down the importance of the information being touted around the web .
" obviously , these docs are not polished or ready for prime time and they 're certainly not revealing some big , secret plan for taking over the world .
" this is " akin to having your underwear drawer rifled : embarrassing , but no one 's really going to be surprised about what 's in there . "
that is an apt apology , " mr stone said .
at the social media blog mashable , adam ostrow agreed .
" it 's another embarrassing moment in twitter 's torrid growth , but nothing that 's likely to bring the house down . "

the care quality commission warned a lack of training , poor monitoring and high workloads were commonplace after surveying all 392 trusts in england .
the regulator was asked by the government to look at the issue following the death of the toddler .
a host of agencies involved in his care have been criticised for failing to spot and stop the abuse he suffered .
the toddler - now named as peter - had been seen by health services 35 times by the time he died in 2007 aged 17 months after suffering more than 50 separate injuries .
where the nhs must improve training - just over half of the relevant health staff get the proper training .
figure drops to a third for gps monitoring - nhs boards criticised for not putting child protection higher on their agenda - a third did not get a single presentation from staff on the issue in 2008 workloads - key staff are being overworked with a fifth of trusts reporting they had health visitors with too many children on books processes - many hospitals failing to follow-up children who miss appointments this included appointments with gps , health visitors , paediatricians as well as being seen at walk-in centres .
the catalogue of abuse he suffered emerged during a court hearing at the end of last year that led to the conviction of his mother , her boyfriend and their lodger for causing his death .
the cqc has already looked at the role of the nhs organisations that came into contact with him , saying they missed valuable opportunities to save his life .
but the regulator was also asked to carry out an nhs-wide review of child protection .
the report found that some trusts failed to follow basic good practice principles - a third of hospitals had no follow-up process for children who miss appointments .
it also highlighted a worrying lack of oversight from boards with nearly a third not having at least one presentation from child protection staff during 2008 .
a fifth of trusts also reported having health visitors with case loads of more than 500 children - the recommendation is 400 at most .
training the nhs was also criticised on training .
just 54 % of staff who work with children have completed the correct training .
for gps , this drops to a third and even for doctors working in a & e departments the figure only stands at 58 % .
the regulator said all nhs trusts should now review the practices they have in place and warned they will be carrying out visits to those with the most problems .
cqc chief executive cynthia bower said : " immediately after the baby p tragedy , everyone agreed that everything possible must be done to prevent a recurrence .
" this must not prove to be hollow rhetoric . "
health secretary andy burnham agreed .
" i wish to make it clear that i see these basics as non-negotiable and that the nhs must ensure their full implementation . "

the care quality commission warned a lack of training , poor monitoring and high workloads were commonplace after surveying all 392 trusts in england .
the regulator was asked by the government to look at the issue following the death of the toddler .
a host of agencies involved in his care have been criticised for failing to spot and stop the abuse he suffered .
the toddler - now named as peter - had been seen by health services 35 times by the time he died in 2007 aged 17 months after suffering more than 50 separate injuries .
where the nhs must improve training - just over half of the relevant health staff get the proper training .
figure drops to a third for gps monitoring - nhs boards criticised for not putting child protection higher on their agenda - a third did not get a single presentation from staff on the issue in 2008 workloads - key staff are being overworked with a fifth of trusts reporting they had health visitors with too many children on books processes - many hospitals failing to follow-up children who miss appointments this included appointments with gps , health visitors , paediatricians as well as being seen at walk-in centres .
the catalogue of abuse he suffered emerged during a court hearing at the end of last year that led to the conviction of his mother , her boyfriend and their lodger for causing his death .
the cqc has already looked at the role of the nhs organisations that came into contact with him , saying they missed valuable opportunities to save his life .
but the regulator was also asked to carry out an nhs-wide review of child protection .
the report found that some trusts failed to follow basic good practice principles - a third of hospitals had no follow-up process for children who miss appointments .
it also highlighted a worrying lack of oversight from boards with nearly a third not having at least one presentation from child protection staff during 2008 .
a fifth of trusts also reported having health visitors with case loads of more than 500 children - the recommendation is 400 at most .
training the nhs was also criticised on training .
just 54 % of staff who work with children have completed the correct training .
for gps , this drops to a third and even for doctors working in a & e departments the figure only stands at 58 % .
the regulator said all nhs trusts should now review the practices they have in place and warned they will be carrying out visits to those with the most problems .
cqc chief executive cynthia bower said : " immediately after the baby p tragedy , everyone agreed that everything possible must be done to prevent a recurrence .
" this must not prove to be hollow rhetoric . "
health secretary andy burnham agreed .
" i wish to make it clear that i see these basics as non-negotiable and that the nhs must ensure their full implementation . "
peter carter , of the royal college of nursing , said nhs trusts should be shamed by the findings .
