organizers of the meeting , chaired by ban and the african union , had said more than $ 250 million was needed to improve security in a state which has had no central government since former president mohamed siad barre was ousted in 1991 , setting off a bloody cycle of clashes between rival factions .
eu officials said the aim was to build up a police force of some 10,000 officers and a security force of 5,000 .
support is also sought for the 4,300-strong african union mission amisom .
the amisom force - the only security presence backing the government - is well short of the 8,000 soldiers initially planned and is regularly attacked by the islamist shebab militia .
" restoring security and stability in somalia is vital to the success of the reconciliation effort and the survival of the unity government , " ban told the conference , held under the auspices of the united nations .
" much remains to be done . "
ban reiterated he had no intention of sending a un force to somalia any time soon , saying that the united nations should take a cautious and incremental approach to sending its own peacekeeping mission , and only " when the security conditions are appropriate . "
target likely to be exceeded after delegates underlined the challenges facing the war-torn country , organizers said donors had promised funding which was likely to exceed their initial expectations .
" we are on target , we are even a little bit higher because the target was $ 250 million , " said eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel .
" it seems that we are also above 250 million if you take into account material aid . "
" it 's really a full success , " he added to reporters after the four-hour conference in brussels .
the european commission , whose president jose manuel barroso also attended , had announced it would pledge at least 60 million euros on the eve of the meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamists have battled numerous governments president ahmed , who took office in january , made a personal plea for funds at the conference .
" solving this problem will require a radical solution , " said ahmed .
" the restoration of security and peace in somalia is the basis of any solution to the problems , " he said .
islamist fighters including the hard-line shebab militia have waged battles against the transitional government , its predecessor cabinet and their allies , vowing to fight until all foreign forces withdraw and sharia law is imposed .
more than one million people have fled their homes .
fewer than one in three somalis , whose life expectancy is 46 years , have access to clean water .
general instability and lawlessness while the conference was not focused on piracy , the high media profile of the growing number of cases of daring raids on freighters on the seas of the gulf of aden has become synonymous with somalia 's woes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international anti-piracy efforts face a tough mission " piracy is not a water-borne disease .
it is a symptom of anarchy and insecurity on the ground , " ban said .
" dealing with it requires an integrated strategy that addresses the fundamental issue of lawlessness in somalia . "
despite international naval missions - including from nato and the european union - piracy has mushroomed over the last year , as ransom-hunting somalis tackle ever-bigger and more distant prizes .
more than 130 merchant ships were attacked in the region last year , an increase of more than 200 percent on 2007 , the international maritime bureau said .
a tenfold increase was noted in the first three months of 2009 .
" if we only treat the symptoms , piracy at sea , but not its root causes - the decay of the state and poverty - we will fail , " barroso said .
non-governmental organization oxfam said the conference was being held at a critical moment for 3.2 million somalis desperately in need of aid , more than a million of whom have fled their homes to avoid fighting in the last two years .
" the piracy issue that has grabbed international headlines is a symptom of deeper issues that have gone unaddressed ever since the collapse of the national government in 1991 , " oxfam 's robert maletta said in a statement .
ahmed underlined : " it is our duty to pursue these criminals not only on the high seas but also on terra firma . "
piracy on the increase despite international force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's mission off the coast of somalia is in question piracy has worsened off somalia 's coast despite the presence of naval forces from more than a dozen countries , including task forces under nato , eu and us command .
nato 's four-ship mission was due to wind up its operation on thursday .
diplomats were discussing whether it could be extended and nato has said it wants tougher rules to allow the detention of captured suspects .
the united states , which is reviewing its somalia policy , plans to help build somali security forces and bolster the new government but has made clear it has no desire to " drive " the whole process . nda / mll , afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is our hope that any car scrappage legislation ultimately enacted will remedy these concerns , and that the eu will be able to support this important initiative to promote fuel-efficiency , reduce pollution , and provide a needed boost to the automobile industry , " john bruton , the eu 's ambassador to the united states , said in a letter sent to the us congress on wednesday .
president barack obama supports passage of a " cash-for-clunkers " bill to pay people to turn in their gas guzzlers and replace them with more fuel-efficient vehicles .
but bruton said europe is worried that a leading version of the legislation , " as currently drafted , provides benefits only for replacement vehicles assembled in the u.s. or north america , a distinction that would harm car manufacturers from other parts of the world , including europe . "
such a provision , he added , would be " a clear violation " of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- rules requiring a country 's laws to treat foreign and domestic products equally .

the provision has been a major sticking point in congressional efforts to merge competing proposals for the program , and sutton 's move brings those who are opposed to the north america requirement closer to a compromise with those who support it .
" it 's not so important to me that it has to be done " exactly according to her bill , but rather that a program is passed , sutton told reporters on capitol hill .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 23.04.2009 eu fears washington 's car trade-in plans unfairly favor us industry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trade-in programs are supposed to encourage a switch to greener models the us would violate world trade rules if proposed government payments to encourage consumers to trade in old gas-guzzling cars can be used to buy only new american-made vehicles , according to an eu official . " it is our hope that any car scrappage legislation ultimately enacted will remedy these concerns , and that the eu will be able to support this important initiative to promote fuel-efficiency , reduce pollution , and provide a needed boost to the automobile industry , " john bruton , the eu 's ambassador to the united states , said in a letter sent to the us congress on wednesday .
president barack obama supports passage of a " cash-for-clunkers " bill to pay people to turn in their gas guzzlers and replace them with more fuel-efficient vehicles .
but bruton said europe is worried that a leading version of the legislation , " as currently drafted , provides benefits only for replacement vehicles assembled in the u.s. or north america , a distinction that would harm car manufacturers from other parts of the world , including europe . "
such a provision , he added , would be " a clear violation " of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- rules requiring a country 's laws to treat foreign and domestic products equally .
possible compromise on north american provision europe 's fears and the concerns that the eu and us may bring their differences before the wto were partially allayed on thursday when got a boost after a leading proponent of the " cash-for-clunkers " bill , ohio congresswoman betty sutton , signaled she may drop a provision limiting the subsidies to purchases of north american made vehicles .
the provision has been a major sticking point in congressional efforts to merge competing proposals for the program , and sutton 's move brings those who are opposed to the north america requirement closer to a compromise with those who support it .
" it 's not so important to me that it has to be done " exactly according to her bill , but rather that a program is passed , sutton told reporters on capitol hill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany allows trade-ins for german and foreign cars germany , france , and slovakia - as well as china - have already enacted such trade-in programs but a central feature of the european programs is that they apply to all vehicles , whether assembled in europe or abroad .
the us may now follow suit as congressional aides redouble their efforts to find common ground on compromise legislation that could clear congress within months .
but even if a compromise is reached , lawmakers must find funding for the program .
some have suggested that the money would come from the economic stimulus package passed earlier this year .
proponents say the program - to provide new-car discounts of $ 1,500 to $ 7,500 -lrb- 1,150 euros – 5,700 euros -rrb- , depending on the proposal - is desperately needed to lift slumping car sales . nda / mll , reuters / wall street journal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 23.04.2009 turkey and armenia agree on reconciliation roadmap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish president abdullah gul , left , and armenian president serzh sargsyan met in 2008 turkey and armenia have reached an agreement on a comprehensive framework to normalize relations .
deutsche welle correspondent dorian jones reports that the process carries some risk for the turkish government . the turkish minister for eu affairs , egemen bagis , said thursday the process , which is taking place under swiss supervision , aimed to bring about a fundamental change in bilateral relations between the two countries .
" better relations , more neighborly relations , more trade , more opportunities and cooperation and peace - i see a light at the end of the tunnel , that peace is possible , " he said .
a senior western diplomat , who spoke on condition of anonymity , told reuters news agency that the deal had not yet been signed but that turkey and armenia had agreed on diplomatic ties , opening the border and establishing commissions to address historical disputes .
" all the documents have been agreed in principle but it 's from the signing that the clock starts ticking , " the diplomat said .
" it is a finite period that is not very long .
we are talking about weeks or months . "
old wounds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some armenian groups have long opposed reconciliation with turkey in armenia , several thousand protesters , mainly supporters of a nationalist junior partner in the government , burned turkish flags and condemned the efforts at normalizing relations .
at the heart of ongoing tensions between the countries are accusations by armenia that turkey was directly responsible for what it calls the genocide of 1.5 million armenians in 1915 during world war i , a charge strongly denied by ankara turkey officially admits that as many as 600,000 armenians died during the war and deportation from eastern anatolia , but it insists the deaths must be seen in the context of an armenian uprising at a time when armenians were siding with invading russian troops earlier this week , ankara recalled its ambassador from canada after the canadian prime minister supported the genocide charge .
eyes on obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama looks likely to ease pressure on turkey after the talks with armenia ankara now fears us president barack obama will do the same .
during his presidential campaign obama said he would recognize the genocide if elected .
but yasemin congar , deputy editor of the turkish daily taraf , said obama may now hold back as a result of the new rapprochement efforts .
" washington wants to see turkey open its border with armenia , " she said .
" they want to see ankara and yerevan normalize diplomatic relations and there is a movement to that end .
" i think obama wants to give the message to ankara that if this process goes on it might even stop him from saying the ' g ' word , the genocide word in washington . "
during his visit to turkey earlier this month obama avoided using the so-called " g " word .
instead he praised the turkish and armenian rapprochement efforts .
eve of remembrance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflict between armenia and azerbaijan over nagorno-karabahk displaced hundreds of thousands the timing of turkey 's announcement of its agreement with armenia is being seen as no coincidence .
it comes just one day before armenians around the world remember those killed in 1915 .
traditionally , us presidents deliver a speech to mark the event .
us-based armenian groups have been lobbying obama intensively to use his expected speech to recognize the genocide .
that is now seen as unlikely in light of the new rapprochement efforts .
obama is also aware that a reference to genocide would seriously damage us-turkey relations .
the turkish government is paying a heavy domestic political price for its rapprochement efforts , since turkey 's close relationship to armenia 's rival , azerbaijan , is seen to be at risk .
sixteen years ago , armenia occupied nearly 20 percent of azerbaijan following a war over the disputed enclave of nagorno-karabakh . turkey imposed a trade embargo against armenia in support of its ally .
" all turkish press , all political opposition , is using the azerbaijani issue against the government .
i think the government finds itself in a very difficult position , " said political scientist nuray mert .
such pressure is already having an effect , with the turkish prime minister now linking the ending of the embargo to the withdrawal of armenian forces from azerbaijan .
that is seen as unlikely anytime soon .
turkish news reports have said azerbaijan is disturbed by the reconciliation efforts , which could lead to the reopening of the turkish-armenian border .
but with ankara facing increasing pressure from both the us and the eu to end the embargo , the turkish government now finds itself between a rock and a hard place .

deutsche welle correspondent dorian jones reports that the process carries some risk for the turkish government . the turkish minister for eu affairs , egemen bagis , said thursday the process , which is taking place under swiss supervision , aimed to bring about a fundamental change in bilateral relations between the two countries .
" better relations , more neighborly relations , more trade , more opportunities and cooperation and peace - i see a light at the end of the tunnel , that peace is possible , " he said .
a senior western diplomat , who spoke on condition of anonymity , told reuters news agency that the deal had not yet been signed but that turkey and armenia had agreed on diplomatic ties , opening the border and establishing commissions to address historical disputes .
" all the documents have been agreed in principle but it 's from the signing that the clock starts ticking , " the diplomat said .
" it is a finite period that is not very long .
we are talking about weeks or months . "
old wounds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some armenian groups have long opposed reconciliation with turkey in armenia , several thousand protesters , mainly supporters of a nationalist junior partner in the government , burned turkish flags and condemned the efforts at normalizing relations .
at the heart of ongoing tensions between the countries are accusations by armenia that turkey was directly responsible for what it calls the genocide of 1.5 million armenians in 1915 during world war i , a charge strongly denied by ankara turkey officially admits that as many as 600,000 armenians died during the war and deportation from eastern anatolia , but it insists the deaths must be seen in the context of an armenian uprising at a time when armenians were siding with invading russian troops earlier this week , ankara recalled its ambassador from canada after the canadian prime minister supported the genocide charge .
eyes on obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama looks likely to ease pressure on turkey after the talks with armenia ankara now fears us president barack obama will do the same .
during his presidential campaign obama said he would recognize the genocide if elected .
but yasemin congar , deputy editor of the turkish daily taraf , said obama may now hold back as a result of the new rapprochement efforts .
" washington wants to see turkey open its border with armenia , " she said .
" they want to see ankara and yerevan normalize diplomatic relations and there is a movement to that end .
" i think obama wants to give the message to ankara that if this process goes on it might even stop him from saying the ' g ' word , the genocide word in washington . "
during his visit to turkey earlier this month obama avoided using the so-called " g " word .
instead he praised the turkish and armenian rapprochement efforts .
eve of remembrance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflict between armenia and azerbaijan over nagorno-karabahk displaced hundreds of thousands the timing of turkey 's announcement of its agreement with armenia is being seen as no coincidence .
it comes just one day before armenians around the world remember those killed in 1915 .
traditionally , us presidents deliver a speech to mark the event .
us-based armenian groups have been lobbying obama intensively to use his expected speech to recognize the genocide .
that is now seen as unlikely in light of the new rapprochement efforts .
obama is also aware that a reference to genocide would seriously damage us-turkey relations .
the turkish government is paying a heavy domestic political price for its rapprochement efforts , since turkey 's close relationship to armenia 's rival , azerbaijan , is seen to be at risk .
sixteen years ago , armenia occupied nearly 20 percent of azerbaijan following a war over the disputed enclave of nagorno-karabakh . turkey imposed a trade embargo against armenia in support of its ally .
" all turkish press , all political opposition , is using the azerbaijani issue against the government .
i think the government finds itself in a very difficult position , " said political scientist nuray mert .
such pressure is already having an effect , with the turkish prime minister now linking the ending of the embargo to the withdrawal of armenian forces from azerbaijan .
that is seen as unlikely anytime soon .
turkish news reports have said azerbaijan is disturbed by the reconciliation efforts , which could lead to the reopening of the turkish-armenian border .
but with ankara facing increasing pressure from both the us and the eu to end the embargo , the turkish government now finds itself between a rock and a hard place .

" we will not participate in the election of a president , or in parliamentary sessions that will discuss it , " said mihai gimpu , leader of the opposition liberal party of moldova -lrb- lpm -rrb- .
disputed national elections earlier this month gave the ruling communists 60 seats in moldova 's 101-seat legislature , prompting violent clashes in the capital , chisinau .
opposition demonstrators accused the communists of voter fraud and battled with police on april 7 , leaving one dead , hundreds injured , and the parliament building ransacked and partially burned .
according to the constitution , moldova 's next president must be voted into office by the new parliament , by a 61 member majority .
however , three opposition parties , including the lpm , control 41 seats in moldova 's legislature , according to a vote recount completed by the central election commission on wednesday - creating a potential deadlock .
opposition aiming to block presidential selection moldova 's supreme court on thursday afternoon set a limit on the time allowed for the legislature to select a president , ruling that parliament must choose a new chief executive by july 7 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin must stand down by law - but who will follow him ?
if it fails to agree on a president by that date , the parliament must be dissolved and new elections would have to be held , the court said , setting the rival factions on a possible collision course once again .
independent observers including monitors from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- ruled moldova 's april 5 elections were generally free and fair .
moldovan president vladimir voronin , head of the communist party , took the country 's top office in 2001 and has held it ever since .
but as he is prevented by constitutional statute from continuing in office , a new president must be chosen .
concerned eu discuss sending mission to moldova meanwhile , european union external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner has backed the idea of sending an eu mission to moldova .
" personally i 'm in favor of such a mission , that 's absolutely clear .
now we have to work out the terms of reference of such a mission , " she told a press conference in brussels .
the idea of an investigative mission , including representatives from the european commission and the moldovan opposition was first mooted wednesday by czech president mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
topolanek made the suggestion during a visit to moldova where he met communist president vladimir voronin and opposition figures , saying it would help shed light on recent events and help restore calm .
the mission proposal will be put to a meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg on monday . nda / mll , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 23.04.2009 turkey and armenia agree on reconciliation roadmap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish president abdullah gul , left , and armenian president serzh sargsyan met in 2008 turkey and armenia have reached an agreement on a comprehensive framework to normalize relations .
deutsche welle correspondent dorian jones reports that the process carries some risk for the turkish government . the turkish minister for eu affairs , egemen bagis , said thursday the process , which is taking place under swiss supervision , aimed to bring about a fundamental change in bilateral relations between the two countries .
" better relations , more neighborly relations , more trade , more opportunities and cooperation and peace - i see a light at the end of the tunnel , that peace is possible , " he said .
a senior western diplomat , who spoke on condition of anonymity , told reuters news agency that the deal had not yet been signed but that turkey and armenia had agreed on diplomatic ties , opening the border and establishing commissions to address historical disputes .
" all the documents have been agreed in principle but it 's from the signing that the clock starts ticking , " the diplomat said .
" it is a finite period that is not very long .
we are talking about weeks or months . "
old wounds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some armenian groups have long opposed reconciliation with turkey in armenia , several thousand protesters , mainly supporters of a nationalist junior partner in the government , burned turkish flags and condemned the efforts at normalizing relations .
at the heart of ongoing tensions between the countries are accusations by armenia that turkey was directly responsible for what it calls the genocide of 1.5 million armenians in 1915 during world war i , a charge strongly denied by ankara turkey officially admits that as many as 600,000 armenians died during the war and deportation from eastern anatolia , but it insists the deaths must be seen in the context of an armenian uprising at a time when armenians were siding with invading russian troops earlier this week , ankara recalled its ambassador from canada after the canadian prime minister supported the genocide charge .
eyes on obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama looks likely to ease pressure on turkey after the talks with armenia ankara now fears us president barack obama will do the same .
during his presidential campaign obama said he would recognize the genocide if elected .
but yasemin congar , deputy editor of the turkish daily taraf , said obama may now hold back as a result of the new rapprochement efforts .
" washington wants to see turkey open its border with armenia , " she said .
" they want to see ankara and yerevan normalize diplomatic relations and there is a movement to that end .
" i think obama wants to give the message to ankara that if this process goes on it might even stop him from saying the ' g ' word , the genocide word in washington . "
during his visit to turkey earlier this month obama avoided using the so-called " g " word .
instead he praised the turkish and armenian rapprochement efforts .
eve of remembrance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflict between armenia and azerbaijan over nagorno-karabahk displaced hundreds of thousands the timing of turkey 's announcement of its agreement with armenia is being seen as no coincidence .
it comes just one day before armenians around the world remember those killed in 1915 .
traditionally , us presidents deliver a speech to mark the event .
us-based armenian groups have been lobbying obama intensively to use his expected speech to recognize the genocide .
that is now seen as unlikely in light of the new rapprochement efforts .
obama is also aware that a reference to genocide would seriously damage us-turkey relations .
the turkish government is paying a heavy domestic political price for its rapprochement efforts , since turkey 's close relationship to armenia 's rival , azerbaijan , is seen to be at risk .
sixteen years ago , armenia occupied nearly 20 percent of azerbaijan following a war over the disputed enclave of nagorno-karabakh . turkey imposed a trade embargo against armenia in support of its ally .
" all turkish press , all political opposition , is using the azerbaijani issue against the government .
i think the government finds itself in a very difficult position , " said political scientist nuray mert .
such pressure is already having an effect , with the turkish prime minister now linking the ending of the embargo to the withdrawal of armenian forces from azerbaijan .
that is seen as unlikely anytime soon .
turkish news reports have said azerbaijan is disturbed by the reconciliation efforts , which could lead to the reopening of the turkish-armenian border .
but with ankara facing increasing pressure from both the us and the eu to end the embargo , the turkish government now finds itself between a rock and a hard place .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 23.04.2009 donors pledge $ 213 million for security in somalia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalia has been locked in a cycle of chaos and violence for nearly two decades international donors have pledged 213 million dollars -lrb- 163 million euros -rrb- to help bolster security in somalia , a key to helping end attacks by pirates off the country 's coast . donors made the pledges at a conference in brussels thursday at which united nations secretary general ban ki-moon and somalia 's president , sheikh sharif ahmed , appealed for funds to help end two decades of lawlessness in the east african country .
organizers of the meeting , chaired by ban and the african union , had said more than $ 250 million was needed to improve security in a state which has had no central government since former president mohamed siad barre was ousted in 1991 , setting off a bloody cycle of clashes between rival factions .
eu officials said the aim was to build up a police force of some 10,000 officers and a security force of 5,000 .
support is also sought for the 4,300-strong african union mission amisom .
the amisom force - the only security presence backing the government - is well short of the 8,000 soldiers initially planned and is regularly attacked by the islamist shebab militia .
" restoring security and stability in somalia is vital to the success of the reconciliation effort and the survival of the unity government , " ban told the conference , held under the auspices of the united nations .
" much remains to be done . "
ban reiterated he had no intention of sending a un force to somalia any time soon , saying that the united nations should take a cautious and incremental approach to sending its own peacekeeping mission , and only " when the security conditions are appropriate . "
target likely to be exceeded after delegates underlined the challenges facing the war-torn country , organizers said donors had promised funding which was likely to exceed their initial expectations .
" we are on target , we are even a little bit higher because the target was $ 250 million , " said eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel .
" it seems that we are also above 250 million if you take into account material aid . "

organizers of the meeting , chaired by ban and the african union , had said more than $ 250 million was needed to improve security in a state which has had no central government since former president mohamed siad barre was ousted in 1991 , setting off a bloody cycle of clashes between rival factions .
eu officials said the aim was to build up a police force of some 10,000 officers and a security force of 5,000 .
support is also sought for the 4,300-strong african union mission amisom .
the amisom force - the only security presence backing the government - is well short of the 8,000 soldiers initially planned and is regularly attacked by the islamist shebab militia .
" restoring security and stability in somalia is vital to the success of the reconciliation effort and the survival of the unity government , " ban told the conference , held under the auspices of the united nations .
" much remains to be done . "
ban reiterated he had no intention of sending a un force to somalia any time soon , saying that the united nations should take a cautious and incremental approach to sending its own peacekeeping mission , and only " when the security conditions are appropriate . "
target likely to be exceeded after delegates underlined the challenges facing the war-torn country , organizers said donors had promised funding which was likely to exceed their initial expectations .
" we are on target , we are even a little bit higher because the target was $ 250 million , " said eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel .
" it seems that we are also above 250 million if you take into account material aid . "
" it 's really a full success , " he added to reporters after the four-hour conference in brussels .

the amisom force - the only security presence backing the government - is well short of the 8,000 soldiers initially planned and is regularly attacked by the islamist shebab militia .
" restoring security and stability in somalia is vital to the success of the reconciliation effort and the survival of the unity government , " ban told the conference , held under the auspices of the united nations .
" much remains to be done . "
ban reiterated he had no intention of sending a un force to somalia any time soon , saying that the united nations should take a cautious and incremental approach to sending its own peacekeeping mission , and only " when the security conditions are appropriate . "
target likely to be exceeded after delegates underlined the challenges facing the war-torn country , organizers said donors had promised funding which was likely to exceed their initial expectations .
" we are on target , we are even a little bit higher because the target was $ 250 million , " said eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel .
" it seems that we are also above 250 million if you take into account material aid . "
" it 's really a full success , " he added to reporters after the four-hour conference in brussels .
the european commission , whose president jose manuel barroso also attended , had announced it would pledge at least 60 million euros on the eve of the meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamists have battled numerous governments president ahmed , who took office in january , made a personal plea for funds at the conference .
" solving this problem will require a radical solution , " said ahmed .
" the restoration of security and peace in somalia is the basis of any solution to the problems , " he said .
islamist fighters including the hard-line shebab militia have waged battles against the transitional government , its predecessor cabinet and their allies , vowing to fight until all foreign forces withdraw and sharia law is imposed .
more than one million people have fled their homes .
fewer than one in three somalis , whose life expectancy is 46 years , have access to clean water .
general instability and lawlessness while the conference was not focused on piracy , the high media profile of the growing number of cases of daring raids on freighters on the seas of the gulf of aden has become synonymous with somalia 's woes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international anti-piracy efforts face a tough mission " piracy is not a water-borne disease .
it is a symptom of anarchy and insecurity on the ground , " ban said .
" dealing with it requires an integrated strategy that addresses the fundamental issue of lawlessness in somalia . "
despite international naval missions - including from nato and the european union - piracy has mushroomed over the last year , as ransom-hunting somalis tackle ever-bigger and more distant prizes .
more than 130 merchant ships were attacked in the region last year , an increase of more than 200 percent on 2007 , the international maritime bureau said .
a tenfold increase was noted in the first three months of 2009 .
" if we only treat the symptoms , piracy at sea , but not its root causes - the decay of the state and poverty - we will fail , " barroso said .
non-governmental organization oxfam said the conference was being held at a critical moment for 3.2 million somalis desperately in need of aid , more than a million of whom have fled their homes to avoid fighting in the last two years .
" the piracy issue that has grabbed international headlines is a symptom of deeper issues that have gone unaddressed ever since the collapse of the national government in 1991 , " oxfam 's robert maletta said in a statement .
ahmed underlined : " it is our duty to pursue these criminals not only on the high seas but also on terra firma . "
piracy on the increase despite international force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's mission off the coast of somalia is in question piracy has worsened off somalia 's coast despite the presence of naval forces from more than a dozen countries , including task forces under nato , eu and us command .
nato 's four-ship mission was due to wind up its operation on thursday .
diplomats were discussing whether it could be extended and nato has said it wants tougher rules to allow the detention of captured suspects .
the united states , which is reviewing its somalia policy , plans to help build somali security forces and bolster the new government but has made clear it has no desire to " drive " the whole process . nda / mll , afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is our hope that any car scrappage legislation ultimately enacted will remedy these concerns , and that the eu will be able to support this important initiative to promote fuel-efficiency , reduce pollution , and provide a needed boost to the automobile industry , " john bruton , the eu 's ambassador to the united states , said in a letter sent to the us congress on wednesday .
president barack obama supports passage of a " cash-for-clunkers " bill to pay people to turn in their gas guzzlers and replace them with more fuel-efficient vehicles .
but bruton said europe is worried that a leading version of the legislation , " as currently drafted , provides benefits only for replacement vehicles assembled in the u.s. or north america , a distinction that would harm car manufacturers from other parts of the world , including europe . "
such a provision , he added , would be " a clear violation " of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- rules requiring a country 's laws to treat foreign and domestic products equally .
possible compromise on north american provision europe 's fears and the concerns that the eu and us may bring their differences before the wto were partially allayed on thursday when got a boost after a leading proponent of the " cash-for-clunkers " bill , ohio congresswoman betty sutton , signaled she may drop a provision limiting the subsidies to purchases of north american made vehicles .
the provision has been a major sticking point in congressional efforts to merge competing proposals for the program , and sutton 's move brings those who are opposed to the north america requirement closer to a compromise with those who support it .
" it 's not so important to me that it has to be done " exactly according to her bill , but rather that a program is passed , sutton told reporters on capitol hill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany allows trade-ins for german and foreign cars germany , france , and slovakia - as well as china - have already enacted such trade-in programs but a central feature of the european programs is that they apply to all vehicles , whether assembled in europe or abroad .
the us may now follow suit as congressional aides redouble their efforts to find common ground on compromise legislation that could clear congress within months .
but even if a compromise is reached , lawmakers must find funding for the program .
some have suggested that the money would come from the economic stimulus package passed earlier this year .
proponents say the program - to provide new-car discounts of $ 1,500 to $ 7,500 -lrb- 1,150 euros – 5,700 euros -rrb- , depending on the proposal - is desperately needed to lift slumping car sales . nda / mll , reuters / wall street journal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however he claimed fiat had no interest in a strategic partnership with opel .
he said an alliance with fiat would lead to massive job cuts at opel and the closure of german factories after bundestag elections in september .
opel has around 25,000 workers .

" fiat has … huge liquidity problems .

stuermer also said that fiat would most likely not be able to go it alone in its bid for control of opel .
" i think that fiat at the moment does not have the free cash lying around to just come up with the money .
they would certainly have to team up either with one of the other interested parties in investing in opel or with one of their own long-term partners from the agnelli family or wider italy . "

but there are fears over what that could mean for opel ’ s german workers . franz confirmed thursday reports that said fiat was ready to sign a declaration of intent on a takeover as early as next tuesday .
however he claimed fiat had no interest in a strategic partnership with opel .
he said an alliance with fiat would lead to massive job cuts at opel and the closure of german factories after bundestag elections in september .
opel has around 25,000 workers .
franz also said fiat , which has 14.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 18.4 billion -rrb- of debt sitting over its head , had no way of finding the 500 million euros in fresh capital gm is seeking from a suitor .
" fiat has … huge liquidity problems .
they ca n't get hold of money at the moment , " franz said .
" the government ca n't give guarantees for such a transparent plan . "
on thursday , fiat posted a first-quarter loss of 411 million euros and ruled out any direct investment as part of a potential deal for a strategic partnership with us peer chrysler .
" no agreements " roland koch , the premier of the german state of hesse , where opel has its headquarters , confirmed that fiat was involved in discussions over a potential takeover .
he said that canadian car parts maker magna was also interested in a stake , but that no agreements have been reached yet .
german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg also said no decision had been taken on fiat 's role in any takeover .
" the federal government is holding talks with various interested parties , without any predetermination , " guttenberg said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg says opel 's future is still under discussion the online version of us daily wall street journal reported that fiat chief executive sergio marchionne had held talks with guttenberg in berlin last week .
job cuts certain christoph stuermer , an auto industry expert at think tank ihs global insight , said opel 's manufacturing and technological aspects would be of little interest to fiat .
" on top of having a 100 percent overlapping product portfolio , fiat and opel also have a very much overlapping regional footprint … so i think that mr franz is being very polite .
i think that the long-term strategy of fiat is really to keep the market share and get rid of all the rest of opel . "
stuermer also said that fiat would most likely not be able to go it alone in its bid for control of opel .
" i think that fiat at the moment does not have the free cash lying around to just come up with the money .
they would certainly have to team up either with one of the other interested parties in investing in opel or with one of their own long-term partners from the agnelli family or wider italy . "
spokespeople from fiat and opel were unavailable for comment on thursday on the potential takeover .
two sides of the coin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel workers fear german production lines could be terminated pierluigi bellini , associate director of ihs 's automotive division in milan , agreed that a fiat-opel fusion would spell the end for thousands of german workers .
" fiat and opel have obvious synergies here , scales of economy , " he said .
" but the other side of the coin is that work forces would need to be cut , both in germany and italy , and i do n't know if that is feasible now .
especially in germany , where you have an election year , and in italy the situation is already pretty bad for italian plants . "
despite all the potential points of synergy , fiat faces an uphill battle to convince opel 's management and the industry at large that it has the capacity to take control of the german carmaker .

" what seat would be more appropriate than a land wounded by the earthquake ? "
berlusconi told a news conference in l 'aquila on thursday , after holding a cabinet meeting in the stricken town .
berlusconi said moving the meeting of the heads of government of the world 's richest countries , currently set to take place on la maddalena , a small island off sardinia , would be a " positive signal for the more than 60,000 people still living in temporary camps . "
" the 21 heads of government who come will be able to see first-hand the wounds caused by this earthquake , " berlusconi added .
" i think it could work out very well . "
berlusconi looking to divert funds to disaster zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi will need to consult with g8 leaders on the move the italian leader , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the g8 club of industrialized nations , added that the 220 million euros -lrb- $ 286.5 million -rrb- needed for summit security and infrastructure in sardinia could this way be invested in the earthquake region instead .
berlusconi acknowledged logistics and cost problems at the original venue on a sardinian island were putting the original plans in jeopardy .
however , the decision to move the conference to l 'aquila could render moot more than two years of planning for the event .
the decision to move the summit was dependent on approval from the other nations attending the summit scheduled for july 8-10 there have already been signs of dissent within berlusconi 's cabinet over moving the g8 summit , with at least one minister saying it was " implausible " and would be difficult to pull off .
cabinet increases aid to quake region the april 6 quake in the central region of abruzzo killed 296 people , flattened entire areas of some towns and made some 65,000 people homeless .
the cabinet earlier on thursday approved a decree raising up to 8 billion euros to rebuild the quake-hit areas and fund emergency services . nda / mll , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i can well imagine that in two or three months , people 's anger will grow considerably , " schwan told the muenchener merkur newspaper .
that 's when some of the government 's measures to cushion the blow from the recession - such as filling in the pay gap for people who are forced into shortened work hours - are due to run out .
" if there is no sign of hope for things to improve , then the mood can turn explosive , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if aid measures run out , patience will as well , schwan warns schwan 's comments followed those of sommer , who heads the federation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- umbrella group .
in an intervew with germany 's ard television , sommer warned of social unrest comparable to that in the 1930s - when widespread poverty paved the way for the nazi regime 's rise to power .
fraying tempers in france the projected economic contraction of up to six percent is comparable with data from the years 1930 , 1931 and 1932 , sommer said .
making the rounds of the german press , sommer told the nordwest zeitung newspaper that if there are mass layoffs , it would be " a provocation for workers and the unions , " indicating that " social unrest could no longer be discounted " in germany .
the seams of civil restraint are already beginning to fray in france - a country known for frequent strikes and an active labor movment .
on tuesday , a french court rejected a motion brought by employees of a factory run by germany 's continental ag to block the plant 's planned 2010 closure .
citing the steep drop in demand in the automobile sector , continental announced in march plans to shutter the factory in clairoix , north of paris , which employs 1,120 .
smashed windows , destroyed equipment workers responded to the ruling by smashing windows and destroying equipment at the factory and regional administrative offices in nearby compiegne .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sommer sees parallels with the early 1930s on wednesday , factory management distributed fliers reading : " we have no other choice but to suspend production as well as the whole of the site 's activities until further notice . "
french government officials condemned the workers ' rampage , calling it " unacceptable . "
continental workers have drawn nationwide attention , meeting with top government officials at the presidential palace , burning tires in the streets of the capital and leading weeks of protests .
their actions are part of a wave of increasingly radical employee movements to fight layoffs and cutbacks prompted by france 's worst economic performance in 30 years .
workers have held managers hostage and blocked production at sites around the country .
on tuesday , workers in southwest france released two bosses held for two days over plans to shut a subsidiary of american automotive company molex .
french prime minister francois fillon criticized what he called a small minority of " very violent " workers who are hijacking peaceful union mediation efforts .

" winterkorn said the two companies together " have the stuff to develop the powerhouse of the international automobile industry , " but did not provide any further details . his remarks came as the financial times newspaper reported that porsche se , the luxury brand 's holding company , was looking to sell its manufacturing arm to vw in exchange for cash and shares . further reports from bloomberg news agency quoted unnamed sources as saying the deal would help porsche se raise the funds it needs to continue its push to gain full control of vw , which , as europe 's biggest carmaker , has a turnover roughly 15 times larger than porsche 's . porsche se already owns 51 percent of vw , but analysts say the 9 billion euros of debt it has accumulated buying shares so far is making it difficult for porsche to acquire its target stake of 75 percent . the stuttgart-based sports carmaker recently renewed a credit line worth 10 billion euros , but tighter lending conditions caused by the global financial crisis left its managers short of the 12.5 billion they had initially sought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : works council president uwe hueck says porsche is in a strong financial position representatives of both vw and porsche se declined to comment on the media reports . however , the president of porsche 's works council , uwe hueck , criticized the media for suggesting the company was in financial difficulty and that vw was considering the stake . " i 'm angry that particular persons in the media are spreading ideas that have n't been discussed by the supervisory board , " hueck said in a written statement . he said that the reports were irresponsible and threatened to spread fear among porsche workers . " the jobs at our company are secure , " hueck said , adding that porsche remained financially sound and profitable despite difficulties linked to the global economic downturn . meanwhile , ahead of thursday 's shareholder meeting , vw reported what it described as " extremely weak " results for the first three months of this year with earnings slumping over the last three-quarters . the wolfsburg-based company 's net profit tumbled to 243 million euros in the first quarter of 2009 - down 74 percent from the same period last year . sje / nrt , afp / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i can well imagine that in two or three months , people 's anger will grow considerably , " schwan told the muenchener merkur newspaper .
that 's when some of the government 's measures to cushion the blow from the recession - such as filling in the pay gap for people who are forced into shortened work hours - are due to run out .
" if there is no sign of hope for things to improve , then the mood can turn explosive , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if aid measures run out , patience will as well , schwan warns schwan 's comments followed those of sommer , who heads the federation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- umbrella group .
in an intervew with germany 's ard television , sommer warned of social unrest comparable to that in the 1930s - when widespread poverty paved the way for the nazi regime 's rise to power .
fraying tempers in france the projected economic contraction of up to six percent is comparable with data from the years 1930 , 1931 and 1932 , sommer said .
making the rounds of the german press , sommer told the nordwest zeitung newspaper that if there are mass layoffs , it would be " a provocation for workers and the unions , " indicating that " social unrest could no longer be discounted " in germany .
the seams of civil restraint are already beginning to fray in france - a country known for frequent strikes and an active labor movment .
on tuesday , a french court rejected a motion brought by employees of a factory run by germany 's continental ag to block the plant 's planned 2010 closure .
citing the steep drop in demand in the automobile sector , continental announced in march plans to shutter the factory in clairoix , north of paris , which employs 1,120 .
smashed windows , destroyed equipment workers responded to the ruling by smashing windows and destroying equipment at the factory and regional administrative offices in nearby compiegne .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sommer sees parallels with the early 1930s on wednesday , factory management distributed fliers reading : " we have no other choice but to suspend production as well as the whole of the site 's activities until further notice . "
french government officials condemned the workers ' rampage , calling it " unacceptable . "
continental workers have drawn nationwide attention , meeting with top government officials at the presidential palace , burning tires in the streets of the capital and leading weeks of protests .
their actions are part of a wave of increasingly radical employee movements to fight layoffs and cutbacks prompted by france 's worst economic performance in 30 years .
workers have held managers hostage and blocked production at sites around the country .
on tuesday , workers in southwest france released two bosses held for two days over plans to shut a subsidiary of american automotive company molex .
french prime minister francois fillon criticized what he called a small minority of " very violent " workers who are hijacking peaceful union mediation efforts .
he called for charges to be laid against the rampaging workers , the ap news agency reported . jen / pfd , ap / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's jobless rate was 7.3 percent last year .

labor market crisis the imf 's latest world economic outlook underscores the risks that the economic crisis is rapidly turning into a labor market crisis , with euro-zone unemployment set to rise this year to 10.1 percent before edging up to 11.5 percent in 2010 .

" what seat would be more appropriate than a land wounded by the earthquake ? "
berlusconi told a news conference in l 'aquila on thursday , after holding a cabinet meeting in the stricken town .
berlusconi said moving the meeting of the heads of government of the world 's richest countries , currently set to take place on la maddalena , a small island off sardinia , would be a " positive signal for the more than 60,000 people still living in temporary camps . "
" the 21 heads of government who come will be able to see first-hand the wounds caused by this earthquake , " berlusconi added .
" i think it could work out very well . "
berlusconi looking to divert funds to disaster zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi will need to consult with g8 leaders on the move the italian leader , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the g8 club of industrialized nations , added that the 220 million euros -lrb- $ 286.5 million -rrb- needed for summit security and infrastructure in sardinia could this way be invested in the earthquake region instead .
berlusconi acknowledged logistics and cost problems at the original venue on a sardinian island were putting the original plans in jeopardy .
however , the decision to move the conference to l 'aquila could render moot more than two years of planning for the event .
the decision to move the summit was dependent on approval from the other nations attending the summit scheduled for july 8-10 there have already been signs of dissent within berlusconi 's cabinet over moving the g8 summit , with at least one minister saying it was " implausible " and would be difficult to pull off .
cabinet increases aid to quake region the april 6 quake in the central region of abruzzo killed 296 people , flattened entire areas of some towns and made some 65,000 people homeless .
the cabinet earlier on thursday approved a decree raising up to 8 billion euros to rebuild the quake-hit areas and fund emergency services . nda / mll , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the subject of piracy threatened to dominate proceedings . as international donors gathered at a conference to help bring stability to somalia , it seemed rampant piracy in busy shipping lanes off the somali coast - a subject that has topped international news bulletins for months - was likely to dominate the talks .
the one-day conference in brussels aims to raise at least 128 million euros -lrb- $ 166 million -rrb- to finance african peacekeepers and support somalia 's fledgling police and security forces .
but european commission president jose manuel barrosso said ahead of the talks that he was worried that the piracy problem might divert resources in the lawless nation .
piracy a ' symptom ' , ban says " if we only treat the symptoms , piracy at sea , but not its root causes - the decay of the state and poverty - we will fail , " barroso said ahead of the meeting .
for his part , ban said international funding for somalia 's new government and african union peacekeepers is vital to help stabilize the lawless nation , a prerequisite for stopping the persistent pirate attacks .
at a news conference , ban told reporteres that piracy is a symptom of anarchy and insecurity on the ground .
he said international help would enable the new government to establish authority and ensure reconstruction .
no plans for peace force ban reiterated that he had no intention of sending a un force to somalia any time soon , saying a peacekeeping operation would go only when " circumstances and conditions are appropriate . "
organisers of the meeting , which is being chaired by the un and the african union , say more than $ 250 million is needed for next year to improve security in a state that has functioned without a central government since 1991 and is mired in conflict .
also due to attend was somali president sheikh sharif ahmed , a former islamist rebel leader elected in january at un-brokered talks and widely seen as the best hope for restoring stability . jen / pfd , ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their forecast is even gloomier than the imf 's prediction for 2009 . germany 's leading economic institutes are predicting the worst economic decline since the country was founded in 1949 . in their annual spring report , they say the country 's economy will shrink by 6.0 percent this year .
the world 's top exporter is not likely to see an improvement any time soon , either . the institutes predict that the recession will continue into 2010 , with the economy contracting by 0.5 percent next year . the economic experts also say unemployment will rise to just under five million jobless by the end of next year . " on the basis of leading indicators , the institutes expect that the downward trend to continue and do not believe it will bottom out before the middle of 2010 , " the widely-watched report states . the institutes publish their outlook twice a year . the spring report 2009 comes a day after the latest projections by the international monetary fund , imf , which said the german economy was likely to contract by 5.6 percent , pushing unemployment rates up .
with global trade shrinking and the world economy gripped by recession , the international monetary fund has slashed its 2009 growth forecast for the entire 16-member euro zone by another one to 4.2 percent .
dire predictions but while their prognosis for germany looked especially bad , the imf said germany 's government still had more room to maneuver because of sound fiscal policies in the past , and should be spending extra public funds to make up for the massive decline in exports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck and guttenberg have their work cut out for them " could they do more ?
the answer is yes , " imf economist jorg decressin said .
" this is a case where a country has done its homework during the good times ... and can take advantage of this during the bad times . "
as the world 's leading export nation , germany now appears to be bearing the brunt of the global recession , with the imf saying unemployment could climb to 10.8 percent in 2010 from 9 percent this year .
germany 's jobless rate was 7.3 percent last year .
“ i think we were all agreed around the table that we have a very difficult year ahead of us , " said german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg at a news conference on wednesday following an economic summit with chancellor angela merkel and leaders from industry and unions . finance minister peer steinbrueck told reporters there had been a slump of 3.3 percent in the first three months of the year .
labor market crisis the imf 's latest world economic outlook underscores the risks that the economic crisis is rapidly turning into a labor market crisis , with euro-zone unemployment set to rise this year to 10.1 percent before edging up to 11.5 percent in 2010 .
this is despite the massive stimulus packages introduced by european governments and the number of companies across europe placing employees on short-term working contracts rather than laying them off .
the euro-zone jobless rate stood at 7.6 percent in 2008 .
" the euro area is coming out of this crisis somewhat later than the us because to some extent the policy stimulus kicked in later , " decressin told reporters in washington .
but it is a picture repeated across europe , with the imf saying france faces a 3 percent fall in growth in 2009 and a meagre 0.4 percent pickup next year , while italian gdp should sink by 4.4 percent this year .
britain , which has been battling with falling consumer demand , a housing market collapse and a drawing in of its key financial sector , is expected to stage only a modest recovery after this year 's 4.1 percent contraction .
the imf predicts british unemployment will jump from 7.4 percent in 2009 to 9.2 percent next year .
ireland has been particularly badly hit by the world recession and the credit crunch , and the imf predicts that irish economic growth will fall by a disastrous 8 percent this year and by 3 percent in 2010 after a collapse in the nation 's construction boom . db / pfd , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the subject of piracy threatened to dominate proceedings . as international donors gathered at a conference to help bring stability to somalia , it seemed rampant piracy in busy shipping lanes off the somali coast - a subject that has topped international news bulletins for months - was likely to dominate the talks .
the one-day conference in brussels aims to raise at least 128 million euros -lrb- $ 166 million -rrb- to finance african peacekeepers and support somalia 's fledgling police and security forces .
but european commission president jose manuel barrosso said ahead of the talks that he was worried that the piracy problem might divert resources in the lawless nation .
piracy a ' symptom ' , ban says " if we only treat the symptoms , piracy at sea , but not its root causes - the decay of the state and poverty - we will fail , " barroso said ahead of the meeting .
for his part , ban said international funding for somalia 's new government and african union peacekeepers is vital to help stabilize the lawless nation , a prerequisite for stopping the persistent pirate attacks .
at a news conference , ban told reporteres that piracy is a symptom of anarchy and insecurity on the ground .
he said international help would enable the new government to establish authority and ensure reconstruction .
no plans for peace force ban reiterated that he had no intention of sending a un force to somalia any time soon , saying a peacekeeping operation would go only when " circumstances and conditions are appropriate . "
organisers of the meeting , which is being chaired by the un and the african union , say more than $ 250 million is needed for next year to improve security in a state that has functioned without a central government since 1991 and is mired in conflict .
also due to attend was somali president sheikh sharif ahmed , a former islamist rebel leader elected in january at un-brokered talks and widely seen as the best hope for restoring stability . jen / pfd , ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i can well imagine that in two or three months , people 's anger will grow considerably , " schwan told the muenchener merkur newspaper .
that 's when some of the government 's measures to cushion the blow from the recession - such as filling in the pay gap for people who are forced into shortened work hours - are due to run out .
" if there is no sign of hope for things to improve , then the mood can turn explosive , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if aid measures run out , patience will as well , schwan warns schwan 's comments followed those of sommer , who heads the federation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- umbrella group .
in an intervew with germany 's ard television , sommer warned of social unrest comparable to that in the 1930s - when widespread poverty paved the way for the nazi regime 's rise to power .
fraying tempers in france the projected economic contraction of up to six percent is comparable with data from the years 1930 , 1931 and 1932 , sommer said .
making the rounds of the german press , sommer told the nordwest zeitung newspaper that if there are mass layoffs , it would be " a provocation for workers and the unions , " indicating that " social unrest could no longer be discounted " in germany .
the seams of civil restraint are already beginning to fray in france - a country known for frequent strikes and an active labor movment .
on tuesday , a french court rejected a motion brought by employees of a factory run by germany 's continental ag to block the plant 's planned 2010 closure .
citing the steep drop in demand in the automobile sector , continental announced in march plans to shutter the factory in clairoix , north of paris , which employs 1,120 .
smashed windows , destroyed equipment workers responded to the ruling by smashing windows and destroying equipment at the factory and regional administrative offices in nearby compiegne .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sommer sees parallels with the early 1930s on wednesday , factory management distributed fliers reading : " we have no other choice but to suspend production as well as the whole of the site 's activities until further notice . "
french government officials condemned the workers ' rampage , calling it " unacceptable . "
continental workers have drawn nationwide attention , meeting with top government officials at the presidential palace , burning tires in the streets of the capital and leading weeks of protests .
their actions are part of a wave of increasingly radical employee movements to fight layoffs and cutbacks prompted by france 's worst economic performance in 30 years .
workers have held managers hostage and blocked production at sites around the country .
on tuesday , workers in southwest france released two bosses held for two days over plans to shut a subsidiary of american automotive company molex .

" winterkorn said the two companies together " have the stuff to develop the powerhouse of the international automobile industry , " but did not provide any further details . his remarks came as the financial times newspaper reported that porsche se , the luxury brand 's holding company , was looking to sell its manufacturing arm to vw in exchange for cash and shares . further reports from bloomberg news agency quoted unnamed sources as saying the deal would help porsche se raise the funds it needs to continue its push to gain full control of vw , which , as europe 's biggest carmaker , has a turnover roughly 15 times larger than porsche 's . porsche se already owns 51 percent of vw , but analysts say the 9 billion euros of debt it has accumulated buying shares so far is making it difficult for porsche to acquire its target stake of 75 percent . the stuttgart-based sports carmaker recently renewed a credit line worth 10 billion euros , but tighter lending conditions caused by the global financial crisis left its managers short of the 12.5 billion they had initially sought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : works council president uwe hueck says porsche is in a strong financial position representatives of both vw and porsche se declined to comment on the media reports . however , the president of porsche 's works council , uwe hueck , criticized the media for suggesting the company was in financial difficulty and that vw was considering the stake . " i 'm angry that particular persons in the media are spreading ideas that have n't been discussed by the supervisory board , " hueck said in a written statement . he said that the reports were irresponsible and threatened to spread fear among porsche workers . " the jobs at our company are secure , " hueck said , adding that porsche remained financially sound and profitable despite difficulties linked to the global economic downturn . meanwhile , ahead of thursday 's shareholder meeting , vw reported what it described as " extremely weak " results for the first three months of this year with earnings slumping over the last three-quarters . the wolfsburg-based company 's net profit tumbled to 243 million euros in the first quarter of 2009 - down 74 percent from the same period last year . sje / nrt , afp / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" what seat would be more appropriate than a land wounded by the earthquake ? "
berlusconi told a news conference in l 'aquila on thursday , after holding a cabinet meeting in the stricken town .
berlusconi said moving the meeting of the heads of government of the world 's richest countries , currently set to take place on la maddalena , a small island off sardinia , would be a " positive signal for the more than 60,000 people still living in temporary camps . "
" the 21 heads of government who come will be able to see first-hand the wounds caused by this earthquake , " berlusconi added .
" i think it could work out very well . "
berlusconi looking to divert funds to disaster zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi will need to consult with g8 leaders on the move the italian leader , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the g8 club of industrialized nations , added that the 220 million euros -lrb- $ 286.5 million -rrb- needed for summit security and infrastructure in sardinia could this way be invested in the earthquake region instead .
berlusconi acknowledged logistics and cost problems at the original venue on a sardinian island were putting the original plans in jeopardy .
however , the decision to move the conference to l 'aquila could render moot more than two years of planning for the event .
the decision to move the summit was dependent on approval from the other nations attending the summit scheduled for july 8-10 there have already been signs of dissent within berlusconi 's cabinet over moving the g8 summit , with at least one minister saying it was " implausible " and would be difficult to pull off .
cabinet increases aid to quake region the april 6 quake in the central region of abruzzo killed 296 people , flattened entire areas of some towns and made some 65,000 people homeless .
the cabinet earlier on thursday approved a decree raising up to 8 billion euros to rebuild the quake-hit areas and fund emergency services . nda / mll , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" winterkorn said the two companies together " have the stuff to develop the powerhouse of the international automobile industry , " but did not provide any further details . his remarks came as the financial times newspaper reported that porsche se , the luxury brand 's holding company , was looking to sell its manufacturing arm to vw in exchange for cash and shares . further reports from bloomberg news agency quoted unnamed sources as saying the deal would help porsche se raise the funds it needs to continue its push to gain full control of vw , which , as europe 's biggest carmaker , has a turnover roughly 15 times larger than porsche 's . porsche se already owns 51 percent of vw , but analysts say the 9 billion euros of debt it has accumulated buying shares so far is making it difficult for porsche to acquire its target stake of 75 percent . the stuttgart-based sports carmaker recently renewed a credit line worth 10 billion euros , but tighter lending conditions caused by the global financial crisis left its managers short of the 12.5 billion they had initially sought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : works council president uwe hueck says porsche is in a strong financial position representatives of both vw and porsche se declined to comment on the media reports . however , the president of porsche 's works council , uwe hueck , criticized the media for suggesting the company was in financial difficulty and that vw was considering the stake . " i 'm angry that particular persons in the media are spreading ideas that have n't been discussed by the supervisory board , " hueck said in a written statement . he said that the reports were irresponsible and threatened to spread fear among porsche workers . " the jobs at our company are secure , " hueck said , adding that porsche remained financially sound and profitable despite difficulties linked to the global economic downturn . meanwhile , ahead of thursday 's shareholder meeting , vw reported what it described as " extremely weak " results for the first three months of this year with earnings slumping over the last three-quarters . the wolfsburg-based company 's net profit tumbled to 243 million euros in the first quarter of 2009 - down 74 percent from the same period last year . sje / nrt , afp / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

al-qaeda 's north african branch had claimed responsibility for the abductions . a german tourist who was taken hostage by islamists three months ago in mali was released wednesday evening , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in berlin .
the 77-year-old woman was one of four western tourists abducted on january 22 during a trip to niger and mali .
steinmeier said that the woman was in the care of mali government officials and that she was exhausted by the ordeal and hardship of three months in captivity .
steinmeier also thanked mali president amadou toumani toure , who had cooperated closely with berlin to end the abduction .
a spokesperson for the mali government said that that two canadian un diplomats and a woman from switzerland have also been released .
a group calling itself the north african branch of al-qaeda had claimed responsibility for the abductions demanding its members to be freed from detention in mali and other countries .
analysts say the sahara desert in west africa has become increasingly insecure for tourists with islamist groups seeking to spread their influence south from algeria .

several of joanne k. rowling 's harry potter sequels repeated the feat .
now it 's the " twilight " series by american author stephenie meyer that 's taking german readers - mainly women - by storm .
" people 's ability and willingness to read english-language novels is growing , " thomas wilking , editor-in-chief of the book-sellers ' publication " buchreport , " told dpa news agency .
a female trend bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was harry potter rather than shakespeare who got germans to choose the original version " the english boom can mainly be attributed to women , " he added .
" women , as a rule , are more likely to read novels , and material like the ' twilight ' series clearly caters to a female audience . "

on world book day , reading in any language is celebrated . it started in 2003 with " harry potter and the order of the phoenix " - the first english-language book that managed to claim the top spot for several weeks running in germany 's spiegel best-seller list - in the original .
several of joanne k. rowling 's harry potter sequels repeated the feat .
now it 's the " twilight " series by american author stephenie meyer that 's taking german readers - mainly women - by storm .

the information , the most extensive of its kind to date , will be analyzed by manufacturers who hope eventually to adapt clothing measurements to suit the new german figure .

i do n't think it will be a revolution in labeling but we will fine tune it , ” he says .
more than 13,000 people between the ages of eight and 86 took part in the survey , which will also be used to benefit furniture design , car interiors - including the length of seat belts - and even operating tables .

retailers across europe have just started again with the discussion about size zero .
they have been discussing this for years and it will take another three years to harmonize , ” says rasch .
it also remains up to the individual brands to what extent they follow sizing guidelines .
luxury brands tailor clothes for a different demographic than high street stores , for example .
“ the decision of how to name a piece of clothing is a very individual and a very political decision which is very closely linked with marketing and image and all the things that make up a brand , ” rasch says .
the information from this survey will also form part of an ongoing research project of interest to the participating companies .

their forecast is even gloomier than the imf 's prediction for 2009 . germany 's leading economic institutes are predicting the worst economic decline since the country was founded in 1949 . in their annual spring report , they say the country 's economy will shrink by 6.0 percent this year .
the world 's top exporter is not likely to see an improvement any time soon , either . the institutes predict that the recession will continue into 2010 , with the economy contracting by 0.5 percent next year . the economic experts also say unemployment will rise to just under five million jobless by the end of next year . " on the basis of leading indicators , the institutes expect that the downward trend to continue and do not believe it will bottom out before the middle of 2010 , " the widely-watched report states . the institutes publish their outlook twice a year . the spring report 2009 comes a day after the latest projections by the international monetary fund , imf , which said the german economy was likely to contract by 5.6 percent , pushing unemployment rates up .
with global trade shrinking and the world economy gripped by recession , the international monetary fund has slashed its 2009 growth forecast for the entire 16-member euro zone by another one to 4.2 percent .
dire predictions but while their prognosis for germany looked especially bad , the imf said germany 's government still had more room to maneuver because of sound fiscal policies in the past , and should be spending extra public funds to make up for the massive decline in exports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck and guttenberg have their work cut out for them " could they do more ?
the answer is yes , " imf economist jorg decressin said .
" this is a case where a country has done its homework during the good times ... and can take advantage of this during the bad times . "
as the world 's leading export nation , germany now appears to be bearing the brunt of the global recession , with the imf saying unemployment could climb to 10.8 percent in 2010 from 9 percent this year .
germany 's jobless rate was 7.3 percent last year .
“ i think we were all agreed around the table that we have a very difficult year ahead of us , " said german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg at a news conference on wednesday following an economic summit with chancellor angela merkel and leaders from industry and unions . finance minister peer steinbrueck told reporters there had been a slump of 3.3 percent in the first three months of the year .
labor market crisis the imf 's latest world economic outlook underscores the risks that the economic crisis is rapidly turning into a labor market crisis , with euro-zone unemployment set to rise this year to 10.1 percent before edging up to 11.5 percent in 2010 .
this is despite the massive stimulus packages introduced by european governments and the number of companies across europe placing employees on short-term working contracts rather than laying them off .
the euro-zone jobless rate stood at 7.6 percent in 2008 .
" the euro area is coming out of this crisis somewhat later than the us because to some extent the policy stimulus kicked in later , " decressin told reporters in washington .
but it is a picture repeated across europe , with the imf saying france faces a 3 percent fall in growth in 2009 and a meagre 0.4 percent pickup next year , while italian gdp should sink by 4.4 percent this year .
britain , which has been battling with falling consumer demand , a housing market collapse and a drawing in of its key financial sector , is expected to stage only a modest recovery after this year 's 4.1 percent contraction .
the imf predicts british unemployment will jump from 7.4 percent in 2009 to 9.2 percent next year .
ireland has been particularly badly hit by the world recession and the credit crunch , and the imf predicts that irish economic growth will fall by a disastrous 8 percent this year and by 3 percent in 2010 after a collapse in the nation 's construction boom . db / pfd , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the information , the most extensive of its kind to date , will be analyzed by manufacturers who hope eventually to adapt clothing measurements to suit the new german figure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : textile scientists are collaborating with electronics specialists who measure bodies with lasers thomas rasch is the director of germanfashion , an organization that represents the german clothing industry .
he does n't expect dramatic changes because of the findings but he says it is sure to influence the way some stores mark and manufacture their sizes in future . “ now that we know exactly what the proportions are in the population of germany , we can check the decisions we already made .
i do n't think it will be a revolution in labeling but we will fine tune it , ” he says .
more than 13,000 people between the ages of eight and 86 took part in the survey , which will also be used to benefit furniture design , car interiors - including the length of seat belts - and even operating tables .
this was the first such survey of women in 15 years and the first for men in almost three decades .
tangible effects will take some time to implement .
sizegermany 's project manager dr. rainer trieb says it will be several months at least before the findings can be incorporated into new designs .
“ information will be integrated into new products for the coming seasons on a step by step basis .
maybe these results will be completely integrated in the next two or three years , ” he says .
if the shoe fits interest from the clothing sector is not completely altruistic .
a foreseeable side-effect of better-fitting clothing is that people buy more .
the findings have also raised the question of how shops choose to depict clothes sizes .
it is often the case that if people feel they fit into a smaller size that they are more inclined to make a purchase .
for rasch there is still a long way to go before there is any real parity in clothes sizing and even longer before retailers across europe agree on a unified system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : because germans are getting bigger , fewer people fit into standard clothing sizes , set in the 1950s “ the one thing is the new data about the proportion of bodies and the other thing is the question of the future of the labeling of sizes .
retailers across europe have just started again with the discussion about size zero .
they have been discussing this for years and it will take another three years to harmonize , ” says rasch .
it also remains up to the individual brands to what extent they follow sizing guidelines .
luxury brands tailor clothes for a different demographic than high street stores , for example .
“ the decision of how to name a piece of clothing is a very individual and a very political decision which is very closely linked with marketing and image and all the things that make up a brand , ” rasch says .
the information from this survey will also form part of an ongoing research project of interest to the participating companies .
sizegermany has created an interactive portal where companies can access the data directly .
regular information from the federal statistics bureau will be included to allow companies to compare the data to changing demographics .
one final project is to combine recent body size information gathered from other european surveys .
one thing that has emerged from the statistics is that while germans are taller than they used to be - a fact linked to affluence , nutrition , and light - they have for the moment reached a growth cap .
the german waist though is still expanding .

" i can well imagine that in two or three months , people 's anger will grow considerably , " schwan told the muenchener merkur newspaper .
that 's when some of the government 's measures to cushion the blow from the recession - such as filling in the pay gap for people who are forced into shortened work hours - are due to run out .
" if there is no sign of hope for things to improve , then the mood can turn explosive , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if aid measures run out , patience will as well , schwan warns schwan 's comments followed those of sommer , who heads the federation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- umbrella group .
in an intervew with germany 's ard television , sommer warned of social unrest comparable to that in the 1930s - when widespread poverty paved the way for the nazi regime 's rise to power .
fraying tempers in france the projected economic contraction of up to six percent is comparable with data from the years 1930 , 1931 and 1932 , sommer said .
making the rounds of the german press , sommer told the nordwest zeitung newspaper that if there are mass layoffs , it would be " a provocation for workers and the unions , " indicating that " social unrest could no longer be discounted " in germany .
the seams of civil restraint are already beginning to fray in france - a country known for frequent strikes and an active labor movment .
on tuesday , a french court rejected a motion brought by employees of a factory run by germany 's continental ag to block the plant 's planned 2010 closure .
citing the steep drop in demand in the automobile sector , continental announced in march plans to shutter the factory in clairoix , north of paris , which employs 1,120 .
smashed windows , destroyed equipment workers responded to the ruling by smashing windows and destroying equipment at the factory and regional administrative offices in nearby compiegne .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sommer sees parallels with the early 1930s on wednesday , factory management distributed fliers reading : " we have no other choice but to suspend production as well as the whole of the site 's activities until further notice . "
french government officials condemned the workers ' rampage , calling it " unacceptable . "
continental workers have drawn nationwide attention , meeting with top government officials at the presidential palace , burning tires in the streets of the capital and leading weeks of protests .
their actions are part of a wave of increasingly radical employee movements to fight layoffs and cutbacks prompted by france 's worst economic performance in 30 years .
workers have held managers hostage and blocked production at sites around the country .
on tuesday , workers in southwest france released two bosses held for two days over plans to shut a subsidiary of american automotive company molex .
french prime minister francois fillon criticized what he called a small minority of " very violent " workers who are hijacking peaceful union mediation efforts .

the subject of piracy threatened to dominate proceedings . as international donors gathered at a conference to help bring stability to somalia , it seemed rampant piracy in busy shipping lanes off the somali coast - a subject that has topped international news bulletins for months - was likely to dominate the talks .
the one-day conference in brussels aims to raise at least 128 million euros -lrb- $ 166 million -rrb- to finance african peacekeepers and support somalia 's fledgling police and security forces .

piracy a ' symptom ' , ban says " if we only treat the symptoms , piracy at sea , but not its root causes - the decay of the state and poverty - we will fail , " barroso said ahead of the meeting .
for his part , ban said international funding for somalia 's new government and african union peacekeepers is vital to help stabilize the lawless nation , a prerequisite for stopping the persistent pirate attacks .
at a news conference , ban told reporteres that piracy is a symptom of anarchy and insecurity on the ground .
he said international help would enable the new government to establish authority and ensure reconstruction .
no plans for peace force ban reiterated that he had no intention of sending a un force to somalia any time soon , saying a peacekeeping operation would go only when " circumstances and conditions are appropriate . "
organisers of the meeting , which is being chaired by the un and the african union , say more than $ 250 million is needed for next year to improve security in a state that has functioned without a central government since 1991 and is mired in conflict .

" i can well imagine that in two or three months , people 's anger will grow considerably , " schwan told the muenchener merkur newspaper .
that 's when some of the government 's measures to cushion the blow from the recession - such as filling in the pay gap for people who are forced into shortened work hours - are due to run out .
" if there is no sign of hope for things to improve , then the mood can turn explosive , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if aid measures run out , patience will as well , schwan warns schwan 's comments followed those of sommer , who heads the federation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- umbrella group .
in an intervew with germany 's ard television , sommer warned of social unrest comparable to that in the 1930s - when widespread poverty paved the way for the nazi regime 's rise to power .
fraying tempers in france the projected economic contraction of up to six percent is comparable with data from the years 1930 , 1931 and 1932 , sommer said .
making the rounds of the german press , sommer told the nordwest zeitung newspaper that if there are mass layoffs , it would be " a provocation for workers and the unions , " indicating that " social unrest could no longer be discounted " in germany .
the seams of civil restraint are already beginning to fray in france - a country known for frequent strikes and an active labor movment .
on tuesday , a french court rejected a motion brought by employees of a factory run by germany 's continental ag to block the plant 's planned 2010 closure .
citing the steep drop in demand in the automobile sector , continental announced in march plans to shutter the factory in clairoix , north of paris , which employs 1,120 .
smashed windows , destroyed equipment workers responded to the ruling by smashing windows and destroying equipment at the factory and regional administrative offices in nearby compiegne .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sommer sees parallels with the early 1930s on wednesday , factory management distributed fliers reading : " we have no other choice but to suspend production as well as the whole of the site 's activities until further notice . "
french government officials condemned the workers ' rampage , calling it " unacceptable . "
continental workers have drawn nationwide attention , meeting with top government officials at the presidential palace , burning tires in the streets of the capital and leading weeks of protests .
their actions are part of a wave of increasingly radical employee movements to fight layoffs and cutbacks prompted by france 's worst economic performance in 30 years .
workers have held managers hostage and blocked production at sites around the country .
on tuesday , workers in southwest france released two bosses held for two days over plans to shut a subsidiary of american automotive company molex .
french prime minister francois fillon criticized what he called a small minority of " very violent " workers who are hijacking peaceful union mediation efforts .
he called for charges to be laid against the rampaging workers , the ap news agency reported . jen / pfd , ap / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their forecast is even gloomier than the imf 's prediction for 2009 . germany 's leading economic institutes are predicting the worst economic decline since the country was founded in 1949 . in their annual spring report , they say the country 's economy will shrink by 6.0 percent this year .
the world 's top exporter is not likely to see an improvement any time soon , either . the institutes predict that the recession will continue into 2010 , with the economy contracting by 0.5 percent next year . the economic experts also say unemployment will rise to just under five million jobless by the end of next year . " on the basis of leading indicators , the institutes expect that the downward trend to continue and do not believe it will bottom out before the middle of 2010 , " the widely-watched report states . the institutes publish their outlook twice a year . the spring report 2009 comes a day after the latest projections by the international monetary fund , imf , which said the german economy was likely to contract by 5.6 percent , pushing unemployment rates up .
with global trade shrinking and the world economy gripped by recession , the international monetary fund has slashed its 2009 growth forecast for the entire 16-member euro zone by another one to 4.2 percent .
dire predictions but while their prognosis for germany looked especially bad , the imf said germany 's government still had more room to maneuver because of sound fiscal policies in the past , and should be spending extra public funds to make up for the massive decline in exports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck and guttenberg have their work cut out for them " could they do more ?
the answer is yes , " imf economist jorg decressin said .
" this is a case where a country has done its homework during the good times ... and can take advantage of this during the bad times . "
as the world 's leading export nation , germany now appears to be bearing the brunt of the global recession , with the imf saying unemployment could climb to 10.8 percent in 2010 from 9 percent this year .
germany 's jobless rate was 7.3 percent last year .
“ i think we were all agreed around the table that we have a very difficult year ahead of us , " said german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg at a news conference on wednesday following an economic summit with chancellor angela merkel and leaders from industry and unions . finance minister peer steinbrueck told reporters there had been a slump of 3.3 percent in the first three months of the year .
labor market crisis the imf 's latest world economic outlook underscores the risks that the economic crisis is rapidly turning into a labor market crisis , with euro-zone unemployment set to rise this year to 10.1 percent before edging up to 11.5 percent in 2010 .
this is despite the massive stimulus packages introduced by european governments and the number of companies across europe placing employees on short-term working contracts rather than laying them off .
the euro-zone jobless rate stood at 7.6 percent in 2008 .
" the euro area is coming out of this crisis somewhat later than the us because to some extent the policy stimulus kicked in later , " decressin told reporters in washington .
but it is a picture repeated across europe , with the imf saying france faces a 3 percent fall in growth in 2009 and a meagre 0.4 percent pickup next year , while italian gdp should sink by 4.4 percent this year .
britain , which has been battling with falling consumer demand , a housing market collapse and a drawing in of its key financial sector , is expected to stage only a modest recovery after this year 's 4.1 percent contraction .
the imf predicts british unemployment will jump from 7.4 percent in 2009 to 9.2 percent next year .
ireland has been particularly badly hit by the world recession and the credit crunch , and the imf predicts that irish economic growth will fall by a disastrous 8 percent this year and by 3 percent in 2010 after a collapse in the nation 's construction boom . db / pfd , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with global trade shrinking and the world economy gripped by recession , the international monetary fund has slashed its 2009 growth forecast for the entire 16-member euro zone by another one to 4.2 percent .

the answer is yes , " imf economist jorg decressin said .

as the world 's leading export nation , germany now appears to be bearing the brunt of the global recession , with the imf saying unemployment could climb to 10.8 percent in 2010 from 9 percent this year .
germany 's jobless rate was 7.3 percent last year .
“ i think we were all agreed around the table that we have a very difficult year ahead of us , " said german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg at a news conference on wednesday following an economic summit with chancellor angela merkel and leaders from industry and unions . finance minister peer steinbrueck told reporters there had been a slump of 3.3 percent in the first three months of the year .

this is despite the massive stimulus packages introduced by european governments and the number of companies across europe placing employees on short-term working contracts rather than laying them off .
the euro-zone jobless rate stood at 7.6 percent in 2008 .
" the euro area is coming out of this crisis somewhat later than the us because to some extent the policy stimulus kicked in later , " decressin told reporters in washington .
but it is a picture repeated across europe , with the imf saying france faces a 3 percent fall in growth in 2009 and a meagre 0.4 percent pickup next year , while italian gdp should sink by 4.4 percent this year .
britain , which has been battling with falling consumer demand , a housing market collapse and a drawing in of its key financial sector , is expected to stage only a modest recovery after this year 's 4.1 percent contraction .
the imf predicts british unemployment will jump from 7.4 percent in 2009 to 9.2 percent next year .

a company spokeswoman , marion kessing , said sabotage was highly unlikely as a cause .
the bonn-based offshoot of the giant german telecoms group deutsche telekom is also attempting to assess how many of its 39.1 million german mobile phone customers were hit by the outage .
however , a t-mobile spokesman told german press agency dpa on wednesday that the company was not liable to pay compensation as a result of the breakdown in its network .
but in a gesture of contrition , the company said customers would be allowed to send text messages for free all day this sunday within germany . dfm / mll , ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i do n't think it will be a revolution in labeling but we will fine tune it , ” he says .
more than 13,000 people between the ages of eight and 86 took part in the survey , which will also be used to benefit furniture design , car interiors - including the length of seat belts - and even operating tables .
this was the first such survey of women in 15 years and the first for men in almost three decades .

for rasch there is still a long way to go before there is any real parity in clothes sizing and even longer before retailers across europe agree on a unified system .

it also remains up to the individual brands to what extent they follow sizing guidelines .
luxury brands tailor clothes for a different demographic than high street stores , for example .
“ the decision of how to name a piece of clothing is a very individual and a very political decision which is very closely linked with marketing and image and all the things that make up a brand , ” rasch says .

for rasch there is still a long way to go before there is any real parity in clothes sizing and even longer before retailers across europe agree on a unified system .

retailers across europe have just started again with the discussion about size zero .
they have been discussing this for years and it will take another three years to harmonize , ” says rasch .
it also remains up to the individual brands to what extent they follow sizing guidelines .
luxury brands tailor clothes for a different demographic than high street stores , for example .
“ the decision of how to name a piece of clothing is a very individual and a very political decision which is very closely linked with marketing and image and all the things that make up a brand , ” rasch says .

regular information from the federal statistics bureau will be included to allow companies to compare the data to changing demographics .

the information , the most extensive of its kind to date , will be analyzed by manufacturers who hope eventually to adapt clothing measurements to suit the new german figure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : textile scientists are collaborating with electronics specialists who measure bodies with lasers thomas rasch is the director of germanfashion , an organization that represents the german clothing industry .
he does n't expect dramatic changes because of the findings but he says it is sure to influence the way some stores mark and manufacture their sizes in future . “ now that we know exactly what the proportions are in the population of germany , we can check the decisions we already made .
i do n't think it will be a revolution in labeling but we will fine tune it , ” he says .
more than 13,000 people between the ages of eight and 86 took part in the survey , which will also be used to benefit furniture design , car interiors - including the length of seat belts - and even operating tables .
this was the first such survey of women in 15 years and the first for men in almost three decades .
tangible effects will take some time to implement .
sizegermany 's project manager dr. rainer trieb says it will be several months at least before the findings can be incorporated into new designs .
“ information will be integrated into new products for the coming seasons on a step by step basis .
maybe these results will be completely integrated in the next two or three years , ” he says .
if the shoe fits interest from the clothing sector is not completely altruistic .
a foreseeable side-effect of better-fitting clothing is that people buy more .
the findings have also raised the question of how shops choose to depict clothes sizes .
it is often the case that if people feel they fit into a smaller size that they are more inclined to make a purchase .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 23.04.2009 fiat wants majority stake in opel , says workers ' council großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fiat-opel fusion could lead to huge job cuts , analysts say italian car manufacturer fiat is bidding to take over germany 's opel , the head of the opel workers ' council , klaus franz , has said .
but there are fears over what that could mean for opel ’ s german workers . franz confirmed thursday reports that said fiat was ready to sign a declaration of intent on a takeover as early as next tuesday .
however he claimed fiat had no interest in a strategic partnership with opel .
he said an alliance with fiat would lead to massive job cuts at opel and the closure of german factories after bundestag elections in september .
opel has around 25,000 workers .
franz also said fiat , which has 14.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 18.4 billion -rrb- of debt sitting over its head , had no way of finding the 500 million euros in fresh capital gm is seeking from a suitor .
" fiat has … huge liquidity problems .
they ca n't get hold of money at the moment , " franz said .
" the government ca n't give guarantees for such a transparent plan . "
on thursday , fiat posted a first-quarter loss of 411 million euros and ruled out any direct investment as part of a potential deal for a strategic partnership with us peer chrysler .
" no agreements " roland koch , the premier of the german state of hesse , where opel has its headquarters , confirmed that fiat was involved in discussions over a potential takeover .
he said that canadian car parts maker magna was also interested in a stake , but that no agreements have been reached yet .
german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg also said no decision had been taken on fiat 's role in any takeover .
" the federal government is holding talks with various interested parties , without any predetermination , " guttenberg said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg says opel 's future is still under discussion the online version of us daily wall street journal reported that fiat chief executive sergio marchionne had held talks with guttenberg in berlin last week .
job cuts certain christoph stuermer , an auto industry expert at think tank ihs global insight , said opel 's manufacturing and technological aspects would be of little interest to fiat .
" on top of having a 100 percent overlapping product portfolio , fiat and opel also have a very much overlapping regional footprint … so i think that mr franz is being very polite .
i think that the long-term strategy of fiat is really to keep the market share and get rid of all the rest of opel . "
stuermer also said that fiat would most likely not be able to go it alone in its bid for control of opel .
" i think that fiat at the moment does not have the free cash lying around to just come up with the money .
they would certainly have to team up either with one of the other interested parties in investing in opel or with one of their own long-term partners from the agnelli family or wider italy . "
spokespeople from fiat and opel were unavailable for comment on thursday on the potential takeover .
two sides of the coin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel workers fear german production lines could be terminated pierluigi bellini , associate director of ihs 's automotive division in milan , agreed that a fiat-opel fusion would spell the end for thousands of german workers .
" fiat and opel have obvious synergies here , scales of economy , " he said .
" but the other side of the coin is that work forces would need to be cut , both in germany and italy , and i do n't know if that is feasible now .
especially in germany , where you have an election year , and in italy the situation is already pretty bad for italian plants . "
despite all the potential points of synergy , fiat faces an uphill battle to convince opel 's management and the industry at large that it has the capacity to take control of the german carmaker .

" we will not participate in the election of a president , or in parliamentary sessions that will discuss it , " said mihai gimpu , leader of the opposition liberal party of moldova -lrb- lpm -rrb- .
disputed national elections earlier this month gave the ruling communists 60 seats in moldova 's 101-seat legislature , prompting violent clashes in the capital , chisinau .
opposition demonstrators accused the communists of voter fraud and battled with police on april 7 , leaving one dead , hundreds injured , and the parliament building ransacked and partially burned .
according to the constitution , moldova 's next president must be voted into office by the new parliament , by a 61 member majority .
however , three opposition parties , including the lpm , control 41 seats in moldova 's legislature , according to a vote recount completed by the central election commission on wednesday - creating a potential deadlock .
opposition aiming to block presidential selection moldova 's supreme court on thursday afternoon set a limit on the time allowed for the legislature to select a president , ruling that parliament must choose a new chief executive by july 7 .

if it fails to agree on a president by that date , the parliament must be dissolved and new elections would have to be held , the court said , setting the rival factions on a possible collision course once again .
independent observers including monitors from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- ruled moldova 's april 5 elections were generally free and fair .
moldovan president vladimir voronin , head of the communist party , took the country 's top office in 2001 and has held it ever since .
but as he is prevented by constitutional statute from continuing in office , a new president must be chosen .
concerned eu discuss sending mission to moldova meanwhile , european union external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner has backed the idea of sending an eu mission to moldova .
" personally i 'm in favor of such a mission , that 's absolutely clear .
now we have to work out the terms of reference of such a mission , " she told a press conference in brussels .
the idea of an investigative mission , including representatives from the european commission and the moldovan opposition was first mooted wednesday by czech president mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
topolanek made the suggestion during a visit to moldova where he met communist president vladimir voronin and opposition figures , saying it would help shed light on recent events and help restore calm .
the mission proposal will be put to a meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg on monday . nda / mll , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

organizers of the meeting , chaired by ban and the african union , had said more than $ 250 million was needed to improve security in a state which has had no central government since former president mohamed siad barre was ousted in 1991 , setting off a bloody cycle of clashes between rival factions .
eu officials said the aim was to build up a police force of some 10,000 officers and a security force of 5,000 .
support is also sought for the 4,300-strong african union mission amisom .
the amisom force - the only security presence backing the government - is well short of the 8,000 soldiers initially planned and is regularly attacked by the islamist shebab militia .
" restoring security and stability in somalia is vital to the success of the reconciliation effort and the survival of the unity government , " ban told the conference , held under the auspices of the united nations .
" much remains to be done . "
ban reiterated he had no intention of sending a un force to somalia any time soon , saying that the united nations should take a cautious and incremental approach to sending its own peacekeeping mission , and only " when the security conditions are appropriate . "
target likely to be exceeded after delegates underlined the challenges facing the war-torn country , organizers said donors had promised funding which was likely to exceed their initial expectations .
" we are on target , we are even a little bit higher because the target was $ 250 million , " said eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel .
" it seems that we are also above 250 million if you take into account material aid . "
" it 's really a full success , " he added to reporters after the four-hour conference in brussels .
the european commission , whose president jose manuel barroso also attended , had announced it would pledge at least 60 million euros on the eve of the meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamists have battled numerous governments president ahmed , who took office in january , made a personal plea for funds at the conference .
" solving this problem will require a radical solution , " said ahmed .
" the restoration of security and peace in somalia is the basis of any solution to the problems , " he said .
islamist fighters including the hard-line shebab militia have waged battles against the transitional government , its predecessor cabinet and their allies , vowing to fight until all foreign forces withdraw and sharia law is imposed .
more than one million people have fled their homes .
fewer than one in three somalis , whose life expectancy is 46 years , have access to clean water .
general instability and lawlessness while the conference was not focused on piracy , the high media profile of the growing number of cases of daring raids on freighters on the seas of the gulf of aden has become synonymous with somalia 's woes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international anti-piracy efforts face a tough mission " piracy is not a water-borne disease .
it is a symptom of anarchy and insecurity on the ground , " ban said .
" dealing with it requires an integrated strategy that addresses the fundamental issue of lawlessness in somalia . "
despite international naval missions - including from nato and the european union - piracy has mushroomed over the last year , as ransom-hunting somalis tackle ever-bigger and more distant prizes .
more than 130 merchant ships were attacked in the region last year , an increase of more than 200 percent on 2007 , the international maritime bureau said .
a tenfold increase was noted in the first three months of 2009 .
" if we only treat the symptoms , piracy at sea , but not its root causes - the decay of the state and poverty - we will fail , " barroso said .
non-governmental organization oxfam said the conference was being held at a critical moment for 3.2 million somalis desperately in need of aid , more than a million of whom have fled their homes to avoid fighting in the last two years .
" the piracy issue that has grabbed international headlines is a symptom of deeper issues that have gone unaddressed ever since the collapse of the national government in 1991 , " oxfam 's robert maletta said in a statement .
ahmed underlined : " it is our duty to pursue these criminals not only on the high seas but also on terra firma . "

organizers of the meeting , chaired by ban and the african union , had said more than $ 250 million was needed to improve security in a state which has had no central government since former president mohamed siad barre was ousted in 1991 , setting off a bloody cycle of clashes between rival factions .
eu officials said the aim was to build up a police force of some 10,000 officers and a security force of 5,000 .
support is also sought for the 4,300-strong african union mission amisom .
the amisom force - the only security presence backing the government - is well short of the 8,000 soldiers initially planned and is regularly attacked by the islamist shebab militia .
" restoring security and stability in somalia is vital to the success of the reconciliation effort and the survival of the unity government , " ban told the conference , held under the auspices of the united nations .
" much remains to be done . "
ban reiterated he had no intention of sending a un force to somalia any time soon , saying that the united nations should take a cautious and incremental approach to sending its own peacekeeping mission , and only " when the security conditions are appropriate . "

the subject of piracy threatened to dominate proceedings . as international donors gathered at a conference to help bring stability to somalia , it seemed rampant piracy in busy shipping lanes off the somali coast - a subject that has topped international news bulletins for months - was likely to dominate the talks .
the one-day conference in brussels aims to raise at least 128 million euros -lrb- $ 166 million -rrb- to finance african peacekeepers and support somalia 's fledgling police and security forces .
but european commission president jose manuel barrosso said ahead of the talks that he was worried that the piracy problem might divert resources in the lawless nation .
piracy a ' symptom ' , ban says " if we only treat the symptoms , piracy at sea , but not its root causes - the decay of the state and poverty - we will fail , " barroso said ahead of the meeting .
for his part , ban said international funding for somalia 's new government and african union peacekeepers is vital to help stabilize the lawless nation , a prerequisite for stopping the persistent pirate attacks .
at a news conference , ban told reporteres that piracy is a symptom of anarchy and insecurity on the ground .
he said international help would enable the new government to establish authority and ensure reconstruction .
no plans for peace force ban reiterated that he had no intention of sending a un force to somalia any time soon , saying a peacekeeping operation would go only when " circumstances and conditions are appropriate . "
organisers of the meeting , which is being chaired by the un and the african union , say more than $ 250 million is needed for next year to improve security in a state that has functioned without a central government since 1991 and is mired in conflict .
also due to attend was somali president sheikh sharif ahmed , a former islamist rebel leader elected in january at un-brokered talks and widely seen as the best hope for restoring stability . jen / pfd , ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" winterkorn said the two companies together " have the stuff to develop the powerhouse of the international automobile industry , " but did not provide any further details . his remarks came as the financial times newspaper reported that porsche se , the luxury brand 's holding company , was looking to sell its manufacturing arm to vw in exchange for cash and shares . further reports from bloomberg news agency quoted unnamed sources as saying the deal would help porsche se raise the funds it needs to continue its push to gain full control of vw , which , as europe 's biggest carmaker , has a turnover roughly 15 times larger than porsche 's . porsche se already owns 51 percent of vw , but analysts say the 9 billion euros of debt it has accumulated buying shares so far is making it difficult for porsche to acquire its target stake of 75 percent . the stuttgart-based sports carmaker recently renewed a credit line worth 10 billion euros , but tighter lending conditions caused by the global financial crisis left its managers short of the 12.5 billion they had initially sought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : works council president uwe hueck says porsche is in a strong financial position representatives of both vw and porsche se declined to comment on the media reports . however , the president of porsche 's works council , uwe hueck , criticized the media for suggesting the company was in financial difficulty and that vw was considering the stake . " i 'm angry that particular persons in the media are spreading ideas that have n't been discussed by the supervisory board , " hueck said in a written statement . he said that the reports were irresponsible and threatened to spread fear among porsche workers . " the jobs at our company are secure , " hueck said , adding that porsche remained financially sound and profitable despite difficulties linked to the global economic downturn . meanwhile , ahead of thursday 's shareholder meeting , vw reported what it described as " extremely weak " results for the first three months of this year with earnings slumping over the last three-quarters . the wolfsburg-based company 's net profit tumbled to 243 million euros in the first quarter of 2009 - down 74 percent from the same period last year . sje / nrt , afp / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the information , the most extensive of its kind to date , will be analyzed by manufacturers who hope eventually to adapt clothing measurements to suit the new german figure .

he does n't expect dramatic changes because of the findings but he says it is sure to influence the way some stores mark and manufacture their sizes in future . “ now that we know exactly what the proportions are in the population of germany , we can check the decisions we already made .
i do n't think it will be a revolution in labeling but we will fine tune it , ” he says .
more than 13,000 people between the ages of eight and 86 took part in the survey , which will also be used to benefit furniture design , car interiors - including the length of seat belts - and even operating tables .
this was the first such survey of women in 15 years and the first for men in almost three decades .
tangible effects will take some time to implement .
sizegermany 's project manager dr. rainer trieb says it will be several months at least before the findings can be incorporated into new designs .

a foreseeable side-effect of better-fitting clothing is that people buy more .
the findings have also raised the question of how shops choose to depict clothes sizes .
it is often the case that if people feel they fit into a smaller size that they are more inclined to make a purchase .
for rasch there is still a long way to go before there is any real parity in clothes sizing and even longer before retailers across europe agree on a unified system .

retailers across europe have just started again with the discussion about size zero .
they have been discussing this for years and it will take another three years to harmonize , ” says rasch .
it also remains up to the individual brands to what extent they follow sizing guidelines .
luxury brands tailor clothes for a different demographic than high street stores , for example .
“ the decision of how to name a piece of clothing is a very individual and a very political decision which is very closely linked with marketing and image and all the things that make up a brand , ” rasch says .
the information from this survey will also form part of an ongoing research project of interest to the participating companies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 23.04.2009 germans get taller - and wider großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the first mass measuring in germany to use high-resolution laser scanning technology a survey supported by clothes and car manufacturers has shown that women have grown on average at least 4 cm around the hips while the average man has gone up by two chest sizes . using the latest in 3d scanner technology , human solutions and the textile research institute hohenstein took 70 separate measurements in sitting and standing positions .
the information , the most extensive of its kind to date , will be analyzed by manufacturers who hope eventually to adapt clothing measurements to suit the new german figure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : textile scientists are collaborating with electronics specialists who measure bodies with lasers thomas rasch is the director of germanfashion , an organization that represents the german clothing industry .
he does n't expect dramatic changes because of the findings but he says it is sure to influence the way some stores mark and manufacture their sizes in future . “ now that we know exactly what the proportions are in the population of germany , we can check the decisions we already made .
i do n't think it will be a revolution in labeling but we will fine tune it , ” he says .
more than 13,000 people between the ages of eight and 86 took part in the survey , which will also be used to benefit furniture design , car interiors - including the length of seat belts - and even operating tables .
this was the first such survey of women in 15 years and the first for men in almost three decades .
tangible effects will take some time to implement .
sizegermany 's project manager dr. rainer trieb says it will be several months at least before the findings can be incorporated into new designs .
“ information will be integrated into new products for the coming seasons on a step by step basis .
maybe these results will be completely integrated in the next two or three years , ” he says .
if the shoe fits interest from the clothing sector is not completely altruistic .
a foreseeable side-effect of better-fitting clothing is that people buy more .
the findings have also raised the question of how shops choose to depict clothes sizes .
it is often the case that if people feel they fit into a smaller size that they are more inclined to make a purchase .
for rasch there is still a long way to go before there is any real parity in clothes sizing and even longer before retailers across europe agree on a unified system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : because germans are getting bigger , fewer people fit into standard clothing sizes , set in the 1950s “ the one thing is the new data about the proportion of bodies and the other thing is the question of the future of the labeling of sizes .
retailers across europe have just started again with the discussion about size zero .
they have been discussing this for years and it will take another three years to harmonize , ” says rasch .
it also remains up to the individual brands to what extent they follow sizing guidelines .
luxury brands tailor clothes for a different demographic than high street stores , for example .
“ the decision of how to name a piece of clothing is a very individual and a very political decision which is very closely linked with marketing and image and all the things that make up a brand , ” rasch says .
the information from this survey will also form part of an ongoing research project of interest to the participating companies .
sizegermany has created an interactive portal where companies can access the data directly .
regular information from the federal statistics bureau will be included to allow companies to compare the data to changing demographics .
one final project is to combine recent body size information gathered from other european surveys .
one thing that has emerged from the statistics is that while germans are taller than they used to be - a fact linked to affluence , nutrition , and light - they have for the moment reached a growth cap .

the subject of piracy threatened to dominate proceedings . as international donors gathered at a conference to help bring stability to somalia , it seemed rampant piracy in busy shipping lanes off the somali coast - a subject that has topped international news bulletins for months - was likely to dominate the talks .
the one-day conference in brussels aims to raise at least 128 million euros -lrb- $ 166 million -rrb- to finance african peacekeepers and support somalia 's fledgling police and security forces .

piracy a ' symptom ' , ban says " if we only treat the symptoms , piracy at sea , but not its root causes - the decay of the state and poverty - we will fail , " barroso said ahead of the meeting .
for his part , ban said international funding for somalia 's new government and african union peacekeepers is vital to help stabilize the lawless nation , a prerequisite for stopping the persistent pirate attacks .

he said international help would enable the new government to establish authority and ensure reconstruction .
no plans for peace force ban reiterated that he had no intention of sending a un force to somalia any time soon , saying a peacekeeping operation would go only when " circumstances and conditions are appropriate . "

the subject of piracy threatened to dominate proceedings . as international donors gathered at a conference to help bring stability to somalia , it seemed rampant piracy in busy shipping lanes off the somali coast - a subject that has topped international news bulletins for months - was likely to dominate the talks .
the one-day conference in brussels aims to raise at least 128 million euros -lrb- $ 166 million -rrb- to finance african peacekeepers and support somalia 's fledgling police and security forces .
but european commission president jose manuel barrosso said ahead of the talks that he was worried that the piracy problem might divert resources in the lawless nation .
piracy a ' symptom ' , ban says " if we only treat the symptoms , piracy at sea , but not its root causes - the decay of the state and poverty - we will fail , " barroso said ahead of the meeting .
for his part , ban said international funding for somalia 's new government and african union peacekeepers is vital to help stabilize the lawless nation , a prerequisite for stopping the persistent pirate attacks .
at a news conference , ban told reporteres that piracy is a symptom of anarchy and insecurity on the ground .
he said international help would enable the new government to establish authority and ensure reconstruction .
no plans for peace force ban reiterated that he had no intention of sending a un force to somalia any time soon , saying a peacekeeping operation would go only when " circumstances and conditions are appropriate . "
organisers of the meeting , which is being chaired by the un and the african union , say more than $ 250 million is needed for next year to improve security in a state that has functioned without a central government since 1991 and is mired in conflict .

al-qaeda 's north african branch had claimed responsibility for the abductions . a german tourist who was taken hostage by islamists three months ago in mali was released wednesday evening , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in berlin .
the 77-year-old woman was one of four western tourists abducted on january 22 during a trip to niger and mali .
steinmeier said that the woman was in the care of mali government officials and that she was exhausted by the ordeal and hardship of three months in captivity .
steinmeier also thanked mali president amadou toumani toure , who had cooperated closely with berlin to end the abduction .
a spokesperson for the mali government said that that two canadian un diplomats and a woman from switzerland have also been released .

their forecast is even gloomier than the imf 's prediction for 2009 . germany 's leading economic institutes are predicting the worst economic decline since the country was founded in 1949 . in their annual spring report , they say the country 's economy will shrink by 6.0 percent this year .
the world 's top exporter is not likely to see an improvement any time soon , either . the institutes predict that the recession will continue into 2010 , with the economy contracting by 0.5 percent next year . the economic experts also say unemployment will rise to just under five million jobless by the end of next year . " on the basis of leading indicators , the institutes expect that the downward trend to continue and do not believe it will bottom out before the middle of 2010 , " the widely-watched report states . the institutes publish their outlook twice a year . the spring report 2009 comes a day after the latest projections by the international monetary fund , imf , which said the german economy was likely to contract by 5.6 percent , pushing unemployment rates up .
with global trade shrinking and the world economy gripped by recession , the international monetary fund has slashed its 2009 growth forecast for the entire 16-member euro zone by another one to 4.2 percent .
dire predictions but while their prognosis for germany looked especially bad , the imf said germany 's government still had more room to maneuver because of sound fiscal policies in the past , and should be spending extra public funds to make up for the massive decline in exports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck and guttenberg have their work cut out for them " could they do more ?
the answer is yes , " imf economist jorg decressin said .
" this is a case where a country has done its homework during the good times ... and can take advantage of this during the bad times . "
as the world 's leading export nation , germany now appears to be bearing the brunt of the global recession , with the imf saying unemployment could climb to 10.8 percent in 2010 from 9 percent this year .
germany 's jobless rate was 7.3 percent last year .
“ i think we were all agreed around the table that we have a very difficult year ahead of us , " said german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg at a news conference on wednesday following an economic summit with chancellor angela merkel and leaders from industry and unions . finance minister peer steinbrueck told reporters there had been a slump of 3.3 percent in the first three months of the year .
labor market crisis the imf 's latest world economic outlook underscores the risks that the economic crisis is rapidly turning into a labor market crisis , with euro-zone unemployment set to rise this year to 10.1 percent before edging up to 11.5 percent in 2010 .
this is despite the massive stimulus packages introduced by european governments and the number of companies across europe placing employees on short-term working contracts rather than laying them off .
the euro-zone jobless rate stood at 7.6 percent in 2008 .
" the euro area is coming out of this crisis somewhat later than the us because to some extent the policy stimulus kicked in later , " decressin told reporters in washington .
but it is a picture repeated across europe , with the imf saying france faces a 3 percent fall in growth in 2009 and a meagre 0.4 percent pickup next year , while italian gdp should sink by 4.4 percent this year .
britain , which has been battling with falling consumer demand , a housing market collapse and a drawing in of its key financial sector , is expected to stage only a modest recovery after this year 's 4.1 percent contraction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : recession leaves germans little to celebrate on labor day spring employment boost fails to materialize germany warned of unrest as french protesters turn violent germany slashes growth forecast ' kidnap the boss , ' says german left-wing politician economy -pipe- 23.04.2009 economic institutes see hard times ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finance minister is on the front line of efforts to reverse germany 's worsening downturn leading german economic institutes say europe 's largest economy is caught up in the maelstrom of a global recession .
their forecast is even gloomier than the imf 's prediction for 2009 . germany 's leading economic institutes are predicting the worst economic decline since the country was founded in 1949 . in their annual spring report , they say the country 's economy will shrink by 6.0 percent this year .
the world 's top exporter is not likely to see an improvement any time soon , either . the institutes predict that the recession will continue into 2010 , with the economy contracting by 0.5 percent next year . the economic experts also say unemployment will rise to just under five million jobless by the end of next year . " on the basis of leading indicators , the institutes expect that the downward trend to continue and do not believe it will bottom out before the middle of 2010 , " the widely-watched report states . the institutes publish their outlook twice a year . the spring report 2009 comes a day after the latest projections by the international monetary fund , imf , which said the german economy was likely to contract by 5.6 percent , pushing unemployment rates up .
with global trade shrinking and the world economy gripped by recession , the international monetary fund has slashed its 2009 growth forecast for the entire 16-member euro zone by another one to 4.2 percent .
dire predictions but while their prognosis for germany looked especially bad , the imf said germany 's government still had more room to maneuver because of sound fiscal policies in the past , and should be spending extra public funds to make up for the massive decline in exports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck and guttenberg have their work cut out for them " could they do more ?
the answer is yes , " imf economist jorg decressin said .
" this is a case where a country has done its homework during the good times ... and can take advantage of this during the bad times . "
as the world 's leading export nation , germany now appears to be bearing the brunt of the global recession , with the imf saying unemployment could climb to 10.8 percent in 2010 from 9 percent this year .
germany 's jobless rate was 7.3 percent last year .
“ i think we were all agreed around the table that we have a very difficult year ahead of us , " said german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg at a news conference on wednesday following an economic summit with chancellor angela merkel and leaders from industry and unions . finance minister peer steinbrueck told reporters there had been a slump of 3.3 percent in the first three months of the year .
labor market crisis the imf 's latest world economic outlook underscores the risks that the economic crisis is rapidly turning into a labor market crisis , with euro-zone unemployment set to rise this year to 10.1 percent before edging up to 11.5 percent in 2010 .
this is despite the massive stimulus packages introduced by european governments and the number of companies across europe placing employees on short-term working contracts rather than laying them off .
the euro-zone jobless rate stood at 7.6 percent in 2008 .
" the euro area is coming out of this crisis somewhat later than the us because to some extent the policy stimulus kicked in later , " decressin told reporters in washington .
but it is a picture repeated across europe , with the imf saying france faces a 3 percent fall in growth in 2009 and a meagre 0.4 percent pickup next year , while italian gdp should sink by 4.4 percent this year .
britain , which has been battling with falling consumer demand , a housing market collapse and a drawing in of its key financial sector , is expected to stage only a modest recovery after this year 's 4.1 percent contraction .
the imf predicts british unemployment will jump from 7.4 percent in 2009 to 9.2 percent next year .
ireland has been particularly badly hit by the world recession and the credit crunch , and the imf predicts that irish economic growth will fall by a disastrous 8 percent this year and by 3 percent in 2010 after a collapse in the nation 's construction boom . db / pfd , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their forecast is even gloomier than the imf 's prediction for 2009 . germany 's leading economic institutes are predicting the worst economic decline since the country was founded in 1949 . in their annual spring report , they say the country 's economy will shrink by 6.0 percent this year .
the world 's top exporter is not likely to see an improvement any time soon , either . the institutes predict that the recession will continue into 2010 , with the economy contracting by 0.5 percent next year . the economic experts also say unemployment will rise to just under five million jobless by the end of next year . " on the basis of leading indicators , the institutes expect that the downward trend to continue and do not believe it will bottom out before the middle of 2010 , " the widely-watched report states . the institutes publish their outlook twice a year . the spring report 2009 comes a day after the latest projections by the international monetary fund , imf , which said the german economy was likely to contract by 5.6 percent , pushing unemployment rates up .
with global trade shrinking and the world economy gripped by recession , the international monetary fund has slashed its 2009 growth forecast for the entire 16-member euro zone by another one to 4.2 percent .
dire predictions but while their prognosis for germany looked especially bad , the imf said germany 's government still had more room to maneuver because of sound fiscal policies in the past , and should be spending extra public funds to make up for the massive decline in exports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck and guttenberg have their work cut out for them " could they do more ?
the answer is yes , " imf economist jorg decressin said .
" this is a case where a country has done its homework during the good times ... and can take advantage of this during the bad times . "
as the world 's leading export nation , germany now appears to be bearing the brunt of the global recession , with the imf saying unemployment could climb to 10.8 percent in 2010 from 9 percent this year .
germany 's jobless rate was 7.3 percent last year .
“ i think we were all agreed around the table that we have a very difficult year ahead of us , " said german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg at a news conference on wednesday following an economic summit with chancellor angela merkel and leaders from industry and unions . finance minister peer steinbrueck told reporters there had been a slump of 3.3 percent in the first three months of the year .
labor market crisis the imf 's latest world economic outlook underscores the risks that the economic crisis is rapidly turning into a labor market crisis , with euro-zone unemployment set to rise this year to 10.1 percent before edging up to 11.5 percent in 2010 .
this is despite the massive stimulus packages introduced by european governments and the number of companies across europe placing employees on short-term working contracts rather than laying them off .
the euro-zone jobless rate stood at 7.6 percent in 2008 .
" the euro area is coming out of this crisis somewhat later than the us because to some extent the policy stimulus kicked in later , " decressin told reporters in washington .
but it is a picture repeated across europe , with the imf saying france faces a 3 percent fall in growth in 2009 and a meagre 0.4 percent pickup next year , while italian gdp should sink by 4.4 percent this year .
britain , which has been battling with falling consumer demand , a housing market collapse and a drawing in of its key financial sector , is expected to stage only a modest recovery after this year 's 4.1 percent contraction .
the imf predicts british unemployment will jump from 7.4 percent in 2009 to 9.2 percent next year .
ireland has been particularly badly hit by the world recession and the credit crunch , and the imf predicts that irish economic growth will fall by a disastrous 8 percent this year and by 3 percent in 2010 after a collapse in the nation 's construction boom . db / pfd , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier says a german woman held in mali has been freed , along with three other hostages .
al-qaeda 's north african branch had claimed responsibility for the abductions . a german tourist who was taken hostage by islamists three months ago in mali was released wednesday evening , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in berlin .
the 77-year-old woman was one of four western tourists abducted on january 22 during a trip to niger and mali .
steinmeier said that the woman was in the care of mali government officials and that she was exhausted by the ordeal and hardship of three months in captivity .
steinmeier also thanked mali president amadou toumani toure , who had cooperated closely with berlin to end the abduction .
a spokesperson for the mali government said that that two canadian un diplomats and a woman from switzerland have also been released .
a group calling itself the north african branch of al-qaeda had claimed responsibility for the abductions demanding its members to be freed from detention in mali and other countries .
analysts say the sahara desert in west africa has become increasingly insecure for tourists with islamist groups seeking to spread their influence south from algeria .
malian officials initially blamed tuareg rebels for the january abduction saying that al-qaeda hires the nomadic rebels and other armed groups to carry out kidnappings . ai / ca , dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i do n't think it will be a revolution in labeling but we will fine tune it , ” he says .
more than 13,000 people between the ages of eight and 86 took part in the survey , which will also be used to benefit furniture design , car interiors - including the length of seat belts - and even operating tables .
this was the first such survey of women in 15 years and the first for men in almost three decades .

retailers across europe have just started again with the discussion about size zero .
they have been discussing this for years and it will take another three years to harmonize , ” says rasch .
it also remains up to the individual brands to what extent they follow sizing guidelines .
luxury brands tailor clothes for a different demographic than high street stores , for example .
“ the decision of how to name a piece of clothing is a very individual and a very political decision which is very closely linked with marketing and image and all the things that make up a brand , ” rasch says .
the information from this survey will also form part of an ongoing research project of interest to the participating companies .
sizegermany has created an interactive portal where companies can access the data directly .
regular information from the federal statistics bureau will be included to allow companies to compare the data to changing demographics .
one final project is to combine recent body size information gathered from other european surveys .
one thing that has emerged from the statistics is that while germans are taller than they used to be - a fact linked to affluence , nutrition , and light - they have for the moment reached a growth cap .
the german waist though is still expanding .

but there are fears over what that could mean for opel ’ s german workers . franz confirmed thursday reports that said fiat was ready to sign a declaration of intent on a takeover as early as next tuesday .
however he claimed fiat had no interest in a strategic partnership with opel .
he said an alliance with fiat would lead to massive job cuts at opel and the closure of german factories after bundestag elections in september .
opel has around 25,000 workers .
franz also said fiat , which has 14.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 18.4 billion -rrb- of debt sitting over its head , had no way of finding the 500 million euros in fresh capital gm is seeking from a suitor .
" fiat has … huge liquidity problems .
they ca n't get hold of money at the moment , " franz said .
" the government ca n't give guarantees for such a transparent plan . "
on thursday , fiat posted a first-quarter loss of 411 million euros and ruled out any direct investment as part of a potential deal for a strategic partnership with us peer chrysler .
" no agreements " roland koch , the premier of the german state of hesse , where opel has its headquarters , confirmed that fiat was involved in discussions over a potential takeover .
he said that canadian car parts maker magna was also interested in a stake , but that no agreements have been reached yet .
german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg also said no decision had been taken on fiat 's role in any takeover .
" the federal government is holding talks with various interested parties , without any predetermination , " guttenberg said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg says opel 's future is still under discussion the online version of us daily wall street journal reported that fiat chief executive sergio marchionne had held talks with guttenberg in berlin last week .
job cuts certain christoph stuermer , an auto industry expert at think tank ihs global insight , said opel 's manufacturing and technological aspects would be of little interest to fiat .
" on top of having a 100 percent overlapping product portfolio , fiat and opel also have a very much overlapping regional footprint … so i think that mr franz is being very polite .

but there are fears over what that could mean for opel ’ s german workers . franz confirmed thursday reports that said fiat was ready to sign a declaration of intent on a takeover as early as next tuesday .
however he claimed fiat had no interest in a strategic partnership with opel .
he said an alliance with fiat would lead to massive job cuts at opel and the closure of german factories after bundestag elections in september .
opel has around 25,000 workers .
franz also said fiat , which has 14.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 18.4 billion -rrb- of debt sitting over its head , had no way of finding the 500 million euros in fresh capital gm is seeking from a suitor .

he said that canadian car parts maker magna was also interested in a stake , but that no agreements have been reached yet .
german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg also said no decision had been taken on fiat 's role in any takeover .

" what seat would be more appropriate than a land wounded by the earthquake ? "
berlusconi told a news conference in l 'aquila on thursday , after holding a cabinet meeting in the stricken town .
berlusconi said moving the meeting of the heads of government of the world 's richest countries , currently set to take place on la maddalena , a small island off sardinia , would be a " positive signal for the more than 60,000 people still living in temporary camps . "
" the 21 heads of government who come will be able to see first-hand the wounds caused by this earthquake , " berlusconi added .
" i think it could work out very well . "
berlusconi looking to divert funds to disaster zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi will need to consult with g8 leaders on the move the italian leader , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the g8 club of industrialized nations , added that the 220 million euros -lrb- $ 286.5 million -rrb- needed for summit security and infrastructure in sardinia could this way be invested in the earthquake region instead .
berlusconi acknowledged logistics and cost problems at the original venue on a sardinian island were putting the original plans in jeopardy .
however , the decision to move the conference to l 'aquila could render moot more than two years of planning for the event .
the decision to move the summit was dependent on approval from the other nations attending the summit scheduled for july 8-10 there have already been signs of dissent within berlusconi 's cabinet over moving the g8 summit , with at least one minister saying it was " implausible " and would be difficult to pull off .

" the 21 heads of government who come will be able to see first-hand the wounds caused by this earthquake , " berlusconi added .
" i think it could work out very well . "
berlusconi looking to divert funds to disaster zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi will need to consult with g8 leaders on the move the italian leader , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the g8 club of industrialized nations , added that the 220 million euros -lrb- $ 286.5 million -rrb- needed for summit security and infrastructure in sardinia could this way be invested in the earthquake region instead .
berlusconi acknowledged logistics and cost problems at the original venue on a sardinian island were putting the original plans in jeopardy .
however , the decision to move the conference to l 'aquila could render moot more than two years of planning for the event .
the decision to move the summit was dependent on approval from the other nations attending the summit scheduled for july 8-10 there have already been signs of dissent within berlusconi 's cabinet over moving the g8 summit , with at least one minister saying it was " implausible " and would be difficult to pull off .
cabinet increases aid to quake region the april 6 quake in the central region of abruzzo killed 296 people , flattened entire areas of some towns and made some 65,000 people homeless .
the cabinet earlier on thursday approved a decree raising up to 8 billion euros to rebuild the quake-hit areas and fund emergency services . nda / mll , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

organizers of the meeting , chaired by ban and the african union , had said more than $ 250 million was needed to improve security in a state which has had no central government since former president mohamed siad barre was ousted in 1991 , setting off a bloody cycle of clashes between rival factions .
eu officials said the aim was to build up a police force of some 10,000 officers and a security force of 5,000 .
support is also sought for the 4,300-strong african union mission amisom .
the amisom force - the only security presence backing the government - is well short of the 8,000 soldiers initially planned and is regularly attacked by the islamist shebab militia .
" restoring security and stability in somalia is vital to the success of the reconciliation effort and the survival of the unity government , " ban told the conference , held under the auspices of the united nations .
" much remains to be done . "
ban reiterated he had no intention of sending a un force to somalia any time soon , saying that the united nations should take a cautious and incremental approach to sending its own peacekeeping mission , and only " when the security conditions are appropriate . "
target likely to be exceeded after delegates underlined the challenges facing the war-torn country , organizers said donors had promised funding which was likely to exceed their initial expectations .
" we are on target , we are even a little bit higher because the target was $ 250 million , " said eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel .
" it seems that we are also above 250 million if you take into account material aid . "
" it 's really a full success , " he added to reporters after the four-hour conference in brussels .
the european commission , whose president jose manuel barroso also attended , had announced it would pledge at least 60 million euros on the eve of the meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamists have battled numerous governments president ahmed , who took office in january , made a personal plea for funds at the conference .
" solving this problem will require a radical solution , " said ahmed .
" the restoration of security and peace in somalia is the basis of any solution to the problems , " he said .
islamist fighters including the hard-line shebab militia have waged battles against the transitional government , its predecessor cabinet and their allies , vowing to fight until all foreign forces withdraw and sharia law is imposed .
more than one million people have fled their homes .
fewer than one in three somalis , whose life expectancy is 46 years , have access to clean water .
general instability and lawlessness while the conference was not focused on piracy , the high media profile of the growing number of cases of daring raids on freighters on the seas of the gulf of aden has become synonymous with somalia 's woes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international anti-piracy efforts face a tough mission " piracy is not a water-borne disease .
it is a symptom of anarchy and insecurity on the ground , " ban said .
" dealing with it requires an integrated strategy that addresses the fundamental issue of lawlessness in somalia . "
despite international naval missions - including from nato and the european union - piracy has mushroomed over the last year , as ransom-hunting somalis tackle ever-bigger and more distant prizes .
more than 130 merchant ships were attacked in the region last year , an increase of more than 200 percent on 2007 , the international maritime bureau said .
a tenfold increase was noted in the first three months of 2009 .
" if we only treat the symptoms , piracy at sea , but not its root causes - the decay of the state and poverty - we will fail , " barroso said .
non-governmental organization oxfam said the conference was being held at a critical moment for 3.2 million somalis desperately in need of aid , more than a million of whom have fled their homes to avoid fighting in the last two years .
" the piracy issue that has grabbed international headlines is a symptom of deeper issues that have gone unaddressed ever since the collapse of the national government in 1991 , " oxfam 's robert maletta said in a statement .
ahmed underlined : " it is our duty to pursue these criminals not only on the high seas but also on terra firma . "

" dealing with it requires an integrated strategy that addresses the fundamental issue of lawlessness in somalia . "
despite international naval missions - including from nato and the european union - piracy has mushroomed over the last year , as ransom-hunting somalis tackle ever-bigger and more distant prizes .
more than 130 merchant ships were attacked in the region last year , an increase of more than 200 percent on 2007 , the international maritime bureau said .
a tenfold increase was noted in the first three months of 2009 .
" if we only treat the symptoms , piracy at sea , but not its root causes - the decay of the state and poverty - we will fail , " barroso said .
non-governmental organization oxfam said the conference was being held at a critical moment for 3.2 million somalis desperately in need of aid , more than a million of whom have fled their homes to avoid fighting in the last two years .
" the piracy issue that has grabbed international headlines is a symptom of deeper issues that have gone unaddressed ever since the collapse of the national government in 1991 , " oxfam 's robert maletta said in a statement .
ahmed underlined : " it is our duty to pursue these criminals not only on the high seas but also on terra firma . "
piracy on the increase despite international force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's mission off the coast of somalia is in question piracy has worsened off somalia 's coast despite the presence of naval forces from more than a dozen countries , including task forces under nato , eu and us command .
nato 's four-ship mission was due to wind up its operation on thursday .
diplomats were discussing whether it could be extended and nato has said it wants tougher rules to allow the detention of captured suspects .
the united states , which is reviewing its somalia policy , plans to help build somali security forces and bolster the new government but has made clear it has no desire to " drive " the whole process . nda / mll , afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 23.04.2009 turkey and armenia agree on reconciliation roadmap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish president abdullah gul , left , and armenian president serzh sargsyan met in 2008 turkey and armenia have reached an agreement on a comprehensive framework to normalize relations .
deutsche welle correspondent dorian jones reports that the process carries some risk for the turkish government . the turkish minister for eu affairs , egemen bagis , said thursday the process , which is taking place under swiss supervision , aimed to bring about a fundamental change in bilateral relations between the two countries .
" better relations , more neighborly relations , more trade , more opportunities and cooperation and peace - i see a light at the end of the tunnel , that peace is possible , " he said .
a senior western diplomat , who spoke on condition of anonymity , told reuters news agency that the deal had not yet been signed but that turkey and armenia had agreed on diplomatic ties , opening the border and establishing commissions to address historical disputes .
" all the documents have been agreed in principle but it 's from the signing that the clock starts ticking , " the diplomat said .
" it is a finite period that is not very long .
we are talking about weeks or months . "
old wounds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some armenian groups have long opposed reconciliation with turkey in armenia , several thousand protesters , mainly supporters of a nationalist junior partner in the government , burned turkish flags and condemned the efforts at normalizing relations .
at the heart of ongoing tensions between the countries are accusations by armenia that turkey was directly responsible for what it calls the genocide of 1.5 million armenians in 1915 during world war i , a charge strongly denied by ankara turkey officially admits that as many as 600,000 armenians died during the war and deportation from eastern anatolia , but it insists the deaths must be seen in the context of an armenian uprising at a time when armenians were siding with invading russian troops earlier this week , ankara recalled its ambassador from canada after the canadian prime minister supported the genocide charge .
eyes on obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama looks likely to ease pressure on turkey after the talks with armenia ankara now fears us president barack obama will do the same .
during his presidential campaign obama said he would recognize the genocide if elected .
but yasemin congar , deputy editor of the turkish daily taraf , said obama may now hold back as a result of the new rapprochement efforts .
" washington wants to see turkey open its border with armenia , " she said .
" they want to see ankara and yerevan normalize diplomatic relations and there is a movement to that end .
" i think obama wants to give the message to ankara that if this process goes on it might even stop him from saying the ' g ' word , the genocide word in washington . "
during his visit to turkey earlier this month obama avoided using the so-called " g " word .
instead he praised the turkish and armenian rapprochement efforts .
eve of remembrance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflict between armenia and azerbaijan over nagorno-karabahk displaced hundreds of thousands the timing of turkey 's announcement of its agreement with armenia is being seen as no coincidence .
it comes just one day before armenians around the world remember those killed in 1915 .
traditionally , us presidents deliver a speech to mark the event .
us-based armenian groups have been lobbying obama intensively to use his expected speech to recognize the genocide .
that is now seen as unlikely in light of the new rapprochement efforts .
obama is also aware that a reference to genocide would seriously damage us-turkey relations .
the turkish government is paying a heavy domestic political price for its rapprochement efforts , since turkey 's close relationship to armenia 's rival , azerbaijan , is seen to be at risk .
sixteen years ago , armenia occupied nearly 20 percent of azerbaijan following a war over the disputed enclave of nagorno-karabakh . turkey imposed a trade embargo against armenia in support of its ally .
" all turkish press , all political opposition , is using the azerbaijani issue against the government .
i think the government finds itself in a very difficult position , " said political scientist nuray mert .
such pressure is already having an effect , with the turkish prime minister now linking the ending of the embargo to the withdrawal of armenian forces from azerbaijan .
that is seen as unlikely anytime soon .
turkish news reports have said azerbaijan is disturbed by the reconciliation efforts , which could lead to the reopening of the turkish-armenian border .
but with ankara facing increasing pressure from both the us and the eu to end the embargo , the turkish government now finds itself between a rock and a hard place .

deutsche welle correspondent dorian jones reports that the process carries some risk for the turkish government . the turkish minister for eu affairs , egemen bagis , said thursday the process , which is taking place under swiss supervision , aimed to bring about a fundamental change in bilateral relations between the two countries .
" better relations , more neighborly relations , more trade , more opportunities and cooperation and peace - i see a light at the end of the tunnel , that peace is possible , " he said .
a senior western diplomat , who spoke on condition of anonymity , told reuters news agency that the deal had not yet been signed but that turkey and armenia had agreed on diplomatic ties , opening the border and establishing commissions to address historical disputes .
" all the documents have been agreed in principle but it 's from the signing that the clock starts ticking , " the diplomat said .
" it is a finite period that is not very long .
we are talking about weeks or months . "
old wounds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some armenian groups have long opposed reconciliation with turkey in armenia , several thousand protesters , mainly supporters of a nationalist junior partner in the government , burned turkish flags and condemned the efforts at normalizing relations .
at the heart of ongoing tensions between the countries are accusations by armenia that turkey was directly responsible for what it calls the genocide of 1.5 million armenians in 1915 during world war i , a charge strongly denied by ankara turkey officially admits that as many as 600,000 armenians died during the war and deportation from eastern anatolia , but it insists the deaths must be seen in the context of an armenian uprising at a time when armenians were siding with invading russian troops earlier this week , ankara recalled its ambassador from canada after the canadian prime minister supported the genocide charge .
eyes on obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama looks likely to ease pressure on turkey after the talks with armenia ankara now fears us president barack obama will do the same .
during his presidential campaign obama said he would recognize the genocide if elected .
but yasemin congar , deputy editor of the turkish daily taraf , said obama may now hold back as a result of the new rapprochement efforts .
" washington wants to see turkey open its border with armenia , " she said .
" they want to see ankara and yerevan normalize diplomatic relations and there is a movement to that end .
" i think obama wants to give the message to ankara that if this process goes on it might even stop him from saying the ' g ' word , the genocide word in washington . "
during his visit to turkey earlier this month obama avoided using the so-called " g " word .
instead he praised the turkish and armenian rapprochement efforts .
eve of remembrance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflict between armenia and azerbaijan over nagorno-karabahk displaced hundreds of thousands the timing of turkey 's announcement of its agreement with armenia is being seen as no coincidence .
it comes just one day before armenians around the world remember those killed in 1915 .
traditionally , us presidents deliver a speech to mark the event .
us-based armenian groups have been lobbying obama intensively to use his expected speech to recognize the genocide .
that is now seen as unlikely in light of the new rapprochement efforts .
obama is also aware that a reference to genocide would seriously damage us-turkey relations .
the turkish government is paying a heavy domestic political price for its rapprochement efforts , since turkey 's close relationship to armenia 's rival , azerbaijan , is seen to be at risk .
sixteen years ago , armenia occupied nearly 20 percent of azerbaijan following a war over the disputed enclave of nagorno-karabakh . turkey imposed a trade embargo against armenia in support of its ally .
" all turkish press , all political opposition , is using the azerbaijani issue against the government .
i think the government finds itself in a very difficult position , " said political scientist nuray mert .
such pressure is already having an effect , with the turkish prime minister now linking the ending of the embargo to the withdrawal of armenian forces from azerbaijan .
that is seen as unlikely anytime soon .
turkish news reports have said azerbaijan is disturbed by the reconciliation efforts , which could lead to the reopening of the turkish-armenian border .
but with ankara facing increasing pressure from both the us and the eu to end the embargo , the turkish government now finds itself between a rock and a hard place .

the opposition parties free democrats , greens and the left voted in parliament to set up the commission , while the christian democrats and the social democrats who form the government coalition abstained .
committee under time pressure the committee will be comprised of lawmakers and its goal is to uncover whether poor crisis management on the part of the government has left the taxpayer carrying the burden , and what lessons can be learned from the situation .
hypo real estate bank is in the process of being nationalized .

organizers of the meeting , chaired by ban and the african union , had said more than $ 250 million was needed to improve security in a state which has had no central government since former president mohamed siad barre was ousted in 1991 , setting off a bloody cycle of clashes between rival factions .
eu officials said the aim was to build up a police force of some 10,000 officers and a security force of 5,000 .
support is also sought for the 4,300-strong african union mission amisom .
the amisom force - the only security presence backing the government - is well short of the 8,000 soldiers initially planned and is regularly attacked by the islamist shebab militia .
" restoring security and stability in somalia is vital to the success of the reconciliation effort and the survival of the unity government , " ban told the conference , held under the auspices of the united nations .
" much remains to be done . "
ban reiterated he had no intention of sending a un force to somalia any time soon , saying that the united nations should take a cautious and incremental approach to sending its own peacekeeping mission , and only " when the security conditions are appropriate . "
target likely to be exceeded after delegates underlined the challenges facing the war-torn country , organizers said donors had promised funding which was likely to exceed their initial expectations .
" we are on target , we are even a little bit higher because the target was $ 250 million , " said eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel .
" it seems that we are also above 250 million if you take into account material aid . "
" it 's really a full success , " he added to reporters after the four-hour conference in brussels .
the european commission , whose president jose manuel barroso also attended , had announced it would pledge at least 60 million euros on the eve of the meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamists have battled numerous governments president ahmed , who took office in january , made a personal plea for funds at the conference .
" solving this problem will require a radical solution , " said ahmed .
" the restoration of security and peace in somalia is the basis of any solution to the problems , " he said .
islamist fighters including the hard-line shebab militia have waged battles against the transitional government , its predecessor cabinet and their allies , vowing to fight until all foreign forces withdraw and sharia law is imposed .
more than one million people have fled their homes .
fewer than one in three somalis , whose life expectancy is 46 years , have access to clean water .
general instability and lawlessness while the conference was not focused on piracy , the high media profile of the growing number of cases of daring raids on freighters on the seas of the gulf of aden has become synonymous with somalia 's woes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international anti-piracy efforts face a tough mission " piracy is not a water-borne disease .
it is a symptom of anarchy and insecurity on the ground , " ban said .
" dealing with it requires an integrated strategy that addresses the fundamental issue of lawlessness in somalia . "
despite international naval missions - including from nato and the european union - piracy has mushroomed over the last year , as ransom-hunting somalis tackle ever-bigger and more distant prizes .
more than 130 merchant ships were attacked in the region last year , an increase of more than 200 percent on 2007 , the international maritime bureau said .
a tenfold increase was noted in the first three months of 2009 .
" if we only treat the symptoms , piracy at sea , but not its root causes - the decay of the state and poverty - we will fail , " barroso said .
non-governmental organization oxfam said the conference was being held at a critical moment for 3.2 million somalis desperately in need of aid , more than a million of whom have fled their homes to avoid fighting in the last two years .
" the piracy issue that has grabbed international headlines is a symptom of deeper issues that have gone unaddressed ever since the collapse of the national government in 1991 , " oxfam 's robert maletta said in a statement .
ahmed underlined : " it is our duty to pursue these criminals not only on the high seas but also on terra firma . "

" it is our hope that any car scrappage legislation ultimately enacted will remedy these concerns , and that the eu will be able to support this important initiative to promote fuel-efficiency , reduce pollution , and provide a needed boost to the automobile industry , " john bruton , the eu 's ambassador to the united states , said in a letter sent to the us congress on wednesday .
president barack obama supports passage of a " cash-for-clunkers " bill to pay people to turn in their gas guzzlers and replace them with more fuel-efficient vehicles .
but bruton said europe is worried that a leading version of the legislation , " as currently drafted , provides benefits only for replacement vehicles assembled in the u.s. or north america , a distinction that would harm car manufacturers from other parts of the world , including europe . "
such a provision , he added , would be " a clear violation " of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- rules requiring a country 's laws to treat foreign and domestic products equally .
possible compromise on north american provision europe 's fears and the concerns that the eu and us may bring their differences before the wto were partially allayed on thursday when got a boost after a leading proponent of the " cash-for-clunkers " bill , ohio congresswoman betty sutton , signaled she may drop a provision limiting the subsidies to purchases of north american made vehicles .
the provision has been a major sticking point in congressional efforts to merge competing proposals for the program , and sutton 's move brings those who are opposed to the north america requirement closer to a compromise with those who support it .
" it 's not so important to me that it has to be done " exactly according to her bill , but rather that a program is passed , sutton told reporters on capitol hill .

their forecast is even gloomier than the imf 's prediction for 2009 . germany 's leading economic institutes are predicting the worst economic decline since the country was founded in 1949 . in their annual spring report , they say the country 's economy will shrink by 6.0 percent this year .
the world 's top exporter is not likely to see an improvement any time soon , either . the institutes predict that the recession will continue into 2010 , with the economy contracting by 0.5 percent next year . the economic experts also say unemployment will rise to just under five million jobless by the end of next year . " on the basis of leading indicators , the institutes expect that the downward trend to continue and do not believe it will bottom out before the middle of 2010 , " the widely-watched report states . the institutes publish their outlook twice a year . the spring report 2009 comes a day after the latest projections by the international monetary fund , imf , which said the german economy was likely to contract by 5.6 percent , pushing unemployment rates up .
with global trade shrinking and the world economy gripped by recession , the international monetary fund has slashed its 2009 growth forecast for the entire 16-member euro zone by another one to 4.2 percent .
dire predictions but while their prognosis for germany looked especially bad , the imf said germany 's government still had more room to maneuver because of sound fiscal policies in the past , and should be spending extra public funds to make up for the massive decline in exports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck and guttenberg have their work cut out for them " could they do more ?
the answer is yes , " imf economist jorg decressin said .
" this is a case where a country has done its homework during the good times ... and can take advantage of this during the bad times . "
as the world 's leading export nation , germany now appears to be bearing the brunt of the global recession , with the imf saying unemployment could climb to 10.8 percent in 2010 from 9 percent this year .
germany 's jobless rate was 7.3 percent last year .
“ i think we were all agreed around the table that we have a very difficult year ahead of us , " said german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg at a news conference on wednesday following an economic summit with chancellor angela merkel and leaders from industry and unions . finance minister peer steinbrueck told reporters there had been a slump of 3.3 percent in the first three months of the year .
labor market crisis the imf 's latest world economic outlook underscores the risks that the economic crisis is rapidly turning into a labor market crisis , with euro-zone unemployment set to rise this year to 10.1 percent before edging up to 11.5 percent in 2010 .
this is despite the massive stimulus packages introduced by european governments and the number of companies across europe placing employees on short-term working contracts rather than laying them off .
the euro-zone jobless rate stood at 7.6 percent in 2008 .
" the euro area is coming out of this crisis somewhat later than the us because to some extent the policy stimulus kicked in later , " decressin told reporters in washington .
but it is a picture repeated across europe , with the imf saying france faces a 3 percent fall in growth in 2009 and a meagre 0.4 percent pickup next year , while italian gdp should sink by 4.4 percent this year .
britain , which has been battling with falling consumer demand , a housing market collapse and a drawing in of its key financial sector , is expected to stage only a modest recovery after this year 's 4.1 percent contraction .
the imf predicts british unemployment will jump from 7.4 percent in 2009 to 9.2 percent next year .
ireland has been particularly badly hit by the world recession and the credit crunch , and the imf predicts that irish economic growth will fall by a disastrous 8 percent this year and by 3 percent in 2010 after a collapse in the nation 's construction boom . db / pfd , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : recession leaves germans little to celebrate on labor day spring employment boost fails to materialize germany warned of unrest as french protesters turn violent germany slashes growth forecast ' kidnap the boss , ' says german left-wing politician economy -pipe- 23.04.2009 economic institutes see hard times ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finance minister is on the front line of efforts to reverse germany 's worsening downturn leading german economic institutes say europe 's largest economy is caught up in the maelstrom of a global recession .
their forecast is even gloomier than the imf 's prediction for 2009 . germany 's leading economic institutes are predicting the worst economic decline since the country was founded in 1949 . in their annual spring report , they say the country 's economy will shrink by 6.0 percent this year .
the world 's top exporter is not likely to see an improvement any time soon , either . the institutes predict that the recession will continue into 2010 , with the economy contracting by 0.5 percent next year . the economic experts also say unemployment will rise to just under five million jobless by the end of next year . " on the basis of leading indicators , the institutes expect that the downward trend to continue and do not believe it will bottom out before the middle of 2010 , " the widely-watched report states . the institutes publish their outlook twice a year . the spring report 2009 comes a day after the latest projections by the international monetary fund , imf , which said the german economy was likely to contract by 5.6 percent , pushing unemployment rates up .
with global trade shrinking and the world economy gripped by recession , the international monetary fund has slashed its 2009 growth forecast for the entire 16-member euro zone by another one to 4.2 percent .
dire predictions but while their prognosis for germany looked especially bad , the imf said germany 's government still had more room to maneuver because of sound fiscal policies in the past , and should be spending extra public funds to make up for the massive decline in exports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck and guttenberg have their work cut out for them " could they do more ?
the answer is yes , " imf economist jorg decressin said .
" this is a case where a country has done its homework during the good times ... and can take advantage of this during the bad times . "
as the world 's leading export nation , germany now appears to be bearing the brunt of the global recession , with the imf saying unemployment could climb to 10.8 percent in 2010 from 9 percent this year .
germany 's jobless rate was 7.3 percent last year .
“ i think we were all agreed around the table that we have a very difficult year ahead of us , " said german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg at a news conference on wednesday following an economic summit with chancellor angela merkel and leaders from industry and unions . finance minister peer steinbrueck told reporters there had been a slump of 3.3 percent in the first three months of the year .
labor market crisis the imf 's latest world economic outlook underscores the risks that the economic crisis is rapidly turning into a labor market crisis , with euro-zone unemployment set to rise this year to 10.1 percent before edging up to 11.5 percent in 2010 .
this is despite the massive stimulus packages introduced by european governments and the number of companies across europe placing employees on short-term working contracts rather than laying them off .
the euro-zone jobless rate stood at 7.6 percent in 2008 .
" the euro area is coming out of this crisis somewhat later than the us because to some extent the policy stimulus kicked in later , " decressin told reporters in washington .
but it is a picture repeated across europe , with the imf saying france faces a 3 percent fall in growth in 2009 and a meagre 0.4 percent pickup next year , while italian gdp should sink by 4.4 percent this year .

their forecast is even gloomier than the imf 's prediction for 2009 . germany 's leading economic institutes are predicting the worst economic decline since the country was founded in 1949 . in their annual spring report , they say the country 's economy will shrink by 6.0 percent this year .
the world 's top exporter is not likely to see an improvement any time soon , either . the institutes predict that the recession will continue into 2010 , with the economy contracting by 0.5 percent next year . the economic experts also say unemployment will rise to just under five million jobless by the end of next year . " on the basis of leading indicators , the institutes expect that the downward trend to continue and do not believe it will bottom out before the middle of 2010 , " the widely-watched report states . the institutes publish their outlook twice a year . the spring report 2009 comes a day after the latest projections by the international monetary fund , imf , which said the german economy was likely to contract by 5.6 percent , pushing unemployment rates up .
with global trade shrinking and the world economy gripped by recession , the international monetary fund has slashed its 2009 growth forecast for the entire 16-member euro zone by another one to 4.2 percent .
dire predictions but while their prognosis for germany looked especially bad , the imf said germany 's government still had more room to maneuver because of sound fiscal policies in the past , and should be spending extra public funds to make up for the massive decline in exports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck and guttenberg have their work cut out for them " could they do more ?
the answer is yes , " imf economist jorg decressin said .
" this is a case where a country has done its homework during the good times ... and can take advantage of this during the bad times . "
as the world 's leading export nation , germany now appears to be bearing the brunt of the global recession , with the imf saying unemployment could climb to 10.8 percent in 2010 from 9 percent this year .
germany 's jobless rate was 7.3 percent last year .
“ i think we were all agreed around the table that we have a very difficult year ahead of us , " said german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg at a news conference on wednesday following an economic summit with chancellor angela merkel and leaders from industry and unions . finance minister peer steinbrueck told reporters there had been a slump of 3.3 percent in the first three months of the year .
labor market crisis the imf 's latest world economic outlook underscores the risks that the economic crisis is rapidly turning into a labor market crisis , with euro-zone unemployment set to rise this year to 10.1 percent before edging up to 11.5 percent in 2010 .
this is despite the massive stimulus packages introduced by european governments and the number of companies across europe placing employees on short-term working contracts rather than laying them off .
the euro-zone jobless rate stood at 7.6 percent in 2008 .
" the euro area is coming out of this crisis somewhat later than the us because to some extent the policy stimulus kicked in later , " decressin told reporters in washington .
but it is a picture repeated across europe , with the imf saying france faces a 3 percent fall in growth in 2009 and a meagre 0.4 percent pickup next year , while italian gdp should sink by 4.4 percent this year .
britain , which has been battling with falling consumer demand , a housing market collapse and a drawing in of its key financial sector , is expected to stage only a modest recovery after this year 's 4.1 percent contraction .

" what seat would be more appropriate than a land wounded by the earthquake ? "
berlusconi told a news conference in l 'aquila on thursday , after holding a cabinet meeting in the stricken town .
berlusconi said moving the meeting of the heads of government of the world 's richest countries , currently set to take place on la maddalena , a small island off sardinia , would be a " positive signal for the more than 60,000 people still living in temporary camps . "
" the 21 heads of government who come will be able to see first-hand the wounds caused by this earthquake , " berlusconi added .
" i think it could work out very well . "
berlusconi looking to divert funds to disaster zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi will need to consult with g8 leaders on the move the italian leader , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the g8 club of industrialized nations , added that the 220 million euros -lrb- $ 286.5 million -rrb- needed for summit security and infrastructure in sardinia could this way be invested in the earthquake region instead .
berlusconi acknowledged logistics and cost problems at the original venue on a sardinian island were putting the original plans in jeopardy .
however , the decision to move the conference to l 'aquila could render moot more than two years of planning for the event .
the decision to move the summit was dependent on approval from the other nations attending the summit scheduled for july 8-10 there have already been signs of dissent within berlusconi 's cabinet over moving the g8 summit , with at least one minister saying it was " implausible " and would be difficult to pull off .
cabinet increases aid to quake region the april 6 quake in the central region of abruzzo killed 296 people , flattened entire areas of some towns and made some 65,000 people homeless .
the cabinet earlier on thursday approved a decree raising up to 8 billion euros to rebuild the quake-hit areas and fund emergency services . nda / mll , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

organizers of the meeting , chaired by ban and the african union , had said more than $ 250 million was needed to improve security in a state which has had no central government since former president mohamed siad barre was ousted in 1991 , setting off a bloody cycle of clashes between rival factions .
eu officials said the aim was to build up a police force of some 10,000 officers and a security force of 5,000 .
support is also sought for the 4,300-strong african union mission amisom .
the amisom force - the only security presence backing the government - is well short of the 8,000 soldiers initially planned and is regularly attacked by the islamist shebab militia .
" restoring security and stability in somalia is vital to the success of the reconciliation effort and the survival of the unity government , " ban told the conference , held under the auspices of the united nations .
" much remains to be done . "
ban reiterated he had no intention of sending a un force to somalia any time soon , saying that the united nations should take a cautious and incremental approach to sending its own peacekeeping mission , and only " when the security conditions are appropriate . "
target likely to be exceeded after delegates underlined the challenges facing the war-torn country , organizers said donors had promised funding which was likely to exceed their initial expectations .
" we are on target , we are even a little bit higher because the target was $ 250 million , " said eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel .
" it seems that we are also above 250 million if you take into account material aid . "
" it 's really a full success , " he added to reporters after the four-hour conference in brussels .
the european commission , whose president jose manuel barroso also attended , had announced it would pledge at least 60 million euros on the eve of the meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamists have battled numerous governments president ahmed , who took office in january , made a personal plea for funds at the conference .
" solving this problem will require a radical solution , " said ahmed .
" the restoration of security and peace in somalia is the basis of any solution to the problems , " he said .
islamist fighters including the hard-line shebab militia have waged battles against the transitional government , its predecessor cabinet and their allies , vowing to fight until all foreign forces withdraw and sharia law is imposed .
more than one million people have fled their homes .
fewer than one in three somalis , whose life expectancy is 46 years , have access to clean water .
general instability and lawlessness while the conference was not focused on piracy , the high media profile of the growing number of cases of daring raids on freighters on the seas of the gulf of aden has become synonymous with somalia 's woes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international anti-piracy efforts face a tough mission " piracy is not a water-borne disease .
it is a symptom of anarchy and insecurity on the ground , " ban said .
" dealing with it requires an integrated strategy that addresses the fundamental issue of lawlessness in somalia . "
despite international naval missions - including from nato and the european union - piracy has mushroomed over the last year , as ransom-hunting somalis tackle ever-bigger and more distant prizes .
more than 130 merchant ships were attacked in the region last year , an increase of more than 200 percent on 2007 , the international maritime bureau said .
a tenfold increase was noted in the first three months of 2009 .
" if we only treat the symptoms , piracy at sea , but not its root causes - the decay of the state and poverty - we will fail , " barroso said .
non-governmental organization oxfam said the conference was being held at a critical moment for 3.2 million somalis desperately in need of aid , more than a million of whom have fled their homes to avoid fighting in the last two years .
" the piracy issue that has grabbed international headlines is a symptom of deeper issues that have gone unaddressed ever since the collapse of the national government in 1991 , " oxfam 's robert maletta said in a statement .
ahmed underlined : " it is our duty to pursue these criminals not only on the high seas but also on terra firma . "
piracy on the increase despite international force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's mission off the coast of somalia is in question piracy has worsened off somalia 's coast despite the presence of naval forces from more than a dozen countries , including task forces under nato , eu and us command .
nato 's four-ship mission was due to wind up its operation on thursday .
diplomats were discussing whether it could be extended and nato has said it wants tougher rules to allow the detention of captured suspects .
the united states , which is reviewing its somalia policy , plans to help build somali security forces and bolster the new government but has made clear it has no desire to " drive " the whole process . nda / mll , afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the subject of piracy threatened to dominate proceedings . as international donors gathered at a conference to help bring stability to somalia , it seemed rampant piracy in busy shipping lanes off the somali coast - a subject that has topped international news bulletins for months - was likely to dominate the talks .
the one-day conference in brussels aims to raise at least 128 million euros -lrb- $ 166 million -rrb- to finance african peacekeepers and support somalia 's fledgling police and security forces .
but european commission president jose manuel barrosso said ahead of the talks that he was worried that the piracy problem might divert resources in the lawless nation .
piracy a ' symptom ' , ban says " if we only treat the symptoms , piracy at sea , but not its root causes - the decay of the state and poverty - we will fail , " barroso said ahead of the meeting .
for his part , ban said international funding for somalia 's new government and african union peacekeepers is vital to help stabilize the lawless nation , a prerequisite for stopping the persistent pirate attacks .
at a news conference , ban told reporteres that piracy is a symptom of anarchy and insecurity on the ground .
he said international help would enable the new government to establish authority and ensure reconstruction .
no plans for peace force ban reiterated that he had no intention of sending a un force to somalia any time soon , saying a peacekeeping operation would go only when " circumstances and conditions are appropriate . "
organisers of the meeting , which is being chaired by the un and the african union , say more than $ 250 million is needed for next year to improve security in a state that has functioned without a central government since 1991 and is mired in conflict .

" what seat would be more appropriate than a land wounded by the earthquake ? "
berlusconi told a news conference in l 'aquila on thursday , after holding a cabinet meeting in the stricken town .
berlusconi said moving the meeting of the heads of government of the world 's richest countries , currently set to take place on la maddalena , a small island off sardinia , would be a " positive signal for the more than 60,000 people still living in temporary camps . "
" the 21 heads of government who come will be able to see first-hand the wounds caused by this earthquake , " berlusconi added .
" i think it could work out very well . "
berlusconi looking to divert funds to disaster zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi will need to consult with g8 leaders on the move the italian leader , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the g8 club of industrialized nations , added that the 220 million euros -lrb- $ 286.5 million -rrb- needed for summit security and infrastructure in sardinia could this way be invested in the earthquake region instead .
berlusconi acknowledged logistics and cost problems at the original venue on a sardinian island were putting the original plans in jeopardy .
however , the decision to move the conference to l 'aquila could render moot more than two years of planning for the event .
the decision to move the summit was dependent on approval from the other nations attending the summit scheduled for july 8-10 there have already been signs of dissent within berlusconi 's cabinet over moving the g8 summit , with at least one minister saying it was " implausible " and would be difficult to pull off .
cabinet increases aid to quake region the april 6 quake in the central region of abruzzo killed 296 people , flattened entire areas of some towns and made some 65,000 people homeless .
the cabinet earlier on thursday approved a decree raising up to 8 billion euros to rebuild the quake-hit areas and fund emergency services . nda / mll , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier says a german woman held in mali has been freed , along with three other hostages .
al-qaeda 's north african branch had claimed responsibility for the abductions . a german tourist who was taken hostage by islamists three months ago in mali was released wednesday evening , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in berlin .
the 77-year-old woman was one of four western tourists abducted on january 22 during a trip to niger and mali .
steinmeier said that the woman was in the care of mali government officials and that she was exhausted by the ordeal and hardship of three months in captivity .
steinmeier also thanked mali president amadou toumani toure , who had cooperated closely with berlin to end the abduction .

their forecast is even gloomier than the imf 's prediction for 2009 . germany 's leading economic institutes are predicting the worst economic decline since the country was founded in 1949 . in their annual spring report , they say the country 's economy will shrink by 6.0 percent this year .
the world 's top exporter is not likely to see an improvement any time soon , either . the institutes predict that the recession will continue into 2010 , with the economy contracting by 0.5 percent next year . the economic experts also say unemployment will rise to just under five million jobless by the end of next year . " on the basis of leading indicators , the institutes expect that the downward trend to continue and do not believe it will bottom out before the middle of 2010 , " the widely-watched report states . the institutes publish their outlook twice a year . the spring report 2009 comes a day after the latest projections by the international monetary fund , imf , which said the german economy was likely to contract by 5.6 percent , pushing unemployment rates up .
with global trade shrinking and the world economy gripped by recession , the international monetary fund has slashed its 2009 growth forecast for the entire 16-member euro zone by another one to 4.2 percent .
dire predictions but while their prognosis for germany looked especially bad , the imf said germany 's government still had more room to maneuver because of sound fiscal policies in the past , and should be spending extra public funds to make up for the massive decline in exports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck and guttenberg have their work cut out for them " could they do more ?
the answer is yes , " imf economist jorg decressin said .
" this is a case where a country has done its homework during the good times ... and can take advantage of this during the bad times . "
as the world 's leading export nation , germany now appears to be bearing the brunt of the global recession , with the imf saying unemployment could climb to 10.8 percent in 2010 from 9 percent this year .
germany 's jobless rate was 7.3 percent last year .
“ i think we were all agreed around the table that we have a very difficult year ahead of us , " said german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg at a news conference on wednesday following an economic summit with chancellor angela merkel and leaders from industry and unions . finance minister peer steinbrueck told reporters there had been a slump of 3.3 percent in the first three months of the year .
labor market crisis the imf 's latest world economic outlook underscores the risks that the economic crisis is rapidly turning into a labor market crisis , with euro-zone unemployment set to rise this year to 10.1 percent before edging up to 11.5 percent in 2010 .
this is despite the massive stimulus packages introduced by european governments and the number of companies across europe placing employees on short-term working contracts rather than laying them off .
the euro-zone jobless rate stood at 7.6 percent in 2008 .
" the euro area is coming out of this crisis somewhat later than the us because to some extent the policy stimulus kicked in later , " decressin told reporters in washington .
but it is a picture repeated across europe , with the imf saying france faces a 3 percent fall in growth in 2009 and a meagre 0.4 percent pickup next year , while italian gdp should sink by 4.4 percent this year .
britain , which has been battling with falling consumer demand , a housing market collapse and a drawing in of its key financial sector , is expected to stage only a modest recovery after this year 's 4.1 percent contraction .
the imf predicts british unemployment will jump from 7.4 percent in 2009 to 9.2 percent next year .
ireland has been particularly badly hit by the world recession and the credit crunch , and the imf predicts that irish economic growth will fall by a disastrous 8 percent this year and by 3 percent in 2010 after a collapse in the nation 's construction boom . db / pfd , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i can well imagine that in two or three months , people 's anger will grow considerably , " schwan told the muenchener merkur newspaper .
that 's when some of the government 's measures to cushion the blow from the recession - such as filling in the pay gap for people who are forced into shortened work hours - are due to run out .
" if there is no sign of hope for things to improve , then the mood can turn explosive , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if aid measures run out , patience will as well , schwan warns schwan 's comments followed those of sommer , who heads the federation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- umbrella group .
in an intervew with germany 's ard television , sommer warned of social unrest comparable to that in the 1930s - when widespread poverty paved the way for the nazi regime 's rise to power .
fraying tempers in france the projected economic contraction of up to six percent is comparable with data from the years 1930 , 1931 and 1932 , sommer said .
making the rounds of the german press , sommer told the nordwest zeitung newspaper that if there are mass layoffs , it would be " a provocation for workers and the unions , " indicating that " social unrest could no longer be discounted " in germany .
the seams of civil restraint are already beginning to fray in france - a country known for frequent strikes and an active labor movment .
on tuesday , a french court rejected a motion brought by employees of a factory run by germany 's continental ag to block the plant 's planned 2010 closure .
citing the steep drop in demand in the automobile sector , continental announced in march plans to shutter the factory in clairoix , north of paris , which employs 1,120 .
smashed windows , destroyed equipment workers responded to the ruling by smashing windows and destroying equipment at the factory and regional administrative offices in nearby compiegne .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sommer sees parallels with the early 1930s on wednesday , factory management distributed fliers reading : " we have no other choice but to suspend production as well as the whole of the site 's activities until further notice . "
french government officials condemned the workers ' rampage , calling it " unacceptable . "
continental workers have drawn nationwide attention , meeting with top government officials at the presidential palace , burning tires in the streets of the capital and leading weeks of protests .
their actions are part of a wave of increasingly radical employee movements to fight layoffs and cutbacks prompted by france 's worst economic performance in 30 years .
workers have held managers hostage and blocked production at sites around the country .
on tuesday , workers in southwest france released two bosses held for two days over plans to shut a subsidiary of american automotive company molex .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 23.04.2009 turkey and armenia agree on reconciliation roadmap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish president abdullah gul , left , and armenian president serzh sargsyan met in 2008 turkey and armenia have reached an agreement on a comprehensive framework to normalize relations .
deutsche welle correspondent dorian jones reports that the process carries some risk for the turkish government . the turkish minister for eu affairs , egemen bagis , said thursday the process , which is taking place under swiss supervision , aimed to bring about a fundamental change in bilateral relations between the two countries .
" better relations , more neighborly relations , more trade , more opportunities and cooperation and peace - i see a light at the end of the tunnel , that peace is possible , " he said .
a senior western diplomat , who spoke on condition of anonymity , told reuters news agency that the deal had not yet been signed but that turkey and armenia had agreed on diplomatic ties , opening the border and establishing commissions to address historical disputes .
" all the documents have been agreed in principle but it 's from the signing that the clock starts ticking , " the diplomat said .
" it is a finite period that is not very long .
we are talking about weeks or months . "
old wounds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some armenian groups have long opposed reconciliation with turkey in armenia , several thousand protesters , mainly supporters of a nationalist junior partner in the government , burned turkish flags and condemned the efforts at normalizing relations .
at the heart of ongoing tensions between the countries are accusations by armenia that turkey was directly responsible for what it calls the genocide of 1.5 million armenians in 1915 during world war i , a charge strongly denied by ankara turkey officially admits that as many as 600,000 armenians died during the war and deportation from eastern anatolia , but it insists the deaths must be seen in the context of an armenian uprising at a time when armenians were siding with invading russian troops earlier this week , ankara recalled its ambassador from canada after the canadian prime minister supported the genocide charge .
eyes on obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama looks likely to ease pressure on turkey after the talks with armenia ankara now fears us president barack obama will do the same .
during his presidential campaign obama said he would recognize the genocide if elected .
but yasemin congar , deputy editor of the turkish daily taraf , said obama may now hold back as a result of the new rapprochement efforts .
" washington wants to see turkey open its border with armenia , " she said .
" they want to see ankara and yerevan normalize diplomatic relations and there is a movement to that end .
" i think obama wants to give the message to ankara that if this process goes on it might even stop him from saying the ' g ' word , the genocide word in washington . "
during his visit to turkey earlier this month obama avoided using the so-called " g " word .
instead he praised the turkish and armenian rapprochement efforts .
eve of remembrance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflict between armenia and azerbaijan over nagorno-karabahk displaced hundreds of thousands the timing of turkey 's announcement of its agreement with armenia is being seen as no coincidence .
it comes just one day before armenians around the world remember those killed in 1915 .
traditionally , us presidents deliver a speech to mark the event .
us-based armenian groups have been lobbying obama intensively to use his expected speech to recognize the genocide .
that is now seen as unlikely in light of the new rapprochement efforts .
obama is also aware that a reference to genocide would seriously damage us-turkey relations .
the turkish government is paying a heavy domestic political price for its rapprochement efforts , since turkey 's close relationship to armenia 's rival , azerbaijan , is seen to be at risk .
sixteen years ago , armenia occupied nearly 20 percent of azerbaijan following a war over the disputed enclave of nagorno-karabakh . turkey imposed a trade embargo against armenia in support of its ally .
" all turkish press , all political opposition , is using the azerbaijani issue against the government .
i think the government finds itself in a very difficult position , " said political scientist nuray mert .
such pressure is already having an effect , with the turkish prime minister now linking the ending of the embargo to the withdrawal of armenian forces from azerbaijan .
that is seen as unlikely anytime soon .
turkish news reports have said azerbaijan is disturbed by the reconciliation efforts , which could lead to the reopening of the turkish-armenian border .
but with ankara facing increasing pressure from both the us and the eu to end the embargo , the turkish government now finds itself between a rock and a hard place .

" it is our hope that any car scrappage legislation ultimately enacted will remedy these concerns , and that the eu will be able to support this important initiative to promote fuel-efficiency , reduce pollution , and provide a needed boost to the automobile industry , " john bruton , the eu 's ambassador to the united states , said in a letter sent to the us congress on wednesday .
president barack obama supports passage of a " cash-for-clunkers " bill to pay people to turn in their gas guzzlers and replace them with more fuel-efficient vehicles .
but bruton said europe is worried that a leading version of the legislation , " as currently drafted , provides benefits only for replacement vehicles assembled in the u.s. or north america , a distinction that would harm car manufacturers from other parts of the world , including europe . "
such a provision , he added , would be " a clear violation " of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- rules requiring a country 's laws to treat foreign and domestic products equally .
possible compromise on north american provision europe 's fears and the concerns that the eu and us may bring their differences before the wto were partially allayed on thursday when got a boost after a leading proponent of the " cash-for-clunkers " bill , ohio congresswoman betty sutton , signaled she may drop a provision limiting the subsidies to purchases of north american made vehicles .
the provision has been a major sticking point in congressional efforts to merge competing proposals for the program , and sutton 's move brings those who are opposed to the north america requirement closer to a compromise with those who support it .
" it 's not so important to me that it has to be done " exactly according to her bill , but rather that a program is passed , sutton told reporters on capitol hill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany allows trade-ins for german and foreign cars germany , france , and slovakia - as well as china - have already enacted such trade-in programs but a central feature of the european programs is that they apply to all vehicles , whether assembled in europe or abroad .
the us may now follow suit as congressional aides redouble their efforts to find common ground on compromise legislation that could clear congress within months .
but even if a compromise is reached , lawmakers must find funding for the program .
some have suggested that the money would come from the economic stimulus package passed earlier this year .
proponents say the program - to provide new-car discounts of $ 1,500 to $ 7,500 -lrb- 1,150 euros – 5,700 euros -rrb- , depending on the proposal - is desperately needed to lift slumping car sales . nda / mll , reuters / wall street journal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but there are fears over what that could mean for opel ’ s german workers . franz confirmed thursday reports that said fiat was ready to sign a declaration of intent on a takeover as early as next tuesday .
however he claimed fiat had no interest in a strategic partnership with opel .
he said an alliance with fiat would lead to massive job cuts at opel and the closure of german factories after bundestag elections in september .
opel has around 25,000 workers .
franz also said fiat , which has 14.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 18.4 billion -rrb- of debt sitting over its head , had no way of finding the 500 million euros in fresh capital gm is seeking from a suitor .
" fiat has … huge liquidity problems .

on thursday , fiat posted a first-quarter loss of 411 million euros and ruled out any direct investment as part of a potential deal for a strategic partnership with us peer chrysler .

he said that canadian car parts maker magna was also interested in a stake , but that no agreements have been reached yet .

i think that the long-term strategy of fiat is really to keep the market share and get rid of all the rest of opel . "
stuermer also said that fiat would most likely not be able to go it alone in its bid for control of opel .
" i think that fiat at the moment does not have the free cash lying around to just come up with the money .
they would certainly have to team up either with one of the other interested parties in investing in opel or with one of their own long-term partners from the agnelli family or wider italy . "
spokespeople from fiat and opel were unavailable for comment on thursday on the potential takeover .
two sides of the coin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel workers fear german production lines could be terminated pierluigi bellini , associate director of ihs 's automotive division in milan , agreed that a fiat-opel fusion would spell the end for thousands of german workers .

" but the other side of the coin is that work forces would need to be cut , both in germany and italy , and i do n't know if that is feasible now .
especially in germany , where you have an election year , and in italy the situation is already pretty bad for italian plants . "
despite all the potential points of synergy , fiat faces an uphill battle to convince opel 's management and the industry at large that it has the capacity to take control of the german carmaker .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 23.04.2009 moldovan opposition to boycott country 's next parliament großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned that the opposition 's latest move could lead to further unrest leaders of moldova 's opposition have announced plans to boycott the next parliament as the country 's supreme court sets a deadline for a political showdown in the former soviet republic . " we will not participate in the election of a president , or in parliamentary sessions that will discuss it , " said mihai gimpu , leader of the opposition liberal party of moldova -lrb- lpm -rrb- .
disputed national elections earlier this month gave the ruling communists 60 seats in moldova 's 101-seat legislature , prompting violent clashes in the capital , chisinau .
opposition demonstrators accused the communists of voter fraud and battled with police on april 7 , leaving one dead , hundreds injured , and the parliament building ransacked and partially burned .
according to the constitution , moldova 's next president must be voted into office by the new parliament , by a 61 member majority .
however , three opposition parties , including the lpm , control 41 seats in moldova 's legislature , according to a vote recount completed by the central election commission on wednesday - creating a potential deadlock .
opposition aiming to block presidential selection moldova 's supreme court on thursday afternoon set a limit on the time allowed for the legislature to select a president , ruling that parliament must choose a new chief executive by july 7 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin must stand down by law - but who will follow him ?
if it fails to agree on a president by that date , the parliament must be dissolved and new elections would have to be held , the court said , setting the rival factions on a possible collision course once again .
independent observers including monitors from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- ruled moldova 's april 5 elections were generally free and fair .
moldovan president vladimir voronin , head of the communist party , took the country 's top office in 2001 and has held it ever since .
but as he is prevented by constitutional statute from continuing in office , a new president must be chosen .
concerned eu discuss sending mission to moldova meanwhile , european union external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner has backed the idea of sending an eu mission to moldova .
" personally i 'm in favor of such a mission , that 's absolutely clear .
now we have to work out the terms of reference of such a mission , " she told a press conference in brussels .
the idea of an investigative mission , including representatives from the european commission and the moldovan opposition was first mooted wednesday by czech president mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
topolanek made the suggestion during a visit to moldova where he met communist president vladimir voronin and opposition figures , saying it would help shed light on recent events and help restore calm .
the mission proposal will be put to a meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg on monday . nda / mll , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is our hope that any car scrappage legislation ultimately enacted will remedy these concerns , and that the eu will be able to support this important initiative to promote fuel-efficiency , reduce pollution , and provide a needed boost to the automobile industry , " john bruton , the eu 's ambassador to the united states , said in a letter sent to the us congress on wednesday .
president barack obama supports passage of a " cash-for-clunkers " bill to pay people to turn in their gas guzzlers and replace them with more fuel-efficient vehicles .
but bruton said europe is worried that a leading version of the legislation , " as currently drafted , provides benefits only for replacement vehicles assembled in the u.s. or north america , a distinction that would harm car manufacturers from other parts of the world , including europe . "
such a provision , he added , would be " a clear violation " of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- rules requiring a country 's laws to treat foreign and domestic products equally .
possible compromise on north american provision europe 's fears and the concerns that the eu and us may bring their differences before the wto were partially allayed on thursday when got a boost after a leading proponent of the " cash-for-clunkers " bill , ohio congresswoman betty sutton , signaled she may drop a provision limiting the subsidies to purchases of north american made vehicles .
the provision has been a major sticking point in congressional efforts to merge competing proposals for the program , and sutton 's move brings those who are opposed to the north america requirement closer to a compromise with those who support it .
" it 's not so important to me that it has to be done " exactly according to her bill , but rather that a program is passed , sutton told reporters on capitol hill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany allows trade-ins for german and foreign cars germany , france , and slovakia - as well as china - have already enacted such trade-in programs but a central feature of the european programs is that they apply to all vehicles , whether assembled in europe or abroad .
the us may now follow suit as congressional aides redouble their efforts to find common ground on compromise legislation that could clear congress within months .
but even if a compromise is reached , lawmakers must find funding for the program .
some have suggested that the money would come from the economic stimulus package passed earlier this year .
proponents say the program - to provide new-car discounts of $ 1,500 to $ 7,500 -lrb- 1,150 euros – 5,700 euros -rrb- , depending on the proposal - is desperately needed to lift slumping car sales . nda / mll , reuters / wall street journal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 23.04.2009 turkey and armenia agree on reconciliation roadmap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish president abdullah gul , left , and armenian president serzh sargsyan met in 2008 turkey and armenia have reached an agreement on a comprehensive framework to normalize relations .
deutsche welle correspondent dorian jones reports that the process carries some risk for the turkish government . the turkish minister for eu affairs , egemen bagis , said thursday the process , which is taking place under swiss supervision , aimed to bring about a fundamental change in bilateral relations between the two countries .
" better relations , more neighborly relations , more trade , more opportunities and cooperation and peace - i see a light at the end of the tunnel , that peace is possible , " he said .
a senior western diplomat , who spoke on condition of anonymity , told reuters news agency that the deal had not yet been signed but that turkey and armenia had agreed on diplomatic ties , opening the border and establishing commissions to address historical disputes .
" all the documents have been agreed in principle but it 's from the signing that the clock starts ticking , " the diplomat said .
" it is a finite period that is not very long .
we are talking about weeks or months . "
old wounds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some armenian groups have long opposed reconciliation with turkey in armenia , several thousand protesters , mainly supporters of a nationalist junior partner in the government , burned turkish flags and condemned the efforts at normalizing relations .
at the heart of ongoing tensions between the countries are accusations by armenia that turkey was directly responsible for what it calls the genocide of 1.5 million armenians in 1915 during world war i , a charge strongly denied by ankara turkey officially admits that as many as 600,000 armenians died during the war and deportation from eastern anatolia , but it insists the deaths must be seen in the context of an armenian uprising at a time when armenians were siding with invading russian troops earlier this week , ankara recalled its ambassador from canada after the canadian prime minister supported the genocide charge .
eyes on obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama looks likely to ease pressure on turkey after the talks with armenia ankara now fears us president barack obama will do the same .
during his presidential campaign obama said he would recognize the genocide if elected .
but yasemin congar , deputy editor of the turkish daily taraf , said obama may now hold back as a result of the new rapprochement efforts .
" washington wants to see turkey open its border with armenia , " she said .
" they want to see ankara and yerevan normalize diplomatic relations and there is a movement to that end .
" i think obama wants to give the message to ankara that if this process goes on it might even stop him from saying the ' g ' word , the genocide word in washington . "
during his visit to turkey earlier this month obama avoided using the so-called " g " word .
instead he praised the turkish and armenian rapprochement efforts .
eve of remembrance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflict between armenia and azerbaijan over nagorno-karabahk displaced hundreds of thousands the timing of turkey 's announcement of its agreement with armenia is being seen as no coincidence .
it comes just one day before armenians around the world remember those killed in 1915 .
traditionally , us presidents deliver a speech to mark the event .
us-based armenian groups have been lobbying obama intensively to use his expected speech to recognize the genocide .
that is now seen as unlikely in light of the new rapprochement efforts .
obama is also aware that a reference to genocide would seriously damage us-turkey relations .
the turkish government is paying a heavy domestic political price for its rapprochement efforts , since turkey 's close relationship to armenia 's rival , azerbaijan , is seen to be at risk .
sixteen years ago , armenia occupied nearly 20 percent of azerbaijan following a war over the disputed enclave of nagorno-karabakh . turkey imposed a trade embargo against armenia in support of its ally .
" all turkish press , all political opposition , is using the azerbaijani issue against the government .
i think the government finds itself in a very difficult position , " said political scientist nuray mert .
such pressure is already having an effect , with the turkish prime minister now linking the ending of the embargo to the withdrawal of armenian forces from azerbaijan .
that is seen as unlikely anytime soon .
turkish news reports have said azerbaijan is disturbed by the reconciliation efforts , which could lead to the reopening of the turkish-armenian border .
but with ankara facing increasing pressure from both the us and the eu to end the embargo , the turkish government now finds itself between a rock and a hard place .

deutsche welle correspondent dorian jones reports that the process carries some risk for the turkish government . the turkish minister for eu affairs , egemen bagis , said thursday the process , which is taking place under swiss supervision , aimed to bring about a fundamental change in bilateral relations between the two countries .
" better relations , more neighborly relations , more trade , more opportunities and cooperation and peace - i see a light at the end of the tunnel , that peace is possible , " he said .
a senior western diplomat , who spoke on condition of anonymity , told reuters news agency that the deal had not yet been signed but that turkey and armenia had agreed on diplomatic ties , opening the border and establishing commissions to address historical disputes .
" all the documents have been agreed in principle but it 's from the signing that the clock starts ticking , " the diplomat said .
" it is a finite period that is not very long .
we are talking about weeks or months . "
old wounds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some armenian groups have long opposed reconciliation with turkey in armenia , several thousand protesters , mainly supporters of a nationalist junior partner in the government , burned turkish flags and condemned the efforts at normalizing relations .
at the heart of ongoing tensions between the countries are accusations by armenia that turkey was directly responsible for what it calls the genocide of 1.5 million armenians in 1915 during world war i , a charge strongly denied by ankara turkey officially admits that as many as 600,000 armenians died during the war and deportation from eastern anatolia , but it insists the deaths must be seen in the context of an armenian uprising at a time when armenians were siding with invading russian troops earlier this week , ankara recalled its ambassador from canada after the canadian prime minister supported the genocide charge .
eyes on obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama looks likely to ease pressure on turkey after the talks with armenia ankara now fears us president barack obama will do the same .
during his presidential campaign obama said he would recognize the genocide if elected .
but yasemin congar , deputy editor of the turkish daily taraf , said obama may now hold back as a result of the new rapprochement efforts .
" washington wants to see turkey open its border with armenia , " she said .
" they want to see ankara and yerevan normalize diplomatic relations and there is a movement to that end .
" i think obama wants to give the message to ankara that if this process goes on it might even stop him from saying the ' g ' word , the genocide word in washington . "
during his visit to turkey earlier this month obama avoided using the so-called " g " word .
instead he praised the turkish and armenian rapprochement efforts .
eve of remembrance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflict between armenia and azerbaijan over nagorno-karabahk displaced hundreds of thousands the timing of turkey 's announcement of its agreement with armenia is being seen as no coincidence .
it comes just one day before armenians around the world remember those killed in 1915 .
traditionally , us presidents deliver a speech to mark the event .
us-based armenian groups have been lobbying obama intensively to use his expected speech to recognize the genocide .
that is now seen as unlikely in light of the new rapprochement efforts .
obama is also aware that a reference to genocide would seriously damage us-turkey relations .
the turkish government is paying a heavy domestic political price for its rapprochement efforts , since turkey 's close relationship to armenia 's rival , azerbaijan , is seen to be at risk .
sixteen years ago , armenia occupied nearly 20 percent of azerbaijan following a war over the disputed enclave of nagorno-karabakh . turkey imposed a trade embargo against armenia in support of its ally .
" all turkish press , all political opposition , is using the azerbaijani issue against the government .
i think the government finds itself in a very difficult position , " said political scientist nuray mert .
such pressure is already having an effect , with the turkish prime minister now linking the ending of the embargo to the withdrawal of armenian forces from azerbaijan .
that is seen as unlikely anytime soon .
turkish news reports have said azerbaijan is disturbed by the reconciliation efforts , which could lead to the reopening of the turkish-armenian border .
but with ankara facing increasing pressure from both the us and the eu to end the embargo , the turkish government now finds itself between a rock and a hard place .

" it is our hope that any car scrappage legislation ultimately enacted will remedy these concerns , and that the eu will be able to support this important initiative to promote fuel-efficiency , reduce pollution , and provide a needed boost to the automobile industry , " john bruton , the eu 's ambassador to the united states , said in a letter sent to the us congress on wednesday .
president barack obama supports passage of a " cash-for-clunkers " bill to pay people to turn in their gas guzzlers and replace them with more fuel-efficient vehicles .
but bruton said europe is worried that a leading version of the legislation , " as currently drafted , provides benefits only for replacement vehicles assembled in the u.s. or north america , a distinction that would harm car manufacturers from other parts of the world , including europe . "
such a provision , he added , would be " a clear violation " of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- rules requiring a country 's laws to treat foreign and domestic products equally .
possible compromise on north american provision europe 's fears and the concerns that the eu and us may bring their differences before the wto were partially allayed on thursday when got a boost after a leading proponent of the " cash-for-clunkers " bill , ohio congresswoman betty sutton , signaled she may drop a provision limiting the subsidies to purchases of north american made vehicles .
the provision has been a major sticking point in congressional efforts to merge competing proposals for the program , and sutton 's move brings those who are opposed to the north america requirement closer to a compromise with those who support it .
" it 's not so important to me that it has to be done " exactly according to her bill , but rather that a program is passed , sutton told reporters on capitol hill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany allows trade-ins for german and foreign cars germany , france , and slovakia - as well as china - have already enacted such trade-in programs but a central feature of the european programs is that they apply to all vehicles , whether assembled in europe or abroad .
the us may now follow suit as congressional aides redouble their efforts to find common ground on compromise legislation that could clear congress within months .
but even if a compromise is reached , lawmakers must find funding for the program .
some have suggested that the money would come from the economic stimulus package passed earlier this year .
proponents say the program - to provide new-car discounts of $ 1,500 to $ 7,500 -lrb- 1,150 euros – 5,700 euros -rrb- , depending on the proposal - is desperately needed to lift slumping car sales . nda / mll , reuters / wall street journal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their forecast is even gloomier than the imf 's prediction for 2009 . germany 's leading economic institutes are predicting the worst economic decline since the country was founded in 1949 . in their annual spring report , they say the country 's economy will shrink by 6.0 percent this year .
the world 's top exporter is not likely to see an improvement any time soon , either . the institutes predict that the recession will continue into 2010 , with the economy contracting by 0.5 percent next year . the economic experts also say unemployment will rise to just under five million jobless by the end of next year . " on the basis of leading indicators , the institutes expect that the downward trend to continue and do not believe it will bottom out before the middle of 2010 , " the widely-watched report states . the institutes publish their outlook twice a year . the spring report 2009 comes a day after the latest projections by the international monetary fund , imf , which said the german economy was likely to contract by 5.6 percent , pushing unemployment rates up .
with global trade shrinking and the world economy gripped by recession , the international monetary fund has slashed its 2009 growth forecast for the entire 16-member euro zone by another one to 4.2 percent .
dire predictions but while their prognosis for germany looked especially bad , the imf said germany 's government still had more room to maneuver because of sound fiscal policies in the past , and should be spending extra public funds to make up for the massive decline in exports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck and guttenberg have their work cut out for them " could they do more ?
the answer is yes , " imf economist jorg decressin said .
" this is a case where a country has done its homework during the good times ... and can take advantage of this during the bad times . "
as the world 's leading export nation , germany now appears to be bearing the brunt of the global recession , with the imf saying unemployment could climb to 10.8 percent in 2010 from 9 percent this year .
germany 's jobless rate was 7.3 percent last year .
“ i think we were all agreed around the table that we have a very difficult year ahead of us , " said german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg at a news conference on wednesday following an economic summit with chancellor angela merkel and leaders from industry and unions . finance minister peer steinbrueck told reporters there had been a slump of 3.3 percent in the first three months of the year .
labor market crisis the imf 's latest world economic outlook underscores the risks that the economic crisis is rapidly turning into a labor market crisis , with euro-zone unemployment set to rise this year to 10.1 percent before edging up to 11.5 percent in 2010 .
this is despite the massive stimulus packages introduced by european governments and the number of companies across europe placing employees on short-term working contracts rather than laying them off .
the euro-zone jobless rate stood at 7.6 percent in 2008 .
" the euro area is coming out of this crisis somewhat later than the us because to some extent the policy stimulus kicked in later , " decressin told reporters in washington .
but it is a picture repeated across europe , with the imf saying france faces a 3 percent fall in growth in 2009 and a meagre 0.4 percent pickup next year , while italian gdp should sink by 4.4 percent this year .
britain , which has been battling with falling consumer demand , a housing market collapse and a drawing in of its key financial sector , is expected to stage only a modest recovery after this year 's 4.1 percent contraction .
the imf predicts british unemployment will jump from 7.4 percent in 2009 to 9.2 percent next year .

their forecast is even gloomier than the imf 's prediction for 2009 . germany 's leading economic institutes are predicting the worst economic decline since the country was founded in 1949 . in their annual spring report , they say the country 's economy will shrink by 6.0 percent this year .
the world 's top exporter is not likely to see an improvement any time soon , either . the institutes predict that the recession will continue into 2010 , with the economy contracting by 0.5 percent next year . the economic experts also say unemployment will rise to just under five million jobless by the end of next year . " on the basis of leading indicators , the institutes expect that the downward trend to continue and do not believe it will bottom out before the middle of 2010 , " the widely-watched report states . the institutes publish their outlook twice a year . the spring report 2009 comes a day after the latest projections by the international monetary fund , imf , which said the german economy was likely to contract by 5.6 percent , pushing unemployment rates up .
with global trade shrinking and the world economy gripped by recession , the international monetary fund has slashed its 2009 growth forecast for the entire 16-member euro zone by another one to 4.2 percent .
dire predictions but while their prognosis for germany looked especially bad , the imf said germany 's government still had more room to maneuver because of sound fiscal policies in the past , and should be spending extra public funds to make up for the massive decline in exports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck and guttenberg have their work cut out for them " could they do more ?
the answer is yes , " imf economist jorg decressin said .
" this is a case where a country has done its homework during the good times ... and can take advantage of this during the bad times . "
as the world 's leading export nation , germany now appears to be bearing the brunt of the global recession , with the imf saying unemployment could climb to 10.8 percent in 2010 from 9 percent this year .
germany 's jobless rate was 7.3 percent last year .
“ i think we were all agreed around the table that we have a very difficult year ahead of us , " said german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg at a news conference on wednesday following an economic summit with chancellor angela merkel and leaders from industry and unions . finance minister peer steinbrueck told reporters there had been a slump of 3.3 percent in the first three months of the year .
labor market crisis the imf 's latest world economic outlook underscores the risks that the economic crisis is rapidly turning into a labor market crisis , with euro-zone unemployment set to rise this year to 10.1 percent before edging up to 11.5 percent in 2010 .
this is despite the massive stimulus packages introduced by european governments and the number of companies across europe placing employees on short-term working contracts rather than laying them off .
the euro-zone jobless rate stood at 7.6 percent in 2008 .
" the euro area is coming out of this crisis somewhat later than the us because to some extent the policy stimulus kicked in later , " decressin told reporters in washington .
but it is a picture repeated across europe , with the imf saying france faces a 3 percent fall in growth in 2009 and a meagre 0.4 percent pickup next year , while italian gdp should sink by 4.4 percent this year .
britain , which has been battling with falling consumer demand , a housing market collapse and a drawing in of its key financial sector , is expected to stage only a modest recovery after this year 's 4.1 percent contraction .

" winterkorn said the two companies together " have the stuff to develop the powerhouse of the international automobile industry , " but did not provide any further details . his remarks came as the financial times newspaper reported that porsche se , the luxury brand 's holding company , was looking to sell its manufacturing arm to vw in exchange for cash and shares . further reports from bloomberg news agency quoted unnamed sources as saying the deal would help porsche se raise the funds it needs to continue its push to gain full control of vw , which , as europe 's biggest carmaker , has a turnover roughly 15 times larger than porsche 's . porsche se already owns 51 percent of vw , but analysts say the 9 billion euros of debt it has accumulated buying shares so far is making it difficult for porsche to acquire its target stake of 75 percent . the stuttgart-based sports carmaker recently renewed a credit line worth 10 billion euros , but tighter lending conditions caused by the global financial crisis left its managers short of the 12.5 billion they had initially sought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : works council president uwe hueck says porsche is in a strong financial position representatives of both vw and porsche se declined to comment on the media reports . however , the president of porsche 's works council , uwe hueck , criticized the media for suggesting the company was in financial difficulty and that vw was considering the stake . " i 'm angry that particular persons in the media are spreading ideas that have n't been discussed by the supervisory board , " hueck said in a written statement . he said that the reports were irresponsible and threatened to spread fear among porsche workers . " the jobs at our company are secure , " hueck said , adding that porsche remained financially sound and profitable despite difficulties linked to the global economic downturn . meanwhile , ahead of thursday 's shareholder meeting , vw reported what it described as " extremely weak " results for the first three months of this year with earnings slumping over the last three-quarters . the wolfsburg-based company 's net profit tumbled to 243 million euros in the first quarter of 2009 - down 74 percent from the same period last year . sje / nrt , afp / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

disputed national elections earlier this month gave the ruling communists 60 seats in moldova 's 101-seat legislature , prompting violent clashes in the capital , chisinau .
opposition demonstrators accused the communists of voter fraud and battled with police on april 7 , leaving one dead , hundreds injured , and the parliament building ransacked and partially burned .
according to the constitution , moldova 's next president must be voted into office by the new parliament , by a 61 member majority .

the idea of an investigative mission , including representatives from the european commission and the moldovan opposition was first mooted wednesday by czech president mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .

" we will not participate in the election of a president , or in parliamentary sessions that will discuss it , " said mihai gimpu , leader of the opposition liberal party of moldova -lrb- lpm -rrb- .
disputed national elections earlier this month gave the ruling communists 60 seats in moldova 's 101-seat legislature , prompting violent clashes in the capital , chisinau .
opposition demonstrators accused the communists of voter fraud and battled with police on april 7 , leaving one dead , hundreds injured , and the parliament building ransacked and partially burned .
according to the constitution , moldova 's next president must be voted into office by the new parliament , by a 61 member majority .
however , three opposition parties , including the lpm , control 41 seats in moldova 's legislature , according to a vote recount completed by the central election commission on wednesday - creating a potential deadlock .
opposition aiming to block presidential selection moldova 's supreme court on thursday afternoon set a limit on the time allowed for the legislature to select a president , ruling that parliament must choose a new chief executive by july 7 .

if it fails to agree on a president by that date , the parliament must be dissolved and new elections would have to be held , the court said , setting the rival factions on a possible collision course once again .
independent observers including monitors from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- ruled moldova 's april 5 elections were generally free and fair .
moldovan president vladimir voronin , head of the communist party , took the country 's top office in 2001 and has held it ever since .
but as he is prevented by constitutional statute from continuing in office , a new president must be chosen .
concerned eu discuss sending mission to moldova meanwhile , european union external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner has backed the idea of sending an eu mission to moldova .
" personally i 'm in favor of such a mission , that 's absolutely clear .
now we have to work out the terms of reference of such a mission , " she told a press conference in brussels .
the idea of an investigative mission , including representatives from the european commission and the moldovan opposition was first mooted wednesday by czech president mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
topolanek made the suggestion during a visit to moldova where he met communist president vladimir voronin and opposition figures , saying it would help shed light on recent events and help restore calm .
the mission proposal will be put to a meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg on monday . nda / mll , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we will not participate in the election of a president , or in parliamentary sessions that will discuss it , " said mihai gimpu , leader of the opposition liberal party of moldova -lrb- lpm -rrb- .
disputed national elections earlier this month gave the ruling communists 60 seats in moldova 's 101-seat legislature , prompting violent clashes in the capital , chisinau .
opposition demonstrators accused the communists of voter fraud and battled with police on april 7 , leaving one dead , hundreds injured , and the parliament building ransacked and partially burned .
according to the constitution , moldova 's next president must be voted into office by the new parliament , by a 61 member majority .
however , three opposition parties , including the lpm , control 41 seats in moldova 's legislature , according to a vote recount completed by the central election commission on wednesday - creating a potential deadlock .
opposition aiming to block presidential selection moldova 's supreme court on thursday afternoon set a limit on the time allowed for the legislature to select a president , ruling that parliament must choose a new chief executive by july 7 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin must stand down by law - but who will follow him ?
if it fails to agree on a president by that date , the parliament must be dissolved and new elections would have to be held , the court said , setting the rival factions on a possible collision course once again .
independent observers including monitors from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- ruled moldova 's april 5 elections were generally free and fair .
moldovan president vladimir voronin , head of the communist party , took the country 's top office in 2001 and has held it ever since .
but as he is prevented by constitutional statute from continuing in office , a new president must be chosen .
concerned eu discuss sending mission to moldova meanwhile , european union external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner has backed the idea of sending an eu mission to moldova .
" personally i 'm in favor of such a mission , that 's absolutely clear .
now we have to work out the terms of reference of such a mission , " she told a press conference in brussels .
the idea of an investigative mission , including representatives from the european commission and the moldovan opposition was first mooted wednesday by czech president mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
topolanek made the suggestion during a visit to moldova where he met communist president vladimir voronin and opposition figures , saying it would help shed light on recent events and help restore calm .
the mission proposal will be put to a meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg on monday . nda / mll , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the subject of piracy threatened to dominate proceedings . as international donors gathered at a conference to help bring stability to somalia , it seemed rampant piracy in busy shipping lanes off the somali coast - a subject that has topped international news bulletins for months - was likely to dominate the talks .
the one-day conference in brussels aims to raise at least 128 million euros -lrb- $ 166 million -rrb- to finance african peacekeepers and support somalia 's fledgling police and security forces .
but european commission president jose manuel barrosso said ahead of the talks that he was worried that the piracy problem might divert resources in the lawless nation .
piracy a ' symptom ' , ban says " if we only treat the symptoms , piracy at sea , but not its root causes - the decay of the state and poverty - we will fail , " barroso said ahead of the meeting .
for his part , ban said international funding for somalia 's new government and african union peacekeepers is vital to help stabilize the lawless nation , a prerequisite for stopping the persistent pirate attacks .
at a news conference , ban told reporteres that piracy is a symptom of anarchy and insecurity on the ground .
he said international help would enable the new government to establish authority and ensure reconstruction .
no plans for peace force ban reiterated that he had no intention of sending a un force to somalia any time soon , saying a peacekeeping operation would go only when " circumstances and conditions are appropriate . "
organisers of the meeting , which is being chaired by the un and the african union , say more than $ 250 million is needed for next year to improve security in a state that has functioned without a central government since 1991 and is mired in conflict .

the subject of piracy threatened to dominate proceedings . as international donors gathered at a conference to help bring stability to somalia , it seemed rampant piracy in busy shipping lanes off the somali coast - a subject that has topped international news bulletins for months - was likely to dominate the talks .
the one-day conference in brussels aims to raise at least 128 million euros -lrb- $ 166 million -rrb- to finance african peacekeepers and support somalia 's fledgling police and security forces .
but european commission president jose manuel barrosso said ahead of the talks that he was worried that the piracy problem might divert resources in the lawless nation .
piracy a ' symptom ' , ban says " if we only treat the symptoms , piracy at sea , but not its root causes - the decay of the state and poverty - we will fail , " barroso said ahead of the meeting .
for his part , ban said international funding for somalia 's new government and african union peacekeepers is vital to help stabilize the lawless nation , a prerequisite for stopping the persistent pirate attacks .
at a news conference , ban told reporteres that piracy is a symptom of anarchy and insecurity on the ground .
he said international help would enable the new government to establish authority and ensure reconstruction .
no plans for peace force ban reiterated that he had no intention of sending a un force to somalia any time soon , saying a peacekeeping operation would go only when " circumstances and conditions are appropriate . "
organisers of the meeting , which is being chaired by the un and the african union , say more than $ 250 million is needed for next year to improve security in a state that has functioned without a central government since 1991 and is mired in conflict .
also due to attend was somali president sheikh sharif ahmed , a former islamist rebel leader elected in january at un-brokered talks and widely seen as the best hope for restoring stability . jen / pfd , ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we will not participate in the election of a president , or in parliamentary sessions that will discuss it , " said mihai gimpu , leader of the opposition liberal party of moldova -lrb- lpm -rrb- .
disputed national elections earlier this month gave the ruling communists 60 seats in moldova 's 101-seat legislature , prompting violent clashes in the capital , chisinau .
opposition demonstrators accused the communists of voter fraud and battled with police on april 7 , leaving one dead , hundreds injured , and the parliament building ransacked and partially burned .
according to the constitution , moldova 's next president must be voted into office by the new parliament , by a 61 member majority .
however , three opposition parties , including the lpm , control 41 seats in moldova 's legislature , according to a vote recount completed by the central election commission on wednesday - creating a potential deadlock .
opposition aiming to block presidential selection moldova 's supreme court on thursday afternoon set a limit on the time allowed for the legislature to select a president , ruling that parliament must choose a new chief executive by july 7 .

if it fails to agree on a president by that date , the parliament must be dissolved and new elections would have to be held , the court said , setting the rival factions on a possible collision course once again .
independent observers including monitors from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- ruled moldova 's april 5 elections were generally free and fair .
moldovan president vladimir voronin , head of the communist party , took the country 's top office in 2001 and has held it ever since .
but as he is prevented by constitutional statute from continuing in office , a new president must be chosen .
concerned eu discuss sending mission to moldova meanwhile , european union external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner has backed the idea of sending an eu mission to moldova .
" personally i 'm in favor of such a mission , that 's absolutely clear .
now we have to work out the terms of reference of such a mission , " she told a press conference in brussels .
the idea of an investigative mission , including representatives from the european commission and the moldovan opposition was first mooted wednesday by czech president mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
topolanek made the suggestion during a visit to moldova where he met communist president vladimir voronin and opposition figures , saying it would help shed light on recent events and help restore calm .
the mission proposal will be put to a meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg on monday . nda / mll , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 23.04.2009 donors pledge $ 213 million for security in somalia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalia has been locked in a cycle of chaos and violence for nearly two decades international donors have pledged 213 million dollars -lrb- 163 million euros -rrb- to help bolster security in somalia , a key to helping end attacks by pirates off the country 's coast . donors made the pledges at a conference in brussels thursday at which united nations secretary general ban ki-moon and somalia 's president , sheikh sharif ahmed , appealed for funds to help end two decades of lawlessness in the east african country .
organizers of the meeting , chaired by ban and the african union , had said more than $ 250 million was needed to improve security in a state which has had no central government since former president mohamed siad barre was ousted in 1991 , setting off a bloody cycle of clashes between rival factions .
eu officials said the aim was to build up a police force of some 10,000 officers and a security force of 5,000 .
support is also sought for the 4,300-strong african union mission amisom .
the amisom force - the only security presence backing the government - is well short of the 8,000 soldiers initially planned and is regularly attacked by the islamist shebab militia .
" restoring security and stability in somalia is vital to the success of the reconciliation effort and the survival of the unity government , " ban told the conference , held under the auspices of the united nations .
" much remains to be done . "
ban reiterated he had no intention of sending a un force to somalia any time soon , saying that the united nations should take a cautious and incremental approach to sending its own peacekeeping mission , and only " when the security conditions are appropriate . "
target likely to be exceeded after delegates underlined the challenges facing the war-torn country , organizers said donors had promised funding which was likely to exceed their initial expectations .
" we are on target , we are even a little bit higher because the target was $ 250 million , " said eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel .
" it seems that we are also above 250 million if you take into account material aid . "
" it 's really a full success , " he added to reporters after the four-hour conference in brussels .
the european commission , whose president jose manuel barroso also attended , had announced it would pledge at least 60 million euros on the eve of the meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamists have battled numerous governments president ahmed , who took office in january , made a personal plea for funds at the conference .
" solving this problem will require a radical solution , " said ahmed .
" the restoration of security and peace in somalia is the basis of any solution to the problems , " he said .
islamist fighters including the hard-line shebab militia have waged battles against the transitional government , its predecessor cabinet and their allies , vowing to fight until all foreign forces withdraw and sharia law is imposed .
more than one million people have fled their homes .
fewer than one in three somalis , whose life expectancy is 46 years , have access to clean water .
general instability and lawlessness while the conference was not focused on piracy , the high media profile of the growing number of cases of daring raids on freighters on the seas of the gulf of aden has become synonymous with somalia 's woes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international anti-piracy efforts face a tough mission " piracy is not a water-borne disease .
it is a symptom of anarchy and insecurity on the ground , " ban said .
" dealing with it requires an integrated strategy that addresses the fundamental issue of lawlessness in somalia . "
despite international naval missions - including from nato and the european union - piracy has mushroomed over the last year , as ransom-hunting somalis tackle ever-bigger and more distant prizes .
more than 130 merchant ships were attacked in the region last year , an increase of more than 200 percent on 2007 , the international maritime bureau said .
a tenfold increase was noted in the first three months of 2009 .
" if we only treat the symptoms , piracy at sea , but not its root causes - the decay of the state and poverty - we will fail , " barroso said .
non-governmental organization oxfam said the conference was being held at a critical moment for 3.2 million somalis desperately in need of aid , more than a million of whom have fled their homes to avoid fighting in the last two years .
" the piracy issue that has grabbed international headlines is a symptom of deeper issues that have gone unaddressed ever since the collapse of the national government in 1991 , " oxfam 's robert maletta said in a statement .
ahmed underlined : " it is our duty to pursue these criminals not only on the high seas but also on terra firma . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 23.04.2009 fiat wants majority stake in opel , says workers ' council großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fiat-opel fusion could lead to huge job cuts , analysts say italian car manufacturer fiat is bidding to take over germany 's opel , the head of the opel workers ' council , klaus franz , has said .
but there are fears over what that could mean for opel ’ s german workers . franz confirmed thursday reports that said fiat was ready to sign a declaration of intent on a takeover as early as next tuesday .
however he claimed fiat had no interest in a strategic partnership with opel .
he said an alliance with fiat would lead to massive job cuts at opel and the closure of german factories after bundestag elections in september .
opel has around 25,000 workers .
franz also said fiat , which has 14.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 18.4 billion -rrb- of debt sitting over its head , had no way of finding the 500 million euros in fresh capital gm is seeking from a suitor .
" fiat has … huge liquidity problems .
they ca n't get hold of money at the moment , " franz said .
" the government ca n't give guarantees for such a transparent plan . "
on thursday , fiat posted a first-quarter loss of 411 million euros and ruled out any direct investment as part of a potential deal for a strategic partnership with us peer chrysler .
" no agreements " roland koch , the premier of the german state of hesse , where opel has its headquarters , confirmed that fiat was involved in discussions over a potential takeover .
he said that canadian car parts maker magna was also interested in a stake , but that no agreements have been reached yet .
german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg also said no decision had been taken on fiat 's role in any takeover .
" the federal government is holding talks with various interested parties , without any predetermination , " guttenberg said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg says opel 's future is still under discussion the online version of us daily wall street journal reported that fiat chief executive sergio marchionne had held talks with guttenberg in berlin last week .
job cuts certain christoph stuermer , an auto industry expert at think tank ihs global insight , said opel 's manufacturing and technological aspects would be of little interest to fiat .
" on top of having a 100 percent overlapping product portfolio , fiat and opel also have a very much overlapping regional footprint … so i think that mr franz is being very polite .
i think that the long-term strategy of fiat is really to keep the market share and get rid of all the rest of opel . "
stuermer also said that fiat would most likely not be able to go it alone in its bid for control of opel .
" i think that fiat at the moment does not have the free cash lying around to just come up with the money .
they would certainly have to team up either with one of the other interested parties in investing in opel or with one of their own long-term partners from the agnelli family or wider italy . "
spokespeople from fiat and opel were unavailable for comment on thursday on the potential takeover .
two sides of the coin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel workers fear german production lines could be terminated pierluigi bellini , associate director of ihs 's automotive division in milan , agreed that a fiat-opel fusion would spell the end for thousands of german workers .
" fiat and opel have obvious synergies here , scales of economy , " he said .
" but the other side of the coin is that work forces would need to be cut , both in germany and italy , and i do n't know if that is feasible now .
especially in germany , where you have an election year , and in italy the situation is already pretty bad for italian plants . "
despite all the potential points of synergy , fiat faces an uphill battle to convince opel 's management and the industry at large that it has the capacity to take control of the german carmaker .

" it is our hope that any car scrappage legislation ultimately enacted will remedy these concerns , and that the eu will be able to support this important initiative to promote fuel-efficiency , reduce pollution , and provide a needed boost to the automobile industry , " john bruton , the eu 's ambassador to the united states , said in a letter sent to the us congress on wednesday .
president barack obama supports passage of a " cash-for-clunkers " bill to pay people to turn in their gas guzzlers and replace them with more fuel-efficient vehicles .
but bruton said europe is worried that a leading version of the legislation , " as currently drafted , provides benefits only for replacement vehicles assembled in the u.s. or north america , a distinction that would harm car manufacturers from other parts of the world , including europe . "
such a provision , he added , would be " a clear violation " of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- rules requiring a country 's laws to treat foreign and domestic products equally .
possible compromise on north american provision europe 's fears and the concerns that the eu and us may bring their differences before the wto were partially allayed on thursday when got a boost after a leading proponent of the " cash-for-clunkers " bill , ohio congresswoman betty sutton , signaled she may drop a provision limiting the subsidies to purchases of north american made vehicles .
the provision has been a major sticking point in congressional efforts to merge competing proposals for the program , and sutton 's move brings those who are opposed to the north america requirement closer to a compromise with those who support it .
" it 's not so important to me that it has to be done " exactly according to her bill , but rather that a program is passed , sutton told reporters on capitol hill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany allows trade-ins for german and foreign cars germany , france , and slovakia - as well as china - have already enacted such trade-in programs but a central feature of the european programs is that they apply to all vehicles , whether assembled in europe or abroad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 23.04.2009 donors pledge $ 213 million for security in somalia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalia has been locked in a cycle of chaos and violence for nearly two decades international donors have pledged 213 million dollars -lrb- 163 million euros -rrb- to help bolster security in somalia , a key to helping end attacks by pirates off the country 's coast . donors made the pledges at a conference in brussels thursday at which united nations secretary general ban ki-moon and somalia 's president , sheikh sharif ahmed , appealed for funds to help end two decades of lawlessness in the east african country .
organizers of the meeting , chaired by ban and the african union , had said more than $ 250 million was needed to improve security in a state which has had no central government since former president mohamed siad barre was ousted in 1991 , setting off a bloody cycle of clashes between rival factions .
eu officials said the aim was to build up a police force of some 10,000 officers and a security force of 5,000 .
support is also sought for the 4,300-strong african union mission amisom .
the amisom force - the only security presence backing the government - is well short of the 8,000 soldiers initially planned and is regularly attacked by the islamist shebab militia .
" restoring security and stability in somalia is vital to the success of the reconciliation effort and the survival of the unity government , " ban told the conference , held under the auspices of the united nations .
" much remains to be done . "
ban reiterated he had no intention of sending a un force to somalia any time soon , saying that the united nations should take a cautious and incremental approach to sending its own peacekeeping mission , and only " when the security conditions are appropriate . "
target likely to be exceeded after delegates underlined the challenges facing the war-torn country , organizers said donors had promised funding which was likely to exceed their initial expectations .
" we are on target , we are even a little bit higher because the target was $ 250 million , " said eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel .
" it seems that we are also above 250 million if you take into account material aid . "
" it 's really a full success , " he added to reporters after the four-hour conference in brussels .
the european commission , whose president jose manuel barroso also attended , had announced it would pledge at least 60 million euros on the eve of the meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamists have battled numerous governments president ahmed , who took office in january , made a personal plea for funds at the conference .
" solving this problem will require a radical solution , " said ahmed .
" the restoration of security and peace in somalia is the basis of any solution to the problems , " he said .
islamist fighters including the hard-line shebab militia have waged battles against the transitional government , its predecessor cabinet and their allies , vowing to fight until all foreign forces withdraw and sharia law is imposed .
more than one million people have fled their homes .
fewer than one in three somalis , whose life expectancy is 46 years , have access to clean water .
general instability and lawlessness while the conference was not focused on piracy , the high media profile of the growing number of cases of daring raids on freighters on the seas of the gulf of aden has become synonymous with somalia 's woes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international anti-piracy efforts face a tough mission " piracy is not a water-borne disease .
it is a symptom of anarchy and insecurity on the ground , " ban said .
" dealing with it requires an integrated strategy that addresses the fundamental issue of lawlessness in somalia . "
despite international naval missions - including from nato and the european union - piracy has mushroomed over the last year , as ransom-hunting somalis tackle ever-bigger and more distant prizes .
more than 130 merchant ships were attacked in the region last year , an increase of more than 200 percent on 2007 , the international maritime bureau said .
a tenfold increase was noted in the first three months of 2009 .
" if we only treat the symptoms , piracy at sea , but not its root causes - the decay of the state and poverty - we will fail , " barroso said .
non-governmental organization oxfam said the conference was being held at a critical moment for 3.2 million somalis desperately in need of aid , more than a million of whom have fled their homes to avoid fighting in the last two years .
" the piracy issue that has grabbed international headlines is a symptom of deeper issues that have gone unaddressed ever since the collapse of the national government in 1991 , " oxfam 's robert maletta said in a statement .
ahmed underlined : " it is our duty to pursue these criminals not only on the high seas but also on terra firma . "
piracy on the increase despite international force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's mission off the coast of somalia is in question piracy has worsened off somalia 's coast despite the presence of naval forces from more than a dozen countries , including task forces under nato , eu and us command .
nato 's four-ship mission was due to wind up its operation on thursday .
diplomats were discussing whether it could be extended and nato has said it wants tougher rules to allow the detention of captured suspects .
the united states , which is reviewing its somalia policy , plans to help build somali security forces and bolster the new government but has made clear it has no desire to " drive " the whole process . nda / mll , afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

president barack obama supports passage of a " cash-for-clunkers " bill to pay people to turn in their gas guzzlers and replace them with more fuel-efficient vehicles .
but bruton said europe is worried that a leading version of the legislation , " as currently drafted , provides benefits only for replacement vehicles assembled in the u.s. or north america , a distinction that would harm car manufacturers from other parts of the world , including europe . "
such a provision , he added , would be " a clear violation " of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- rules requiring a country 's laws to treat foreign and domestic products equally .
possible compromise on north american provision europe 's fears and the concerns that the eu and us may bring their differences before the wto were partially allayed on thursday when got a boost after a leading proponent of the " cash-for-clunkers " bill , ohio congresswoman betty sutton , signaled she may drop a provision limiting the subsidies to purchases of north american made vehicles .
the provision has been a major sticking point in congressional efforts to merge competing proposals for the program , and sutton 's move brings those who are opposed to the north america requirement closer to a compromise with those who support it .
" it 's not so important to me that it has to be done " exactly according to her bill , but rather that a program is passed , sutton told reporters on capitol hill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany allows trade-ins for german and foreign cars germany , france , and slovakia - as well as china - have already enacted such trade-in programs but a central feature of the european programs is that they apply to all vehicles , whether assembled in europe or abroad .
the us may now follow suit as congressional aides redouble their efforts to find common ground on compromise legislation that could clear congress within months .
but even if a compromise is reached , lawmakers must find funding for the program .
some have suggested that the money would come from the economic stimulus package passed earlier this year .
proponents say the program - to provide new-car discounts of $ 1,500 to $ 7,500 -lrb- 1,150 euros – 5,700 euros -rrb- , depending on the proposal - is desperately needed to lift slumping car sales . nda / mll , reuters / wall street journal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said an alliance with fiat would lead to massive job cuts at opel and the closure of german factories after bundestag elections in september .
opel has around 25,000 workers .

deutsche welle correspondent dorian jones reports that the process carries some risk for the turkish government . the turkish minister for eu affairs , egemen bagis , said thursday the process , which is taking place under swiss supervision , aimed to bring about a fundamental change in bilateral relations between the two countries .
" better relations , more neighborly relations , more trade , more opportunities and cooperation and peace - i see a light at the end of the tunnel , that peace is possible , " he said .
a senior western diplomat , who spoke on condition of anonymity , told reuters news agency that the deal had not yet been signed but that turkey and armenia had agreed on diplomatic ties , opening the border and establishing commissions to address historical disputes .
" all the documents have been agreed in principle but it 's from the signing that the clock starts ticking , " the diplomat said .
" it is a finite period that is not very long .
we are talking about weeks or months . "
old wounds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some armenian groups have long opposed reconciliation with turkey in armenia , several thousand protesters , mainly supporters of a nationalist junior partner in the government , burned turkish flags and condemned the efforts at normalizing relations .
at the heart of ongoing tensions between the countries are accusations by armenia that turkey was directly responsible for what it calls the genocide of 1.5 million armenians in 1915 during world war i , a charge strongly denied by ankara turkey officially admits that as many as 600,000 armenians died during the war and deportation from eastern anatolia , but it insists the deaths must be seen in the context of an armenian uprising at a time when armenians were siding with invading russian troops earlier this week , ankara recalled its ambassador from canada after the canadian prime minister supported the genocide charge .
eyes on obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama looks likely to ease pressure on turkey after the talks with armenia ankara now fears us president barack obama will do the same .
during his presidential campaign obama said he would recognize the genocide if elected .
but yasemin congar , deputy editor of the turkish daily taraf , said obama may now hold back as a result of the new rapprochement efforts .
" washington wants to see turkey open its border with armenia , " she said .
" they want to see ankara and yerevan normalize diplomatic relations and there is a movement to that end .
" i think obama wants to give the message to ankara that if this process goes on it might even stop him from saying the ' g ' word , the genocide word in washington . "
during his visit to turkey earlier this month obama avoided using the so-called " g " word .
instead he praised the turkish and armenian rapprochement efforts .
eve of remembrance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflict between armenia and azerbaijan over nagorno-karabahk displaced hundreds of thousands the timing of turkey 's announcement of its agreement with armenia is being seen as no coincidence .
it comes just one day before armenians around the world remember those killed in 1915 .
traditionally , us presidents deliver a speech to mark the event .
us-based armenian groups have been lobbying obama intensively to use his expected speech to recognize the genocide .
that is now seen as unlikely in light of the new rapprochement efforts .
obama is also aware that a reference to genocide would seriously damage us-turkey relations .
the turkish government is paying a heavy domestic political price for its rapprochement efforts , since turkey 's close relationship to armenia 's rival , azerbaijan , is seen to be at risk .
sixteen years ago , armenia occupied nearly 20 percent of azerbaijan following a war over the disputed enclave of nagorno-karabakh . turkey imposed a trade embargo against armenia in support of its ally .
" all turkish press , all political opposition , is using the azerbaijani issue against the government .
i think the government finds itself in a very difficult position , " said political scientist nuray mert .
such pressure is already having an effect , with the turkish prime minister now linking the ending of the embargo to the withdrawal of armenian forces from azerbaijan .
that is seen as unlikely anytime soon .
turkish news reports have said azerbaijan is disturbed by the reconciliation efforts , which could lead to the reopening of the turkish-armenian border .
but with ankara facing increasing pressure from both the us and the eu to end the embargo , the turkish government now finds itself between a rock and a hard place .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 23.04.2009 donors pledge $ 213 million for security in somalia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalia has been locked in a cycle of chaos and violence for nearly two decades international donors have pledged 213 million dollars -lrb- 163 million euros -rrb- to help bolster security in somalia , a key to helping end attacks by pirates off the country 's coast . donors made the pledges at a conference in brussels thursday at which united nations secretary general ban ki-moon and somalia 's president , sheikh sharif ahmed , appealed for funds to help end two decades of lawlessness in the east african country .
organizers of the meeting , chaired by ban and the african union , had said more than $ 250 million was needed to improve security in a state which has had no central government since former president mohamed siad barre was ousted in 1991 , setting off a bloody cycle of clashes between rival factions .
eu officials said the aim was to build up a police force of some 10,000 officers and a security force of 5,000 .
support is also sought for the 4,300-strong african union mission amisom .
the amisom force - the only security presence backing the government - is well short of the 8,000 soldiers initially planned and is regularly attacked by the islamist shebab militia .
" restoring security and stability in somalia is vital to the success of the reconciliation effort and the survival of the unity government , " ban told the conference , held under the auspices of the united nations .
" much remains to be done . "
ban reiterated he had no intention of sending a un force to somalia any time soon , saying that the united nations should take a cautious and incremental approach to sending its own peacekeeping mission , and only " when the security conditions are appropriate . "
target likely to be exceeded after delegates underlined the challenges facing the war-torn country , organizers said donors had promised funding which was likely to exceed their initial expectations .
" we are on target , we are even a little bit higher because the target was $ 250 million , " said eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel .
" it seems that we are also above 250 million if you take into account material aid . "
" it 's really a full success , " he added to reporters after the four-hour conference in brussels .
the european commission , whose president jose manuel barroso also attended , had announced it would pledge at least 60 million euros on the eve of the meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamists have battled numerous governments president ahmed , who took office in january , made a personal plea for funds at the conference .
" solving this problem will require a radical solution , " said ahmed .
" the restoration of security and peace in somalia is the basis of any solution to the problems , " he said .
islamist fighters including the hard-line shebab militia have waged battles against the transitional government , its predecessor cabinet and their allies , vowing to fight until all foreign forces withdraw and sharia law is imposed .
more than one million people have fled their homes .
fewer than one in three somalis , whose life expectancy is 46 years , have access to clean water .
general instability and lawlessness while the conference was not focused on piracy , the high media profile of the growing number of cases of daring raids on freighters on the seas of the gulf of aden has become synonymous with somalia 's woes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international anti-piracy efforts face a tough mission " piracy is not a water-borne disease .
it is a symptom of anarchy and insecurity on the ground , " ban said .
" dealing with it requires an integrated strategy that addresses the fundamental issue of lawlessness in somalia . "
despite international naval missions - including from nato and the european union - piracy has mushroomed over the last year , as ransom-hunting somalis tackle ever-bigger and more distant prizes .
more than 130 merchant ships were attacked in the region last year , an increase of more than 200 percent on 2007 , the international maritime bureau said .
a tenfold increase was noted in the first three months of 2009 .
" if we only treat the symptoms , piracy at sea , but not its root causes - the decay of the state and poverty - we will fail , " barroso said .
non-governmental organization oxfam said the conference was being held at a critical moment for 3.2 million somalis desperately in need of aid , more than a million of whom have fled their homes to avoid fighting in the last two years .
" the piracy issue that has grabbed international headlines is a symptom of deeper issues that have gone unaddressed ever since the collapse of the national government in 1991 , " oxfam 's robert maletta said in a statement .
ahmed underlined : " it is our duty to pursue these criminals not only on the high seas but also on terra firma . "

" it is our hope that any car scrappage legislation ultimately enacted will remedy these concerns , and that the eu will be able to support this important initiative to promote fuel-efficiency , reduce pollution , and provide a needed boost to the automobile industry , " john bruton , the eu 's ambassador to the united states , said in a letter sent to the us congress on wednesday .
president barack obama supports passage of a " cash-for-clunkers " bill to pay people to turn in their gas guzzlers and replace them with more fuel-efficient vehicles .
but bruton said europe is worried that a leading version of the legislation , " as currently drafted , provides benefits only for replacement vehicles assembled in the u.s. or north america , a distinction that would harm car manufacturers from other parts of the world , including europe . "
such a provision , he added , would be " a clear violation " of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- rules requiring a country 's laws to treat foreign and domestic products equally .
possible compromise on north american provision europe 's fears and the concerns that the eu and us may bring their differences before the wto were partially allayed on thursday when got a boost after a leading proponent of the " cash-for-clunkers " bill , ohio congresswoman betty sutton , signaled she may drop a provision limiting the subsidies to purchases of north american made vehicles .
the provision has been a major sticking point in congressional efforts to merge competing proposals for the program , and sutton 's move brings those who are opposed to the north america requirement closer to a compromise with those who support it .
" it 's not so important to me that it has to be done " exactly according to her bill , but rather that a program is passed , sutton told reporters on capitol hill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany allows trade-ins for german and foreign cars germany , france , and slovakia - as well as china - have already enacted such trade-in programs but a central feature of the european programs is that they apply to all vehicles , whether assembled in europe or abroad .
the us may now follow suit as congressional aides redouble their efforts to find common ground on compromise legislation that could clear congress within months .
but even if a compromise is reached , lawmakers must find funding for the program .
some have suggested that the money would come from the economic stimulus package passed earlier this year .
proponents say the program - to provide new-car discounts of $ 1,500 to $ 7,500 -lrb- 1,150 euros – 5,700 euros -rrb- , depending on the proposal - is desperately needed to lift slumping car sales . nda / mll , reuters / wall street journal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 23.04.2009 turkey and armenia agree on reconciliation roadmap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish president abdullah gul , left , and armenian president serzh sargsyan met in 2008 turkey and armenia have reached an agreement on a comprehensive framework to normalize relations .
deutsche welle correspondent dorian jones reports that the process carries some risk for the turkish government . the turkish minister for eu affairs , egemen bagis , said thursday the process , which is taking place under swiss supervision , aimed to bring about a fundamental change in bilateral relations between the two countries .
" better relations , more neighborly relations , more trade , more opportunities and cooperation and peace - i see a light at the end of the tunnel , that peace is possible , " he said .
a senior western diplomat , who spoke on condition of anonymity , told reuters news agency that the deal had not yet been signed but that turkey and armenia had agreed on diplomatic ties , opening the border and establishing commissions to address historical disputes .
" all the documents have been agreed in principle but it 's from the signing that the clock starts ticking , " the diplomat said .
" it is a finite period that is not very long .
we are talking about weeks or months . "
old wounds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some armenian groups have long opposed reconciliation with turkey in armenia , several thousand protesters , mainly supporters of a nationalist junior partner in the government , burned turkish flags and condemned the efforts at normalizing relations .
at the heart of ongoing tensions between the countries are accusations by armenia that turkey was directly responsible for what it calls the genocide of 1.5 million armenians in 1915 during world war i , a charge strongly denied by ankara turkey officially admits that as many as 600,000 armenians died during the war and deportation from eastern anatolia , but it insists the deaths must be seen in the context of an armenian uprising at a time when armenians were siding with invading russian troops earlier this week , ankara recalled its ambassador from canada after the canadian prime minister supported the genocide charge .
eyes on obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama looks likely to ease pressure on turkey after the talks with armenia ankara now fears us president barack obama will do the same .
during his presidential campaign obama said he would recognize the genocide if elected .
but yasemin congar , deputy editor of the turkish daily taraf , said obama may now hold back as a result of the new rapprochement efforts .
" washington wants to see turkey open its border with armenia , " she said .
" they want to see ankara and yerevan normalize diplomatic relations and there is a movement to that end .
" i think obama wants to give the message to ankara that if this process goes on it might even stop him from saying the ' g ' word , the genocide word in washington . "
during his visit to turkey earlier this month obama avoided using the so-called " g " word .
instead he praised the turkish and armenian rapprochement efforts .
eve of remembrance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflict between armenia and azerbaijan over nagorno-karabahk displaced hundreds of thousands the timing of turkey 's announcement of its agreement with armenia is being seen as no coincidence .
it comes just one day before armenians around the world remember those killed in 1915 .
traditionally , us presidents deliver a speech to mark the event .
us-based armenian groups have been lobbying obama intensively to use his expected speech to recognize the genocide .
that is now seen as unlikely in light of the new rapprochement efforts .
obama is also aware that a reference to genocide would seriously damage us-turkey relations .
the turkish government is paying a heavy domestic political price for its rapprochement efforts , since turkey 's close relationship to armenia 's rival , azerbaijan , is seen to be at risk .
sixteen years ago , armenia occupied nearly 20 percent of azerbaijan following a war over the disputed enclave of nagorno-karabakh . turkey imposed a trade embargo against armenia in support of its ally .
" all turkish press , all political opposition , is using the azerbaijani issue against the government .
i think the government finds itself in a very difficult position , " said political scientist nuray mert .
such pressure is already having an effect , with the turkish prime minister now linking the ending of the embargo to the withdrawal of armenian forces from azerbaijan .
that is seen as unlikely anytime soon .
turkish news reports have said azerbaijan is disturbed by the reconciliation efforts , which could lead to the reopening of the turkish-armenian border .
but with ankara facing increasing pressure from both the us and the eu to end the embargo , the turkish government now finds itself between a rock and a hard place .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 23.04.2009 eu fears washington 's car trade-in plans unfairly favor us industry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trade-in programs are supposed to encourage a switch to greener models the us would violate world trade rules if proposed government payments to encourage consumers to trade in old gas-guzzling cars can be used to buy only new american-made vehicles , according to an eu official . " it is our hope that any car scrappage legislation ultimately enacted will remedy these concerns , and that the eu will be able to support this important initiative to promote fuel-efficiency , reduce pollution , and provide a needed boost to the automobile industry , " john bruton , the eu 's ambassador to the united states , said in a letter sent to the us congress on wednesday .
president barack obama supports passage of a " cash-for-clunkers " bill to pay people to turn in their gas guzzlers and replace them with more fuel-efficient vehicles .
but bruton said europe is worried that a leading version of the legislation , " as currently drafted , provides benefits only for replacement vehicles assembled in the u.s. or north america , a distinction that would harm car manufacturers from other parts of the world , including europe . "
such a provision , he added , would be " a clear violation " of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- rules requiring a country 's laws to treat foreign and domestic products equally .
possible compromise on north american provision europe 's fears and the concerns that the eu and us may bring their differences before the wto were partially allayed on thursday when got a boost after a leading proponent of the " cash-for-clunkers " bill , ohio congresswoman betty sutton , signaled she may drop a provision limiting the subsidies to purchases of north american made vehicles .
the provision has been a major sticking point in congressional efforts to merge competing proposals for the program , and sutton 's move brings those who are opposed to the north america requirement closer to a compromise with those who support it .
" it 's not so important to me that it has to be done " exactly according to her bill , but rather that a program is passed , sutton told reporters on capitol hill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany allows trade-ins for german and foreign cars germany , france , and slovakia - as well as china - have already enacted such trade-in programs but a central feature of the european programs is that they apply to all vehicles , whether assembled in europe or abroad .
the us may now follow suit as congressional aides redouble their efforts to find common ground on compromise legislation that could clear congress within months .
but even if a compromise is reached , lawmakers must find funding for the program .
some have suggested that the money would come from the economic stimulus package passed earlier this year .
proponents say the program - to provide new-car discounts of $ 1,500 to $ 7,500 -lrb- 1,150 euros – 5,700 euros -rrb- , depending on the proposal - is desperately needed to lift slumping car sales . nda / mll , reuters / wall street journal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

organizers of the meeting , chaired by ban and the african union , had said more than $ 250 million was needed to improve security in a state which has had no central government since former president mohamed siad barre was ousted in 1991 , setting off a bloody cycle of clashes between rival factions .
eu officials said the aim was to build up a police force of some 10,000 officers and a security force of 5,000 .
support is also sought for the 4,300-strong african union mission amisom .
the amisom force - the only security presence backing the government - is well short of the 8,000 soldiers initially planned and is regularly attacked by the islamist shebab militia .
" restoring security and stability in somalia is vital to the success of the reconciliation effort and the survival of the unity government , " ban told the conference , held under the auspices of the united nations .
" much remains to be done . "
ban reiterated he had no intention of sending a un force to somalia any time soon , saying that the united nations should take a cautious and incremental approach to sending its own peacekeeping mission , and only " when the security conditions are appropriate . "
target likely to be exceeded after delegates underlined the challenges facing the war-torn country , organizers said donors had promised funding which was likely to exceed their initial expectations .
" we are on target , we are even a little bit higher because the target was $ 250 million , " said eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel .
" it seems that we are also above 250 million if you take into account material aid . "
" it 's really a full success , " he added to reporters after the four-hour conference in brussels .
the european commission , whose president jose manuel barroso also attended , had announced it would pledge at least 60 million euros on the eve of the meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamists have battled numerous governments president ahmed , who took office in january , made a personal plea for funds at the conference .
" solving this problem will require a radical solution , " said ahmed .
" the restoration of security and peace in somalia is the basis of any solution to the problems , " he said .
islamist fighters including the hard-line shebab militia have waged battles against the transitional government , its predecessor cabinet and their allies , vowing to fight until all foreign forces withdraw and sharia law is imposed .
more than one million people have fled their homes .
fewer than one in three somalis , whose life expectancy is 46 years , have access to clean water .
general instability and lawlessness while the conference was not focused on piracy , the high media profile of the growing number of cases of daring raids on freighters on the seas of the gulf of aden has become synonymous with somalia 's woes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international anti-piracy efforts face a tough mission " piracy is not a water-borne disease .
it is a symptom of anarchy and insecurity on the ground , " ban said .
" dealing with it requires an integrated strategy that addresses the fundamental issue of lawlessness in somalia . "
despite international naval missions - including from nato and the european union - piracy has mushroomed over the last year , as ransom-hunting somalis tackle ever-bigger and more distant prizes .
more than 130 merchant ships were attacked in the region last year , an increase of more than 200 percent on 2007 , the international maritime bureau said .
a tenfold increase was noted in the first three months of 2009 .
" if we only treat the symptoms , piracy at sea , but not its root causes - the decay of the state and poverty - we will fail , " barroso said .
non-governmental organization oxfam said the conference was being held at a critical moment for 3.2 million somalis desperately in need of aid , more than a million of whom have fled their homes to avoid fighting in the last two years .
" the piracy issue that has grabbed international headlines is a symptom of deeper issues that have gone unaddressed ever since the collapse of the national government in 1991 , " oxfam 's robert maletta said in a statement .
ahmed underlined : " it is our duty to pursue these criminals not only on the high seas but also on terra firma . "

organizers of the meeting , chaired by ban and the african union , had said more than $ 250 million was needed to improve security in a state which has had no central government since former president mohamed siad barre was ousted in 1991 , setting off a bloody cycle of clashes between rival factions .
eu officials said the aim was to build up a police force of some 10,000 officers and a security force of 5,000 .
support is also sought for the 4,300-strong african union mission amisom .
the amisom force - the only security presence backing the government - is well short of the 8,000 soldiers initially planned and is regularly attacked by the islamist shebab militia .
" restoring security and stability in somalia is vital to the success of the reconciliation effort and the survival of the unity government , " ban told the conference , held under the auspices of the united nations .
" much remains to be done . "
ban reiterated he had no intention of sending a un force to somalia any time soon , saying that the united nations should take a cautious and incremental approach to sending its own peacekeeping mission , and only " when the security conditions are appropriate . "
target likely to be exceeded after delegates underlined the challenges facing the war-torn country , organizers said donors had promised funding which was likely to exceed their initial expectations .
" we are on target , we are even a little bit higher because the target was $ 250 million , " said eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel .
" it seems that we are also above 250 million if you take into account material aid . "
" it 's really a full success , " he added to reporters after the four-hour conference in brussels .
the european commission , whose president jose manuel barroso also attended , had announced it would pledge at least 60 million euros on the eve of the meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamists have battled numerous governments president ahmed , who took office in january , made a personal plea for funds at the conference .
" solving this problem will require a radical solution , " said ahmed .
" the restoration of security and peace in somalia is the basis of any solution to the problems , " he said .
islamist fighters including the hard-line shebab militia have waged battles against the transitional government , its predecessor cabinet and their allies , vowing to fight until all foreign forces withdraw and sharia law is imposed .
more than one million people have fled their homes .
fewer than one in three somalis , whose life expectancy is 46 years , have access to clean water .
general instability and lawlessness while the conference was not focused on piracy , the high media profile of the growing number of cases of daring raids on freighters on the seas of the gulf of aden has become synonymous with somalia 's woes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international anti-piracy efforts face a tough mission " piracy is not a water-borne disease .
it is a symptom of anarchy and insecurity on the ground , " ban said .
" dealing with it requires an integrated strategy that addresses the fundamental issue of lawlessness in somalia . "
despite international naval missions - including from nato and the european union - piracy has mushroomed over the last year , as ransom-hunting somalis tackle ever-bigger and more distant prizes .
more than 130 merchant ships were attacked in the region last year , an increase of more than 200 percent on 2007 , the international maritime bureau said .
a tenfold increase was noted in the first three months of 2009 .
" if we only treat the symptoms , piracy at sea , but not its root causes - the decay of the state and poverty - we will fail , " barroso said .
non-governmental organization oxfam said the conference was being held at a critical moment for 3.2 million somalis desperately in need of aid , more than a million of whom have fled their homes to avoid fighting in the last two years .
" the piracy issue that has grabbed international headlines is a symptom of deeper issues that have gone unaddressed ever since the collapse of the national government in 1991 , " oxfam 's robert maletta said in a statement .
ahmed underlined : " it is our duty to pursue these criminals not only on the high seas but also on terra firma . "

" what seat would be more appropriate than a land wounded by the earthquake ? "
berlusconi told a news conference in l 'aquila on thursday , after holding a cabinet meeting in the stricken town .
berlusconi said moving the meeting of the heads of government of the world 's richest countries , currently set to take place on la maddalena , a small island off sardinia , would be a " positive signal for the more than 60,000 people still living in temporary camps . "

the decision to move the summit was dependent on approval from the other nations attending the summit scheduled for july 8-10 there have already been signs of dissent within berlusconi 's cabinet over moving the g8 summit , with at least one minister saying it was " implausible " and would be difficult to pull off .

" it is our hope that any car scrappage legislation ultimately enacted will remedy these concerns , and that the eu will be able to support this important initiative to promote fuel-efficiency , reduce pollution , and provide a needed boost to the automobile industry , " john bruton , the eu 's ambassador to the united states , said in a letter sent to the us congress on wednesday .
president barack obama supports passage of a " cash-for-clunkers " bill to pay people to turn in their gas guzzlers and replace them with more fuel-efficient vehicles .
but bruton said europe is worried that a leading version of the legislation , " as currently drafted , provides benefits only for replacement vehicles assembled in the u.s. or north america , a distinction that would harm car manufacturers from other parts of the world , including europe . "
such a provision , he added , would be " a clear violation " of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- rules requiring a country 's laws to treat foreign and domestic products equally .
possible compromise on north american provision europe 's fears and the concerns that the eu and us may bring their differences before the wto were partially allayed on thursday when got a boost after a leading proponent of the " cash-for-clunkers " bill , ohio congresswoman betty sutton , signaled she may drop a provision limiting the subsidies to purchases of north american made vehicles .
the provision has been a major sticking point in congressional efforts to merge competing proposals for the program , and sutton 's move brings those who are opposed to the north america requirement closer to a compromise with those who support it .
" it 's not so important to me that it has to be done " exactly according to her bill , but rather that a program is passed , sutton told reporters on capitol hill .

deutsche welle correspondent dorian jones reports that the process carries some risk for the turkish government . the turkish minister for eu affairs , egemen bagis , said thursday the process , which is taking place under swiss supervision , aimed to bring about a fundamental change in bilateral relations between the two countries .
" better relations , more neighborly relations , more trade , more opportunities and cooperation and peace - i see a light at the end of the tunnel , that peace is possible , " he said .
a senior western diplomat , who spoke on condition of anonymity , told reuters news agency that the deal had not yet been signed but that turkey and armenia had agreed on diplomatic ties , opening the border and establishing commissions to address historical disputes .
" all the documents have been agreed in principle but it 's from the signing that the clock starts ticking , " the diplomat said .
" it is a finite period that is not very long .
we are talking about weeks or months . "
old wounds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some armenian groups have long opposed reconciliation with turkey in armenia , several thousand protesters , mainly supporters of a nationalist junior partner in the government , burned turkish flags and condemned the efforts at normalizing relations .
at the heart of ongoing tensions between the countries are accusations by armenia that turkey was directly responsible for what it calls the genocide of 1.5 million armenians in 1915 during world war i , a charge strongly denied by ankara turkey officially admits that as many as 600,000 armenians died during the war and deportation from eastern anatolia , but it insists the deaths must be seen in the context of an armenian uprising at a time when armenians were siding with invading russian troops earlier this week , ankara recalled its ambassador from canada after the canadian prime minister supported the genocide charge .
eyes on obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama looks likely to ease pressure on turkey after the talks with armenia ankara now fears us president barack obama will do the same .
during his presidential campaign obama said he would recognize the genocide if elected .
but yasemin congar , deputy editor of the turkish daily taraf , said obama may now hold back as a result of the new rapprochement efforts .
" washington wants to see turkey open its border with armenia , " she said .
" they want to see ankara and yerevan normalize diplomatic relations and there is a movement to that end .
" i think obama wants to give the message to ankara that if this process goes on it might even stop him from saying the ' g ' word , the genocide word in washington . "
during his visit to turkey earlier this month obama avoided using the so-called " g " word .
instead he praised the turkish and armenian rapprochement efforts .
eve of remembrance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflict between armenia and azerbaijan over nagorno-karabahk displaced hundreds of thousands the timing of turkey 's announcement of its agreement with armenia is being seen as no coincidence .
it comes just one day before armenians around the world remember those killed in 1915 .
traditionally , us presidents deliver a speech to mark the event .
us-based armenian groups have been lobbying obama intensively to use his expected speech to recognize the genocide .
that is now seen as unlikely in light of the new rapprochement efforts .
obama is also aware that a reference to genocide would seriously damage us-turkey relations .
the turkish government is paying a heavy domestic political price for its rapprochement efforts , since turkey 's close relationship to armenia 's rival , azerbaijan , is seen to be at risk .
sixteen years ago , armenia occupied nearly 20 percent of azerbaijan following a war over the disputed enclave of nagorno-karabakh . turkey imposed a trade embargo against armenia in support of its ally .
" all turkish press , all political opposition , is using the azerbaijani issue against the government .
i think the government finds itself in a very difficult position , " said political scientist nuray mert .
such pressure is already having an effect , with the turkish prime minister now linking the ending of the embargo to the withdrawal of armenian forces from azerbaijan .
that is seen as unlikely anytime soon .
turkish news reports have said azerbaijan is disturbed by the reconciliation efforts , which could lead to the reopening of the turkish-armenian border .
but with ankara facing increasing pressure from both the us and the eu to end the embargo , the turkish government now finds itself between a rock and a hard place .

the turkish government is paying a heavy domestic political price for its rapprochement efforts , since turkey 's close relationship to armenia 's rival , azerbaijan , is seen to be at risk .
sixteen years ago , armenia occupied nearly 20 percent of azerbaijan following a war over the disputed enclave of nagorno-karabakh . turkey imposed a trade embargo against armenia in support of its ally .
" all turkish press , all political opposition , is using the azerbaijani issue against the government .
i think the government finds itself in a very difficult position , " said political scientist nuray mert .
such pressure is already having an effect , with the turkish prime minister now linking the ending of the embargo to the withdrawal of armenian forces from azerbaijan .
that is seen as unlikely anytime soon .
turkish news reports have said azerbaijan is disturbed by the reconciliation efforts , which could lead to the reopening of the turkish-armenian border .
but with ankara facing increasing pressure from both the us and the eu to end the embargo , the turkish government now finds itself between a rock and a hard place .

their forecast is even gloomier than the imf 's prediction for 2009 . germany 's leading economic institutes are predicting the worst economic decline since the country was founded in 1949 . in their annual spring report , they say the country 's economy will shrink by 6.0 percent this year .
the world 's top exporter is not likely to see an improvement any time soon , either . the institutes predict that the recession will continue into 2010 , with the economy contracting by 0.5 percent next year . the economic experts also say unemployment will rise to just under five million jobless by the end of next year . " on the basis of leading indicators , the institutes expect that the downward trend to continue and do not believe it will bottom out before the middle of 2010 , " the widely-watched report states . the institutes publish their outlook twice a year . the spring report 2009 comes a day after the latest projections by the international monetary fund , imf , which said the german economy was likely to contract by 5.6 percent , pushing unemployment rates up .
with global trade shrinking and the world economy gripped by recession , the international monetary fund has slashed its 2009 growth forecast for the entire 16-member euro zone by another one to 4.2 percent .
dire predictions but while their prognosis for germany looked especially bad , the imf said germany 's government still had more room to maneuver because of sound fiscal policies in the past , and should be spending extra public funds to make up for the massive decline in exports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck and guttenberg have their work cut out for them " could they do more ?
the answer is yes , " imf economist jorg decressin said .
" this is a case where a country has done its homework during the good times ... and can take advantage of this during the bad times . "
as the world 's leading export nation , germany now appears to be bearing the brunt of the global recession , with the imf saying unemployment could climb to 10.8 percent in 2010 from 9 percent this year .
germany 's jobless rate was 7.3 percent last year .
“ i think we were all agreed around the table that we have a very difficult year ahead of us , " said german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg at a news conference on wednesday following an economic summit with chancellor angela merkel and leaders from industry and unions . finance minister peer steinbrueck told reporters there had been a slump of 3.3 percent in the first three months of the year .
labor market crisis the imf 's latest world economic outlook underscores the risks that the economic crisis is rapidly turning into a labor market crisis , with euro-zone unemployment set to rise this year to 10.1 percent before edging up to 11.5 percent in 2010 .
this is despite the massive stimulus packages introduced by european governments and the number of companies across europe placing employees on short-term working contracts rather than laying them off .
the euro-zone jobless rate stood at 7.6 percent in 2008 .
" the euro area is coming out of this crisis somewhat later than the us because to some extent the policy stimulus kicked in later , " decressin told reporters in washington .
but it is a picture repeated across europe , with the imf saying france faces a 3 percent fall in growth in 2009 and a meagre 0.4 percent pickup next year , while italian gdp should sink by 4.4 percent this year .
britain , which has been battling with falling consumer demand , a housing market collapse and a drawing in of its key financial sector , is expected to stage only a modest recovery after this year 's 4.1 percent contraction .
the imf predicts british unemployment will jump from 7.4 percent in 2009 to 9.2 percent next year .
ireland has been particularly badly hit by the world recession and the credit crunch , and the imf predicts that irish economic growth will fall by a disastrous 8 percent this year and by 3 percent in 2010 after a collapse in the nation 's construction boom . db / pfd , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their forecast is even gloomier than the imf 's prediction for 2009 . germany 's leading economic institutes are predicting the worst economic decline since the country was founded in 1949 . in their annual spring report , they say the country 's economy will shrink by 6.0 percent this year .
the world 's top exporter is not likely to see an improvement any time soon , either . the institutes predict that the recession will continue into 2010 , with the economy contracting by 0.5 percent next year . the economic experts also say unemployment will rise to just under five million jobless by the end of next year . " on the basis of leading indicators , the institutes expect that the downward trend to continue and do not believe it will bottom out before the middle of 2010 , " the widely-watched report states . the institutes publish their outlook twice a year . the spring report 2009 comes a day after the latest projections by the international monetary fund , imf , which said the german economy was likely to contract by 5.6 percent , pushing unemployment rates up .
with global trade shrinking and the world economy gripped by recession , the international monetary fund has slashed its 2009 growth forecast for the entire 16-member euro zone by another one to 4.2 percent .
dire predictions but while their prognosis for germany looked especially bad , the imf said germany 's government still had more room to maneuver because of sound fiscal policies in the past , and should be spending extra public funds to make up for the massive decline in exports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck and guttenberg have their work cut out for them " could they do more ?
the answer is yes , " imf economist jorg decressin said .
" this is a case where a country has done its homework during the good times ... and can take advantage of this during the bad times . "
as the world 's leading export nation , germany now appears to be bearing the brunt of the global recession , with the imf saying unemployment could climb to 10.8 percent in 2010 from 9 percent this year .
germany 's jobless rate was 7.3 percent last year .
“ i think we were all agreed around the table that we have a very difficult year ahead of us , " said german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg at a news conference on wednesday following an economic summit with chancellor angela merkel and leaders from industry and unions . finance minister peer steinbrueck told reporters there had been a slump of 3.3 percent in the first three months of the year .
labor market crisis the imf 's latest world economic outlook underscores the risks that the economic crisis is rapidly turning into a labor market crisis , with euro-zone unemployment set to rise this year to 10.1 percent before edging up to 11.5 percent in 2010 .
this is despite the massive stimulus packages introduced by european governments and the number of companies across europe placing employees on short-term working contracts rather than laying them off .
the euro-zone jobless rate stood at 7.6 percent in 2008 .
" the euro area is coming out of this crisis somewhat later than the us because to some extent the policy stimulus kicked in later , " decressin told reporters in washington .
but it is a picture repeated across europe , with the imf saying france faces a 3 percent fall in growth in 2009 and a meagre 0.4 percent pickup next year , while italian gdp should sink by 4.4 percent this year .
britain , which has been battling with falling consumer demand , a housing market collapse and a drawing in of its key financial sector , is expected to stage only a modest recovery after this year 's 4.1 percent contraction .
the imf predicts british unemployment will jump from 7.4 percent in 2009 to 9.2 percent next year .

german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier says a german woman held in mali has been freed , along with three other hostages .
al-qaeda 's north african branch had claimed responsibility for the abductions . a german tourist who was taken hostage by islamists three months ago in mali was released wednesday evening , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in berlin .
the 77-year-old woman was one of four western tourists abducted on january 22 during a trip to niger and mali .
steinmeier said that the woman was in the care of mali government officials and that she was exhausted by the ordeal and hardship of three months in captivity .
steinmeier also thanked mali president amadou toumani toure , who had cooperated closely with berlin to end the abduction .
a spokesperson for the mali government said that that two canadian un diplomats and a woman from switzerland have also been released .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 23.04.2009 germans get taller - and wider großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the first mass measuring in germany to use high-resolution laser scanning technology a survey supported by clothes and car manufacturers has shown that women have grown on average at least 4 cm around the hips while the average man has gone up by two chest sizes . using the latest in 3d scanner technology , human solutions and the textile research institute hohenstein took 70 separate measurements in sitting and standing positions .
the information , the most extensive of its kind to date , will be analyzed by manufacturers who hope eventually to adapt clothing measurements to suit the new german figure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : textile scientists are collaborating with electronics specialists who measure bodies with lasers thomas rasch is the director of germanfashion , an organization that represents the german clothing industry .
he does n't expect dramatic changes because of the findings but he says it is sure to influence the way some stores mark and manufacture their sizes in future . “ now that we know exactly what the proportions are in the population of germany , we can check the decisions we already made .
i do n't think it will be a revolution in labeling but we will fine tune it , ” he says .
more than 13,000 people between the ages of eight and 86 took part in the survey , which will also be used to benefit furniture design , car interiors - including the length of seat belts - and even operating tables .
this was the first such survey of women in 15 years and the first for men in almost three decades .
tangible effects will take some time to implement .
sizegermany 's project manager dr. rainer trieb says it will be several months at least before the findings can be incorporated into new designs .
“ information will be integrated into new products for the coming seasons on a step by step basis .
maybe these results will be completely integrated in the next two or three years , ” he says .
if the shoe fits interest from the clothing sector is not completely altruistic .
a foreseeable side-effect of better-fitting clothing is that people buy more .
the findings have also raised the question of how shops choose to depict clothes sizes .
it is often the case that if people feel they fit into a smaller size that they are more inclined to make a purchase .
for rasch there is still a long way to go before there is any real parity in clothes sizing and even longer before retailers across europe agree on a unified system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : because germans are getting bigger , fewer people fit into standard clothing sizes , set in the 1950s “ the one thing is the new data about the proportion of bodies and the other thing is the question of the future of the labeling of sizes .
retailers across europe have just started again with the discussion about size zero .
they have been discussing this for years and it will take another three years to harmonize , ” says rasch .
it also remains up to the individual brands to what extent they follow sizing guidelines .
luxury brands tailor clothes for a different demographic than high street stores , for example .
“ the decision of how to name a piece of clothing is a very individual and a very political decision which is very closely linked with marketing and image and all the things that make up a brand , ” rasch says .
the information from this survey will also form part of an ongoing research project of interest to the participating companies .
sizegermany has created an interactive portal where companies can access the data directly .
regular information from the federal statistics bureau will be included to allow companies to compare the data to changing demographics .
one final project is to combine recent body size information gathered from other european surveys .
one thing that has emerged from the statistics is that while germans are taller than they used to be - a fact linked to affluence , nutrition , and light - they have for the moment reached a growth cap .
the german waist though is still expanding .

maybe these results will be completely integrated in the next two or three years , ” he says .
if the shoe fits interest from the clothing sector is not completely altruistic .
a foreseeable side-effect of better-fitting clothing is that people buy more .
the findings have also raised the question of how shops choose to depict clothes sizes .
it is often the case that if people feel they fit into a smaller size that they are more inclined to make a purchase .
for rasch there is still a long way to go before there is any real parity in clothes sizing and even longer before retailers across europe agree on a unified system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : because germans are getting bigger , fewer people fit into standard clothing sizes , set in the 1950s “ the one thing is the new data about the proportion of bodies and the other thing is the question of the future of the labeling of sizes .
retailers across europe have just started again with the discussion about size zero .
they have been discussing this for years and it will take another three years to harmonize , ” says rasch .
it also remains up to the individual brands to what extent they follow sizing guidelines .
luxury brands tailor clothes for a different demographic than high street stores , for example .
“ the decision of how to name a piece of clothing is a very individual and a very political decision which is very closely linked with marketing and image and all the things that make up a brand , ” rasch says .
the information from this survey will also form part of an ongoing research project of interest to the participating companies .
sizegermany has created an interactive portal where companies can access the data directly .
regular information from the federal statistics bureau will be included to allow companies to compare the data to changing demographics .
one final project is to combine recent body size information gathered from other european surveys .
one thing that has emerged from the statistics is that while germans are taller than they used to be - a fact linked to affluence , nutrition , and light - they have for the moment reached a growth cap .
the german waist though is still expanding .

organizers of the meeting , chaired by ban and the african union , had said more than $ 250 million was needed to improve security in a state which has had no central government since former president mohamed siad barre was ousted in 1991 , setting off a bloody cycle of clashes between rival factions .
eu officials said the aim was to build up a police force of some 10,000 officers and a security force of 5,000 .
support is also sought for the 4,300-strong african union mission amisom .
the amisom force - the only security presence backing the government - is well short of the 8,000 soldiers initially planned and is regularly attacked by the islamist shebab militia .
" restoring security and stability in somalia is vital to the success of the reconciliation effort and the survival of the unity government , " ban told the conference , held under the auspices of the united nations .
" much remains to be done . "
ban reiterated he had no intention of sending a un force to somalia any time soon , saying that the united nations should take a cautious and incremental approach to sending its own peacekeeping mission , and only " when the security conditions are appropriate . "
target likely to be exceeded after delegates underlined the challenges facing the war-torn country , organizers said donors had promised funding which was likely to exceed their initial expectations .
" we are on target , we are even a little bit higher because the target was $ 250 million , " said eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel .
" it seems that we are also above 250 million if you take into account material aid . "
" it 's really a full success , " he added to reporters after the four-hour conference in brussels .
the european commission , whose president jose manuel barroso also attended , had announced it would pledge at least 60 million euros on the eve of the meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamists have battled numerous governments president ahmed , who took office in january , made a personal plea for funds at the conference .
" solving this problem will require a radical solution , " said ahmed .
" the restoration of security and peace in somalia is the basis of any solution to the problems , " he said .
islamist fighters including the hard-line shebab militia have waged battles against the transitional government , its predecessor cabinet and their allies , vowing to fight until all foreign forces withdraw and sharia law is imposed .
more than one million people have fled their homes .
fewer than one in three somalis , whose life expectancy is 46 years , have access to clean water .
general instability and lawlessness while the conference was not focused on piracy , the high media profile of the growing number of cases of daring raids on freighters on the seas of the gulf of aden has become synonymous with somalia 's woes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international anti-piracy efforts face a tough mission " piracy is not a water-borne disease .
it is a symptom of anarchy and insecurity on the ground , " ban said .
" dealing with it requires an integrated strategy that addresses the fundamental issue of lawlessness in somalia . "
despite international naval missions - including from nato and the european union - piracy has mushroomed over the last year , as ransom-hunting somalis tackle ever-bigger and more distant prizes .
more than 130 merchant ships were attacked in the region last year , an increase of more than 200 percent on 2007 , the international maritime bureau said .
a tenfold increase was noted in the first three months of 2009 .
" if we only treat the symptoms , piracy at sea , but not its root causes - the decay of the state and poverty - we will fail , " barroso said .
non-governmental organization oxfam said the conference was being held at a critical moment for 3.2 million somalis desperately in need of aid , more than a million of whom have fled their homes to avoid fighting in the last two years .
" the piracy issue that has grabbed international headlines is a symptom of deeper issues that have gone unaddressed ever since the collapse of the national government in 1991 , " oxfam 's robert maletta said in a statement .
ahmed underlined : " it is our duty to pursue these criminals not only on the high seas but also on terra firma . "

organizers of the meeting , chaired by ban and the african union , had said more than $ 250 million was needed to improve security in a state which has had no central government since former president mohamed siad barre was ousted in 1991 , setting off a bloody cycle of clashes between rival factions .
eu officials said the aim was to build up a police force of some 10,000 officers and a security force of 5,000 .
support is also sought for the 4,300-strong african union mission amisom .
the amisom force - the only security presence backing the government - is well short of the 8,000 soldiers initially planned and is regularly attacked by the islamist shebab militia .
" restoring security and stability in somalia is vital to the success of the reconciliation effort and the survival of the unity government , " ban told the conference , held under the auspices of the united nations .
" much remains to be done . "
ban reiterated he had no intention of sending a un force to somalia any time soon , saying that the united nations should take a cautious and incremental approach to sending its own peacekeeping mission , and only " when the security conditions are appropriate . "
target likely to be exceeded after delegates underlined the challenges facing the war-torn country , organizers said donors had promised funding which was likely to exceed their initial expectations .
" we are on target , we are even a little bit higher because the target was $ 250 million , " said eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel .
" it seems that we are also above 250 million if you take into account material aid . "
" it 's really a full success , " he added to reporters after the four-hour conference in brussels .
the european commission , whose president jose manuel barroso also attended , had announced it would pledge at least 60 million euros on the eve of the meeting .

" what seat would be more appropriate than a land wounded by the earthquake ? "
berlusconi told a news conference in l 'aquila on thursday , after holding a cabinet meeting in the stricken town .
berlusconi said moving the meeting of the heads of government of the world 's richest countries , currently set to take place on la maddalena , a small island off sardinia , would be a " positive signal for the more than 60,000 people still living in temporary camps . "
" the 21 heads of government who come will be able to see first-hand the wounds caused by this earthquake , " berlusconi added .
" i think it could work out very well . "
berlusconi looking to divert funds to disaster zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi will need to consult with g8 leaders on the move the italian leader , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the g8 club of industrialized nations , added that the 220 million euros -lrb- $ 286.5 million -rrb- needed for summit security and infrastructure in sardinia could this way be invested in the earthquake region instead .

" we will not participate in the election of a president , or in parliamentary sessions that will discuss it , " said mihai gimpu , leader of the opposition liberal party of moldova -lrb- lpm -rrb- .
disputed national elections earlier this month gave the ruling communists 60 seats in moldova 's 101-seat legislature , prompting violent clashes in the capital , chisinau .
opposition demonstrators accused the communists of voter fraud and battled with police on april 7 , leaving one dead , hundreds injured , and the parliament building ransacked and partially burned .

opposition aiming to block presidential selection moldova 's supreme court on thursday afternoon set a limit on the time allowed for the legislature to select a president , ruling that parliament must choose a new chief executive by july 7 .

if it fails to agree on a president by that date , the parliament must be dissolved and new elections would have to be held , the court said , setting the rival factions on a possible collision course once again .
independent observers including monitors from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- ruled moldova 's april 5 elections were generally free and fair .
moldovan president vladimir voronin , head of the communist party , took the country 's top office in 2001 and has held it ever since .
but as he is prevented by constitutional statute from continuing in office , a new president must be chosen .
concerned eu discuss sending mission to moldova meanwhile , european union external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner has backed the idea of sending an eu mission to moldova .
" personally i 'm in favor of such a mission , that 's absolutely clear .
now we have to work out the terms of reference of such a mission , " she told a press conference in brussels .
the idea of an investigative mission , including representatives from the european commission and the moldovan opposition was first mooted wednesday by czech president mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
topolanek made the suggestion during a visit to moldova where he met communist president vladimir voronin and opposition figures , saying it would help shed light on recent events and help restore calm .
the mission proposal will be put to a meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg on monday . nda / mll , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but there are fears over what that could mean for opel ’ s german workers . franz confirmed thursday reports that said fiat was ready to sign a declaration of intent on a takeover as early as next tuesday .
however he claimed fiat had no interest in a strategic partnership with opel .
he said an alliance with fiat would lead to massive job cuts at opel and the closure of german factories after bundestag elections in september .
opel has around 25,000 workers .
franz also said fiat , which has 14.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 18.4 billion -rrb- of debt sitting over its head , had no way of finding the 500 million euros in fresh capital gm is seeking from a suitor .
" fiat has … huge liquidity problems .
they ca n't get hold of money at the moment , " franz said .
" the government ca n't give guarantees for such a transparent plan . "
on thursday , fiat posted a first-quarter loss of 411 million euros and ruled out any direct investment as part of a potential deal for a strategic partnership with us peer chrysler .
" no agreements " roland koch , the premier of the german state of hesse , where opel has its headquarters , confirmed that fiat was involved in discussions over a potential takeover .
he said that canadian car parts maker magna was also interested in a stake , but that no agreements have been reached yet .
german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg also said no decision had been taken on fiat 's role in any takeover .

" on top of having a 100 percent overlapping product portfolio , fiat and opel also have a very much overlapping regional footprint … so i think that mr franz is being very polite .
i think that the long-term strategy of fiat is really to keep the market share and get rid of all the rest of opel . "
stuermer also said that fiat would most likely not be able to go it alone in its bid for control of opel .
" i think that fiat at the moment does not have the free cash lying around to just come up with the money .
they would certainly have to team up either with one of the other interested parties in investing in opel or with one of their own long-term partners from the agnelli family or wider italy . "
spokespeople from fiat and opel were unavailable for comment on thursday on the potential takeover .
two sides of the coin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel workers fear german production lines could be terminated pierluigi bellini , associate director of ihs 's automotive division in milan , agreed that a fiat-opel fusion would spell the end for thousands of german workers .

" but the other side of the coin is that work forces would need to be cut , both in germany and italy , and i do n't know if that is feasible now .

despite all the potential points of synergy , fiat faces an uphill battle to convince opel 's management and the industry at large that it has the capacity to take control of the german carmaker .

but there are fears over what that could mean for opel ’ s german workers . franz confirmed thursday reports that said fiat was ready to sign a declaration of intent on a takeover as early as next tuesday .
however he claimed fiat had no interest in a strategic partnership with opel .
he said an alliance with fiat would lead to massive job cuts at opel and the closure of german factories after bundestag elections in september .
opel has around 25,000 workers .
franz also said fiat , which has 14.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 18.4 billion -rrb- of debt sitting over its head , had no way of finding the 500 million euros in fresh capital gm is seeking from a suitor .
" fiat has … huge liquidity problems .
they ca n't get hold of money at the moment , " franz said .
" the government ca n't give guarantees for such a transparent plan . "
on thursday , fiat posted a first-quarter loss of 411 million euros and ruled out any direct investment as part of a potential deal for a strategic partnership with us peer chrysler .
" no agreements " roland koch , the premier of the german state of hesse , where opel has its headquarters , confirmed that fiat was involved in discussions over a potential takeover .
he said that canadian car parts maker magna was also interested in a stake , but that no agreements have been reached yet .
german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg also said no decision had been taken on fiat 's role in any takeover .
" the federal government is holding talks with various interested parties , without any predetermination , " guttenberg said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg says opel 's future is still under discussion the online version of us daily wall street journal reported that fiat chief executive sergio marchionne had held talks with guttenberg in berlin last week .
job cuts certain christoph stuermer , an auto industry expert at think tank ihs global insight , said opel 's manufacturing and technological aspects would be of little interest to fiat .
" on top of having a 100 percent overlapping product portfolio , fiat and opel also have a very much overlapping regional footprint … so i think that mr franz is being very polite .
i think that the long-term strategy of fiat is really to keep the market share and get rid of all the rest of opel . "
stuermer also said that fiat would most likely not be able to go it alone in its bid for control of opel .
" i think that fiat at the moment does not have the free cash lying around to just come up with the money .
they would certainly have to team up either with one of the other interested parties in investing in opel or with one of their own long-term partners from the agnelli family or wider italy . "
spokespeople from fiat and opel were unavailable for comment on thursday on the potential takeover .
two sides of the coin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel workers fear german production lines could be terminated pierluigi bellini , associate director of ihs 's automotive division in milan , agreed that a fiat-opel fusion would spell the end for thousands of german workers .
" fiat and opel have obvious synergies here , scales of economy , " he said .
" but the other side of the coin is that work forces would need to be cut , both in germany and italy , and i do n't know if that is feasible now .
especially in germany , where you have an election year , and in italy the situation is already pretty bad for italian plants . "
despite all the potential points of synergy , fiat faces an uphill battle to convince opel 's management and the industry at large that it has the capacity to take control of the german carmaker .

" what seat would be more appropriate than a land wounded by the earthquake ? "
berlusconi told a news conference in l 'aquila on thursday , after holding a cabinet meeting in the stricken town .
berlusconi said moving the meeting of the heads of government of the world 's richest countries , currently set to take place on la maddalena , a small island off sardinia , would be a " positive signal for the more than 60,000 people still living in temporary camps . "
" the 21 heads of government who come will be able to see first-hand the wounds caused by this earthquake , " berlusconi added .
" i think it could work out very well . "
berlusconi looking to divert funds to disaster zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi will need to consult with g8 leaders on the move the italian leader , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the g8 club of industrialized nations , added that the 220 million euros -lrb- $ 286.5 million -rrb- needed for summit security and infrastructure in sardinia could this way be invested in the earthquake region instead .
berlusconi acknowledged logistics and cost problems at the original venue on a sardinian island were putting the original plans in jeopardy .
however , the decision to move the conference to l 'aquila could render moot more than two years of planning for the event .
the decision to move the summit was dependent on approval from the other nations attending the summit scheduled for july 8-10 there have already been signs of dissent within berlusconi 's cabinet over moving the g8 summit , with at least one minister saying it was " implausible " and would be difficult to pull off .
cabinet increases aid to quake region the april 6 quake in the central region of abruzzo killed 296 people , flattened entire areas of some towns and made some 65,000 people homeless .
the cabinet earlier on thursday approved a decree raising up to 8 billion euros to rebuild the quake-hit areas and fund emergency services . nda / mll , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 23.04.2009 turkey and armenia agree on reconciliation roadmap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish president abdullah gul , left , and armenian president serzh sargsyan met in 2008 turkey and armenia have reached an agreement on a comprehensive framework to normalize relations .
deutsche welle correspondent dorian jones reports that the process carries some risk for the turkish government . the turkish minister for eu affairs , egemen bagis , said thursday the process , which is taking place under swiss supervision , aimed to bring about a fundamental change in bilateral relations between the two countries .
" better relations , more neighborly relations , more trade , more opportunities and cooperation and peace - i see a light at the end of the tunnel , that peace is possible , " he said .
a senior western diplomat , who spoke on condition of anonymity , told reuters news agency that the deal had not yet been signed but that turkey and armenia had agreed on diplomatic ties , opening the border and establishing commissions to address historical disputes .
" all the documents have been agreed in principle but it 's from the signing that the clock starts ticking , " the diplomat said .
" it is a finite period that is not very long .
we are talking about weeks or months . "
old wounds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some armenian groups have long opposed reconciliation with turkey in armenia , several thousand protesters , mainly supporters of a nationalist junior partner in the government , burned turkish flags and condemned the efforts at normalizing relations .
at the heart of ongoing tensions between the countries are accusations by armenia that turkey was directly responsible for what it calls the genocide of 1.5 million armenians in 1915 during world war i , a charge strongly denied by ankara turkey officially admits that as many as 600,000 armenians died during the war and deportation from eastern anatolia , but it insists the deaths must be seen in the context of an armenian uprising at a time when armenians were siding with invading russian troops earlier this week , ankara recalled its ambassador from canada after the canadian prime minister supported the genocide charge .
eyes on obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama looks likely to ease pressure on turkey after the talks with armenia ankara now fears us president barack obama will do the same .
during his presidential campaign obama said he would recognize the genocide if elected .
but yasemin congar , deputy editor of the turkish daily taraf , said obama may now hold back as a result of the new rapprochement efforts .
" washington wants to see turkey open its border with armenia , " she said .
" they want to see ankara and yerevan normalize diplomatic relations and there is a movement to that end .
" i think obama wants to give the message to ankara that if this process goes on it might even stop him from saying the ' g ' word , the genocide word in washington . "
during his visit to turkey earlier this month obama avoided using the so-called " g " word .
instead he praised the turkish and armenian rapprochement efforts .
eve of remembrance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflict between armenia and azerbaijan over nagorno-karabahk displaced hundreds of thousands the timing of turkey 's announcement of its agreement with armenia is being seen as no coincidence .
it comes just one day before armenians around the world remember those killed in 1915 .
traditionally , us presidents deliver a speech to mark the event .
us-based armenian groups have been lobbying obama intensively to use his expected speech to recognize the genocide .
that is now seen as unlikely in light of the new rapprochement efforts .
obama is also aware that a reference to genocide would seriously damage us-turkey relations .
the turkish government is paying a heavy domestic political price for its rapprochement efforts , since turkey 's close relationship to armenia 's rival , azerbaijan , is seen to be at risk .
sixteen years ago , armenia occupied nearly 20 percent of azerbaijan following a war over the disputed enclave of nagorno-karabakh . turkey imposed a trade embargo against armenia in support of its ally .
" all turkish press , all political opposition , is using the azerbaijani issue against the government .
i think the government finds itself in a very difficult position , " said political scientist nuray mert .
such pressure is already having an effect , with the turkish prime minister now linking the ending of the embargo to the withdrawal of armenian forces from azerbaijan .
that is seen as unlikely anytime soon .
turkish news reports have said azerbaijan is disturbed by the reconciliation efforts , which could lead to the reopening of the turkish-armenian border .
but with ankara facing increasing pressure from both the us and the eu to end the embargo , the turkish government now finds itself between a rock and a hard place .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 23.04.2009 turkey and armenia agree on reconciliation roadmap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish president abdullah gul , left , and armenian president serzh sargsyan met in 2008 turkey and armenia have reached an agreement on a comprehensive framework to normalize relations .
deutsche welle correspondent dorian jones reports that the process carries some risk for the turkish government . the turkish minister for eu affairs , egemen bagis , said thursday the process , which is taking place under swiss supervision , aimed to bring about a fundamental change in bilateral relations between the two countries .
" better relations , more neighborly relations , more trade , more opportunities and cooperation and peace - i see a light at the end of the tunnel , that peace is possible , " he said .
a senior western diplomat , who spoke on condition of anonymity , told reuters news agency that the deal had not yet been signed but that turkey and armenia had agreed on diplomatic ties , opening the border and establishing commissions to address historical disputes .
" all the documents have been agreed in principle but it 's from the signing that the clock starts ticking , " the diplomat said .
" it is a finite period that is not very long .
we are talking about weeks or months . "
old wounds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some armenian groups have long opposed reconciliation with turkey in armenia , several thousand protesters , mainly supporters of a nationalist junior partner in the government , burned turkish flags and condemned the efforts at normalizing relations .
at the heart of ongoing tensions between the countries are accusations by armenia that turkey was directly responsible for what it calls the genocide of 1.5 million armenians in 1915 during world war i , a charge strongly denied by ankara turkey officially admits that as many as 600,000 armenians died during the war and deportation from eastern anatolia , but it insists the deaths must be seen in the context of an armenian uprising at a time when armenians were siding with invading russian troops earlier this week , ankara recalled its ambassador from canada after the canadian prime minister supported the genocide charge .
eyes on obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama looks likely to ease pressure on turkey after the talks with armenia ankara now fears us president barack obama will do the same .
during his presidential campaign obama said he would recognize the genocide if elected .
but yasemin congar , deputy editor of the turkish daily taraf , said obama may now hold back as a result of the new rapprochement efforts .
" washington wants to see turkey open its border with armenia , " she said .
" they want to see ankara and yerevan normalize diplomatic relations and there is a movement to that end .
" i think obama wants to give the message to ankara that if this process goes on it might even stop him from saying the ' g ' word , the genocide word in washington . "
during his visit to turkey earlier this month obama avoided using the so-called " g " word .
instead he praised the turkish and armenian rapprochement efforts .
eve of remembrance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflict between armenia and azerbaijan over nagorno-karabahk displaced hundreds of thousands the timing of turkey 's announcement of its agreement with armenia is being seen as no coincidence .
it comes just one day before armenians around the world remember those killed in 1915 .
traditionally , us presidents deliver a speech to mark the event .
us-based armenian groups have been lobbying obama intensively to use his expected speech to recognize the genocide .
that is now seen as unlikely in light of the new rapprochement efforts .
obama is also aware that a reference to genocide would seriously damage us-turkey relations .
the turkish government is paying a heavy domestic political price for its rapprochement efforts , since turkey 's close relationship to armenia 's rival , azerbaijan , is seen to be at risk .
sixteen years ago , armenia occupied nearly 20 percent of azerbaijan following a war over the disputed enclave of nagorno-karabakh . turkey imposed a trade embargo against armenia in support of its ally .
" all turkish press , all political opposition , is using the azerbaijani issue against the government .
i think the government finds itself in a very difficult position , " said political scientist nuray mert .
such pressure is already having an effect , with the turkish prime minister now linking the ending of the embargo to the withdrawal of armenian forces from azerbaijan .
that is seen as unlikely anytime soon .
turkish news reports have said azerbaijan is disturbed by the reconciliation efforts , which could lead to the reopening of the turkish-armenian border .
but with ankara facing increasing pressure from both the us and the eu to end the embargo , the turkish government now finds itself between a rock and a hard place .

deutsche welle correspondent dorian jones reports that the process carries some risk for the turkish government . the turkish minister for eu affairs , egemen bagis , said thursday the process , which is taking place under swiss supervision , aimed to bring about a fundamental change in bilateral relations between the two countries .
" better relations , more neighborly relations , more trade , more opportunities and cooperation and peace - i see a light at the end of the tunnel , that peace is possible , " he said .
a senior western diplomat , who spoke on condition of anonymity , told reuters news agency that the deal had not yet been signed but that turkey and armenia had agreed on diplomatic ties , opening the border and establishing commissions to address historical disputes .
" all the documents have been agreed in principle but it 's from the signing that the clock starts ticking , " the diplomat said .
" it is a finite period that is not very long .
we are talking about weeks or months . "
old wounds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some armenian groups have long opposed reconciliation with turkey in armenia , several thousand protesters , mainly supporters of a nationalist junior partner in the government , burned turkish flags and condemned the efforts at normalizing relations .
at the heart of ongoing tensions between the countries are accusations by armenia that turkey was directly responsible for what it calls the genocide of 1.5 million armenians in 1915 during world war i , a charge strongly denied by ankara turkey officially admits that as many as 600,000 armenians died during the war and deportation from eastern anatolia , but it insists the deaths must be seen in the context of an armenian uprising at a time when armenians were siding with invading russian troops earlier this week , ankara recalled its ambassador from canada after the canadian prime minister supported the genocide charge .

" they want to see ankara and yerevan normalize diplomatic relations and there is a movement to that end .
" i think obama wants to give the message to ankara that if this process goes on it might even stop him from saying the ' g ' word , the genocide word in washington . "
during his visit to turkey earlier this month obama avoided using the so-called " g " word .
instead he praised the turkish and armenian rapprochement efforts .

it comes just one day before armenians around the world remember those killed in 1915 .
traditionally , us presidents deliver a speech to mark the event .
us-based armenian groups have been lobbying obama intensively to use his expected speech to recognize the genocide .
that is now seen as unlikely in light of the new rapprochement efforts .
obama is also aware that a reference to genocide would seriously damage us-turkey relations .
the turkish government is paying a heavy domestic political price for its rapprochement efforts , since turkey 's close relationship to armenia 's rival , azerbaijan , is seen to be at risk .
sixteen years ago , armenia occupied nearly 20 percent of azerbaijan following a war over the disputed enclave of nagorno-karabakh . turkey imposed a trade embargo against armenia in support of its ally .
" all turkish press , all political opposition , is using the azerbaijani issue against the government .
i think the government finds itself in a very difficult position , " said political scientist nuray mert .
such pressure is already having an effect , with the turkish prime minister now linking the ending of the embargo to the withdrawal of armenian forces from azerbaijan .
that is seen as unlikely anytime soon .
turkish news reports have said azerbaijan is disturbed by the reconciliation efforts , which could lead to the reopening of the turkish-armenian border .
but with ankara facing increasing pressure from both the us and the eu to end the embargo , the turkish government now finds itself between a rock and a hard place .

president barack obama supports passage of a " cash-for-clunkers " bill to pay people to turn in their gas guzzlers and replace them with more fuel-efficient vehicles .

deutsche welle correspondent dorian jones reports that the process carries some risk for the turkish government . the turkish minister for eu affairs , egemen bagis , said thursday the process , which is taking place under swiss supervision , aimed to bring about a fundamental change in bilateral relations between the two countries .
" better relations , more neighborly relations , more trade , more opportunities and cooperation and peace - i see a light at the end of the tunnel , that peace is possible , " he said .
a senior western diplomat , who spoke on condition of anonymity , told reuters news agency that the deal had not yet been signed but that turkey and armenia had agreed on diplomatic ties , opening the border and establishing commissions to address historical disputes .
" all the documents have been agreed in principle but it 's from the signing that the clock starts ticking , " the diplomat said .
" it is a finite period that is not very long .
we are talking about weeks or months . "
old wounds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some armenian groups have long opposed reconciliation with turkey in armenia , several thousand protesters , mainly supporters of a nationalist junior partner in the government , burned turkish flags and condemned the efforts at normalizing relations .
at the heart of ongoing tensions between the countries are accusations by armenia that turkey was directly responsible for what it calls the genocide of 1.5 million armenians in 1915 during world war i , a charge strongly denied by ankara turkey officially admits that as many as 600,000 armenians died during the war and deportation from eastern anatolia , but it insists the deaths must be seen in the context of an armenian uprising at a time when armenians were siding with invading russian troops earlier this week , ankara recalled its ambassador from canada after the canadian prime minister supported the genocide charge .
eyes on obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama looks likely to ease pressure on turkey after the talks with armenia ankara now fears us president barack obama will do the same .
during his presidential campaign obama said he would recognize the genocide if elected .
but yasemin congar , deputy editor of the turkish daily taraf , said obama may now hold back as a result of the new rapprochement efforts .
" washington wants to see turkey open its border with armenia , " she said .
" they want to see ankara and yerevan normalize diplomatic relations and there is a movement to that end .
" i think obama wants to give the message to ankara that if this process goes on it might even stop him from saying the ' g ' word , the genocide word in washington . "
during his visit to turkey earlier this month obama avoided using the so-called " g " word .
instead he praised the turkish and armenian rapprochement efforts .
eve of remembrance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflict between armenia and azerbaijan over nagorno-karabahk displaced hundreds of thousands the timing of turkey 's announcement of its agreement with armenia is being seen as no coincidence .
it comes just one day before armenians around the world remember those killed in 1915 .
traditionally , us presidents deliver a speech to mark the event .
us-based armenian groups have been lobbying obama intensively to use his expected speech to recognize the genocide .
that is now seen as unlikely in light of the new rapprochement efforts .
obama is also aware that a reference to genocide would seriously damage us-turkey relations .
the turkish government is paying a heavy domestic political price for its rapprochement efforts , since turkey 's close relationship to armenia 's rival , azerbaijan , is seen to be at risk .
sixteen years ago , armenia occupied nearly 20 percent of azerbaijan following a war over the disputed enclave of nagorno-karabakh . turkey imposed a trade embargo against armenia in support of its ally .
" all turkish press , all political opposition , is using the azerbaijani issue against the government .
i think the government finds itself in a very difficult position , " said political scientist nuray mert .
such pressure is already having an effect , with the turkish prime minister now linking the ending of the embargo to the withdrawal of armenian forces from azerbaijan .
that is seen as unlikely anytime soon .
turkish news reports have said azerbaijan is disturbed by the reconciliation efforts , which could lead to the reopening of the turkish-armenian border .
but with ankara facing increasing pressure from both the us and the eu to end the embargo , the turkish government now finds itself between a rock and a hard place .

" what seat would be more appropriate than a land wounded by the earthquake ? "
berlusconi told a news conference in l 'aquila on thursday , after holding a cabinet meeting in the stricken town .
berlusconi said moving the meeting of the heads of government of the world 's richest countries , currently set to take place on la maddalena , a small island off sardinia , would be a " positive signal for the more than 60,000 people still living in temporary camps . "
" the 21 heads of government who come will be able to see first-hand the wounds caused by this earthquake , " berlusconi added .
" i think it could work out very well . "
berlusconi looking to divert funds to disaster zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi will need to consult with g8 leaders on the move the italian leader , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the g8 club of industrialized nations , added that the 220 million euros -lrb- $ 286.5 million -rrb- needed for summit security and infrastructure in sardinia could this way be invested in the earthquake region instead .
berlusconi acknowledged logistics and cost problems at the original venue on a sardinian island were putting the original plans in jeopardy .
however , the decision to move the conference to l 'aquila could render moot more than two years of planning for the event .
the decision to move the summit was dependent on approval from the other nations attending the summit scheduled for july 8-10 there have already been signs of dissent within berlusconi 's cabinet over moving the g8 summit , with at least one minister saying it was " implausible " and would be difficult to pull off .
cabinet increases aid to quake region the april 6 quake in the central region of abruzzo killed 296 people , flattened entire areas of some towns and made some 65,000 people homeless .
the cabinet earlier on thursday approved a decree raising up to 8 billion euros to rebuild the quake-hit areas and fund emergency services . nda / mll , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle correspondent dorian jones reports that the process carries some risk for the turkish government . the turkish minister for eu affairs , egemen bagis , said thursday the process , which is taking place under swiss supervision , aimed to bring about a fundamental change in bilateral relations between the two countries .
" better relations , more neighborly relations , more trade , more opportunities and cooperation and peace - i see a light at the end of the tunnel , that peace is possible , " he said .
a senior western diplomat , who spoke on condition of anonymity , told reuters news agency that the deal had not yet been signed but that turkey and armenia had agreed on diplomatic ties , opening the border and establishing commissions to address historical disputes .
" all the documents have been agreed in principle but it 's from the signing that the clock starts ticking , " the diplomat said .
" it is a finite period that is not very long .
we are talking about weeks or months . "
old wounds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some armenian groups have long opposed reconciliation with turkey in armenia , several thousand protesters , mainly supporters of a nationalist junior partner in the government , burned turkish flags and condemned the efforts at normalizing relations .
at the heart of ongoing tensions between the countries are accusations by armenia that turkey was directly responsible for what it calls the genocide of 1.5 million armenians in 1915 during world war i , a charge strongly denied by ankara turkey officially admits that as many as 600,000 armenians died during the war and deportation from eastern anatolia , but it insists the deaths must be seen in the context of an armenian uprising at a time when armenians were siding with invading russian troops earlier this week , ankara recalled its ambassador from canada after the canadian prime minister supported the genocide charge .
eyes on obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama looks likely to ease pressure on turkey after the talks with armenia ankara now fears us president barack obama will do the same .
during his presidential campaign obama said he would recognize the genocide if elected .
but yasemin congar , deputy editor of the turkish daily taraf , said obama may now hold back as a result of the new rapprochement efforts .
" washington wants to see turkey open its border with armenia , " she said .
" they want to see ankara and yerevan normalize diplomatic relations and there is a movement to that end .
" i think obama wants to give the message to ankara that if this process goes on it might even stop him from saying the ' g ' word , the genocide word in washington . "
during his visit to turkey earlier this month obama avoided using the so-called " g " word .
instead he praised the turkish and armenian rapprochement efforts .

but there are fears over what that could mean for opel ’ s german workers . franz confirmed thursday reports that said fiat was ready to sign a declaration of intent on a takeover as early as next tuesday .
however he claimed fiat had no interest in a strategic partnership with opel .
he said an alliance with fiat would lead to massive job cuts at opel and the closure of german factories after bundestag elections in september .
opel has around 25,000 workers .
franz also said fiat , which has 14.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 18.4 billion -rrb- of debt sitting over its head , had no way of finding the 500 million euros in fresh capital gm is seeking from a suitor .
" fiat has … huge liquidity problems .
they ca n't get hold of money at the moment , " franz said .
" the government ca n't give guarantees for such a transparent plan . "
on thursday , fiat posted a first-quarter loss of 411 million euros and ruled out any direct investment as part of a potential deal for a strategic partnership with us peer chrysler .
" no agreements " roland koch , the premier of the german state of hesse , where opel has its headquarters , confirmed that fiat was involved in discussions over a potential takeover .
he said that canadian car parts maker magna was also interested in a stake , but that no agreements have been reached yet .
german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg also said no decision had been taken on fiat 's role in any takeover .
" the federal government is holding talks with various interested parties , without any predetermination , " guttenberg said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg says opel 's future is still under discussion the online version of us daily wall street journal reported that fiat chief executive sergio marchionne had held talks with guttenberg in berlin last week .
job cuts certain christoph stuermer , an auto industry expert at think tank ihs global insight , said opel 's manufacturing and technological aspects would be of little interest to fiat .
" on top of having a 100 percent overlapping product portfolio , fiat and opel also have a very much overlapping regional footprint … so i think that mr franz is being very polite .
i think that the long-term strategy of fiat is really to keep the market share and get rid of all the rest of opel . "
stuermer also said that fiat would most likely not be able to go it alone in its bid for control of opel .
" i think that fiat at the moment does not have the free cash lying around to just come up with the money .
they would certainly have to team up either with one of the other interested parties in investing in opel or with one of their own long-term partners from the agnelli family or wider italy . "
spokespeople from fiat and opel were unavailable for comment on thursday on the potential takeover .
two sides of the coin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel workers fear german production lines could be terminated pierluigi bellini , associate director of ihs 's automotive division in milan , agreed that a fiat-opel fusion would spell the end for thousands of german workers .
" fiat and opel have obvious synergies here , scales of economy , " he said .
" but the other side of the coin is that work forces would need to be cut , both in germany and italy , and i do n't know if that is feasible now .
especially in germany , where you have an election year , and in italy the situation is already pretty bad for italian plants . "
despite all the potential points of synergy , fiat faces an uphill battle to convince opel 's management and the industry at large that it has the capacity to take control of the german carmaker .

organizers of the meeting , chaired by ban and the african union , had said more than $ 250 million was needed to improve security in a state which has had no central government since former president mohamed siad barre was ousted in 1991 , setting off a bloody cycle of clashes between rival factions .
eu officials said the aim was to build up a police force of some 10,000 officers and a security force of 5,000 .
support is also sought for the 4,300-strong african union mission amisom .
the amisom force - the only security presence backing the government - is well short of the 8,000 soldiers initially planned and is regularly attacked by the islamist shebab militia .
" restoring security and stability in somalia is vital to the success of the reconciliation effort and the survival of the unity government , " ban told the conference , held under the auspices of the united nations .
" much remains to be done . "
ban reiterated he had no intention of sending a un force to somalia any time soon , saying that the united nations should take a cautious and incremental approach to sending its own peacekeeping mission , and only " when the security conditions are appropriate . "
target likely to be exceeded after delegates underlined the challenges facing the war-torn country , organizers said donors had promised funding which was likely to exceed their initial expectations .
" we are on target , we are even a little bit higher because the target was $ 250 million , " said eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel .
" it seems that we are also above 250 million if you take into account material aid . "
" it 's really a full success , " he added to reporters after the four-hour conference in brussels .
the european commission , whose president jose manuel barroso also attended , had announced it would pledge at least 60 million euros on the eve of the meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamists have battled numerous governments president ahmed , who took office in january , made a personal plea for funds at the conference .
" solving this problem will require a radical solution , " said ahmed .
" the restoration of security and peace in somalia is the basis of any solution to the problems , " he said .
islamist fighters including the hard-line shebab militia have waged battles against the transitional government , its predecessor cabinet and their allies , vowing to fight until all foreign forces withdraw and sharia law is imposed .
more than one million people have fled their homes .
fewer than one in three somalis , whose life expectancy is 46 years , have access to clean water .
general instability and lawlessness while the conference was not focused on piracy , the high media profile of the growing number of cases of daring raids on freighters on the seas of the gulf of aden has become synonymous with somalia 's woes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international anti-piracy efforts face a tough mission " piracy is not a water-borne disease .
it is a symptom of anarchy and insecurity on the ground , " ban said .
" dealing with it requires an integrated strategy that addresses the fundamental issue of lawlessness in somalia . "
despite international naval missions - including from nato and the european union - piracy has mushroomed over the last year , as ransom-hunting somalis tackle ever-bigger and more distant prizes .
more than 130 merchant ships were attacked in the region last year , an increase of more than 200 percent on 2007 , the international maritime bureau said .
a tenfold increase was noted in the first three months of 2009 .
" if we only treat the symptoms , piracy at sea , but not its root causes - the decay of the state and poverty - we will fail , " barroso said .
non-governmental organization oxfam said the conference was being held at a critical moment for 3.2 million somalis desperately in need of aid , more than a million of whom have fled their homes to avoid fighting in the last two years .
" the piracy issue that has grabbed international headlines is a symptom of deeper issues that have gone unaddressed ever since the collapse of the national government in 1991 , " oxfam 's robert maletta said in a statement .
ahmed underlined : " it is our duty to pursue these criminals not only on the high seas but also on terra firma . "

organizers of the meeting , chaired by ban and the african union , had said more than $ 250 million was needed to improve security in a state which has had no central government since former president mohamed siad barre was ousted in 1991 , setting off a bloody cycle of clashes between rival factions .
eu officials said the aim was to build up a police force of some 10,000 officers and a security force of 5,000 .
support is also sought for the 4,300-strong african union mission amisom .
the amisom force - the only security presence backing the government - is well short of the 8,000 soldiers initially planned and is regularly attacked by the islamist shebab militia .
" restoring security and stability in somalia is vital to the success of the reconciliation effort and the survival of the unity government , " ban told the conference , held under the auspices of the united nations .
" much remains to be done . "
ban reiterated he had no intention of sending a un force to somalia any time soon , saying that the united nations should take a cautious and incremental approach to sending its own peacekeeping mission , and only " when the security conditions are appropriate . "
target likely to be exceeded after delegates underlined the challenges facing the war-torn country , organizers said donors had promised funding which was likely to exceed their initial expectations .
" we are on target , we are even a little bit higher because the target was $ 250 million , " said eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel .
" it seems that we are also above 250 million if you take into account material aid . "
" it 's really a full success , " he added to reporters after the four-hour conference in brussels .
the european commission , whose president jose manuel barroso also attended , had announced it would pledge at least 60 million euros on the eve of the meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamists have battled numerous governments president ahmed , who took office in january , made a personal plea for funds at the conference .
" solving this problem will require a radical solution , " said ahmed .
" the restoration of security and peace in somalia is the basis of any solution to the problems , " he said .
islamist fighters including the hard-line shebab militia have waged battles against the transitional government , its predecessor cabinet and their allies , vowing to fight until all foreign forces withdraw and sharia law is imposed .
more than one million people have fled their homes .
fewer than one in three somalis , whose life expectancy is 46 years , have access to clean water .
general instability and lawlessness while the conference was not focused on piracy , the high media profile of the growing number of cases of daring raids on freighters on the seas of the gulf of aden has become synonymous with somalia 's woes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international anti-piracy efforts face a tough mission " piracy is not a water-borne disease .
it is a symptom of anarchy and insecurity on the ground , " ban said .
" dealing with it requires an integrated strategy that addresses the fundamental issue of lawlessness in somalia . "
despite international naval missions - including from nato and the european union - piracy has mushroomed over the last year , as ransom-hunting somalis tackle ever-bigger and more distant prizes .
more than 130 merchant ships were attacked in the region last year , an increase of more than 200 percent on 2007 , the international maritime bureau said .
a tenfold increase was noted in the first three months of 2009 .
" if we only treat the symptoms , piracy at sea , but not its root causes - the decay of the state and poverty - we will fail , " barroso said .
non-governmental organization oxfam said the conference was being held at a critical moment for 3.2 million somalis desperately in need of aid , more than a million of whom have fled their homes to avoid fighting in the last two years .
" the piracy issue that has grabbed international headlines is a symptom of deeper issues that have gone unaddressed ever since the collapse of the national government in 1991 , " oxfam 's robert maletta said in a statement .

" it is our hope that any car scrappage legislation ultimately enacted will remedy these concerns , and that the eu will be able to support this important initiative to promote fuel-efficiency , reduce pollution , and provide a needed boost to the automobile industry , " john bruton , the eu 's ambassador to the united states , said in a letter sent to the us congress on wednesday .
president barack obama supports passage of a " cash-for-clunkers " bill to pay people to turn in their gas guzzlers and replace them with more fuel-efficient vehicles .
but bruton said europe is worried that a leading version of the legislation , " as currently drafted , provides benefits only for replacement vehicles assembled in the u.s. or north america , a distinction that would harm car manufacturers from other parts of the world , including europe . "
such a provision , he added , would be " a clear violation " of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- rules requiring a country 's laws to treat foreign and domestic products equally .
possible compromise on north american provision europe 's fears and the concerns that the eu and us may bring their differences before the wto were partially allayed on thursday when got a boost after a leading proponent of the " cash-for-clunkers " bill , ohio congresswoman betty sutton , signaled she may drop a provision limiting the subsidies to purchases of north american made vehicles .
the provision has been a major sticking point in congressional efforts to merge competing proposals for the program , and sutton 's move brings those who are opposed to the north america requirement closer to a compromise with those who support it .
" it 's not so important to me that it has to be done " exactly according to her bill , but rather that a program is passed , sutton told reporters on capitol hill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany allows trade-ins for german and foreign cars germany , france , and slovakia - as well as china - have already enacted such trade-in programs but a central feature of the european programs is that they apply to all vehicles , whether assembled in europe or abroad .
the us may now follow suit as congressional aides redouble their efforts to find common ground on compromise legislation that could clear congress within months .
but even if a compromise is reached , lawmakers must find funding for the program .
some have suggested that the money would come from the economic stimulus package passed earlier this year .
proponents say the program - to provide new-car discounts of $ 1,500 to $ 7,500 -lrb- 1,150 euros – 5,700 euros -rrb- , depending on the proposal - is desperately needed to lift slumping car sales . nda / mll , reuters / wall street journal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 23.04.2009 eu fears washington 's car trade-in plans unfairly favor us industry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trade-in programs are supposed to encourage a switch to greener models the us would violate world trade rules if proposed government payments to encourage consumers to trade in old gas-guzzling cars can be used to buy only new american-made vehicles , according to an eu official . " it is our hope that any car scrappage legislation ultimately enacted will remedy these concerns , and that the eu will be able to support this important initiative to promote fuel-efficiency , reduce pollution , and provide a needed boost to the automobile industry , " john bruton , the eu 's ambassador to the united states , said in a letter sent to the us congress on wednesday .
president barack obama supports passage of a " cash-for-clunkers " bill to pay people to turn in their gas guzzlers and replace them with more fuel-efficient vehicles .
but bruton said europe is worried that a leading version of the legislation , " as currently drafted , provides benefits only for replacement vehicles assembled in the u.s. or north america , a distinction that would harm car manufacturers from other parts of the world , including europe . "
such a provision , he added , would be " a clear violation " of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- rules requiring a country 's laws to treat foreign and domestic products equally .
possible compromise on north american provision europe 's fears and the concerns that the eu and us may bring their differences before the wto were partially allayed on thursday when got a boost after a leading proponent of the " cash-for-clunkers " bill , ohio congresswoman betty sutton , signaled she may drop a provision limiting the subsidies to purchases of north american made vehicles .
the provision has been a major sticking point in congressional efforts to merge competing proposals for the program , and sutton 's move brings those who are opposed to the north america requirement closer to a compromise with those who support it .
" it 's not so important to me that it has to be done " exactly according to her bill , but rather that a program is passed , sutton told reporters on capitol hill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany allows trade-ins for german and foreign cars germany , france , and slovakia - as well as china - have already enacted such trade-in programs but a central feature of the european programs is that they apply to all vehicles , whether assembled in europe or abroad .
the us may now follow suit as congressional aides redouble their efforts to find common ground on compromise legislation that could clear congress within months .
but even if a compromise is reached , lawmakers must find funding for the program .
some have suggested that the money would come from the economic stimulus package passed earlier this year .
proponents say the program - to provide new-car discounts of $ 1,500 to $ 7,500 -lrb- 1,150 euros – 5,700 euros -rrb- , depending on the proposal - is desperately needed to lift slumping car sales . nda / mll , reuters / wall street journal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but there are fears over what that could mean for opel ’ s german workers . franz confirmed thursday reports that said fiat was ready to sign a declaration of intent on a takeover as early as next tuesday .
however he claimed fiat had no interest in a strategic partnership with opel .
he said an alliance with fiat would lead to massive job cuts at opel and the closure of german factories after bundestag elections in september .
opel has around 25,000 workers .
franz also said fiat , which has 14.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 18.4 billion -rrb- of debt sitting over its head , had no way of finding the 500 million euros in fresh capital gm is seeking from a suitor .
" fiat has … huge liquidity problems .
they ca n't get hold of money at the moment , " franz said .
" the government ca n't give guarantees for such a transparent plan . "
on thursday , fiat posted a first-quarter loss of 411 million euros and ruled out any direct investment as part of a potential deal for a strategic partnership with us peer chrysler .
" no agreements " roland koch , the premier of the german state of hesse , where opel has its headquarters , confirmed that fiat was involved in discussions over a potential takeover .
he said that canadian car parts maker magna was also interested in a stake , but that no agreements have been reached yet .
german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg also said no decision had been taken on fiat 's role in any takeover .
" the federal government is holding talks with various interested parties , without any predetermination , " guttenberg said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg says opel 's future is still under discussion the online version of us daily wall street journal reported that fiat chief executive sergio marchionne had held talks with guttenberg in berlin last week .
job cuts certain christoph stuermer , an auto industry expert at think tank ihs global insight , said opel 's manufacturing and technological aspects would be of little interest to fiat .
" on top of having a 100 percent overlapping product portfolio , fiat and opel also have a very much overlapping regional footprint … so i think that mr franz is being very polite .
i think that the long-term strategy of fiat is really to keep the market share and get rid of all the rest of opel . "
stuermer also said that fiat would most likely not be able to go it alone in its bid for control of opel .
" i think that fiat at the moment does not have the free cash lying around to just come up with the money .
they would certainly have to team up either with one of the other interested parties in investing in opel or with one of their own long-term partners from the agnelli family or wider italy . "
spokespeople from fiat and opel were unavailable for comment on thursday on the potential takeover .
two sides of the coin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel workers fear german production lines could be terminated pierluigi bellini , associate director of ihs 's automotive division in milan , agreed that a fiat-opel fusion would spell the end for thousands of german workers .
" fiat and opel have obvious synergies here , scales of economy , " he said .
" but the other side of the coin is that work forces would need to be cut , both in germany and italy , and i do n't know if that is feasible now .
especially in germany , where you have an election year , and in italy the situation is already pretty bad for italian plants . "
despite all the potential points of synergy , fiat faces an uphill battle to convince opel 's management and the industry at large that it has the capacity to take control of the german carmaker .

despite all the potential points of synergy , fiat faces an uphill battle to convince opel 's management and the industry at large that it has the capacity to take control of the german carmaker .

" it is our hope that any car scrappage legislation ultimately enacted will remedy these concerns , and that the eu will be able to support this important initiative to promote fuel-efficiency , reduce pollution , and provide a needed boost to the automobile industry , " john bruton , the eu 's ambassador to the united states , said in a letter sent to the us congress on wednesday .
president barack obama supports passage of a " cash-for-clunkers " bill to pay people to turn in their gas guzzlers and replace them with more fuel-efficient vehicles .
but bruton said europe is worried that a leading version of the legislation , " as currently drafted , provides benefits only for replacement vehicles assembled in the u.s. or north america , a distinction that would harm car manufacturers from other parts of the world , including europe . "
such a provision , he added , would be " a clear violation " of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- rules requiring a country 's laws to treat foreign and domestic products equally .
possible compromise on north american provision europe 's fears and the concerns that the eu and us may bring their differences before the wto were partially allayed on thursday when got a boost after a leading proponent of the " cash-for-clunkers " bill , ohio congresswoman betty sutton , signaled she may drop a provision limiting the subsidies to purchases of north american made vehicles .
the provision has been a major sticking point in congressional efforts to merge competing proposals for the program , and sutton 's move brings those who are opposed to the north america requirement closer to a compromise with those who support it .
" it 's not so important to me that it has to be done " exactly according to her bill , but rather that a program is passed , sutton told reporters on capitol hill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany allows trade-ins for german and foreign cars germany , france , and slovakia - as well as china - have already enacted such trade-in programs but a central feature of the european programs is that they apply to all vehicles , whether assembled in europe or abroad .
the us may now follow suit as congressional aides redouble their efforts to find common ground on compromise legislation that could clear congress within months .
but even if a compromise is reached , lawmakers must find funding for the program .
some have suggested that the money would come from the economic stimulus package passed earlier this year .
proponents say the program - to provide new-car discounts of $ 1,500 to $ 7,500 -lrb- 1,150 euros – 5,700 euros -rrb- , depending on the proposal - is desperately needed to lift slumping car sales . nda / mll , reuters / wall street journal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle correspondent dorian jones reports that the process carries some risk for the turkish government . the turkish minister for eu affairs , egemen bagis , said thursday the process , which is taking place under swiss supervision , aimed to bring about a fundamental change in bilateral relations between the two countries .
" better relations , more neighborly relations , more trade , more opportunities and cooperation and peace - i see a light at the end of the tunnel , that peace is possible , " he said .
a senior western diplomat , who spoke on condition of anonymity , told reuters news agency that the deal had not yet been signed but that turkey and armenia had agreed on diplomatic ties , opening the border and establishing commissions to address historical disputes .
" all the documents have been agreed in principle but it 's from the signing that the clock starts ticking , " the diplomat said .
" it is a finite period that is not very long .
we are talking about weeks or months . "
old wounds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some armenian groups have long opposed reconciliation with turkey in armenia , several thousand protesters , mainly supporters of a nationalist junior partner in the government , burned turkish flags and condemned the efforts at normalizing relations .
at the heart of ongoing tensions between the countries are accusations by armenia that turkey was directly responsible for what it calls the genocide of 1.5 million armenians in 1915 during world war i , a charge strongly denied by ankara turkey officially admits that as many as 600,000 armenians died during the war and deportation from eastern anatolia , but it insists the deaths must be seen in the context of an armenian uprising at a time when armenians were siding with invading russian troops earlier this week , ankara recalled its ambassador from canada after the canadian prime minister supported the genocide charge .
eyes on obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama looks likely to ease pressure on turkey after the talks with armenia ankara now fears us president barack obama will do the same .
during his presidential campaign obama said he would recognize the genocide if elected .
but yasemin congar , deputy editor of the turkish daily taraf , said obama may now hold back as a result of the new rapprochement efforts .
" washington wants to see turkey open its border with armenia , " she said .
" they want to see ankara and yerevan normalize diplomatic relations and there is a movement to that end .
" i think obama wants to give the message to ankara that if this process goes on it might even stop him from saying the ' g ' word , the genocide word in washington . "
during his visit to turkey earlier this month obama avoided using the so-called " g " word .
instead he praised the turkish and armenian rapprochement efforts .
eve of remembrance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflict between armenia and azerbaijan over nagorno-karabahk displaced hundreds of thousands the timing of turkey 's announcement of its agreement with armenia is being seen as no coincidence .
it comes just one day before armenians around the world remember those killed in 1915 .
traditionally , us presidents deliver a speech to mark the event .
us-based armenian groups have been lobbying obama intensively to use his expected speech to recognize the genocide .
that is now seen as unlikely in light of the new rapprochement efforts .
obama is also aware that a reference to genocide would seriously damage us-turkey relations .
the turkish government is paying a heavy domestic political price for its rapprochement efforts , since turkey 's close relationship to armenia 's rival , azerbaijan , is seen to be at risk .
sixteen years ago , armenia occupied nearly 20 percent of azerbaijan following a war over the disputed enclave of nagorno-karabakh . turkey imposed a trade embargo against armenia in support of its ally .
" all turkish press , all political opposition , is using the azerbaijani issue against the government .
i think the government finds itself in a very difficult position , " said political scientist nuray mert .
such pressure is already having an effect , with the turkish prime minister now linking the ending of the embargo to the withdrawal of armenian forces from azerbaijan .
that is seen as unlikely anytime soon .
turkish news reports have said azerbaijan is disturbed by the reconciliation efforts , which could lead to the reopening of the turkish-armenian border .
but with ankara facing increasing pressure from both the us and the eu to end the embargo , the turkish government now finds itself between a rock and a hard place .

" better relations , more neighborly relations , more trade , more opportunities and cooperation and peace - i see a light at the end of the tunnel , that peace is possible , " he said .
a senior western diplomat , who spoke on condition of anonymity , told reuters news agency that the deal had not yet been signed but that turkey and armenia had agreed on diplomatic ties , opening the border and establishing commissions to address historical disputes .
" all the documents have been agreed in principle but it 's from the signing that the clock starts ticking , " the diplomat said .
" it is a finite period that is not very long .
we are talking about weeks or months . "
old wounds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some armenian groups have long opposed reconciliation with turkey in armenia , several thousand protesters , mainly supporters of a nationalist junior partner in the government , burned turkish flags and condemned the efforts at normalizing relations .
at the heart of ongoing tensions between the countries are accusations by armenia that turkey was directly responsible for what it calls the genocide of 1.5 million armenians in 1915 during world war i , a charge strongly denied by ankara turkey officially admits that as many as 600,000 armenians died during the war and deportation from eastern anatolia , but it insists the deaths must be seen in the context of an armenian uprising at a time when armenians were siding with invading russian troops earlier this week , ankara recalled its ambassador from canada after the canadian prime minister supported the genocide charge .
eyes on obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama looks likely to ease pressure on turkey after the talks with armenia ankara now fears us president barack obama will do the same .
during his presidential campaign obama said he would recognize the genocide if elected .
but yasemin congar , deputy editor of the turkish daily taraf , said obama may now hold back as a result of the new rapprochement efforts .
" washington wants to see turkey open its border with armenia , " she said .
" they want to see ankara and yerevan normalize diplomatic relations and there is a movement to that end .
" i think obama wants to give the message to ankara that if this process goes on it might even stop him from saying the ' g ' word , the genocide word in washington . "
during his visit to turkey earlier this month obama avoided using the so-called " g " word .
instead he praised the turkish and armenian rapprochement efforts .
eve of remembrance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflict between armenia and azerbaijan over nagorno-karabahk displaced hundreds of thousands the timing of turkey 's announcement of its agreement with armenia is being seen as no coincidence .
it comes just one day before armenians around the world remember those killed in 1915 .
traditionally , us presidents deliver a speech to mark the event .
us-based armenian groups have been lobbying obama intensively to use his expected speech to recognize the genocide .
that is now seen as unlikely in light of the new rapprochement efforts .
obama is also aware that a reference to genocide would seriously damage us-turkey relations .
the turkish government is paying a heavy domestic political price for its rapprochement efforts , since turkey 's close relationship to armenia 's rival , azerbaijan , is seen to be at risk .
sixteen years ago , armenia occupied nearly 20 percent of azerbaijan following a war over the disputed enclave of nagorno-karabakh . turkey imposed a trade embargo against armenia in support of its ally .
" all turkish press , all political opposition , is using the azerbaijani issue against the government .
i think the government finds itself in a very difficult position , " said political scientist nuray mert .
such pressure is already having an effect , with the turkish prime minister now linking the ending of the embargo to the withdrawal of armenian forces from azerbaijan .
that is seen as unlikely anytime soon .
turkish news reports have said azerbaijan is disturbed by the reconciliation efforts , which could lead to the reopening of the turkish-armenian border .
but with ankara facing increasing pressure from both the us and the eu to end the embargo , the turkish government now finds itself between a rock and a hard place .

" we will not participate in the election of a president , or in parliamentary sessions that will discuss it , " said mihai gimpu , leader of the opposition liberal party of moldova -lrb- lpm -rrb- .
disputed national elections earlier this month gave the ruling communists 60 seats in moldova 's 101-seat legislature , prompting violent clashes in the capital , chisinau .
opposition demonstrators accused the communists of voter fraud and battled with police on april 7 , leaving one dead , hundreds injured , and the parliament building ransacked and partially burned .
according to the constitution , moldova 's next president must be voted into office by the new parliament , by a 61 member majority .
however , three opposition parties , including the lpm , control 41 seats in moldova 's legislature , according to a vote recount completed by the central election commission on wednesday - creating a potential deadlock .
opposition aiming to block presidential selection moldova 's supreme court on thursday afternoon set a limit on the time allowed for the legislature to select a president , ruling that parliament must choose a new chief executive by july 7 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin must stand down by law - but who will follow him ?
if it fails to agree on a president by that date , the parliament must be dissolved and new elections would have to be held , the court said , setting the rival factions on a possible collision course once again .
independent observers including monitors from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- ruled moldova 's april 5 elections were generally free and fair .
moldovan president vladimir voronin , head of the communist party , took the country 's top office in 2001 and has held it ever since .
but as he is prevented by constitutional statute from continuing in office , a new president must be chosen .
concerned eu discuss sending mission to moldova meanwhile , european union external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner has backed the idea of sending an eu mission to moldova .
" personally i 'm in favor of such a mission , that 's absolutely clear .
now we have to work out the terms of reference of such a mission , " she told a press conference in brussels .
the idea of an investigative mission , including representatives from the european commission and the moldovan opposition was first mooted wednesday by czech president mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
topolanek made the suggestion during a visit to moldova where he met communist president vladimir voronin and opposition figures , saying it would help shed light on recent events and help restore calm .
the mission proposal will be put to a meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg on monday . nda / mll , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is our hope that any car scrappage legislation ultimately enacted will remedy these concerns , and that the eu will be able to support this important initiative to promote fuel-efficiency , reduce pollution , and provide a needed boost to the automobile industry , " john bruton , the eu 's ambassador to the united states , said in a letter sent to the us congress on wednesday .
president barack obama supports passage of a " cash-for-clunkers " bill to pay people to turn in their gas guzzlers and replace them with more fuel-efficient vehicles .
but bruton said europe is worried that a leading version of the legislation , " as currently drafted , provides benefits only for replacement vehicles assembled in the u.s. or north america , a distinction that would harm car manufacturers from other parts of the world , including europe . "
such a provision , he added , would be " a clear violation " of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- rules requiring a country 's laws to treat foreign and domestic products equally .
possible compromise on north american provision europe 's fears and the concerns that the eu and us may bring their differences before the wto were partially allayed on thursday when got a boost after a leading proponent of the " cash-for-clunkers " bill , ohio congresswoman betty sutton , signaled she may drop a provision limiting the subsidies to purchases of north american made vehicles .
the provision has been a major sticking point in congressional efforts to merge competing proposals for the program , and sutton 's move brings those who are opposed to the north america requirement closer to a compromise with those who support it .
" it 's not so important to me that it has to be done " exactly according to her bill , but rather that a program is passed , sutton told reporters on capitol hill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany allows trade-ins for german and foreign cars germany , france , and slovakia - as well as china - have already enacted such trade-in programs but a central feature of the european programs is that they apply to all vehicles , whether assembled in europe or abroad .
the us may now follow suit as congressional aides redouble their efforts to find common ground on compromise legislation that could clear congress within months .
but even if a compromise is reached , lawmakers must find funding for the program .
some have suggested that the money would come from the economic stimulus package passed earlier this year .
proponents say the program - to provide new-car discounts of $ 1,500 to $ 7,500 -lrb- 1,150 euros – 5,700 euros -rrb- , depending on the proposal - is desperately needed to lift slumping car sales . nda / mll , reuters / wall street journal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

organizers of the meeting , chaired by ban and the african union , had said more than $ 250 million was needed to improve security in a state which has had no central government since former president mohamed siad barre was ousted in 1991 , setting off a bloody cycle of clashes between rival factions .
eu officials said the aim was to build up a police force of some 10,000 officers and a security force of 5,000 .
support is also sought for the 4,300-strong african union mission amisom .
the amisom force - the only security presence backing the government - is well short of the 8,000 soldiers initially planned and is regularly attacked by the islamist shebab militia .
" restoring security and stability in somalia is vital to the success of the reconciliation effort and the survival of the unity government , " ban told the conference , held under the auspices of the united nations .
" much remains to be done . "
ban reiterated he had no intention of sending a un force to somalia any time soon , saying that the united nations should take a cautious and incremental approach to sending its own peacekeeping mission , and only " when the security conditions are appropriate . "
target likely to be exceeded after delegates underlined the challenges facing the war-torn country , organizers said donors had promised funding which was likely to exceed their initial expectations .
" we are on target , we are even a little bit higher because the target was $ 250 million , " said eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel .
" it seems that we are also above 250 million if you take into account material aid . "
" it 's really a full success , " he added to reporters after the four-hour conference in brussels .
the european commission , whose president jose manuel barroso also attended , had announced it would pledge at least 60 million euros on the eve of the meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamists have battled numerous governments president ahmed , who took office in january , made a personal plea for funds at the conference .
" solving this problem will require a radical solution , " said ahmed .
" the restoration of security and peace in somalia is the basis of any solution to the problems , " he said .
islamist fighters including the hard-line shebab militia have waged battles against the transitional government , its predecessor cabinet and their allies , vowing to fight until all foreign forces withdraw and sharia law is imposed .
more than one million people have fled their homes .
fewer than one in three somalis , whose life expectancy is 46 years , have access to clean water .
general instability and lawlessness while the conference was not focused on piracy , the high media profile of the growing number of cases of daring raids on freighters on the seas of the gulf of aden has become synonymous with somalia 's woes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international anti-piracy efforts face a tough mission " piracy is not a water-borne disease .
it is a symptom of anarchy and insecurity on the ground , " ban said .
" dealing with it requires an integrated strategy that addresses the fundamental issue of lawlessness in somalia . "
despite international naval missions - including from nato and the european union - piracy has mushroomed over the last year , as ransom-hunting somalis tackle ever-bigger and more distant prizes .
more than 130 merchant ships were attacked in the region last year , an increase of more than 200 percent on 2007 , the international maritime bureau said .
a tenfold increase was noted in the first three months of 2009 .
" if we only treat the symptoms , piracy at sea , but not its root causes - the decay of the state and poverty - we will fail , " barroso said .
non-governmental organization oxfam said the conference was being held at a critical moment for 3.2 million somalis desperately in need of aid , more than a million of whom have fled their homes to avoid fighting in the last two years .
" the piracy issue that has grabbed international headlines is a symptom of deeper issues that have gone unaddressed ever since the collapse of the national government in 1991 , " oxfam 's robert maletta said in a statement .
ahmed underlined : " it is our duty to pursue these criminals not only on the high seas but also on terra firma . "

eu officials said the aim was to build up a police force of some 10,000 officers and a security force of 5,000 .
support is also sought for the 4,300-strong african union mission amisom .
the amisom force - the only security presence backing the government - is well short of the 8,000 soldiers initially planned and is regularly attacked by the islamist shebab militia .
" restoring security and stability in somalia is vital to the success of the reconciliation effort and the survival of the unity government , " ban told the conference , held under the auspices of the united nations .
" much remains to be done . "
ban reiterated he had no intention of sending a un force to somalia any time soon , saying that the united nations should take a cautious and incremental approach to sending its own peacekeeping mission , and only " when the security conditions are appropriate . "
target likely to be exceeded after delegates underlined the challenges facing the war-torn country , organizers said donors had promised funding which was likely to exceed their initial expectations .
" we are on target , we are even a little bit higher because the target was $ 250 million , " said eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel .
" it seems that we are also above 250 million if you take into account material aid . "
" it 's really a full success , " he added to reporters after the four-hour conference in brussels .
the european commission , whose president jose manuel barroso also attended , had announced it would pledge at least 60 million euros on the eve of the meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamists have battled numerous governments president ahmed , who took office in january , made a personal plea for funds at the conference .
" solving this problem will require a radical solution , " said ahmed .
" the restoration of security and peace in somalia is the basis of any solution to the problems , " he said .
islamist fighters including the hard-line shebab militia have waged battles against the transitional government , its predecessor cabinet and their allies , vowing to fight until all foreign forces withdraw and sharia law is imposed .
more than one million people have fled their homes .
fewer than one in three somalis , whose life expectancy is 46 years , have access to clean water .
general instability and lawlessness while the conference was not focused on piracy , the high media profile of the growing number of cases of daring raids on freighters on the seas of the gulf of aden has become synonymous with somalia 's woes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international anti-piracy efforts face a tough mission " piracy is not a water-borne disease .
it is a symptom of anarchy and insecurity on the ground , " ban said .
" dealing with it requires an integrated strategy that addresses the fundamental issue of lawlessness in somalia . "
despite international naval missions - including from nato and the european union - piracy has mushroomed over the last year , as ransom-hunting somalis tackle ever-bigger and more distant prizes .
more than 130 merchant ships were attacked in the region last year , an increase of more than 200 percent on 2007 , the international maritime bureau said .
a tenfold increase was noted in the first three months of 2009 .
" if we only treat the symptoms , piracy at sea , but not its root causes - the decay of the state and poverty - we will fail , " barroso said .
non-governmental organization oxfam said the conference was being held at a critical moment for 3.2 million somalis desperately in need of aid , more than a million of whom have fled their homes to avoid fighting in the last two years .
" the piracy issue that has grabbed international headlines is a symptom of deeper issues that have gone unaddressed ever since the collapse of the national government in 1991 , " oxfam 's robert maletta said in a statement .
ahmed underlined : " it is our duty to pursue these criminals not only on the high seas but also on terra firma . "
piracy on the increase despite international force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's mission off the coast of somalia is in question piracy has worsened off somalia 's coast despite the presence of naval forces from more than a dozen countries , including task forces under nato , eu and us command .
nato 's four-ship mission was due to wind up its operation on thursday .
diplomats were discussing whether it could be extended and nato has said it wants tougher rules to allow the detention of captured suspects .
the united states , which is reviewing its somalia policy , plans to help build somali security forces and bolster the new government but has made clear it has no desire to " drive " the whole process . nda / mll , afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision to move the summit was dependent on approval from the other nations attending the summit scheduled for july 8-10 there have already been signs of dissent within berlusconi 's cabinet over moving the g8 summit , with at least one minister saying it was " implausible " and would be difficult to pull off .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 23.04.2009 donors pledge $ 213 million for security in somalia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalia has been locked in a cycle of chaos and violence for nearly two decades international donors have pledged 213 million dollars -lrb- 163 million euros -rrb- to help bolster security in somalia , a key to helping end attacks by pirates off the country 's coast . donors made the pledges at a conference in brussels thursday at which united nations secretary general ban ki-moon and somalia 's president , sheikh sharif ahmed , appealed for funds to help end two decades of lawlessness in the east african country .
organizers of the meeting , chaired by ban and the african union , had said more than $ 250 million was needed to improve security in a state which has had no central government since former president mohamed siad barre was ousted in 1991 , setting off a bloody cycle of clashes between rival factions .
eu officials said the aim was to build up a police force of some 10,000 officers and a security force of 5,000 .
support is also sought for the 4,300-strong african union mission amisom .
the amisom force - the only security presence backing the government - is well short of the 8,000 soldiers initially planned and is regularly attacked by the islamist shebab militia .
" restoring security and stability in somalia is vital to the success of the reconciliation effort and the survival of the unity government , " ban told the conference , held under the auspices of the united nations .
" much remains to be done . "
ban reiterated he had no intention of sending a un force to somalia any time soon , saying that the united nations should take a cautious and incremental approach to sending its own peacekeeping mission , and only " when the security conditions are appropriate . "
target likely to be exceeded after delegates underlined the challenges facing the war-torn country , organizers said donors had promised funding which was likely to exceed their initial expectations .
" we are on target , we are even a little bit higher because the target was $ 250 million , " said eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel .
" it seems that we are also above 250 million if you take into account material aid . "
" it 's really a full success , " he added to reporters after the four-hour conference in brussels .
the european commission , whose president jose manuel barroso also attended , had announced it would pledge at least 60 million euros on the eve of the meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamists have battled numerous governments president ahmed , who took office in january , made a personal plea for funds at the conference .
" solving this problem will require a radical solution , " said ahmed .
" the restoration of security and peace in somalia is the basis of any solution to the problems , " he said .
islamist fighters including the hard-line shebab militia have waged battles against the transitional government , its predecessor cabinet and their allies , vowing to fight until all foreign forces withdraw and sharia law is imposed .
more than one million people have fled their homes .
fewer than one in three somalis , whose life expectancy is 46 years , have access to clean water .
general instability and lawlessness while the conference was not focused on piracy , the high media profile of the growing number of cases of daring raids on freighters on the seas of the gulf of aden has become synonymous with somalia 's woes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international anti-piracy efforts face a tough mission " piracy is not a water-borne disease .
it is a symptom of anarchy and insecurity on the ground , " ban said .
" dealing with it requires an integrated strategy that addresses the fundamental issue of lawlessness in somalia . "
despite international naval missions - including from nato and the european union - piracy has mushroomed over the last year , as ransom-hunting somalis tackle ever-bigger and more distant prizes .
more than 130 merchant ships were attacked in the region last year , an increase of more than 200 percent on 2007 , the international maritime bureau said .
a tenfold increase was noted in the first three months of 2009 .
" if we only treat the symptoms , piracy at sea , but not its root causes - the decay of the state and poverty - we will fail , " barroso said .
non-governmental organization oxfam said the conference was being held at a critical moment for 3.2 million somalis desperately in need of aid , more than a million of whom have fled their homes to avoid fighting in the last two years .
" the piracy issue that has grabbed international headlines is a symptom of deeper issues that have gone unaddressed ever since the collapse of the national government in 1991 , " oxfam 's robert maletta said in a statement .
ahmed underlined : " it is our duty to pursue these criminals not only on the high seas but also on terra firma . "
piracy on the increase despite international force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's mission off the coast of somalia is in question piracy has worsened off somalia 's coast despite the presence of naval forces from more than a dozen countries , including task forces under nato , eu and us command .
nato 's four-ship mission was due to wind up its operation on thursday .
diplomats were discussing whether it could be extended and nato has said it wants tougher rules to allow the detention of captured suspects .
the united states , which is reviewing its somalia policy , plans to help build somali security forces and bolster the new government but has made clear it has no desire to " drive " the whole process . nda / mll , afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" what seat would be more appropriate than a land wounded by the earthquake ? "
berlusconi told a news conference in l 'aquila on thursday , after holding a cabinet meeting in the stricken town .
berlusconi said moving the meeting of the heads of government of the world 's richest countries , currently set to take place on la maddalena , a small island off sardinia , would be a " positive signal for the more than 60,000 people still living in temporary camps . "
" the 21 heads of government who come will be able to see first-hand the wounds caused by this earthquake , " berlusconi added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 23.04.2009 turkey and armenia agree on reconciliation roadmap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish president abdullah gul , left , and armenian president serzh sargsyan met in 2008 turkey and armenia have reached an agreement on a comprehensive framework to normalize relations .
deutsche welle correspondent dorian jones reports that the process carries some risk for the turkish government . the turkish minister for eu affairs , egemen bagis , said thursday the process , which is taking place under swiss supervision , aimed to bring about a fundamental change in bilateral relations between the two countries .
" better relations , more neighborly relations , more trade , more opportunities and cooperation and peace - i see a light at the end of the tunnel , that peace is possible , " he said .
a senior western diplomat , who spoke on condition of anonymity , told reuters news agency that the deal had not yet been signed but that turkey and armenia had agreed on diplomatic ties , opening the border and establishing commissions to address historical disputes .
" all the documents have been agreed in principle but it 's from the signing that the clock starts ticking , " the diplomat said .
" it is a finite period that is not very long .
we are talking about weeks or months . "
old wounds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some armenian groups have long opposed reconciliation with turkey in armenia , several thousand protesters , mainly supporters of a nationalist junior partner in the government , burned turkish flags and condemned the efforts at normalizing relations .
at the heart of ongoing tensions between the countries are accusations by armenia that turkey was directly responsible for what it calls the genocide of 1.5 million armenians in 1915 during world war i , a charge strongly denied by ankara turkey officially admits that as many as 600,000 armenians died during the war and deportation from eastern anatolia , but it insists the deaths must be seen in the context of an armenian uprising at a time when armenians were siding with invading russian troops earlier this week , ankara recalled its ambassador from canada after the canadian prime minister supported the genocide charge .
eyes on obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama looks likely to ease pressure on turkey after the talks with armenia ankara now fears us president barack obama will do the same .
during his presidential campaign obama said he would recognize the genocide if elected .
but yasemin congar , deputy editor of the turkish daily taraf , said obama may now hold back as a result of the new rapprochement efforts .
" washington wants to see turkey open its border with armenia , " she said .
" they want to see ankara and yerevan normalize diplomatic relations and there is a movement to that end .

" it is our hope that any car scrappage legislation ultimately enacted will remedy these concerns , and that the eu will be able to support this important initiative to promote fuel-efficiency , reduce pollution , and provide a needed boost to the automobile industry , " john bruton , the eu 's ambassador to the united states , said in a letter sent to the us congress on wednesday .
president barack obama supports passage of a " cash-for-clunkers " bill to pay people to turn in their gas guzzlers and replace them with more fuel-efficient vehicles .
but bruton said europe is worried that a leading version of the legislation , " as currently drafted , provides benefits only for replacement vehicles assembled in the u.s. or north america , a distinction that would harm car manufacturers from other parts of the world , including europe . "
such a provision , he added , would be " a clear violation " of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- rules requiring a country 's laws to treat foreign and domestic products equally .
possible compromise on north american provision europe 's fears and the concerns that the eu and us may bring their differences before the wto were partially allayed on thursday when got a boost after a leading proponent of the " cash-for-clunkers " bill , ohio congresswoman betty sutton , signaled she may drop a provision limiting the subsidies to purchases of north american made vehicles .
the provision has been a major sticking point in congressional efforts to merge competing proposals for the program , and sutton 's move brings those who are opposed to the north america requirement closer to a compromise with those who support it .
" it 's not so important to me that it has to be done " exactly according to her bill , but rather that a program is passed , sutton told reporters on capitol hill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany allows trade-ins for german and foreign cars germany , france , and slovakia - as well as china - have already enacted such trade-in programs but a central feature of the european programs is that they apply to all vehicles , whether assembled in europe or abroad .
the us may now follow suit as congressional aides redouble their efforts to find common ground on compromise legislation that could clear congress within months .
but even if a compromise is reached , lawmakers must find funding for the program .
some have suggested that the money would come from the economic stimulus package passed earlier this year .
proponents say the program - to provide new-car discounts of $ 1,500 to $ 7,500 -lrb- 1,150 euros – 5,700 euros -rrb- , depending on the proposal - is desperately needed to lift slumping car sales . nda / mll , reuters / wall street journal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a female trend bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was harry potter rather than shakespeare who got germans to choose the original version " the english boom can mainly be attributed to women , " he added .
" women , as a rule , are more likely to read novels , and material like the ' twilight ' series clearly caters to a female audience . "
in many cases , readers - those diligent about improving their own english or their children 's - buy both the german and english version .
while developing strong english skills is essential to career success in europe , some german readers also choose the original version when the topic has a strong connection to the language .
" our users … want everything about barack obama as quickly as possible - also in english , " said claudia kaltenbach thursday in the hamburger abendblatt .
according to the german booksellers ' association the market share of foreign-language novels has doubled in the past five years , though at just three percent it 's still relatively small .
world book day celebrated on april 23 , world book day is n't language specific - the idea actually began in the catalonian region of spain .
every year on saint george 's name day , catalonians would give each other roses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as part of world book day , stories by prominent authors are distributed to students for free in the 1920s , barcelona 's book guild saw an opportunity and introduced the tradition of giving books along with roses on april 23 .
unesco took up the idea in 1995 , declaring an international day to celebrate reading , books and authors ' rights .
in germany , world book day is observed with a slew of creative events across the country - from readings by prominent actors , to a literary tango evening , to book presentations on a fashion-show-style catwalk .
fittingly , april 23 is also the anniversary of william shakespeare 's death .
though the works of the legendary english playwright are well-known in germany , they have n't profited from the boom in original english texts .

" i can well imagine that in two or three months , people 's anger will grow considerably , " schwan told the muenchener merkur newspaper .
that 's when some of the government 's measures to cushion the blow from the recession - such as filling in the pay gap for people who are forced into shortened work hours - are due to run out .
" if there is no sign of hope for things to improve , then the mood can turn explosive , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if aid measures run out , patience will as well , schwan warns schwan 's comments followed those of sommer , who heads the federation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- umbrella group .
in an intervew with germany 's ard television , sommer warned of social unrest comparable to that in the 1930s - when widespread poverty paved the way for the nazi regime 's rise to power .
fraying tempers in france the projected economic contraction of up to six percent is comparable with data from the years 1930 , 1931 and 1932 , sommer said .
making the rounds of the german press , sommer told the nordwest zeitung newspaper that if there are mass layoffs , it would be " a provocation for workers and the unions , " indicating that " social unrest could no longer be discounted " in germany .
the seams of civil restraint are already beginning to fray in france - a country known for frequent strikes and an active labor movment .
on tuesday , a french court rejected a motion brought by employees of a factory run by germany 's continental ag to block the plant 's planned 2010 closure .
citing the steep drop in demand in the automobile sector , continental announced in march plans to shutter the factory in clairoix , north of paris , which employs 1,120 .
smashed windows , destroyed equipment workers responded to the ruling by smashing windows and destroying equipment at the factory and regional administrative offices in nearby compiegne .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sommer sees parallels with the early 1930s on wednesday , factory management distributed fliers reading : " we have no other choice but to suspend production as well as the whole of the site 's activities until further notice . "
french government officials condemned the workers ' rampage , calling it " unacceptable . "
continental workers have drawn nationwide attention , meeting with top government officials at the presidential palace , burning tires in the streets of the capital and leading weeks of protests .
their actions are part of a wave of increasingly radical employee movements to fight layoffs and cutbacks prompted by france 's worst economic performance in 30 years .
workers have held managers hostage and blocked production at sites around the country .
on tuesday , workers in southwest france released two bosses held for two days over plans to shut a subsidiary of american automotive company molex .
french prime minister francois fillon criticized what he called a small minority of " very violent " workers who are hijacking peaceful union mediation efforts .

their forecast is even gloomier than the imf 's prediction for 2009 . germany 's leading economic institutes are predicting the worst economic decline since the country was founded in 1949 . in their annual spring report , they say the country 's economy will shrink by 6.0 percent this year .
the world 's top exporter is not likely to see an improvement any time soon , either . the institutes predict that the recession will continue into 2010 , with the economy contracting by 0.5 percent next year . the economic experts also say unemployment will rise to just under five million jobless by the end of next year . " on the basis of leading indicators , the institutes expect that the downward trend to continue and do not believe it will bottom out before the middle of 2010 , " the widely-watched report states . the institutes publish their outlook twice a year . the spring report 2009 comes a day after the latest projections by the international monetary fund , imf , which said the german economy was likely to contract by 5.6 percent , pushing unemployment rates up .
with global trade shrinking and the world economy gripped by recession , the international monetary fund has slashed its 2009 growth forecast for the entire 16-member euro zone by another one to 4.2 percent .
dire predictions but while their prognosis for germany looked especially bad , the imf said germany 's government still had more room to maneuver because of sound fiscal policies in the past , and should be spending extra public funds to make up for the massive decline in exports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck and guttenberg have their work cut out for them " could they do more ?
the answer is yes , " imf economist jorg decressin said .
" this is a case where a country has done its homework during the good times ... and can take advantage of this during the bad times . "
as the world 's leading export nation , germany now appears to be bearing the brunt of the global recession , with the imf saying unemployment could climb to 10.8 percent in 2010 from 9 percent this year .
germany 's jobless rate was 7.3 percent last year .
“ i think we were all agreed around the table that we have a very difficult year ahead of us , " said german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg at a news conference on wednesday following an economic summit with chancellor angela merkel and leaders from industry and unions . finance minister peer steinbrueck told reporters there had been a slump of 3.3 percent in the first three months of the year .
labor market crisis the imf 's latest world economic outlook underscores the risks that the economic crisis is rapidly turning into a labor market crisis , with euro-zone unemployment set to rise this year to 10.1 percent before edging up to 11.5 percent in 2010 .
this is despite the massive stimulus packages introduced by european governments and the number of companies across europe placing employees on short-term working contracts rather than laying them off .
the euro-zone jobless rate stood at 7.6 percent in 2008 .
" the euro area is coming out of this crisis somewhat later than the us because to some extent the policy stimulus kicked in later , " decressin told reporters in washington .
but it is a picture repeated across europe , with the imf saying france faces a 3 percent fall in growth in 2009 and a meagre 0.4 percent pickup next year , while italian gdp should sink by 4.4 percent this year .
britain , which has been battling with falling consumer demand , a housing market collapse and a drawing in of its key financial sector , is expected to stage only a modest recovery after this year 's 4.1 percent contraction .
the imf predicts british unemployment will jump from 7.4 percent in 2009 to 9.2 percent next year .
ireland has been particularly badly hit by the world recession and the credit crunch , and the imf predicts that irish economic growth will fall by a disastrous 8 percent this year and by 3 percent in 2010 after a collapse in the nation 's construction boom . db / pfd , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since the 1960s , increased levels of atmospheric pollution have enhanced plant productivity by as much as one quarter , research has found .
in terms of carbon dioxide , this means that an extra 10 % has been stored in the soil .
the research was published in the scientific journal , nature .
it is a common assumption that plants grow best in clear sunny weather , but scientists say this is not always the case .
research has shown that forests and crops can also thrive in hazy conditions because clouds and particles in the atmosphere scatter sun light so that it bathes more leaves .
that enhances photosynthesis , the process by which plants turn light and carbon dioxide into food .
global dimming researchers have now analysed the impact on plants of the dimmer , hazier skies that have resulted from increases in air pollution around the world since the 1960s .
they have calculated that this so-called " global dimming " is responsible for increasing plant productivity by as much as one quarter from 1960 to 1999 .
dr lina mercado from the uk 's centre for ecology and hydrology , the lead author of the study , said : " this resulted in a net 10 % increase in the amount of carbon stored by the land once other effects were taken into account , " she was quoted as saying by the press association .
this study highlights some of the complications that arise when we try to tackle global warming .
as the world attempts to reduce the amount of smog and particulates in the atmosphere to improve human health , it will require even greater efforts to cut back on carbon dioxide .
this new research shows that plants will simply not absorb as much carbon dioxide in cleaner air conditions .
the research will also add weight to arguments about geo-engineering , the idea of curbing global warming by adding reflective materials to the atmosphere .
us president barack obama 's chief scientific adviser , professor john holdren , recently told reporters that such ideas , once dismissed as half-baked , would have to be seriously discussed , such was the scale of the climate challenge .

since the 1960s , increased levels of atmospheric pollution have enhanced plant productivity by as much as one quarter , research has found .
in terms of carbon dioxide , this means that an extra 10 % has been stored in the soil .
the research was published in the scientific journal , nature .
it is a common assumption that plants grow best in clear sunny weather , but scientists say this is not always the case .
research has shown that forests and crops can also thrive in hazy conditions because clouds and particles in the atmosphere scatter sun light so that it bathes more leaves .
that enhances photosynthesis , the process by which plants turn light and carbon dioxide into food .
global dimming researchers have now analysed the impact on plants of the dimmer , hazier skies that have resulted from increases in air pollution around the world since the 1960s .
they have calculated that this so-called " global dimming " is responsible for increasing plant productivity by as much as one quarter from 1960 to 1999 .
dr lina mercado from the uk 's centre for ecology and hydrology , the lead author of the study , said : " this resulted in a net 10 % increase in the amount of carbon stored by the land once other effects were taken into account , " she was quoted as saying by the press association .
this study highlights some of the complications that arise when we try to tackle global warming .
as the world attempts to reduce the amount of smog and particulates in the atmosphere to improve human health , it will require even greater efforts to cut back on carbon dioxide .
this new research shows that plants will simply not absorb as much carbon dioxide in cleaner air conditions .
the research will also add weight to arguments about geo-engineering , the idea of curbing global warming by adding reflective materials to the atmosphere .
us president barack obama 's chief scientific adviser , professor john holdren , recently told reporters that such ideas , once dismissed as half-baked , would have to be seriously discussed , such was the scale of the climate challenge .

the plans are expected to include clusters of power stations sharing pipes diverting carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions to sites under the sea .
on wednesday the chancellor announced funds for up to four similar projects .
each carbon capture scheme could cost more than £ 1bn , paid for by a new levy on consumers ' electricity bills .
a study by the energy company e.on has proposed a network connecting major emitters of carbon dioxide in the thames estuary to a central pipeline carrying the gas to be stored in old gas fields in the north sea .
the scheme could be built around new power stations proposed for kingsnorth , kent , and tilbury , essex , the study suggests .
the government estimates the technology could put around £ 8 a year on the average household bill by 2020 , although this figure depends on many factors . "
for some reason full scale carbon capture and storage deployment never materialises due to technological or financial constraints " greenpeace while the power industry and some environmentalists welcome the strong new commitment to carbon capture , others argue that even coal plants with carbon capture equipment fitted will still produce substantial amounts of greenhouse gases .
they want coal-fired plants ruled out altogether .
experts say that capturing carbon reduces the efficiency of a plant .
together with the co2 created by mining the coal , transporting it and building and running the equipment , it means that the " life cycle " carbon savings are likely to be around 75 % of the emissions , compared to unabated coal .
spurring the new strategy is the uk 's target of saving at least 80 % of its greenhouse gases by 2050 .
over-reliant and because no new coal power station has been built in the uk for more than 30 years , energy experts say the nation has become over-reliant on electricity from gas .
although government policies in the past have failed to attract industries to manufacture renewable technologies , sources have told the bbc they wanted to correct this by ensuring that carbon capture technology creates jobs at home .
environmental groups say although carbon capture and storage technology have both been proven , they have not been tested large-scale coal-fired plants .
a greenpeace spokesman said : " even for supporters of carbon capture and storage , the danger remains that a new coal plant like kingsnorth could be built at vast expense and with an expected lifespan of several decades - but that for some reason full-scale ccs deployment never materialises due to technological or financial constraints .
" this is entirely plausible given that ccs has not been proven at commercial scale anywhere in the world " .

the plans are expected to include clusters of power stations sharing pipes diverting carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions to sites under the sea .
on wednesday the chancellor announced funds for up to four similar projects .
each carbon capture scheme could cost more than £ 1bn , paid for by a new levy on consumers ' electricity bills .
a study by the energy company e.on has proposed a network connecting major emitters of carbon dioxide in the thames estuary to a central pipeline carrying the gas to be stored in old gas fields in the north sea .
the scheme could be built around new power stations proposed for kingsnorth , kent , and tilbury , essex , the study suggests .
the government estimates the technology could put around £ 8 a year on the average household bill by 2020 , although this figure depends on many factors .
for some reason full scale carbon capture and storage deployment never materialises due to technological or financial constraints greenpeace while the power industry and some environmentalists welcome the strong new commitment to carbon capture , others argue that even coal plants with carbon capture equipment fitted will still produce substantial amounts of greenhouse gases .
they want coal-fired plants ruled out altogether .
experts say that capturing carbon reduces the efficiency of a plant .
together with the co2 created by mining the coal , transporting it and building and running the equipment , it means that the " life cycle " carbon savings are likely to be around 75 % of the emissions , compared to unabated coal .
spurring the new strategy is the uk 's target of saving at least 80 % of its greenhouse gases by 2050 .
over-reliant and because no new coal power station has been built in the uk for more than 30 years , energy experts say the nation has become over-reliant on electricity from gas .
although government policies in the past have failed to attract industries to manufacture renewable technologies , sources have told the bbc they wanted to correct this by ensuring that carbon capture technology creates jobs at home .
environmental groups say although carbon capture and storage technology have both been proven , they have not been tested large-scale coal-fired plants .
a greenpeace spokesman said : " even for supporters of carbon capture and storage , the danger remains that a new coal plant like kingsnorth could be built at vast expense and with an expected lifespan of several decades - but that for some reason full-scale ccs deployment never materialises due to technological or financial constraints .
" this is entirely plausible given that ccs has not been proven at commercial scale anywhere in the world " .

the plans are expected to include clusters of power stations sharing pipes diverting carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions to sites under the sea .
on wednesday the chancellor announced funds for up to four similar projects .
each carbon capture scheme could cost more than £ 1bn , paid for by a new levy on consumers ' electricity bills .
a study by the energy company e.on has proposed a network connecting major emitters of carbon dioxide in the thames estuary to a central pipeline carrying the gas to be stored in old gas fields in the north sea .
the scheme could be built around new power stations proposed for kingsnorth , kent , and tilbury , essex , the study suggests .
the government estimates the technology could put around £ 8 a year on the average household bill by 2020 , although this figure depends on many factors .
for some reason full scale carbon capture and storage deployment never materialises due to technological or financial constraints greenpeace while the power industry and some environmentalists welcome the strong new commitment to carbon capture , others argue that even coal plants with carbon capture equipment fitted will still produce substantial amounts of greenhouse gases .
they want coal-fired plants ruled out altogether .
experts say that capturing carbon reduces the efficiency of a plant .
together with the co2 created by mining the coal , transporting it and building and running the equipment , it means that the " life cycle " carbon savings are likely to be around 75 % of the emissions , compared to unabated coal .
spurring the new strategy is the uk 's target of saving at least 80 % of its greenhouse gases by 2050 .
over-reliant and because no new coal power station has been built in the uk for more than 30 years , energy experts say the nation has become over-reliant on electricity from gas .
although government policies in the past have failed to attract industries to manufacture renewable technologies , sources have told the bbc they wanted to correct this by ensuring that carbon capture technology creates jobs at home .
environmental groups say although carbon capture and storage technology have both been proven , they have not been tested large-scale coal-fired plants .
a greenpeace spokesman said : " even for supporters of carbon capture and storage , the danger remains that a new coal plant like kingsnorth could be built at vast expense and with an expected lifespan of several decades - but that for some reason full-scale ccs deployment never materialises due to technological or financial constraints .

the financial times says " a wide and deep chasm " lay in front " but it turned out that he had only the materials for a short and rickety bridge . "
jeremy warner of the independent says " this was one of the most unconvincing and wrong-headed " recent budgets .
the daily express concludes that " the nation is hurtling towards bankruptcy at breakneck pace " .
' political war ' nearly all agree that history was made in the budget .
the guardian calls it " a return to class politics " - the daily telegraph calls it " class war " .
the daily mail describes the new 50 % upper tax rate as " a stake driven through the heart of new labour " .
the times thinks " it is a declaration of economic and political war on the country 's entrepreneurial class " .
the telegraph says it is " shabby cynicism " and comments : " they will not be forgiven for it . "
' robin hood chancellor ' the daily mirror stands alone in applauding the budget .
" just the job , " it says .
it hails alistair darling as " the robin hood chancellor " , saving the day by being " bold labour " , if not old labour , and taxing the rich to " help the poor " .
the independent says tax will certainly be " the election battleground " .
the sun says the disposition of the forces for that campaign are now clear : " labour is back to its high-tax , high-spending roots . "
growing recriminations eyebrows are raised at the release without charge of 12 men who had been questioned about an alleged bomb plot .
security sources have told the independent that the evidence amounted to one e-mail and a handful of ambiguous telephone conversations .
the guardian says the police often find themselves having to weigh the risk of terrorist atrocity against ending up with " a few red faces " .
there are growing recriminations over the operation , says the times .
