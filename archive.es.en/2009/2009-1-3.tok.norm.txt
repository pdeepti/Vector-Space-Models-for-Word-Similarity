" the european union calls for an urgent solution to the commercial dispute on gas supplies from the russian federation to ukraine , and for an immediate resumption of full deliveries of gas to the eu member states , " the eu presidency said in a statement .
" energy relations between the eu and its neighbors should be based on reliability and predictability .
existing commitments to supply and transit have to be honored under all circumstances , " it added .
pipeline pressure is down in the main pipes leading from ukraine into eu members hungary , poland and slovakia , the czech republic 's energy envoy , vaclav bartuska , told german new agency dpa .
" it is so far only a decrease in pressure .
the volumes -lrb- being delivered -rrb- remain the same ...
the ukrainian side told us that volumes will be down tomorrow -lrb- saturday -rrb- , " bartuska said .
russia is the eu 's largest single supplier of natural gas , and 80 percent of its deliveries pass through ukrainian territory .
extraordinary meeting called bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany gets about 40 percent of its gas from russia the eu 's czech presidency has called an special meeting of envoys from the 27 member states for monday to discuss the gas dispute between russian and ukraine , a spokesman said . " we are convening an extraordinary meeting ... at deputy ambassadors ' level on monday where the russia-ukraine gas dispute will be the sole topic for discussion , " a spokesman for the czech presidency told the afp news agency on friday . the goal of the meeting will be " to exchange information " and " to coordinate the eu 's response to the matter , " he told afp , repeating that so far there were no signs that european gas supplies had been hit . repeat performance three years ago , gazprom shut off gas supplies to ukraine in a near-identical row over gas prices and allegedly unpaid bills , causing sudden shortages across much of europe . unlike on that occasion , eu member states had widely anticipated the current shut-off , which comes in the context of increasingly tense relations both between moscow and kiev 's pro-western government and between ukraine 's president and prime minister . eu governments were careful to make sure that their gas stocks were full ahead of winter , meaning that the current shut-off is unlikely to have a short-term impact on supplies , eu sources said . battling versions of events in recent days , russia and ukraine have both conducted intense diplomatic campaigns to present the other side as the troublemaker in the dispute .
the prime ministers of both countries called european commission head jose manuel barroso on new year 's eve to present their respective versions of the row . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom is calling for ukraine to pay full-market price for gas , something it has n't done up to now an eu expert group on gas supplies is set to meet with member states ' representatives in brussels on january 9 .
gazprom is set to send an official to the meeting , while ukraine is expected to send a delegation to brussels in the coming days , officials said . however , analysts say that both sides ' reputations have already been tarnished in the row , with the eu increasingly keen to find gas supplies which come from countries other than russia and pass through countries other than ukraine . eu reliance on russian gas varies from zero in britain and ireland to 100 per cent in the baltic states and slovakia , according to the paris-based international energy agency .
germany , the eu 's largest economy , obtains some 40 percent of all the gas it uses from russia . dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" he -lrb- althaus -rrb- could say his name and his date of birth , " fried dahmen said .
the 50-year-old althuas , from chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- collided with a female skier on the slopes thursday afternoon , according to local police .
the woman , reportedly from slovakia and a mother of four , died on the way to the hospital .
althaus was evacuated for medical treatment by helicopter to a hospital in the austrian town of schwarzach im pongau where he was immediately treated for a serious head injury .
doctors treating the politician said on saturday that althaus ' condition was stable but warned it would take a while for him to recover fully .
earlier , the thueringe allgemeine zeitung newspaper reported that the fact that althaus was wearing a helmet at the time of the accident probably saved his life .
" the premier had a skiing helmet on , the woman did n't , " the paper quoted an austrian police spokesman as saying .
last week , another german skier without a helmet was killed on the austrian slopes .
the head of the cdu ’ s state parliamentary group in thuringia , mike mohring , expressed shock and grief over the incident .
“ i offer my deepest condolences to the relatives of the woman who died in the name of the althaus family and cdu , ” he said .
“ we hope and pray that the condition of the premier stabilizes and he will recover from his injuries . ”
althaus has been premier in thuringia since 2003 .
he was planning to run for reelection this august . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 07 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

elsewhere , however , there was further grim news for the german manufacturing sector . the record numbers of employment last year was the highest number since german unification in 1990 , figures showed .
the number of employed people increased 1.5 per cent from 2007 to 582,000 , partly due to the economic boom that lasted well into the first half of the year , according to the statistics office .
the economic downturn in the second half of 2008 did not have a major effect on employment , it said .
germany 's jobless rate hit a 16-year-low in november when 7.5 per cent of the workforce , or 3.15 million people , were without jobs .
the federal labor agency is due to release unemployment figures for december next week .
grim news on manufacturing front despite the good employment figures , there was further gloomy news for germany 's economy which has been hit particularly hard by the global slowdown .
according to the euro zone 's purchasing managers ' index , compiled by data and research group markit , manufacturing activity in the countries sharing the euro fell to a record low in december .
the purchasing managers ' index is a measure of an economy 's manufacturing activity .
a score over 50 points indicates growth , while a score below 50 reflects contracting industrial output .
december saw the euro zone 's score fall below 34 point points - the lowest level in the survey 's 11-year history . on a national level , germany was one of the hardest hit .
its score shrank to 32.7 in december - down three points from november .
chris williamson , the chief economist at markit , said germany 's disappointing score represents a 12 percent drop in industrial output .
speaking to dw-radio , williamson said germany 's huge reliance on exports to drive its economy was proving to be a major disadvantage in the current global downturn .
" germany , amongst the biggest euro zone economies , has seen the steepest contraction of its export order books , " williamson said . "
this is indicative of sharply declining production in its export markets such as china , the us and the uk , where companies are cutting back on their investment in their own factories , so they 're ordering less plant and machinery , machine tools and so forth which is of course one of the key drivers of germany 's expansion . ”

elsewhere , however , there was further grim news for the german manufacturing sector . the record numbers of employment last year was the highest number since german unification in 1990 , figures showed .
the number of employed people increased 1.5 per cent from 2007 to 582,000 , partly due to the economic boom that lasted well into the first half of the year , according to the statistics office .

the german foreign minister sees that as the only way to clear the path for a cease-fire after a week of air strikes by israel on gaza aimed at hamas , the statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , and merkel have both called on hamas to end rocket fire according to the ministry , steinmeier also reiterated his support for a " humanitarian cease-fire " that would make it easier to get supplies to gaza 's civilians and pave the way for diplomacy . steinmeier has telephoned with arab leaders as well as with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni in recent days to seek ways to end the violence . the german foreign minister has however stressed that the pre-condition for any truce had to be the cessation of missile attacks against israel by the radical hamas in the gaza strip .
german chancellor angela merkel has also come out in strong support of israel during the recent conflict , accusing hamas of terrorism in her new year 's address .
un warns of humanitarian crisis in gaza israel killed a top hamas militant in the gaza strip early saturday as its aircraft continued to pummel the territory on the eighth day of attacks against the islamist movement . gaza militants , for their part , continued to launch rockets and mortar shells at israel , with around five attacks reported on saturday .

us president george w bush on friday called for a " meaningful ceasefire " to the ongoing conflict in the middle east .
in his weekly radio address , bush blamed the situation on hamas ' violation of a ceasefire , calling it " an act of terror that is opposed by the legitimate leader of the palestinian people , president -lrb- mahmoud -rrb- abbas . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has blamed the violence on hamas he stressed that any newly brokered ceasefire must be upheld by both parties .
" the united states is leading diplomatic efforts to achieve a meaningful ceasefire that is fully respected .
another one-way ceasefire that leads to rocket attacks on israel is not acceptable , " bush said .
" and promises from hamas will not suffice - there must be monitoring mechanisms in place to help ensure that smuggling of weapons to terrorist groups in gaza comes to an end . "
eu to send mission to mideast the escalating violence has prompted the european union to send a mission to the region to push both sides to declare a ceasefire .
czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , will lead the delegation which includes eu foreign policy chief javier solana , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and the french and swedish foreign ministers .

" he -lrb- althaus -rrb- could say his name and his date of birth , " fried dahmen said .
the 50-year-old althuas , from chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- collided with a female skier on the slopes thursday afternoon , according to local police .
the woman , reportedly from slovakia and a mother of four , died on the way to the hospital .
althaus was evacuated for medical treatment by helicopter to a hospital in the austrian town of schwarzach im pongau where he was immediately treated for a serious head injury .
doctors treating the politician said on saturday that althaus ' condition was stable but warned it would take a while for him to recover fully .
earlier , the thueringe allgemeine zeitung newspaper reported that the fact that althaus was wearing a helmet at the time of the accident probably saved his life .
" the premier had a skiing helmet on , the woman did n't , " the paper quoted an austrian police spokesman as saying .
last week , another german skier without a helmet was killed on the austrian slopes .
the head of the cdu ’ s state parliamentary group in thuringia , mike mohring , expressed shock and grief over the incident .
“ i offer my deepest condolences to the relatives of the woman who died in the name of the althaus family and cdu , ” he said .
“ we hope and pray that the condition of the premier stabilizes and he will recover from his injuries . ”
althaus has been premier in thuringia since 2003 .

" he -lrb- althaus -rrb- could say his name and his date of birth , " fried dahmen said .
the 50-year-old althuas , from chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- collided with a female skier on the slopes thursday afternoon , according to local police .
the woman , reportedly from slovakia and a mother of four , died on the way to the hospital .
althaus was evacuated for medical treatment by helicopter to a hospital in the austrian town of schwarzach im pongau where he was immediately treated for a serious head injury .
doctors treating the politician said on saturday that althaus ' condition was stable but warned it would take a while for him to recover fully .
earlier , the thueringe allgemeine zeitung newspaper reported that the fact that althaus was wearing a helmet at the time of the accident probably saved his life .
" the premier had a skiing helmet on , the woman did n't , " the paper quoted an austrian police spokesman as saying .
last week , another german skier without a helmet was killed on the austrian slopes .
the head of the cdu ’ s state parliamentary group in thuringia , mike mohring , expressed shock and grief over the incident .
“ i offer my deepest condolences to the relatives of the woman who died in the name of the althaus family and cdu , ” he said .
“ we hope and pray that the condition of the premier stabilizes and he will recover from his injuries . ”
althaus has been premier in thuringia since 2003 .
he was planning to run for reelection this august . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

elsewhere , however , there was further grim news for the german manufacturing sector . the record numbers of employment last year was the highest number since german unification in 1990 , figures showed .
the number of employed people increased 1.5 per cent from 2007 to 582,000 , partly due to the economic boom that lasted well into the first half of the year , according to the statistics office .
the economic downturn in the second half of 2008 did not have a major effect on employment , it said .
germany 's jobless rate hit a 16-year-low in november when 7.5 per cent of the workforce , or 3.15 million people , were without jobs .

grim news on manufacturing front despite the good employment figures , there was further gloomy news for germany 's economy which has been hit particularly hard by the global slowdown .

the purchasing managers ' index is a measure of an economy 's manufacturing activity .

december saw the euro zone 's score fall below 34 point points - the lowest level in the survey 's 11-year history . on a national level , germany was one of the hardest hit .
its score shrank to 32.7 in december - down three points from november .
chris williamson , the chief economist at markit , said germany 's disappointing score represents a 12 percent drop in industrial output .
speaking to dw-radio , williamson said germany 's huge reliance on exports to drive its economy was proving to be a major disadvantage in the current global downturn .
" germany , amongst the biggest euro zone economies , has seen the steepest contraction of its export order books , " williamson said . "
this is indicative of sharply declining production in its export markets such as china , the us and the uk , where companies are cutting back on their investment in their own factories , so they 're ordering less plant and machinery , machine tools and so forth which is of course one of the key drivers of germany 's expansion . ”

" the european union calls for an urgent solution to the commercial dispute on gas supplies from the russian federation to ukraine , and for an immediate resumption of full deliveries of gas to the eu member states , " the eu presidency said in a statement .
" energy relations between the eu and its neighbors should be based on reliability and predictability .
existing commitments to supply and transit have to be honored under all circumstances , " it added .
pipeline pressure is down in the main pipes leading from ukraine into eu members hungary , poland and slovakia , the czech republic 's energy envoy , vaclav bartuska , told german new agency dpa .
" it is so far only a decrease in pressure .
the volumes -lrb- being delivered -rrb- remain the same ...
the ukrainian side told us that volumes will be down tomorrow -lrb- saturday -rrb- , " bartuska said .
russia is the eu 's largest single supplier of natural gas , and 80 percent of its deliveries pass through ukrainian territory .
extraordinary meeting called bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany gets about 40 percent of its gas from russia the eu 's czech presidency has called an special meeting of envoys from the 27 member states for monday to discuss the gas dispute between russian and ukraine , a spokesman said . " we are convening an extraordinary meeting ... at deputy ambassadors ' level on monday where the russia-ukraine gas dispute will be the sole topic for discussion , " a spokesman for the czech presidency told the afp news agency on friday . the goal of the meeting will be " to exchange information " and " to coordinate the eu 's response to the matter , " he told afp , repeating that so far there were no signs that european gas supplies had been hit . repeat performance three years ago , gazprom shut off gas supplies to ukraine in a near-identical row over gas prices and allegedly unpaid bills , causing sudden shortages across much of europe . unlike on that occasion , eu member states had widely anticipated the current shut-off , which comes in the context of increasingly tense relations both between moscow and kiev 's pro-western government and between ukraine 's president and prime minister . eu governments were careful to make sure that their gas stocks were full ahead of winter , meaning that the current shut-off is unlikely to have a short-term impact on supplies , eu sources said . battling versions of events in recent days , russia and ukraine have both conducted intense diplomatic campaigns to present the other side as the troublemaker in the dispute .
the prime ministers of both countries called european commission head jose manuel barroso on new year 's eve to present their respective versions of the row . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom is calling for ukraine to pay full-market price for gas , something it has n't done up to now an eu expert group on gas supplies is set to meet with member states ' representatives in brussels on january 9 .
gazprom is set to send an official to the meeting , while ukraine is expected to send a delegation to brussels in the coming days , officials said . however , analysts say that both sides ' reputations have already been tarnished in the row , with the eu increasingly keen to find gas supplies which come from countries other than russia and pass through countries other than ukraine . eu reliance on russian gas varies from zero in britain and ireland to 100 per cent in the baltic states and slovakia , according to the paris-based international energy agency .
germany , the eu 's largest economy , obtains some 40 percent of all the gas it uses from russia . dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

elsewhere , however , there was further grim news for the german manufacturing sector . the record numbers of employment last year was the highest number since german unification in 1990 , figures showed .
the number of employed people increased 1.5 per cent from 2007 to 582,000 , partly due to the economic boom that lasted well into the first half of the year , according to the statistics office .
the economic downturn in the second half of 2008 did not have a major effect on employment , it said .
germany 's jobless rate hit a 16-year-low in november when 7.5 per cent of the workforce , or 3.15 million people , were without jobs .
the federal labor agency is due to release unemployment figures for december next week .
grim news on manufacturing front despite the good employment figures , there was further gloomy news for germany 's economy which has been hit particularly hard by the global slowdown .
according to the euro zone 's purchasing managers ' index , compiled by data and research group markit , manufacturing activity in the countries sharing the euro fell to a record low in december .
the purchasing managers ' index is a measure of an economy 's manufacturing activity .
a score over 50 points indicates growth , while a score below 50 reflects contracting industrial output .
december saw the euro zone 's score fall below 34 point points - the lowest level in the survey 's 11-year history . on a national level , germany was one of the hardest hit .
its score shrank to 32.7 in december - down three points from november .
chris williamson , the chief economist at markit , said germany 's disappointing score represents a 12 percent drop in industrial output .
speaking to dw-radio , williamson said germany 's huge reliance on exports to drive its economy was proving to be a major disadvantage in the current global downturn .
" germany , amongst the biggest euro zone economies , has seen the steepest contraction of its export order books , " williamson said . "
this is indicative of sharply declining production in its export markets such as china , the us and the uk , where companies are cutting back on their investment in their own factories , so they 're ordering less plant and machinery , machine tools and so forth which is of course one of the key drivers of germany 's expansion . ”
williamson added it would only a matter of time before german manufacturers start slashing jobs . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is clear now that the present crisis has inflicted much deeper wounds on big family fortunes than the last four or five recessions combined , " he said . he compared today 's threats to family fortunes that have grown over generations to those experienced during the bad old days of hyperinflation , during the 1920s or 1930s in germany . for example , the magazine said the value of the shares of the quandt industrial dynasty , which owns one-half of the capital of automaker bmw , has decreased by 50 percent in one year . according to the magazine , there are 122 german individuals or families worth at least one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.38 billion -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german foreign minister sees that as the only way to clear the path for a cease-fire after a week of air strikes by israel on gaza aimed at hamas , the statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , and merkel have both called on hamas to end rocket fire according to the ministry , steinmeier also reiterated his support for a " humanitarian cease-fire " that would make it easier to get supplies to gaza 's civilians and pave the way for diplomacy . steinmeier has telephoned with arab leaders as well as with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni in recent days to seek ways to end the violence . the german foreign minister has however stressed that the pre-condition for any truce had to be the cessation of missile attacks against israel by the radical hamas in the gaza strip .

us president george w bush on friday called for a " meaningful ceasefire " to the ongoing conflict in the middle east .
in his weekly radio address , bush blamed the situation on hamas ' violation of a ceasefire , calling it " an act of terror that is opposed by the legitimate leader of the palestinian people , president -lrb- mahmoud -rrb- abbas . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has blamed the violence on hamas he stressed that any newly brokered ceasefire must be upheld by both parties .
" the united states is leading diplomatic efforts to achieve a meaningful ceasefire that is fully respected .
another one-way ceasefire that leads to rocket attacks on israel is not acceptable , " bush said .
" and promises from hamas will not suffice - there must be monitoring mechanisms in place to help ensure that smuggling of weapons to terrorist groups in gaza comes to an end . "
eu to send mission to mideast the escalating violence has prompted the european union to send a mission to the region to push both sides to declare a ceasefire .
czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , will lead the delegation which includes eu foreign policy chief javier solana , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and the french and swedish foreign ministers .

elsewhere , however , there was further grim news for the german manufacturing sector . the record numbers of employment last year was the highest number since german unification in 1990 , figures showed .
the number of employed people increased 1.5 per cent from 2007 to 582,000 , partly due to the economic boom that lasted well into the first half of the year , according to the statistics office .

december saw the euro zone 's score fall below 34 point points - the lowest level in the survey 's 11-year history . on a national level , germany was one of the hardest hit .
its score shrank to 32.7 in december - down three points from november .
chris williamson , the chief economist at markit , said germany 's disappointing score represents a 12 percent drop in industrial output .
speaking to dw-radio , williamson said germany 's huge reliance on exports to drive its economy was proving to be a major disadvantage in the current global downturn .
" germany , amongst the biggest euro zone economies , has seen the steepest contraction of its export order books , " williamson said . "
this is indicative of sharply declining production in its export markets such as china , the us and the uk , where companies are cutting back on their investment in their own factories , so they 're ordering less plant and machinery , machine tools and so forth which is of course one of the key drivers of germany 's expansion . ”

the german foreign minister sees that as the only way to clear the path for a cease-fire after a week of air strikes by israel on gaza aimed at hamas , the statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , and merkel have both called on hamas to end rocket fire according to the ministry , steinmeier also reiterated his support for a " humanitarian cease-fire " that would make it easier to get supplies to gaza 's civilians and pave the way for diplomacy . steinmeier has telephoned with arab leaders as well as with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni in recent days to seek ways to end the violence . the german foreign minister has however stressed that the pre-condition for any truce had to be the cessation of missile attacks against israel by the radical hamas in the gaza strip .
german chancellor angela merkel has also come out in strong support of israel during the recent conflict , accusing hamas of terrorism in her new year 's address .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has blamed the violence on hamas he stressed that any newly brokered ceasefire must be upheld by both parties .
" the united states is leading diplomatic efforts to achieve a meaningful ceasefire that is fully respected .

" and promises from hamas will not suffice - there must be monitoring mechanisms in place to help ensure that smuggling of weapons to terrorist groups in gaza comes to an end . "

" he -lrb- althaus -rrb- could say his name and his date of birth , " fried dahmen said .
the 50-year-old althuas , from chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- collided with a female skier on the slopes thursday afternoon , according to local police .
the woman , reportedly from slovakia and a mother of four , died on the way to the hospital .
althaus was evacuated for medical treatment by helicopter to a hospital in the austrian town of schwarzach im pongau where he was immediately treated for a serious head injury .
doctors treating the politician said on saturday that althaus ' condition was stable but warned it would take a while for him to recover fully .
earlier , the thueringe allgemeine zeitung newspaper reported that the fact that althaus was wearing a helmet at the time of the accident probably saved his life .
" the premier had a skiing helmet on , the woman did n't , " the paper quoted an austrian police spokesman as saying .
last week , another german skier without a helmet was killed on the austrian slopes .
the head of the cdu ’ s state parliamentary group in thuringia , mike mohring , expressed shock and grief over the incident .
“ i offer my deepest condolences to the relatives of the woman who died in the name of the althaus family and cdu , ” he said .
“ we hope and pray that the condition of the premier stabilizes and he will recover from his injuries . ”
althaus has been premier in thuringia since 2003 .
he was planning to run for reelection this august . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german foreign minister sees that as the only way to clear the path for a cease-fire after a week of air strikes by israel on gaza aimed at hamas , the statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , and merkel have both called on hamas to end rocket fire according to the ministry , steinmeier also reiterated his support for a " humanitarian cease-fire " that would make it easier to get supplies to gaza 's civilians and pave the way for diplomacy . steinmeier has telephoned with arab leaders as well as with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni in recent days to seek ways to end the violence . the german foreign minister has however stressed that the pre-condition for any truce had to be the cessation of missile attacks against israel by the radical hamas in the gaza strip .
german chancellor angela merkel has also come out in strong support of israel during the recent conflict , accusing hamas of terrorism in her new year 's address .
un warns of humanitarian crisis in gaza israel killed a top hamas militant in the gaza strip early saturday as its aircraft continued to pummel the territory on the eighth day of attacks against the islamist movement . gaza militants , for their part , continued to launch rockets and mortar shells at israel , with around five attacks reported on saturday .
earlier the hamas leader-in-exile , khaled meshaal , warned israel of a " black destiny " if it began a threatened ground offensive on gaza .
palestinian officials say at least 436 people have been killed and more than 2,200 injured since israel launched its bombing campaign in response to hamas rocket fire eight days ago .
the un said it believed 25 percent of more than 400 palestinians killed by israeli action so far were civilians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injured palestinian is helped from the rubble four israelis have been killed by palestinian rockets fired into israel since the campaign began last saturday .
israel has now carried out more than 700 strikes on gaza since launching the offensive last saturday , afp news agency said .
the united nations warned of a worsening humanitarian crisis in gaza .
earlier , chief un aid co-coordinator for the territory , maxwell gaylard , said gaza residents were cut off from food , medicine and other supplies .
bush blames hamas for violence protests and growing international outrage about the killing of civilians raised the pressure on world leaders to end the bloodshed .
us president george w bush on friday called for a " meaningful ceasefire " to the ongoing conflict in the middle east .
in his weekly radio address , bush blamed the situation on hamas ' violation of a ceasefire , calling it " an act of terror that is opposed by the legitimate leader of the palestinian people , president -lrb- mahmoud -rrb- abbas . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has blamed the violence on hamas he stressed that any newly brokered ceasefire must be upheld by both parties .
" the united states is leading diplomatic efforts to achieve a meaningful ceasefire that is fully respected .
another one-way ceasefire that leads to rocket attacks on israel is not acceptable , " bush said .
" and promises from hamas will not suffice - there must be monitoring mechanisms in place to help ensure that smuggling of weapons to terrorist groups in gaza comes to an end . "
eu to send mission to mideast the escalating violence has prompted the european union to send a mission to the region to push both sides to declare a ceasefire .
czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , will lead the delegation which includes eu foreign policy chief javier solana , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and the french and swedish foreign ministers .

extraordinary meeting called bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany gets about 40 percent of its gas from russia the eu 's czech presidency has called an special meeting of envoys from the 27 member states for monday to discuss the gas dispute between russian and ukraine , a spokesman said . " we are convening an extraordinary meeting ... at deputy ambassadors ' level on monday where the russia-ukraine gas dispute will be the sole topic for discussion , " a spokesman for the czech presidency told the afp news agency on friday . the goal of the meeting will be " to exchange information " and " to coordinate the eu 's response to the matter , " he told afp , repeating that so far there were no signs that european gas supplies had been hit . repeat performance three years ago , gazprom shut off gas supplies to ukraine in a near-identical row over gas prices and allegedly unpaid bills , causing sudden shortages across much of europe . unlike on that occasion , eu member states had widely anticipated the current shut-off , which comes in the context of increasingly tense relations both between moscow and kiev 's pro-western government and between ukraine 's president and prime minister . eu governments were careful to make sure that their gas stocks were full ahead of winter , meaning that the current shut-off is unlikely to have a short-term impact on supplies , eu sources said . battling versions of events in recent days , russia and ukraine have both conducted intense diplomatic campaigns to present the other side as the troublemaker in the dispute .
the prime ministers of both countries called european commission head jose manuel barroso on new year 's eve to present their respective versions of the row . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom is calling for ukraine to pay full-market price for gas , something it has n't done up to now an eu expert group on gas supplies is set to meet with member states ' representatives in brussels on january 9 .
gazprom is set to send an official to the meeting , while ukraine is expected to send a delegation to brussels in the coming days , officials said . however , analysts say that both sides ' reputations have already been tarnished in the row , with the eu increasingly keen to find gas supplies which come from countries other than russia and pass through countries other than ukraine . eu reliance on russian gas varies from zero in britain and ireland to 100 per cent in the baltic states and slovakia , according to the paris-based international energy agency .
germany , the eu 's largest economy , obtains some 40 percent of all the gas it uses from russia . dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

elsewhere , however , there was further grim news for the german manufacturing sector . the record numbers of employment last year was the highest number since german unification in 1990 , figures showed .
the number of employed people increased 1.5 per cent from 2007 to 582,000 , partly due to the economic boom that lasted well into the first half of the year , according to the statistics office .
the economic downturn in the second half of 2008 did not have a major effect on employment , it said .
germany 's jobless rate hit a 16-year-low in november when 7.5 per cent of the workforce , or 3.15 million people , were without jobs .
the federal labor agency is due to release unemployment figures for december next week .
grim news on manufacturing front despite the good employment figures , there was further gloomy news for germany 's economy which has been hit particularly hard by the global slowdown .
according to the euro zone 's purchasing managers ' index , compiled by data and research group markit , manufacturing activity in the countries sharing the euro fell to a record low in december .
the purchasing managers ' index is a measure of an economy 's manufacturing activity .
a score over 50 points indicates growth , while a score below 50 reflects contracting industrial output .
december saw the euro zone 's score fall below 34 point points - the lowest level in the survey 's 11-year history . on a national level , germany was one of the hardest hit .
its score shrank to 32.7 in december - down three points from november .
chris williamson , the chief economist at markit , said germany 's disappointing score represents a 12 percent drop in industrial output .
speaking to dw-radio , williamson said germany 's huge reliance on exports to drive its economy was proving to be a major disadvantage in the current global downturn .
" germany , amongst the biggest euro zone economies , has seen the steepest contraction of its export order books , " williamson said . "
this is indicative of sharply declining production in its export markets such as china , the us and the uk , where companies are cutting back on their investment in their own factories , so they 're ordering less plant and machinery , machine tools and so forth which is of course one of the key drivers of germany 's expansion . ”
williamson added it would only a matter of time before german manufacturers start slashing jobs . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german foreign minister sees that as the only way to clear the path for a cease-fire after a week of air strikes by israel on gaza aimed at hamas , the statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , and merkel have both called on hamas to end rocket fire according to the ministry , steinmeier also reiterated his support for a " humanitarian cease-fire " that would make it easier to get supplies to gaza 's civilians and pave the way for diplomacy . steinmeier has telephoned with arab leaders as well as with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni in recent days to seek ways to end the violence . the german foreign minister has however stressed that the pre-condition for any truce had to be the cessation of missile attacks against israel by the radical hamas in the gaza strip .
german chancellor angela merkel has also come out in strong support of israel during the recent conflict , accusing hamas of terrorism in her new year 's address .
un warns of humanitarian crisis in gaza israel killed a top hamas militant in the gaza strip early saturday as its aircraft continued to pummel the territory on the eighth day of attacks against the islamist movement . gaza militants , for their part , continued to launch rockets and mortar shells at israel , with around five attacks reported on saturday .
earlier the hamas leader-in-exile , khaled meshaal , warned israel of a " black destiny " if it began a threatened ground offensive on gaza .
palestinian officials say at least 436 people have been killed and more than 2,200 injured since israel launched its bombing campaign in response to hamas rocket fire eight days ago .
the un said it believed 25 percent of more than 400 palestinians killed by israeli action so far were civilians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injured palestinian is helped from the rubble four israelis have been killed by palestinian rockets fired into israel since the campaign began last saturday .
israel has now carried out more than 700 strikes on gaza since launching the offensive last saturday , afp news agency said .
the united nations warned of a worsening humanitarian crisis in gaza .
earlier , chief un aid co-coordinator for the territory , maxwell gaylard , said gaza residents were cut off from food , medicine and other supplies .
bush blames hamas for violence protests and growing international outrage about the killing of civilians raised the pressure on world leaders to end the bloodshed .
us president george w bush on friday called for a " meaningful ceasefire " to the ongoing conflict in the middle east .
in his weekly radio address , bush blamed the situation on hamas ' violation of a ceasefire , calling it " an act of terror that is opposed by the legitimate leader of the palestinian people , president -lrb- mahmoud -rrb- abbas . "

" he -lrb- althaus -rrb- could say his name and his date of birth , " fried dahmen said .
the 50-year-old althuas , from chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- collided with a female skier on the slopes thursday afternoon , according to local police .
the woman , reportedly from slovakia and a mother of four , died on the way to the hospital .
althaus was evacuated for medical treatment by helicopter to a hospital in the austrian town of schwarzach im pongau where he was immediately treated for a serious head injury .
doctors treating the politician said on saturday that althaus ' condition was stable but warned it would take a while for him to recover fully .
earlier , the thueringe allgemeine zeitung newspaper reported that the fact that althaus was wearing a helmet at the time of the accident probably saved his life .
" the premier had a skiing helmet on , the woman did n't , " the paper quoted an austrian police spokesman as saying .
last week , another german skier without a helmet was killed on the austrian slopes .
the head of the cdu ’ s state parliamentary group in thuringia , mike mohring , expressed shock and grief over the incident .
“ i offer my deepest condolences to the relatives of the woman who died in the name of the althaus family and cdu , ” he said .
“ we hope and pray that the condition of the premier stabilizes and he will recover from his injuries . ”
althaus has been premier in thuringia since 2003 .
he was planning to run for reelection this august . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german foreign minister sees that as the only way to clear the path for a cease-fire after a week of air strikes by israel on gaza aimed at hamas , the statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , and merkel have both called on hamas to end rocket fire according to the ministry , steinmeier also reiterated his support for a " humanitarian cease-fire " that would make it easier to get supplies to gaza 's civilians and pave the way for diplomacy . steinmeier has telephoned with arab leaders as well as with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni in recent days to seek ways to end the violence . the german foreign minister has however stressed that the pre-condition for any truce had to be the cessation of missile attacks against israel by the radical hamas in the gaza strip .
german chancellor angela merkel has also come out in strong support of israel during the recent conflict , accusing hamas of terrorism in her new year 's address .
un warns of humanitarian crisis in gaza israel killed a top hamas militant in the gaza strip early saturday as its aircraft continued to pummel the territory on the eighth day of attacks against the islamist movement . gaza militants , for their part , continued to launch rockets and mortar shells at israel , with around five attacks reported on saturday .
earlier the hamas leader-in-exile , khaled meshaal , warned israel of a " black destiny " if it began a threatened ground offensive on gaza .
palestinian officials say at least 436 people have been killed and more than 2,200 injured since israel launched its bombing campaign in response to hamas rocket fire eight days ago .
the un said it believed 25 percent of more than 400 palestinians killed by israeli action so far were civilians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injured palestinian is helped from the rubble four israelis have been killed by palestinian rockets fired into israel since the campaign began last saturday .
israel has now carried out more than 700 strikes on gaza since launching the offensive last saturday , afp news agency said .
the united nations warned of a worsening humanitarian crisis in gaza .
earlier , chief un aid co-coordinator for the territory , maxwell gaylard , said gaza residents were cut off from food , medicine and other supplies .
bush blames hamas for violence protests and growing international outrage about the killing of civilians raised the pressure on world leaders to end the bloodshed .
us president george w bush on friday called for a " meaningful ceasefire " to the ongoing conflict in the middle east .
in his weekly radio address , bush blamed the situation on hamas ' violation of a ceasefire , calling it " an act of terror that is opposed by the legitimate leader of the palestinian people , president -lrb- mahmoud -rrb- abbas . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has blamed the violence on hamas he stressed that any newly brokered ceasefire must be upheld by both parties .

elsewhere , however , there was further grim news for the german manufacturing sector . the record numbers of employment last year was the highest number since german unification in 1990 , figures showed .
the number of employed people increased 1.5 per cent from 2007 to 582,000 , partly due to the economic boom that lasted well into the first half of the year , according to the statistics office .
the economic downturn in the second half of 2008 did not have a major effect on employment , it said .
germany 's jobless rate hit a 16-year-low in november when 7.5 per cent of the workforce , or 3.15 million people , were without jobs .
the federal labor agency is due to release unemployment figures for december next week .
grim news on manufacturing front despite the good employment figures , there was further gloomy news for germany 's economy which has been hit particularly hard by the global slowdown .
according to the euro zone 's purchasing managers ' index , compiled by data and research group markit , manufacturing activity in the countries sharing the euro fell to a record low in december .
the purchasing managers ' index is a measure of an economy 's manufacturing activity .
a score over 50 points indicates growth , while a score below 50 reflects contracting industrial output .
december saw the euro zone 's score fall below 34 point points - the lowest level in the survey 's 11-year history . on a national level , germany was one of the hardest hit .
its score shrank to 32.7 in december - down three points from november .
chris williamson , the chief economist at markit , said germany 's disappointing score represents a 12 percent drop in industrial output .
speaking to dw-radio , williamson said germany 's huge reliance on exports to drive its economy was proving to be a major disadvantage in the current global downturn .
" germany , amongst the biggest euro zone economies , has seen the steepest contraction of its export order books , " williamson said . "
this is indicative of sharply declining production in its export markets such as china , the us and the uk , where companies are cutting back on their investment in their own factories , so they 're ordering less plant and machinery , machine tools and so forth which is of course one of the key drivers of germany 's expansion . ”
williamson added it would only a matter of time before german manufacturers start slashing jobs . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german foreign minister sees that as the only way to clear the path for a cease-fire after a week of air strikes by israel on gaza aimed at hamas , the statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , and merkel have both called on hamas to end rocket fire according to the ministry , steinmeier also reiterated his support for a " humanitarian cease-fire " that would make it easier to get supplies to gaza 's civilians and pave the way for diplomacy . steinmeier has telephoned with arab leaders as well as with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni in recent days to seek ways to end the violence . the german foreign minister has however stressed that the pre-condition for any truce had to be the cessation of missile attacks against israel by the radical hamas in the gaza strip .
german chancellor angela merkel has also come out in strong support of israel during the recent conflict , accusing hamas of terrorism in her new year 's address .
un warns of humanitarian crisis in gaza israel killed a top hamas militant in the gaza strip early saturday as its aircraft continued to pummel the territory on the eighth day of attacks against the islamist movement . gaza militants , for their part , continued to launch rockets and mortar shells at israel , with around five attacks reported on saturday .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has blamed the violence on hamas he stressed that any newly brokered ceasefire must be upheld by both parties .
" the united states is leading diplomatic efforts to achieve a meaningful ceasefire that is fully respected .
another one-way ceasefire that leads to rocket attacks on israel is not acceptable , " bush said .
" and promises from hamas will not suffice - there must be monitoring mechanisms in place to help ensure that smuggling of weapons to terrorist groups in gaza comes to an end . "
eu to send mission to mideast the escalating violence has prompted the european union to send a mission to the region to push both sides to declare a ceasefire .
czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , will lead the delegation which includes eu foreign policy chief javier solana , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and the french and swedish foreign ministers .

" the european union calls for an urgent solution to the commercial dispute on gas supplies from the russian federation to ukraine , and for an immediate resumption of full deliveries of gas to the eu member states , " the eu presidency said in a statement .
" energy relations between the eu and its neighbors should be based on reliability and predictability .

pipeline pressure is down in the main pipes leading from ukraine into eu members hungary , poland and slovakia , the czech republic 's energy envoy , vaclav bartuska , told german new agency dpa .
" it is so far only a decrease in pressure .
the volumes -lrb- being delivered -rrb- remain the same ...
the ukrainian side told us that volumes will be down tomorrow -lrb- saturday -rrb- , " bartuska said .
russia is the eu 's largest single supplier of natural gas , and 80 percent of its deliveries pass through ukrainian territory .
extraordinary meeting called bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany gets about 40 percent of its gas from russia the eu 's czech presidency has called an special meeting of envoys from the 27 member states for monday to discuss the gas dispute between russian and ukraine , a spokesman said . " we are convening an extraordinary meeting ... at deputy ambassadors ' level on monday where the russia-ukraine gas dispute will be the sole topic for discussion , " a spokesman for the czech presidency told the afp news agency on friday . the goal of the meeting will be " to exchange information " and " to coordinate the eu 's response to the matter , " he told afp , repeating that so far there were no signs that european gas supplies had been hit . repeat performance three years ago , gazprom shut off gas supplies to ukraine in a near-identical row over gas prices and allegedly unpaid bills , causing sudden shortages across much of europe . unlike on that occasion , eu member states had widely anticipated the current shut-off , which comes in the context of increasingly tense relations both between moscow and kiev 's pro-western government and between ukraine 's president and prime minister . eu governments were careful to make sure that their gas stocks were full ahead of winter , meaning that the current shut-off is unlikely to have a short-term impact on supplies , eu sources said . battling versions of events in recent days , russia and ukraine have both conducted intense diplomatic campaigns to present the other side as the troublemaker in the dispute .
the prime ministers of both countries called european commission head jose manuel barroso on new year 's eve to present their respective versions of the row . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom is calling for ukraine to pay full-market price for gas , something it has n't done up to now an eu expert group on gas supplies is set to meet with member states ' representatives in brussels on january 9 .
gazprom is set to send an official to the meeting , while ukraine is expected to send a delegation to brussels in the coming days , officials said . however , analysts say that both sides ' reputations have already been tarnished in the row , with the eu increasingly keen to find gas supplies which come from countries other than russia and pass through countries other than ukraine . eu reliance on russian gas varies from zero in britain and ireland to 100 per cent in the baltic states and slovakia , according to the paris-based international energy agency .
germany , the eu 's largest economy , obtains some 40 percent of all the gas it uses from russia . dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" he -lrb- althaus -rrb- could say his name and his date of birth , " fried dahmen said .
the 50-year-old althuas , from chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- collided with a female skier on the slopes thursday afternoon , according to local police .
the woman , reportedly from slovakia and a mother of four , died on the way to the hospital .
althaus was evacuated for medical treatment by helicopter to a hospital in the austrian town of schwarzach im pongau where he was immediately treated for a serious head injury .
doctors treating the politician said on saturday that althaus ' condition was stable but warned it would take a while for him to recover fully .
earlier , the thueringe allgemeine zeitung newspaper reported that the fact that althaus was wearing a helmet at the time of the accident probably saved his life .
" the premier had a skiing helmet on , the woman did n't , " the paper quoted an austrian police spokesman as saying .
last week , another german skier without a helmet was killed on the austrian slopes .

the german foreign minister sees that as the only way to clear the path for a cease-fire after a week of air strikes by israel on gaza aimed at hamas , the statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , and merkel have both called on hamas to end rocket fire according to the ministry , steinmeier also reiterated his support for a " humanitarian cease-fire " that would make it easier to get supplies to gaza 's civilians and pave the way for diplomacy . steinmeier has telephoned with arab leaders as well as with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni in recent days to seek ways to end the violence . the german foreign minister has however stressed that the pre-condition for any truce had to be the cessation of missile attacks against israel by the radical hamas in the gaza strip .
german chancellor angela merkel has also come out in strong support of israel during the recent conflict , accusing hamas of terrorism in her new year 's address .
un warns of humanitarian crisis in gaza israel killed a top hamas militant in the gaza strip early saturday as its aircraft continued to pummel the territory on the eighth day of attacks against the islamist movement . gaza militants , for their part , continued to launch rockets and mortar shells at israel , with around five attacks reported on saturday .
earlier the hamas leader-in-exile , khaled meshaal , warned israel of a " black destiny " if it began a threatened ground offensive on gaza .
palestinian officials say at least 436 people have been killed and more than 2,200 injured since israel launched its bombing campaign in response to hamas rocket fire eight days ago .
the un said it believed 25 percent of more than 400 palestinians killed by israeli action so far were civilians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injured palestinian is helped from the rubble four israelis have been killed by palestinian rockets fired into israel since the campaign began last saturday .
israel has now carried out more than 700 strikes on gaza since launching the offensive last saturday , afp news agency said .
the united nations warned of a worsening humanitarian crisis in gaza .
earlier , chief un aid co-coordinator for the territory , maxwell gaylard , said gaza residents were cut off from food , medicine and other supplies .
bush blames hamas for violence protests and growing international outrage about the killing of civilians raised the pressure on world leaders to end the bloodshed .
us president george w bush on friday called for a " meaningful ceasefire " to the ongoing conflict in the middle east .
in his weekly radio address , bush blamed the situation on hamas ' violation of a ceasefire , calling it " an act of terror that is opposed by the legitimate leader of the palestinian people , president -lrb- mahmoud -rrb- abbas . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has blamed the violence on hamas he stressed that any newly brokered ceasefire must be upheld by both parties .
" the united states is leading diplomatic efforts to achieve a meaningful ceasefire that is fully respected .
another one-way ceasefire that leads to rocket attacks on israel is not acceptable , " bush said .
" and promises from hamas will not suffice - there must be monitoring mechanisms in place to help ensure that smuggling of weapons to terrorist groups in gaza comes to an end . "
eu to send mission to mideast the escalating violence has prompted the european union to send a mission to the region to push both sides to declare a ceasefire .
czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , will lead the delegation which includes eu foreign policy chief javier solana , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and the french and swedish foreign ministers .
the delegation will arrive in cairo on sunday , jan .

the group will then move to jerusalem for further discussions before meeting with palestinian leaders in ramallah in the west bank .

the german foreign minister sees that as the only way to clear the path for a cease-fire after a week of air strikes by israel on gaza aimed at hamas , the statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , and merkel have both called on hamas to end rocket fire according to the ministry , steinmeier also reiterated his support for a " humanitarian cease-fire " that would make it easier to get supplies to gaza 's civilians and pave the way for diplomacy . steinmeier has telephoned with arab leaders as well as with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni in recent days to seek ways to end the violence . the german foreign minister has however stressed that the pre-condition for any truce had to be the cessation of missile attacks against israel by the radical hamas in the gaza strip .
german chancellor angela merkel has also come out in strong support of israel during the recent conflict , accusing hamas of terrorism in her new year 's address .
un warns of humanitarian crisis in gaza israel killed a top hamas militant in the gaza strip early saturday as its aircraft continued to pummel the territory on the eighth day of attacks against the islamist movement . gaza militants , for their part , continued to launch rockets and mortar shells at israel , with around five attacks reported on saturday .
earlier the hamas leader-in-exile , khaled meshaal , warned israel of a " black destiny " if it began a threatened ground offensive on gaza .
palestinian officials say at least 436 people have been killed and more than 2,200 injured since israel launched its bombing campaign in response to hamas rocket fire eight days ago .
the un said it believed 25 percent of more than 400 palestinians killed by israeli action so far were civilians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injured palestinian is helped from the rubble four israelis have been killed by palestinian rockets fired into israel since the campaign began last saturday .
israel has now carried out more than 700 strikes on gaza since launching the offensive last saturday , afp news agency said .
the united nations warned of a worsening humanitarian crisis in gaza .
earlier , chief un aid co-coordinator for the territory , maxwell gaylard , said gaza residents were cut off from food , medicine and other supplies .
bush blames hamas for violence protests and growing international outrage about the killing of civilians raised the pressure on world leaders to end the bloodshed .
us president george w bush on friday called for a " meaningful ceasefire " to the ongoing conflict in the middle east .
in his weekly radio address , bush blamed the situation on hamas ' violation of a ceasefire , calling it " an act of terror that is opposed by the legitimate leader of the palestinian people , president -lrb- mahmoud -rrb- abbas . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has blamed the violence on hamas he stressed that any newly brokered ceasefire must be upheld by both parties .
" the united states is leading diplomatic efforts to achieve a meaningful ceasefire that is fully respected .
another one-way ceasefire that leads to rocket attacks on israel is not acceptable , " bush said .
" and promises from hamas will not suffice - there must be monitoring mechanisms in place to help ensure that smuggling of weapons to terrorist groups in gaza comes to an end . "
eu to send mission to mideast the escalating violence has prompted the european union to send a mission to the region to push both sides to declare a ceasefire .
czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , will lead the delegation which includes eu foreign policy chief javier solana , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and the french and swedish foreign ministers .
the delegation will arrive in cairo on sunday , jan .

the group will then move to jerusalem for further discussions before meeting with palestinian leaders in ramallah in the west bank .

elsewhere , however , there was further grim news for the german manufacturing sector . the record numbers of employment last year was the highest number since german unification in 1990 , figures showed .
the number of employed people increased 1.5 per cent from 2007 to 582,000 , partly due to the economic boom that lasted well into the first half of the year , according to the statistics office .
the economic downturn in the second half of 2008 did not have a major effect on employment , it said .
germany 's jobless rate hit a 16-year-low in november when 7.5 per cent of the workforce , or 3.15 million people , were without jobs .
the federal labor agency is due to release unemployment figures for december next week .
grim news on manufacturing front despite the good employment figures , there was further gloomy news for germany 's economy which has been hit particularly hard by the global slowdown .
according to the euro zone 's purchasing managers ' index , compiled by data and research group markit , manufacturing activity in the countries sharing the euro fell to a record low in december .
the purchasing managers ' index is a measure of an economy 's manufacturing activity .
a score over 50 points indicates growth , while a score below 50 reflects contracting industrial output .
december saw the euro zone 's score fall below 34 point points - the lowest level in the survey 's 11-year history . on a national level , germany was one of the hardest hit .
its score shrank to 32.7 in december - down three points from november .
chris williamson , the chief economist at markit , said germany 's disappointing score represents a 12 percent drop in industrial output .
speaking to dw-radio , williamson said germany 's huge reliance on exports to drive its economy was proving to be a major disadvantage in the current global downturn .
" germany , amongst the biggest euro zone economies , has seen the steepest contraction of its export order books , " williamson said . "
this is indicative of sharply declining production in its export markets such as china , the us and the uk , where companies are cutting back on their investment in their own factories , so they 're ordering less plant and machinery , machine tools and so forth which is of course one of the key drivers of germany 's expansion . ”

elsewhere , however , there was further grim news for the german manufacturing sector . the record numbers of employment last year was the highest number since german unification in 1990 , figures showed .
the number of employed people increased 1.5 per cent from 2007 to 582,000 , partly due to the economic boom that lasted well into the first half of the year , according to the statistics office .
the economic downturn in the second half of 2008 did not have a major effect on employment , it said .
germany 's jobless rate hit a 16-year-low in november when 7.5 per cent of the workforce , or 3.15 million people , were without jobs .
the federal labor agency is due to release unemployment figures for december next week .
grim news on manufacturing front despite the good employment figures , there was further gloomy news for germany 's economy which has been hit particularly hard by the global slowdown .
according to the euro zone 's purchasing managers ' index , compiled by data and research group markit , manufacturing activity in the countries sharing the euro fell to a record low in december .
the purchasing managers ' index is a measure of an economy 's manufacturing activity .
a score over 50 points indicates growth , while a score below 50 reflects contracting industrial output .
december saw the euro zone 's score fall below 34 point points - the lowest level in the survey 's 11-year history . on a national level , germany was one of the hardest hit .
its score shrank to 32.7 in december - down three points from november .
chris williamson , the chief economist at markit , said germany 's disappointing score represents a 12 percent drop in industrial output .
speaking to dw-radio , williamson said germany 's huge reliance on exports to drive its economy was proving to be a major disadvantage in the current global downturn .
" germany , amongst the biggest euro zone economies , has seen the steepest contraction of its export order books , " williamson said . "
this is indicative of sharply declining production in its export markets such as china , the us and the uk , where companies are cutting back on their investment in their own factories , so they 're ordering less plant and machinery , machine tools and so forth which is of course one of the key drivers of germany 's expansion . ”
williamson added it would only a matter of time before german manufacturers start slashing jobs . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german foreign minister sees that as the only way to clear the path for a cease-fire after a week of air strikes by israel on gaza aimed at hamas , the statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , and merkel have both called on hamas to end rocket fire according to the ministry , steinmeier also reiterated his support for a " humanitarian cease-fire " that would make it easier to get supplies to gaza 's civilians and pave the way for diplomacy . steinmeier has telephoned with arab leaders as well as with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni in recent days to seek ways to end the violence . the german foreign minister has however stressed that the pre-condition for any truce had to be the cessation of missile attacks against israel by the radical hamas in the gaza strip .
german chancellor angela merkel has also come out in strong support of israel during the recent conflict , accusing hamas of terrorism in her new year 's address .
un warns of humanitarian crisis in gaza israel killed a top hamas militant in the gaza strip early saturday as its aircraft continued to pummel the territory on the eighth day of attacks against the islamist movement . gaza militants , for their part , continued to launch rockets and mortar shells at israel , with around five attacks reported on saturday .
earlier the hamas leader-in-exile , khaled meshaal , warned israel of a " black destiny " if it began a threatened ground offensive on gaza .

the united nations warned of a worsening humanitarian crisis in gaza .

us president george w bush on friday called for a " meaningful ceasefire " to the ongoing conflict in the middle east .
in his weekly radio address , bush blamed the situation on hamas ' violation of a ceasefire , calling it " an act of terror that is opposed by the legitimate leader of the palestinian people , president -lrb- mahmoud -rrb- abbas . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has blamed the violence on hamas he stressed that any newly brokered ceasefire must be upheld by both parties .
" the united states is leading diplomatic efforts to achieve a meaningful ceasefire that is fully respected .
another one-way ceasefire that leads to rocket attacks on israel is not acceptable , " bush said .
" and promises from hamas will not suffice - there must be monitoring mechanisms in place to help ensure that smuggling of weapons to terrorist groups in gaza comes to an end . "
eu to send mission to mideast the escalating violence has prompted the european union to send a mission to the region to push both sides to declare a ceasefire .
czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , will lead the delegation which includes eu foreign policy chief javier solana , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and the french and swedish foreign ministers .

the german foreign minister sees that as the only way to clear the path for a cease-fire after a week of air strikes by israel on gaza aimed at hamas , the statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , and merkel have both called on hamas to end rocket fire according to the ministry , steinmeier also reiterated his support for a " humanitarian cease-fire " that would make it easier to get supplies to gaza 's civilians and pave the way for diplomacy . steinmeier has telephoned with arab leaders as well as with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni in recent days to seek ways to end the violence . the german foreign minister has however stressed that the pre-condition for any truce had to be the cessation of missile attacks against israel by the radical hamas in the gaza strip .
german chancellor angela merkel has also come out in strong support of israel during the recent conflict , accusing hamas of terrorism in her new year 's address .
un warns of humanitarian crisis in gaza israel killed a top hamas militant in the gaza strip early saturday as its aircraft continued to pummel the territory on the eighth day of attacks against the islamist movement . gaza militants , for their part , continued to launch rockets and mortar shells at israel , with around five attacks reported on saturday .
earlier the hamas leader-in-exile , khaled meshaal , warned israel of a " black destiny " if it began a threatened ground offensive on gaza .
palestinian officials say at least 436 people have been killed and more than 2,200 injured since israel launched its bombing campaign in response to hamas rocket fire eight days ago .
the un said it believed 25 percent of more than 400 palestinians killed by israeli action so far were civilians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injured palestinian is helped from the rubble four israelis have been killed by palestinian rockets fired into israel since the campaign began last saturday .
israel has now carried out more than 700 strikes on gaza since launching the offensive last saturday , afp news agency said .
the united nations warned of a worsening humanitarian crisis in gaza .
earlier , chief un aid co-coordinator for the territory , maxwell gaylard , said gaza residents were cut off from food , medicine and other supplies .
bush blames hamas for violence protests and growing international outrage about the killing of civilians raised the pressure on world leaders to end the bloodshed .
us president george w bush on friday called for a " meaningful ceasefire " to the ongoing conflict in the middle east .
in his weekly radio address , bush blamed the situation on hamas ' violation of a ceasefire , calling it " an act of terror that is opposed by the legitimate leader of the palestinian people , president -lrb- mahmoud -rrb- abbas . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has blamed the violence on hamas he stressed that any newly brokered ceasefire must be upheld by both parties .
" the united states is leading diplomatic efforts to achieve a meaningful ceasefire that is fully respected .
another one-way ceasefire that leads to rocket attacks on israel is not acceptable , " bush said .
" and promises from hamas will not suffice - there must be monitoring mechanisms in place to help ensure that smuggling of weapons to terrorist groups in gaza comes to an end . "
eu to send mission to mideast the escalating violence has prompted the european union to send a mission to the region to push both sides to declare a ceasefire .
czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , will lead the delegation which includes eu foreign policy chief javier solana , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and the french and swedish foreign ministers .

elsewhere , however , there was further grim news for the german manufacturing sector . the record numbers of employment last year was the highest number since german unification in 1990 , figures showed .
the number of employed people increased 1.5 per cent from 2007 to 582,000 , partly due to the economic boom that lasted well into the first half of the year , according to the statistics office .
the economic downturn in the second half of 2008 did not have a major effect on employment , it said .
germany 's jobless rate hit a 16-year-low in november when 7.5 per cent of the workforce , or 3.15 million people , were without jobs .
the federal labor agency is due to release unemployment figures for december next week .
grim news on manufacturing front despite the good employment figures , there was further gloomy news for germany 's economy which has been hit particularly hard by the global slowdown .
according to the euro zone 's purchasing managers ' index , compiled by data and research group markit , manufacturing activity in the countries sharing the euro fell to a record low in december .
the purchasing managers ' index is a measure of an economy 's manufacturing activity .
a score over 50 points indicates growth , while a score below 50 reflects contracting industrial output .
december saw the euro zone 's score fall below 34 point points - the lowest level in the survey 's 11-year history . on a national level , germany was one of the hardest hit .
its score shrank to 32.7 in december - down three points from november .
chris williamson , the chief economist at markit , said germany 's disappointing score represents a 12 percent drop in industrial output .
speaking to dw-radio , williamson said germany 's huge reliance on exports to drive its economy was proving to be a major disadvantage in the current global downturn .
" germany , amongst the biggest euro zone economies , has seen the steepest contraction of its export order books , " williamson said . "
this is indicative of sharply declining production in its export markets such as china , the us and the uk , where companies are cutting back on their investment in their own factories , so they 're ordering less plant and machinery , machine tools and so forth which is of course one of the key drivers of germany 's expansion . ”
williamson added it would only a matter of time before german manufacturers start slashing jobs . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

earlier , the thueringe allgemeine zeitung newspaper reported that the fact that althaus was wearing a helmet at the time of the accident probably saved his life .

elsewhere , however , there was further grim news for the german manufacturing sector . the record numbers of employment last year was the highest number since german unification in 1990 , figures showed .
the number of employed people increased 1.5 per cent from 2007 to 582,000 , partly due to the economic boom that lasted well into the first half of the year , according to the statistics office .

december saw the euro zone 's score fall below 34 point points - the lowest level in the survey 's 11-year history . on a national level , germany was one of the hardest hit .
its score shrank to 32.7 in december - down three points from november .
chris williamson , the chief economist at markit , said germany 's disappointing score represents a 12 percent drop in industrial output .
speaking to dw-radio , williamson said germany 's huge reliance on exports to drive its economy was proving to be a major disadvantage in the current global downturn .
" germany , amongst the biggest euro zone economies , has seen the steepest contraction of its export order books , " williamson said . "
this is indicative of sharply declining production in its export markets such as china , the us and the uk , where companies are cutting back on their investment in their own factories , so they 're ordering less plant and machinery , machine tools and so forth which is of course one of the key drivers of germany 's expansion . ”

elsewhere , however , there was further grim news for the german manufacturing sector . the record numbers of employment last year was the highest number since german unification in 1990 , figures showed .
the number of employed people increased 1.5 per cent from 2007 to 582,000 , partly due to the economic boom that lasted well into the first half of the year , according to the statistics office .
the economic downturn in the second half of 2008 did not have a major effect on employment , it said .
germany 's jobless rate hit a 16-year-low in november when 7.5 per cent of the workforce , or 3.15 million people , were without jobs .
the federal labor agency is due to release unemployment figures for december next week .
grim news on manufacturing front despite the good employment figures , there was further gloomy news for germany 's economy which has been hit particularly hard by the global slowdown .
according to the euro zone 's purchasing managers ' index , compiled by data and research group markit , manufacturing activity in the countries sharing the euro fell to a record low in december .
the purchasing managers ' index is a measure of an economy 's manufacturing activity .

december saw the euro zone 's score fall below 34 point points - the lowest level in the survey 's 11-year history . on a national level , germany was one of the hardest hit .
its score shrank to 32.7 in december - down three points from november .
chris williamson , the chief economist at markit , said germany 's disappointing score represents a 12 percent drop in industrial output .
speaking to dw-radio , williamson said germany 's huge reliance on exports to drive its economy was proving to be a major disadvantage in the current global downturn .
" germany , amongst the biggest euro zone economies , has seen the steepest contraction of its export order books , " williamson said . "
this is indicative of sharply declining production in its export markets such as china , the us and the uk , where companies are cutting back on their investment in their own factories , so they 're ordering less plant and machinery , machine tools and so forth which is of course one of the key drivers of germany 's expansion . ”

" the european union calls for an urgent solution to the commercial dispute on gas supplies from the russian federation to ukraine , and for an immediate resumption of full deliveries of gas to the eu member states , " the eu presidency said in a statement .
" energy relations between the eu and its neighbors should be based on reliability and predictability .
existing commitments to supply and transit have to be honored under all circumstances , " it added .
pipeline pressure is down in the main pipes leading from ukraine into eu members hungary , poland and slovakia , the czech republic 's energy envoy , vaclav bartuska , told german new agency dpa .
" it is so far only a decrease in pressure .
the volumes -lrb- being delivered -rrb- remain the same ...
the ukrainian side told us that volumes will be down tomorrow -lrb- saturday -rrb- , " bartuska said .
russia is the eu 's largest single supplier of natural gas , and 80 percent of its deliveries pass through ukrainian territory .
extraordinary meeting called bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany gets about 40 percent of its gas from russia the eu 's czech presidency has called an special meeting of envoys from the 27 member states for monday to discuss the gas dispute between russian and ukraine , a spokesman said . " we are convening an extraordinary meeting ... at deputy ambassadors ' level on monday where the russia-ukraine gas dispute will be the sole topic for discussion , " a spokesman for the czech presidency told the afp news agency on friday . the goal of the meeting will be " to exchange information " and " to coordinate the eu 's response to the matter , " he told afp , repeating that so far there were no signs that european gas supplies had been hit . repeat performance three years ago , gazprom shut off gas supplies to ukraine in a near-identical row over gas prices and allegedly unpaid bills , causing sudden shortages across much of europe . unlike on that occasion , eu member states had widely anticipated the current shut-off , which comes in the context of increasingly tense relations both between moscow and kiev 's pro-western government and between ukraine 's president and prime minister . eu governments were careful to make sure that their gas stocks were full ahead of winter , meaning that the current shut-off is unlikely to have a short-term impact on supplies , eu sources said . battling versions of events in recent days , russia and ukraine have both conducted intense diplomatic campaigns to present the other side as the troublemaker in the dispute .
the prime ministers of both countries called european commission head jose manuel barroso on new year 's eve to present their respective versions of the row . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom is calling for ukraine to pay full-market price for gas , something it has n't done up to now an eu expert group on gas supplies is set to meet with member states ' representatives in brussels on january 9 .
gazprom is set to send an official to the meeting , while ukraine is expected to send a delegation to brussels in the coming days , officials said . however , analysts say that both sides ' reputations have already been tarnished in the row , with the eu increasingly keen to find gas supplies which come from countries other than russia and pass through countries other than ukraine . eu reliance on russian gas varies from zero in britain and ireland to 100 per cent in the baltic states and slovakia , according to the paris-based international energy agency .
germany , the eu 's largest economy , obtains some 40 percent of all the gas it uses from russia . dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 03.01.2009 eu suffers gas shortfall amid russia-ukraine row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gas row between ukraine and russia is heating up once again the european union has demanded that russia and ukraine solve their row over gas deliveries and stop jeopardizing supplies to the bloc after three member states reported falling gas pressure in their pipelines . the european union 's brand new czech presidency was forced to urge moscow friday evening to resume full gas deliveries after the bloc 's fears of drop in vital gas supplies became a reality .
" the european union calls for an urgent solution to the commercial dispute on gas supplies from the russian federation to ukraine , and for an immediate resumption of full deliveries of gas to the eu member states , " the eu presidency said in a statement .
" energy relations between the eu and its neighbors should be based on reliability and predictability .
existing commitments to supply and transit have to be honored under all circumstances , " it added .
pipeline pressure is down in the main pipes leading from ukraine into eu members hungary , poland and slovakia , the czech republic 's energy envoy , vaclav bartuska , told german new agency dpa .
" it is so far only a decrease in pressure .
the volumes -lrb- being delivered -rrb- remain the same ...
the ukrainian side told us that volumes will be down tomorrow -lrb- saturday -rrb- , " bartuska said .
russia is the eu 's largest single supplier of natural gas , and 80 percent of its deliveries pass through ukrainian territory .
extraordinary meeting called bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany gets about 40 percent of its gas from russia the eu 's czech presidency has called an special meeting of envoys from the 27 member states for monday to discuss the gas dispute between russian and ukraine , a spokesman said . " we are convening an extraordinary meeting ... at deputy ambassadors ' level on monday where the russia-ukraine gas dispute will be the sole topic for discussion , " a spokesman for the czech presidency told the afp news agency on friday . the goal of the meeting will be " to exchange information " and " to coordinate the eu 's response to the matter , " he told afp , repeating that so far there were no signs that european gas supplies had been hit . repeat performance three years ago , gazprom shut off gas supplies to ukraine in a near-identical row over gas prices and allegedly unpaid bills , causing sudden shortages across much of europe . unlike on that occasion , eu member states had widely anticipated the current shut-off , which comes in the context of increasingly tense relations both between moscow and kiev 's pro-western government and between ukraine 's president and prime minister . eu governments were careful to make sure that their gas stocks were full ahead of winter , meaning that the current shut-off is unlikely to have a short-term impact on supplies , eu sources said . battling versions of events in recent days , russia and ukraine have both conducted intense diplomatic campaigns to present the other side as the troublemaker in the dispute .
the prime ministers of both countries called european commission head jose manuel barroso on new year 's eve to present their respective versions of the row . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom is calling for ukraine to pay full-market price for gas , something it has n't done up to now an eu expert group on gas supplies is set to meet with member states ' representatives in brussels on january 9 .
gazprom is set to send an official to the meeting , while ukraine is expected to send a delegation to brussels in the coming days , officials said . however , analysts say that both sides ' reputations have already been tarnished in the row , with the eu increasingly keen to find gas supplies which come from countries other than russia and pass through countries other than ukraine . eu reliance on russian gas varies from zero in britain and ireland to 100 per cent in the baltic states and slovakia , according to the paris-based international energy agency .
germany , the eu 's largest economy , obtains some 40 percent of all the gas it uses from russia . dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" he -lrb- althaus -rrb- could say his name and his date of birth , " fried dahmen said .
the 50-year-old althuas , from chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- collided with a female skier on the slopes thursday afternoon , according to local police .
the woman , reportedly from slovakia and a mother of four , died on the way to the hospital .
althaus was evacuated for medical treatment by helicopter to a hospital in the austrian town of schwarzach im pongau where he was immediately treated for a serious head injury .
doctors treating the politician said on saturday that althaus ' condition was stable but warned it would take a while for him to recover fully .
earlier , the thueringe allgemeine zeitung newspaper reported that the fact that althaus was wearing a helmet at the time of the accident probably saved his life .
" the premier had a skiing helmet on , the woman did n't , " the paper quoted an austrian police spokesman as saying .
last week , another german skier without a helmet was killed on the austrian slopes .
the head of the cdu ’ s state parliamentary group in thuringia , mike mohring , expressed shock and grief over the incident .
“ i offer my deepest condolences to the relatives of the woman who died in the name of the althaus family and cdu , ” he said .
“ we hope and pray that the condition of the premier stabilizes and he will recover from his injuries . ”

" they 're acts of optimism , they 're dreams rendered in steel and concrete , " says william baker , the chief structural engineer behind what will soon be unveiled as the tallest building in the world .
mr baker 's company , skidmore owings merrill , specialises in skyscrapers .
he himself has been making sure a superscraper stays up - burj dubai .
in the wind tunnel the forces kept going down and the buildings went taller and taller .
at a certain height the forces got smaller not bigger william baker skidmore owings merrill the structure is almost finished and is expected it will be unveiled in a few weeks ' time .
but no one is saying how tall it will be .
" we 're not allowed to say .
the client has n't announced what it is and i do n't think they will , " says mr baker .
" it 'll turn into urban folklore , you 'll have people measuring the shadows on googleearth and trying to figure it out . "
all good publicity , and that is after all a large part of what skyscrapers are about - showing off .
the current record holder is taipei 101 , at just over 500 metres high .
to qualify as tallest structure , a building must be kitted out and working as hotel , offices , flats - whatever is there .
the burj -lrb- which means tower in arabic -rrb- will not be fully functioning until later in the year , but the basic structure will be ready soon .
wind proof and what a structure .
it 's based round an idea known as a buttressed central core , with a service shaft made not out of steel but super-concrete , mr baker tells me .
if you look down at the plan from above , it 's like a propeller in shape , with three arms or wings shooting out from the central core .
burj dubai construction began 2004 ; became world 's tallest structure in 2007 floor count : 160 estimated current height : 700 metres this simple geometry means that when the wind gets up , one of the wings will always buttress the tower against it .
" the client 's goal was for the world 's tallest building , simple .
so we went into the wind tunnel with an idea which was only a little taller than taipei 101 .
" our first results were n't too good , so we changed the building 's shape and orientation to reduce the forces - wind is the dominant thing in a tall building and what we did is confuse the wind , " mr baker says .
you may remember during the olympics the attention paid to the swimming costumes which used material to mimic the effect of sharkskin .
a slightly rough material creates little pockets of turbulence on its surface which lubricate movement more than a smooth surface .
the same idea helps the burj slide through the winds when they blow .
" the mullions , the verticals that hold the glass up , stick out and make the surface rough , which is a good thing , like swimmers ' costumes .
" in the wind tunnel the forces kept going down and so the buildings went taller and taller .
in fact at a certain height the forces got smaller not bigger , " mr baker says .
high ambitions because some breakthroughs were made as the building was going up it was too late to incorporate them all in the burj .
" we could definitely go taller , " says mr baker , predicting the possibility of towers 1,000 metres high .
if anyone has the money to build them , of course .
but what effect has the financial crisis had ?
" every market goes through cycles , the next generation of tall buildings are in a hiatus right now , but there 's places with pent up demand .
i see china continuing with that , and india will come into it soon . "
in the meantime the burj dubai will yet again draw attention to the gulf states and their spending .
estimates are that the 160 or so floors will have cost several billion dollars to build - it will contain a hotel designed by giorgio armani and some office space , but will be mainly apartments , most of which are already sold .
so , for the last time , how high will it be ?
" if you put the empire state building on top of the sears tower then it 's reasonable to say you 'll be in the neighbourhood , " mr baker says .
that 's about 400 metres plus 400 ... a monument to a moment of great confidence - or some might say overconfidence !

" they 're acts of optimism , they 're dreams rendered in steel and concrete , " says william baker , the chief structural engineer behind what will soon be unveiled as the tallest building in the world .
mr baker 's company , skidmore owings merrill , specialises in skyscrapers .
he himself has been making sure a superscraper stays up - burj dubai .
in the wind tunnel the forces kept going down and the buildings went taller and taller .
at a certain height the forces got smaller not bigger william baker skidmore owings merrill the structure is almost finished and is expected it will be unveiled in a few weeks ' time .
but no one is saying how tall it will be .
" we 're not allowed to say .
the client has n't announced what it is and i do n't think they will , " says mr baker .
" it 'll turn into urban folklore , you 'll have people measuring the shadows on googleearth and trying to figure it out . "
all good publicity , and that is after all a large part of what skyscrapers are about - showing off .
the current record holder is taipei 101 , at just over 500 metres high .
to qualify as tallest structure , a building must be kitted out and working as hotel , offices , flats - whatever is there .
the burj -lrb- which means tower in arabic -rrb- will not be fully functioning until later in the year , but the basic structure will be ready soon .
wind proof and what a structure .
it 's based round an idea known as a buttressed central core , with a service shaft made not out of steel but super-concrete , mr baker tells me .
if you look down at the plan from above , it 's like a propeller in shape , with three arms or wings shooting out from the central core .
burj dubai construction began 2004 ; became world 's tallest structure in 2007 floor count : 160 estimated current height : 700 metres this simple geometry means that when the wind gets up , one of the wings will always buttress the tower against it .
" the client 's goal was for the world 's tallest building , simple .
so we went into the wind tunnel with an idea which was only a little taller than taipei 101 .
" our first results were n't too good , so we changed the building 's shape and orientation to reduce the forces - wind is the dominant thing in a tall building and what we did is confuse the wind , " mr baker says .
you may remember during the olympics the attention paid to the swimming costumes which used material to mimic the effect of sharkskin .
a slightly rough material creates little pockets of turbulence on its surface which lubricate movement more than a smooth surface .
the same idea helps the burj slide through the winds when they blow .

the party would have spent the £ 12.5bn cost of the measure on creating jobs through investments to make schools , hospitals and homes greener , he said .
tory leader david cameron has branded the vat cut an " expensive failure " which did not encourage shoppers .
the government insists it is offering help to families .
speaking on bbc radio 4 's today programme , mr clegg restated the lib dems plan to build a " fairer " tax system through income tax cuts for low and middle-income earners .
" we would not waste £ 12.5bn on the vat cut which the prime minister has delivered , which we do n't think makes much difference , " he said .
" we would use all of that money for a green investment programme , insulating every school and every hospital in this country , and installing smart meters in every home .
" that kind of radical action not only creates jobs but it 's good for the kind of green economy we need in the future . "
' radical action ' on friday , mr cameron cited figures from the latest retail insight report , which suggested retail footfall was down 3.1 % in december from a year earlier .
" this government , that lectured us about prudence , has spent £ 12.5bn of our money ... and wasted it , " he told the bbc .
but the government has defended the decision to reduce vat from 17.5 % to 15 % until the end of 2009 .
it says the cut was the fairest way to get money into the economy because low-income households spend a larger share of their income on vat than richer households .
prime minister gordon brown also argues that he acted to recapitalise the banks , bring forward public spending and increase child tax credit and payments to pensioners .
there has been some criticism of the vat change from two german politicians and the chief economist at the international monetary fund .
the lib dems tried to get it overturned in a commons debate in december , when treasury spokesman vince cable said it was " seriously defective " as a way of getting money into the economy .

the party would have spent the £ 12.5bn cost of the measure on creating jobs through investments to make schools , hospitals and homes greener , he said .
tory leader david cameron has branded the vat cut an " expensive failure " which did not encourage shoppers .
the government insists it is offering help to families .
speaking on bbc radio 4 's today programme , mr clegg restated the lib dems plan to build a " fairer " tax system through income tax cuts for low and middle-income earners .
" we would not waste £ 12.5bn on the vat cut which the prime minister has delivered , which we do n't think makes much difference , " he said .
" we would use all of that money for a green investment programme , insulating every school and every hospital in this country , and installing smart meters in every home .
" that kind of radical action not only creates jobs but it 's good for the kind of green economy we need in the future . "
' radical action ' on friday , mr cameron cited figures from the latest retail insight report , which suggested retail footfall was down 3.1 % in december from a year earlier .
" this government , that lectured us about prudence , has spent £ 12.5bn of our money ... and wasted it , " he told the bbc .
but the government has defended the decision to reduce vat from 17.5 % to 15 % until the end of 2009 .

it says the cut was the fairest way to get money into the economy because low-income households spend a larger share of their income on vat than richer households .
prime minister gordon brown also argues that he acted to recapitalise the banks , bring forward public spending and increase child tax credit and payments to pensioners .
there has been some criticism of the vat change from two german politicians and the chief economist at the international monetary fund .
the lib dems tried to get it overturned in a commons debate in december , when treasury spokesman vince cable said it was " seriously defective " as a way of getting money into the economy .
