program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 05.08.2009 french fruit farmers slam eu demands to pay back subsidies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fruit and vegetable farmers in france say they are already suffering from falling prices and incomes the eu has extended a deadline for paris to explain how it will recover huge subsidies paid to its fruit farmers that are now deemed illegal .
but farmers are up in arms over demands to pay back up to 500 million euros . the european commission ruled in january that subsidies worth around 338 million euros -lrb- $ 486.4 million -rrb- paid between 1992 and 2002 by the french government to support its fruit and vegetable sector had violated european farm and state aid policy .
the eu executive has said the subsidies gave french farmers an unfair advantage over their european competitors .
the commission has ruled that french growers now owe a total sum of about 500 million euros , including interest charges .
farmers angry about pay back demands the announcement has been met with widespread anger and disbelief in orchards and vegetable markets across france .
the eu decision comes at a time when farmers in europe 's largest farm economy have already been protesting against a recession-linked drop in demand and sliding incomes .
" we just do n't understand it .
these recent weeks , we 've been telling the government how bad things are for us .
and the first answer we get is this - that we have to pay back money we received 10 even 15 years ago , " salvatore esorordu , a fruit grower from the southern region of gard , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : producer prices for fruit and vegetables are plummeting " it 's a provocation .
prices are at their worst level in 20 years , " he added .
producer prices for fruit and vegetables fell 3.1 percent in june , putting them down 17.6 percent year-on-year , according to latest data from french statistics office insee .
the french fruit and vegetable sector , the third-largest in europe , also says it faces growing cheap competition from fellow eu countries that have lower labor costs .
france to negotiate hefty sum france has disputed the hefty sum the eu wants to claw back from fruit and vegetable farmers .
but if the government fails to refund the money , it would be liable to pay a heavy fine .
typically , such fines are open-ended , calculated on the basis of the time it takes the government to act .
if it does n't comply , the fine goes on increasing .
farm minister bruno le maire said this week that france would accept the eu demand for recouping some of the subsidies , but emphasized that he would negotiate with the eu over the total sum .
he also said he wanted the recovery of subsidies to be done gradually and on a case-by-case basis so as to avoid forcing vulnerable farmers to pay back .
" we want the reimbursements to be spread over time .
it would put an unbearable strain on farmers if they 're forced to pay this money back immediately , " le maire said .
" unfair and immoral " this is not the first time france has been forced to ask farmers to pay back subsidies .
but in the past , french farmers received generous aid directly from the european commission .
this time , any recovery of subsidies will go back into the french budget , not eu coffers .
that 's why the french government has more of an incentive to recoup the cash .
but french farmers are unlikely to accept the demands without a fight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josé bové has urged french farmers to fight the eu demands to pay back subsidies josé bové , a french member of the european parliament and former president of the peasants confederation farmers ' union , has urged civil disobedience .
" the farmers must not reimburse this money , " bové said .
" if the government sends them letters telling them to do so , i encourage them to refuse and disobey because it 's unfair and immoral . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 05.08.2009 dramatic jailbreaks put belgian justice minister in the hot seat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ashraf sekkaki is one of the escaped imprisoners currently embarrassing the belgian justice ministry three men on trial for robbery have escaped from a brussels courtroom , putting more pressure on justice minister stefan de clerck . the escapees were at the ornate palace of justice courthouse in central brussels on trial for a robbery in which they allegedly held two women and a child hostage .
just as their handcuffs were removed , their armed accomplices entered the room , threatened the five guards and helped the men flee .
the group later fired at police who were chasing them , and they have not been seen since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the palace of justice is impossible to secure , says justice minister de clerck belgian justice minister stefan de clerck has come under attack for the incident .
de clerck admitted that the accused men , each with a criminal record , should have been guarded by armed police instead of just security personnel .
he said the 19th century palace of justice was " a belgian icon , a monument with magnificent architecture " and numerous entrances that would be impossible to completely secure .
" we need to totally isolate and handle criminal cases in another part of the building , " he said .
multiple escapes plague justice minister the dramatic caper is the third such jailbreak in 12 days .
two weeks ago a helicopter airlifted three dangerous inmates out from a prison yard in bruges .
two of those men are still on the run , one of them 26-year-old ashraf sekkaki , described by the international police organization interpol as one of belgium 's most dangerous criminals .
last week six convicts were able to use a ladder from a construction site inside their prison in northern belgium to hop the prison wall .
while four escapees were immediately stopped , two of them , serving sentences for rape , torture and violent robbery , were able to get away in a car waiting for them .
oddly enough , it 's not a crime to break out of prison in belgium .
it 's natural to want freedom , goes the argument .
but it is illegal to help someone to escape .
for example , the elderly mother of one escaped prisoner could get three years in jail as she had been waiting with the getaway car .
the pressure is now on de clerck to explain the rash of escapes .
he was forced to resign from the same position he holds now in 1998 when a murderer and pedophile was able to escape for a few hours .
when the 1998 debacle came up in a television interview with de clerck after wednesday 's incident , the minister bristled at the host .
" i do my work .
i do what i have to do , " said de clerck , who only recently resumed his old post when a new government was formed late last year .
" i had six months time to work here and then you make such a laughable comment .
i think it 's inappropriate . "
the most significant effect of the escapes so far is that outdoor time for belgian prisoners has been limited .
another inmate of the bruges prison , freddy horion , convicted of multiple murders , has now sued the state for not allowing him to exercise in the fresh air. hf / afp / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the visit comes as taliban-led violence escalates ahead of the august 20 elections . on his maiden visit to afghanistan , anders fogh rasmussen repeated a pledge he made on his first working day in his job as nato secretary general : to make afghanistan his highest priority . " afghanistan is the first country i 'm visiting in my new capacity as secretary general of nato , " he said at a joint press conference with afghan president hamid karzai in kabul on wednesday . " i give very high priority to afghanistan ; actually it will be my highest priority as secretary general , " rasmussen added . he vowed that troops from the western military alliance would do their utmost to provide " the best possible security " for the august 20 presidential election . " i assure you , the afghan people , that we will stay to support you for as long as it takes to finish our job , " he said in a bid to reassure afghans in the run-up to the polls . first-hand appraisal over 64,000 of some 100,000 international troops deployed from 42 countries are serving in the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan .
nato troops operate alongside a us-led coalition . nato officials say their aim is to help stabilize a country suffering from three decades of war , resurgent islamists , poverty and corruption . rasmussen aims to assess first-hand the fight against an escalating taliban-led insurgency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai and 40 other candidates are in the race to lead the war-torn nation during the visit , which comes just two weeks ahead of nationwide elections , rasmussen was also due to hold talks with some of the other candidates for the presidency . although karzai leads a field of some 40 people standing for the top job , he has been widely criticized for avoiding the public campaign trail and deciding instead to carve out alliances with powerful but often corrupt political kingmakers . appeal to the taliban at wednesday 's press conference , karzai called on the taliban and hezbi islami , an associate group of the taliban , to renounce violence and participate in the elections . " we will request the taliban to have the afghan national interest in their hearts and minds and come and participate in the elections and , through voting , bring stability for afghanistan , " karzai said . " after elections , if i win , my first priority will be solidifying and speeding the peace process with the taliban and hezbi islami , and all other groups who are not part of al-qaeda or other terrorist networks , " he added . the worsening security and high casualties on the side of international troops have forced several nato and non-nato countries to call for talks with taliban militants , who , despite the ouster of their regime some eight years ago , are still a force to be reckoned with . rasmussen ’ s comments reflected that view .
" i am ready to take pragmatic steps that can include the security for our troops and even talks with a number of groups within the afghan society , " he said . however , he was at pains to clarify that a prerequisite for such an engagement was that the groups “ put down their weapons and abide by the laws in this country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and afghan forces have been working together to recapture areas held by taliban militants securing taliban strongholds with campaigning for the presidential and provincial council elections in full swing , nato forces are pressing ahead with operations designed to secure taliban strongholds in a last bid to allow voting to take place in restive areas . " our troops will do their utmost to ensure the best possible security around the elections , " rasmussen said , adding : " it is an opportunity for the afghan people to demonstrate that you do not bow to threats and violence of the enemies of afghanistan . " the election is afghanistan 's only second-ever democratic poll after the extremist taliban regime was ousted back in 2001 . the taliban , who ruled afghanistan between 1996 and 2001 , have managed to orchestrate an insurgency that has escalated to record levels .
the intensification is putting a huge strain on us and nato-led forces that have grown to number more than 100,000 . there are concerns that violence will overshadow the elections , deter afghans from going out to vote , and undermine the credibility of a poll that is being seen as a test of an internationally-funded drive to install democracy . bundeswehr troops in isaf bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 3,500 troops stationed in northern afghanistan as part of the isaf mission last month , officials in berlin confirmed that germany 's military , the bundeswehr , was engaged in its largest-ever offensive against the taliban .
this was in response to increased taliban attacks in the north of the country , where most of germany ’ s 3,700 troops are stationed . the latest deployment involved some 300 members of the bundeswehr 's quick reaction force and , for the first time , included armored units fighting with close air support . german defence minister franz josef jung justified the offensive , saying : " we are now being particularly challenged in kunduz . "
however , jung insisted on calling the operation a " stabilization deployment ” ahead of the elections . not an exit strategy the former danish prime minister took charge of the 28-nation nato on monday , pledging to make afghanistan his top priority and prevent the war-torn country from once again becoming a hub of international terrorism . rasmussen , who has a four-year mandate , said the long-term goal was to " move forward concretely and visibly with transferring lead security responsibility in afghanistan to the afghans . " " i believe , during my term , afghans must take over lead responsibility for security in most of their country , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community has spent a huge amount of resources to train afghanistan 's army and police however , he rejected any suggestion that such a strategy amounted to a cut and run strategy as pure propaganda . " let me be clear .
nato must and will be there in support .
let no taliban propaganda try to sell my message as a run for -lrb- the -rrb- exit .
it is not , " he said . while rasmussen ’ s comments were aimed at reassuring afghans , his visit has come at an awkward time , with residents in the southern province of kandahar saying that a nato bomb attack had killed four civilians , including three children . afghan people have become increasingly vocal about their anger over the growing number of civilian casualties as a result of operations by nato and the us-led coalition . rb / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the container ship was released with its 24-member crew on monday after somali pirates received the multi-million dollar ransom from hamburg-based shipping company leonhardt & blumberg .
the vessel was seized on april 4 , around 400 nautical miles off the somali coast , between kenya and the seychelles .
the crew on the container ship includes five germans , three russians , two filipinos , two ukrainians and 12 sailors from the south pacific nation of tuvalu .
frank-walter steinmeier , german foreign minister and social democratic chancellor candidate in up-coming elections , said ransom payments were not good " for dealing with kidnappings . "
" the federal government will not allow itself to be blackmailed in this case or in future kidnapping cases , " a foreign ministry spokesman said , expressing opposition to ransom payments made by the government .

thomas oppermann , parliamentary leader of the social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which is part of the governing grand coalition in berlin , was quoted by the daily hannoversche allgemeine zeitung as saying : " the problem of piracy wo n't get smaller this way . " meanwhile , the father of one of the crew members complained that the government did not do enough to rescue the ship .
" as associates of the government and the crisis group , we just felt abandoned in the end , " the father of the officer , identified as frederik e. , told the nordwest zeitung newspaper .
he said he had written to chancellor angela merkel , president horst koehler and other leading politicians , but never received a response .
the ship , en route to the kenyan port of mombasa , is expected to arrive there on saturday .
hamburg 's chief prosecutor was quoted as saying that a group of officers from the german federal criminal police were set to meet the ship in mombasa .
they are expected to carry out investigations and interviews with crew members to gather evidence about the pirates . rb / dpa / ap editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the visit comes as taliban-led violence escalates ahead of the august 20 elections . on his maiden visit to afghanistan , anders fogh rasmussen repeated a pledge he made on his first working day in his job as nato secretary general : to make afghanistan his highest priority . " afghanistan is the first country i 'm visiting in my new capacity as secretary general of nato , " he said at a joint press conference with afghan president hamid karzai in kabul on wednesday . " i give very high priority to afghanistan ; actually it will be my highest priority as secretary general , " rasmussen added . he vowed that troops from the western military alliance would do their utmost to provide " the best possible security " for the august 20 presidential election . " i assure you , the afghan people , that we will stay to support you for as long as it takes to finish our job , " he said in a bid to reassure afghans in the run-up to the polls . first-hand appraisal over 64,000 of some 100,000 international troops deployed from 42 countries are serving in the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan .
nato troops operate alongside a us-led coalition . nato officials say their aim is to help stabilize a country suffering from three decades of war , resurgent islamists , poverty and corruption . rasmussen aims to assess first-hand the fight against an escalating taliban-led insurgency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai and 40 other candidates are in the race to lead the war-torn nation during the visit , which comes just two weeks ahead of nationwide elections , rasmussen was also due to hold talks with some of the other candidates for the presidency . although karzai leads a field of some 40 people standing for the top job , he has been widely criticized for avoiding the public campaign trail and deciding instead to carve out alliances with powerful but often corrupt political kingmakers . appeal to the taliban at wednesday 's press conference , karzai called on the taliban and hezbi islami , an associate group of the taliban , to renounce violence and participate in the elections . " we will request the taliban to have the afghan national interest in their hearts and minds and come and participate in the elections and , through voting , bring stability for afghanistan , " karzai said . " after elections , if i win , my first priority will be solidifying and speeding the peace process with the taliban and hezbi islami , and all other groups who are not part of al-qaeda or other terrorist networks , " he added . the worsening security and high casualties on the side of international troops have forced several nato and non-nato countries to call for talks with taliban militants , who , despite the ouster of their regime some eight years ago , are still a force to be reckoned with . rasmussen ’ s comments reflected that view .
" i am ready to take pragmatic steps that can include the security for our troops and even talks with a number of groups within the afghan society , " he said . however , he was at pains to clarify that a prerequisite for such an engagement was that the groups “ put down their weapons and abide by the laws in this country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and afghan forces have been working together to recapture areas held by taliban militants securing taliban strongholds with campaigning for the presidential and provincial council elections in full swing , nato forces are pressing ahead with operations designed to secure taliban strongholds in a last bid to allow voting to take place in restive areas . " our troops will do their utmost to ensure the best possible security around the elections , " rasmussen said , adding : " it is an opportunity for the afghan people to demonstrate that you do not bow to threats and violence of the enemies of afghanistan . " the election is afghanistan 's only second-ever democratic poll after the extremist taliban regime was ousted back in 2001 . the taliban , who ruled afghanistan between 1996 and 2001 , have managed to orchestrate an insurgency that has escalated to record levels .
the intensification is putting a huge strain on us and nato-led forces that have grown to number more than 100,000 . there are concerns that violence will overshadow the elections , deter afghans from going out to vote , and undermine the credibility of a poll that is being seen as a test of an internationally-funded drive to install democracy . bundeswehr troops in isaf bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 3,500 troops stationed in northern afghanistan as part of the isaf mission last month , officials in berlin confirmed that germany 's military , the bundeswehr , was engaged in its largest-ever offensive against the taliban .
this was in response to increased taliban attacks in the north of the country , where most of germany ’ s 3,700 troops are stationed . the latest deployment involved some 300 members of the bundeswehr 's quick reaction force and , for the first time , included armored units fighting with close air support . german defence minister franz josef jung justified the offensive , saying : " we are now being particularly challenged in kunduz . "
however , jung insisted on calling the operation a " stabilization deployment ” ahead of the elections . not an exit strategy the former danish prime minister took charge of the 28-nation nato on monday , pledging to make afghanistan his top priority and prevent the war-torn country from once again becoming a hub of international terrorism . rasmussen , who has a four-year mandate , said the long-term goal was to " move forward concretely and visibly with transferring lead security responsibility in afghanistan to the afghans . " " i believe , during my term , afghans must take over lead responsibility for security in most of their country , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community has spent a huge amount of resources to train afghanistan 's army and police however , he rejected any suggestion that such a strategy amounted to a cut and run strategy as pure propaganda . " let me be clear .
nato must and will be there in support .
let no taliban propaganda try to sell my message as a run for -lrb- the -rrb- exit .
it is not , " he said . while rasmussen ’ s comments were aimed at reassuring afghans , his visit has come at an awkward time , with residents in the southern province of kandahar saying that a nato bomb attack had killed four civilians , including three children . afghan people have become increasingly vocal about their anger over the growing number of civilian casualties as a result of operations by nato and the us-led coalition . rb / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but farmers are up in arms over demands to pay back up to 500 million euros . the european commission ruled in january that subsidies worth around 338 million euros -lrb- $ 486.4 million -rrb- paid between 1992 and 2002 by the french government to support its fruit and vegetable sector had violated european farm and state aid policy .
the eu executive has said the subsidies gave french farmers an unfair advantage over their european competitors .
the commission has ruled that french growers now owe a total sum of about 500 million euros , including interest charges .
farmers angry about pay back demands the announcement has been met with widespread anger and disbelief in orchards and vegetable markets across france .
the eu decision comes at a time when farmers in europe 's largest farm economy have already been protesting against a recession-linked drop in demand and sliding incomes .
" we just do n't understand it .
these recent weeks , we 've been telling the government how bad things are for us .
and the first answer we get is this - that we have to pay back money we received 10 even 15 years ago , " salvatore esorordu , a fruit grower from the southern region of gard , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : producer prices for fruit and vegetables are plummeting " it 's a provocation .
prices are at their worst level in 20 years , " he added .
producer prices for fruit and vegetables fell 3.1 percent in june , putting them down 17.6 percent year-on-year , according to latest data from french statistics office insee .
the french fruit and vegetable sector , the third-largest in europe , also says it faces growing cheap competition from fellow eu countries that have lower labor costs .
france to negotiate hefty sum france has disputed the hefty sum the eu wants to claw back from fruit and vegetable farmers .
but if the government fails to refund the money , it would be liable to pay a heavy fine .
typically , such fines are open-ended , calculated on the basis of the time it takes the government to act .
if it does n't comply , the fine goes on increasing .
farm minister bruno le maire said this week that france would accept the eu demand for recouping some of the subsidies , but emphasized that he would negotiate with the eu over the total sum .
he also said he wanted the recovery of subsidies to be done gradually and on a case-by-case basis so as to avoid forcing vulnerable farmers to pay back .
" we want the reimbursements to be spread over time .
it would put an unbearable strain on farmers if they 're forced to pay this money back immediately , " le maire said .
" unfair and immoral " this is not the first time france has been forced to ask farmers to pay back subsidies .
but in the past , french farmers received generous aid directly from the european commission .
this time , any recovery of subsidies will go back into the french budget , not eu coffers .
that 's why the french government has more of an incentive to recoup the cash .
but french farmers are unlikely to accept the demands without a fight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josé bové has urged french farmers to fight the eu demands to pay back subsidies josé bové , a french member of the european parliament and former president of the peasants confederation farmers ' union , has urged civil disobedience .
" the farmers must not reimburse this money , " bové said .
" if the government sends them letters telling them to do so , i encourage them to refuse and disobey because it 's unfair and immoral . "

and the first answer we get is this - that we have to pay back money we received 10 even 15 years ago , " salvatore esorordu , a fruit grower from the southern region of gard , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : producer prices for fruit and vegetables are plummeting " it 's a provocation .
prices are at their worst level in 20 years , " he added .
producer prices for fruit and vegetables fell 3.1 percent in june , putting them down 17.6 percent year-on-year , according to latest data from french statistics office insee .
the french fruit and vegetable sector , the third-largest in europe , also says it faces growing cheap competition from fellow eu countries that have lower labor costs .
france to negotiate hefty sum france has disputed the hefty sum the eu wants to claw back from fruit and vegetable farmers .
but if the government fails to refund the money , it would be liable to pay a heavy fine .
typically , such fines are open-ended , calculated on the basis of the time it takes the government to act .
if it does n't comply , the fine goes on increasing .
farm minister bruno le maire said this week that france would accept the eu demand for recouping some of the subsidies , but emphasized that he would negotiate with the eu over the total sum .
he also said he wanted the recovery of subsidies to be done gradually and on a case-by-case basis so as to avoid forcing vulnerable farmers to pay back .
" we want the reimbursements to be spread over time .
it would put an unbearable strain on farmers if they 're forced to pay this money back immediately , " le maire said .
" unfair and immoral " this is not the first time france has been forced to ask farmers to pay back subsidies .
but in the past , french farmers received generous aid directly from the european commission .
this time , any recovery of subsidies will go back into the french budget , not eu coffers .
that 's why the french government has more of an incentive to recoup the cash .
but french farmers are unlikely to accept the demands without a fight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josé bové has urged french farmers to fight the eu demands to pay back subsidies josé bové , a french member of the european parliament and former president of the peasants confederation farmers ' union , has urged civil disobedience .
" the farmers must not reimburse this money , " bové said .
" if the government sends them letters telling them to do so , i encourage them to refuse and disobey because it 's unfair and immoral . "

the visit comes as taliban-led violence escalates ahead of the august 20 elections . on his maiden visit to afghanistan , anders fogh rasmussen repeated a pledge he made on his first working day in his job as nato secretary general : to make afghanistan his highest priority . " afghanistan is the first country i 'm visiting in my new capacity as secretary general of nato , " he said at a joint press conference with afghan president hamid karzai in kabul on wednesday . " i give very high priority to afghanistan ; actually it will be my highest priority as secretary general , " rasmussen added . he vowed that troops from the western military alliance would do their utmost to provide " the best possible security " for the august 20 presidential election . " i assure you , the afghan people , that we will stay to support you for as long as it takes to finish our job , " he said in a bid to reassure afghans in the run-up to the polls . first-hand appraisal over 64,000 of some 100,000 international troops deployed from 42 countries are serving in the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan .
nato troops operate alongside a us-led coalition . nato officials say their aim is to help stabilize a country suffering from three decades of war , resurgent islamists , poverty and corruption . rasmussen aims to assess first-hand the fight against an escalating taliban-led insurgency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai and 40 other candidates are in the race to lead the war-torn nation during the visit , which comes just two weeks ahead of nationwide elections , rasmussen was also due to hold talks with some of the other candidates for the presidency . although karzai leads a field of some 40 people standing for the top job , he has been widely criticized for avoiding the public campaign trail and deciding instead to carve out alliances with powerful but often corrupt political kingmakers . appeal to the taliban at wednesday 's press conference , karzai called on the taliban and hezbi islami , an associate group of the taliban , to renounce violence and participate in the elections . " we will request the taliban to have the afghan national interest in their hearts and minds and come and participate in the elections and , through voting , bring stability for afghanistan , " karzai said . " after elections , if i win , my first priority will be solidifying and speeding the peace process with the taliban and hezbi islami , and all other groups who are not part of al-qaeda or other terrorist networks , " he added . the worsening security and high casualties on the side of international troops have forced several nato and non-nato countries to call for talks with taliban militants , who , despite the ouster of their regime some eight years ago , are still a force to be reckoned with . rasmussen ’ s comments reflected that view .
" i am ready to take pragmatic steps that can include the security for our troops and even talks with a number of groups within the afghan society , " he said . however , he was at pains to clarify that a prerequisite for such an engagement was that the groups “ put down their weapons and abide by the laws in this country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and afghan forces have been working together to recapture areas held by taliban militants securing taliban strongholds with campaigning for the presidential and provincial council elections in full swing , nato forces are pressing ahead with operations designed to secure taliban strongholds in a last bid to allow voting to take place in restive areas . " our troops will do their utmost to ensure the best possible security around the elections , " rasmussen said , adding : " it is an opportunity for the afghan people to demonstrate that you do not bow to threats and violence of the enemies of afghanistan . " the election is afghanistan 's only second-ever democratic poll after the extremist taliban regime was ousted back in 2001 . the taliban , who ruled afghanistan between 1996 and 2001 , have managed to orchestrate an insurgency that has escalated to record levels .
the intensification is putting a huge strain on us and nato-led forces that have grown to number more than 100,000 . there are concerns that violence will overshadow the elections , deter afghans from going out to vote , and undermine the credibility of a poll that is being seen as a test of an internationally-funded drive to install democracy . bundeswehr troops in isaf bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 3,500 troops stationed in northern afghanistan as part of the isaf mission last month , officials in berlin confirmed that germany 's military , the bundeswehr , was engaged in its largest-ever offensive against the taliban .
this was in response to increased taliban attacks in the north of the country , where most of germany ’ s 3,700 troops are stationed . the latest deployment involved some 300 members of the bundeswehr 's quick reaction force and , for the first time , included armored units fighting with close air support . german defence minister franz josef jung justified the offensive , saying : " we are now being particularly challenged in kunduz . "
however , jung insisted on calling the operation a " stabilization deployment ” ahead of the elections . not an exit strategy the former danish prime minister took charge of the 28-nation nato on monday , pledging to make afghanistan his top priority and prevent the war-torn country from once again becoming a hub of international terrorism . rasmussen , who has a four-year mandate , said the long-term goal was to " move forward concretely and visibly with transferring lead security responsibility in afghanistan to the afghans . " " i believe , during my term , afghans must take over lead responsibility for security in most of their country , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community has spent a huge amount of resources to train afghanistan 's army and police however , he rejected any suggestion that such a strategy amounted to a cut and run strategy as pure propaganda . " let me be clear .
nato must and will be there in support .
let no taliban propaganda try to sell my message as a run for -lrb- the -rrb- exit .
it is not , " he said . while rasmussen ’ s comments were aimed at reassuring afghans , his visit has come at an awkward time , with residents in the southern province of kandahar saying that a nato bomb attack had killed four civilians , including three children . afghan people have become increasingly vocal about their anger over the growing number of civilian casualties as a result of operations by nato and the us-led coalition . rb / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when the 1998 debacle came up in a television interview with de clerck after wednesday 's incident , the minister bristled at the host .
" i do my work .
i do what i have to do , " said de clerck , who only recently resumed his old post when a new government was formed late last year .
" i had six months time to work here and then you make such a laughable comment .
i think it 's inappropriate . "
the most significant effect of the escapes so far is that outdoor time for belgian prisoners has been limited .
another inmate of the bruges prison , freddy horion , convicted of multiple murders , has now sued the state for not allowing him to exercise in the fresh air. hf / afp / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the video carried the slogan " don ’ t go to the polls " and was a copy of a us video campaign that ran ahead of the 2008 elections .
in the american version , a host of a-listers advise viewers not to bother to go and vote , complaining that politicians are all the same and asking why anyone should care what happens to health care , education or the environment .
the video was , of course , ironic and the same stars then told the public that the only way to make a difference on issues that mattered to them , was to vote .
a year later and politik-digital.de , headed by stefan gehrke , has produced a similar video using german celebrities and employing the same tactic .
but in the german version the clip ends with the celebrities still telling people not to vote .
provoking the public this change was a deliberate attempt by gehrke to provoke the public .
" we wanted to provoke , because we know there have been a lot of campaigns against voter apathy in recent years that have n't worked .
that ’ s why we thought we would take the risk that some people might not get the irony . we had the anchor man of the german news show , ' tagesschau ‘ and he is normally very conservative just reading the news .
he says in the video , ' you may not believe me , me but i don ’ t vote .
i think , if you think for just one second , you get that it would never be possible that this guy wouldn ’ t vote or would tell the people not to vote , " says gehrke .
a week later the company released a second video , which , like the us version , shows the stars abandoning all irony and telling the public to get out and vote .
replying to accusations that the campaign may have backfired and that the original irony was lost on the german public , gehrke says he is happy for the media attention this has brought to the problem he is actually trying to tackle , which is voter apathy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this way to vote " - the hope is that more voters will heed the call in 2009 since an all-time high in 1976 when 90 percent of the population cast their votes , voter turnout in germany has been decreasing .
and although the decline has been marginal – dropping from 79 percent in 1994 to 77.7 percent in 2005 – it is reason enough for the german institute for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- to want to play an active role in getting german voters back to the polling booths .
with just over fifty days to go before election day , more than 80 german celebrities and sports stars have taken part in a bpb advertising campaign that hopes to inspire people to go out and vote .
as of wednesday morning the ads are freely available to all radio stations .
" we don ’ t care who you vote for , just as long as you vote ! "
thomas krueger , president of the bpb , is running the radio ad campaign .
the production of the ads is part of a service , says krueger , to help radio stations find a way to reach the public that is not simply through the official party campaigns .
" it 's not about who you vote for , or which party you choose .
it 's that you vote in the first place , " krueger says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy is like sport .
if you do n't use it you lose it soccer players philipp lahm of bayern munich and per mertesacker of werder bremen , as well as boxing champion wladimir klitschko , are some of the sports stars taking part in the campaign , which all the celebrities have signed up for free of charge .
" we want to send out a message that federal elections are more than just an obligatory event that are more or less frustrating .
they are our constitutional right and a chance for us to decide which direction germany will take over the next four years . " says krueger .
" democracy is like sport " " if you don ’ t practise , you lose the hang of it , " wladimir klitschko says of democracy .
classical violin virtuoso , anne-sophie mutter asks voters to imagine their neighbor deciding every day what concert – rock , pop or classical - they should listen to .

all together , 160 german celebrities have taken part in the campaign , which krüger says is about giving the public a political message from people they can actually relate to and not just politicians .
krüger also applauds gehrke ’ s efforts towards the same end , although , he says , you have to be careful to send the message in the right packaging .
" i have a lot of time for irony , but you do have to account for the fact that the german public is different to the us public .
you can ’ t always carry concepts across borders , one has to adapt the concept to the german public .
it 's possible that this sort of irony isn ’ t part of the german psyche yet .
but you have to try everything to get people ’ s attention , " he says .
krüger says he wants people to think again and realise that , even if they feel disillusioned or cynical , their vote is the only way to tackle the issues important to them .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this way to vote " - the hope is that more voters will heed the call in 2009 since an all-time high in 1976 when 90 percent of the population cast their votes , voter turnout in germany has been decreasing .
and although the decline has been marginal – dropping from 79 percent in 1994 to 77.7 percent in 2005 – it is reason enough for the german institute for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- to want to play an active role in getting german voters back to the polling booths .
with just over fifty days to go before election day , more than 80 german celebrities and sports stars have taken part in a bpb advertising campaign that hopes to inspire people to go out and vote .
as of wednesday morning the ads are freely available to all radio stations .
" we don ’ t care who you vote for , just as long as you vote ! "
thomas krueger , president of the bpb , is running the radio ad campaign .
the production of the ads is part of a service , says krueger , to help radio stations find a way to reach the public that is not simply through the official party campaigns .
" it 's not about who you vote for , or which party you choose .
it 's that you vote in the first place , " krueger says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy is like sport .
if you do n't use it you lose it soccer players philipp lahm of bayern munich and per mertesacker of werder bremen , as well as boxing champion wladimir klitschko , are some of the sports stars taking part in the campaign , which all the celebrities have signed up for free of charge .
" we want to send out a message that federal elections are more than just an obligatory event that are more or less frustrating .
they are our constitutional right and a chance for us to decide which direction germany will take over the next four years . " says krueger .
" democracy is like sport " " if you don ’ t practise , you lose the hang of it , " wladimir klitschko says of democracy .
classical violin virtuoso , anne-sophie mutter asks voters to imagine their neighbor deciding every day what concert – rock , pop or classical - they should listen to .
every day for four years !
all together , 160 german celebrities have taken part in the campaign , which krüger says is about giving the public a political message from people they can actually relate to and not just politicians .
krüger also applauds gehrke ’ s efforts towards the same end , although , he says , you have to be careful to send the message in the right packaging .
" i have a lot of time for irony , but you do have to account for the fact that the german public is different to the us public .
you can ’ t always carry concepts across borders , one has to adapt the concept to the german public .
it 's possible that this sort of irony isn ’ t part of the german psyche yet .
but you have to try everything to get people ’ s attention , " he says .
krüger says he wants people to think again and realise that , even if they feel disillusioned or cynical , their vote is the only way to tackle the issues important to them .
these ads , he says , are our way of giving democracy a boost .

the video carried the slogan " don ’ t go to the polls " and was a copy of a us video campaign that ran ahead of the 2008 elections .
in the american version , a host of a-listers advise viewers not to bother to go and vote , complaining that politicians are all the same and asking why anyone should care what happens to health care , education or the environment .
the video was , of course , ironic and the same stars then told the public that the only way to make a difference on issues that mattered to them , was to vote .
a year later and politik-digital.de , headed by stefan gehrke , has produced a similar video using german celebrities and employing the same tactic .
but in the german version the clip ends with the celebrities still telling people not to vote .
provoking the public this change was a deliberate attempt by gehrke to provoke the public .
" we wanted to provoke , because we know there have been a lot of campaigns against voter apathy in recent years that have n't worked .
that ’ s why we thought we would take the risk that some people might not get the irony . we had the anchor man of the german news show , ' tagesschau ‘ and he is normally very conservative just reading the news .
he says in the video , ' you may not believe me , me but i don ’ t vote .
i think , if you think for just one second , you get that it would never be possible that this guy wouldn ’ t vote or would tell the people not to vote , " says gehrke .
a week later the company released a second video , which , like the us version , shows the stars abandoning all irony and telling the public to get out and vote .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.08.2009 old heads at new clubs hope to take teams to bundesliga title glory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg will defend their title under a new coach the bundesliga coach carousel is often as enthralling as the player swaps which take place every summer .
this year , three experienced managers take on new teams all capable of winning the league . when felix magath rolled up at wolfsburg before last season , more than a few eyebrows were raised .
the sometimes abrasive former bayern munich , who coached the bavarian giants to a double “ double ” of league and cup successes in his brief tenure , had offers from a number of top flight clubs after being sacked in february 2007 , but chose a struggling , mediocre team which had flirted with relegation for the previous two seasons .
the rest is history .
wolfsburg picked up their first league crown in may after magath had spent wisely and cannily in the transfer market and cast the wolves in his disciplined image .
wolfsburg , hardly a fashionable unit and usually mid- to lower table fodder for the big guns , were champions , hardly put a foot wrong last season as the side felix built swept the league .
bildunterschrift : magath 's arrival at schalke has taken expectations at the club even higher than usual maybe the 56-year-old magath did n't really believe that his new charges could win the league and he was as surprised as everyone else .
why else would he have agreed to leave the club before the season was even over , with his name penciled in as the new coach of schalke 04 for the 2009/10 season , before wolfsburg had shown what they were really capable of ?
but sign for schalke he did .
one wonders if a man of fewer scruples would have reneged on the agreement in the light of wolfsburg 's impressive season and stayed on to defend the title ?
felix magath may be a lot of things but he is not a deal breaker and as such will lead perennial bundesliga bridesmaids schalke this season and not the reigning champions of wolfsburg .
the royal blues spent most of last season in disarray and magath 's first job has to be to build some team spirit and plug gaps in their defense before their first league game against newly-promoted nuremburg on saturday .
after building a championship winning side out of wolfsburg , expectations are high – even by schalke 's standards .
a club which regularly promises much and more often than not delivers little -lrb- or at best waits until the final minute to choke and break the hearts of its fans -rrb- , schalke is desperate for success and magath comes with a record which suggests he could be the man to turn around their eternally disappointing fortunes .
armin veh : following in felix 's footsteps bildunterschrift : veh has quite an act to follow as he leads wolfsburg into a title defense and the champions league while magath attempts to awaken not so much a sleeping giant as a comatose one , armin veh takes over at wolfsburg with an equally challenging mission laid at his door .
with the wolves defending their first crown and with champions league soccer coming to the home of volkswagen this season , the former stuttgart coach has a high set of standards to maintain .
not only that but the fans have come to expect an attacking style of play rarely seen in wolfsburg .
veh comes to wolfsburg with championship credentials after leading stuttgart to the 2007 title .
but his team buckled during their defense the following season , sinking to the lower reaches of the league before rallying to a sixth-placed finish .
veh was sacked in november 2008 when stuttgart 's results suggested another season of mediocrity beckoned .
veh 's first game in charge is against his former club in the season 's opening game .
the new wolfsburg manager can count himself lucky that he has managed to keep hold of key strikers edwin dzeko and brazilian grafite despite interest from some of europe 's top clubs this summer .
between them , the pair netted 54 league goals , but it remains to be seen if the team can repeat their surprise success or handle the step up to the champions league where they will make their debut .
" the team is very motivated .
my initial impressions from the first training camp have absolutely been confirmed , " veh said , whose attacking options have been further boosted by the arrival of nigerian striker obafemi martins from newcastle .
" we are looking forward to the season and showing what we can do . "
direct dutchman talking tough in bayern bildunterschrift : van gaal will have to draw on his experience at europe 's top clubs to deal with bayern 's demands challenging both of these men is another manager taking the reins of a new club .
bayern munich , who sacked ex-germany coach juergen klinsmann in april , saw out last season under the considered eye caretaker coach jupp heynckes .
but it will be dutchman louis van gaal who takes on the highest-profile job in german league soccer this season .
the former barcelona , ajax and holland coach arrives in germany after leading unfancied az alkmaar to the dutch title last season .
he may have to dig into his experience at the bigger clubs on his cv to cope with the expectation which comes with managing bayern , where domestic honors are demanded and champions league success is expected .
the 57-year-old van gaal has inherited an embarrassment of riches in attack with bayern 's squad containing germany strikers mario gomez and miroslav klose , as well as italian world cup winner luca toni and croatia 's ivica olic .
promising youngster thomas mueller makes it five forwards pushing for two places in van gaal 's starting line-up and the straight-taking coach is expected to stamp his mark on the side .
bayern captain mark van bommel said the players are responding to his direct approach .

this year , three experienced managers take on new teams all capable of winning the league . when felix magath rolled up at wolfsburg before last season , more than a few eyebrows were raised .
the sometimes abrasive former bayern munich , who coached the bavarian giants to a double “ double ” of league and cup successes in his brief tenure , had offers from a number of top flight clubs after being sacked in february 2007 , but chose a struggling , mediocre team which had flirted with relegation for the previous two seasons .
the rest is history .
wolfsburg picked up their first league crown in may after magath had spent wisely and cannily in the transfer market and cast the wolves in his disciplined image .
wolfsburg , hardly a fashionable unit and usually mid- to lower table fodder for the big guns , were champions , hardly put a foot wrong last season as the side felix built swept the league .
bildunterschrift : magath 's arrival at schalke has taken expectations at the club even higher than usual maybe the 56-year-old magath did n't really believe that his new charges could win the league and he was as surprised as everyone else .
why else would he have agreed to leave the club before the season was even over , with his name penciled in as the new coach of schalke 04 for the 2009/10 season , before wolfsburg had shown what they were really capable of ?
but sign for schalke he did .
one wonders if a man of fewer scruples would have reneged on the agreement in the light of wolfsburg 's impressive season and stayed on to defend the title ?
felix magath may be a lot of things but he is not a deal breaker and as such will lead perennial bundesliga bridesmaids schalke this season and not the reigning champions of wolfsburg .
the royal blues spent most of last season in disarray and magath 's first job has to be to build some team spirit and plug gaps in their defense before their first league game against newly-promoted nuremburg on saturday .
after building a championship winning side out of wolfsburg , expectations are high – even by schalke 's standards .
a club which regularly promises much and more often than not delivers little -lrb- or at best waits until the final minute to choke and break the hearts of its fans -rrb- , schalke is desperate for success and magath comes with a record which suggests he could be the man to turn around their eternally disappointing fortunes .

with the wolves defending their first crown and with champions league soccer coming to the home of volkswagen this season , the former stuttgart coach has a high set of standards to maintain .
not only that but the fans have come to expect an attacking style of play rarely seen in wolfsburg .
veh comes to wolfsburg with championship credentials after leading stuttgart to the 2007 title .
but his team buckled during their defense the following season , sinking to the lower reaches of the league before rallying to a sixth-placed finish .
veh was sacked in november 2008 when stuttgart 's results suggested another season of mediocrity beckoned .
veh 's first game in charge is against his former club in the season 's opening game .
the new wolfsburg manager can count himself lucky that he has managed to keep hold of key strikers edwin dzeko and brazilian grafite despite interest from some of europe 's top clubs this summer .
between them , the pair netted 54 league goals , but it remains to be seen if the team can repeat their surprise success or handle the step up to the champions league where they will make their debut .

bayern munich , who sacked ex-germany coach juergen klinsmann in april , saw out last season under the considered eye caretaker coach jupp heynckes .

he may have to dig into his experience at the bigger clubs on his cv to cope with the expectation which comes with managing bayern , where domestic honors are demanded and champions league success is expected .

why else would he have agreed to leave the club before the season was even over , with his name penciled in as the new coach of schalke 04 for the 2009/10 season , before wolfsburg had shown what they were really capable of ?
but sign for schalke he did .
one wonders if a man of fewer scruples would have reneged on the agreement in the light of wolfsburg 's impressive season and stayed on to defend the title ?
felix magath may be a lot of things but he is not a deal breaker and as such will lead perennial bundesliga bridesmaids schalke this season and not the reigning champions of wolfsburg .
the royal blues spent most of last season in disarray and magath 's first job has to be to build some team spirit and plug gaps in their defense before their first league game against newly-promoted nuremburg on saturday .
after building a championship winning side out of wolfsburg , expectations are high – even by schalke 's standards .
a club which regularly promises much and more often than not delivers little -lrb- or at best waits until the final minute to choke and break the hearts of its fans -rrb- , schalke is desperate for success and magath comes with a record which suggests he could be the man to turn around their eternally disappointing fortunes .
armin veh : following in felix 's footsteps bildunterschrift : veh has quite an act to follow as he leads wolfsburg into a title defense and the champions league while magath attempts to awaken not so much a sleeping giant as a comatose one , armin veh takes over at wolfsburg with an equally challenging mission laid at his door .
with the wolves defending their first crown and with champions league soccer coming to the home of volkswagen this season , the former stuttgart coach has a high set of standards to maintain .
not only that but the fans have come to expect an attacking style of play rarely seen in wolfsburg .
veh comes to wolfsburg with championship credentials after leading stuttgart to the 2007 title .
but his team buckled during their defense the following season , sinking to the lower reaches of the league before rallying to a sixth-placed finish .
veh was sacked in november 2008 when stuttgart 's results suggested another season of mediocrity beckoned .
veh 's first game in charge is against his former club in the season 's opening game .
the new wolfsburg manager can count himself lucky that he has managed to keep hold of key strikers edwin dzeko and brazilian grafite despite interest from some of europe 's top clubs this summer .
between them , the pair netted 54 league goals , but it remains to be seen if the team can repeat their surprise success or handle the step up to the champions league where they will make their debut .
" the team is very motivated .
my initial impressions from the first training camp have absolutely been confirmed , " veh said , whose attacking options have been further boosted by the arrival of nigerian striker obafemi martins from newcastle .
" we are looking forward to the season and showing what we can do . "
direct dutchman talking tough in bayern bildunterschrift : van gaal will have to draw on his experience at europe 's top clubs to deal with bayern 's demands challenging both of these men is another manager taking the reins of a new club .
bayern munich , who sacked ex-germany coach juergen klinsmann in april , saw out last season under the considered eye caretaker coach jupp heynckes .
but it will be dutchman louis van gaal who takes on the highest-profile job in german league soccer this season .
the former barcelona , ajax and holland coach arrives in germany after leading unfancied az alkmaar to the dutch title last season .
he may have to dig into his experience at the bigger clubs on his cv to cope with the expectation which comes with managing bayern , where domestic honors are demanded and champions league success is expected .
the 57-year-old van gaal has inherited an embarrassment of riches in attack with bayern 's squad containing germany strikers mario gomez and miroslav klose , as well as italian world cup winner luca toni and croatia 's ivica olic .
promising youngster thomas mueller makes it five forwards pushing for two places in van gaal 's starting line-up and the straight-taking coach is expected to stamp his mark on the side .
bayern captain mark van bommel said the players are responding to his direct approach .
" he clearly tells us what he wants to see .
he 's a straight talker ; he corrects you and urges you on . "
raised voices on the practice ground from time to time are not a problem , says van bommel .
" it 's criticism to help you improve .
it 's well-intentioned , to stop it happening again . "
the dutchman 's first league game in charge is against last season 's dark horses hoffenheim who led the league on their debut bundesliga season at christmas before falling off the pace. nda / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ultimately neither real madrid , barcelona or manchester united were prepared to meet the ever-rising price tag set by the bavarian club where the french international is contracted until 2011 .
the man fans once hailed as " kaiser franck , " now known as " the bavarian diva " by german media , is looking far from imperial with ribery 's commitment to bayern becoming increasingly tarnished during a summer of speculation .
outspoken bayern munich president franz beckenbauer blasted ribery , for , in his view , being more interested in his own career than the club and suggested that the player could still be sold - for 94 million euros -lrb- $ 135 million -rrb- .
" of course we would expect the market price , and if cristiano ronaldo is worth 94 million , then ribery is worth a comparable sum .
but if no offer is forthcoming he must fulfill the terms of his contract until 2011 , " he told sport bild newspaper .
commentators were not entirely convinced by a statement from bayern management which said : " bayern have at no time had and do not have the impression from franck ribery that he would only use bayern in order to further his own career .
he has always given himself and his abilities to the service of the team . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shorts say bayern , the expression says anywhere but here as another season in germany looms , ribery 's attitude continues to make headlines .
when the team assembled for the official pre-season photo session , observers noted the frenchman was unsmiling and distant .
he is due to miss the start of the season through injury and may spend his recuperation time wishing he was at a different stadium - namely the bernabeu in madrid , hob-nobbing with ronaldo , kaka and karim benzema as real madrid chairman florentino perez proudly showed off his multi-million euro signings in the spanish sun .
bayern , overtaken last season by wolfsburg at the top of the league , will be hoping they can hang onto ribery to provide ammunition for mario gomez .
bayern paid 30 million euros to obtain the striker from stuttgart , as they try and win back the coveted bundesliga title .
auf wiedersehen bayern bayern will be without brazilian stalwarts lucio and ze roberto who quit bavaria for inter milan and hamburg respectively in the close season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio expected more respect from new coach van gaal lucio , the veteran central defender , left bayern with a parting shot at new dutch manager louis van gaal who he accused of showing " a lack of respect . "
" i am a world champion -lrb- in the 2002 winning brazil team -rrb- as well as winning the confederations cup twice and was chosen best defender in the bundesliga , ” lucio said as he completed a reported eight million-euro move to the italian champions .
" surely i did not need to show him further proof of my abilities ? "
passing the brazilians on the way out is danijel pranjic , the croatian midfielder who joins bayern from heerenveen and dutch left-back edson braafheid from fc twente .
old boys come home stuttgart , anxious to replace gomez in attack , finally agreed with barcelona the return of their one-time player alexander hleb who spent an unhappy year at camp nou after his transfer from arsenal in 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hleb had a successful mid-decade spell with stuttgart the belarus international opted against a move to inter milan in favor of a move on loan back to the german club where he played from 2000-2005 .

bundesliga champions wolfsburg pulled off a coup by managing to hang on to the league 's player of the year , 23-year-old bosnian playmaker edzin dzeko who had been tempted by ac milan .
wolves add martins and algerian whiz-kid wolfsburg also managed to tempt newcastle 's ex-inter milan striker obafemi martins to the bundesliga for a reported 8.5 million euros after the 24-year-old nigerian spent a frustrating five years on tyneside .

ultimately neither real madrid , barcelona or manchester united were prepared to meet the ever-rising price tag set by the bavarian club where the french international is contracted until 2011 .
the man fans once hailed as " kaiser franck , " now known as " the bavarian diva " by german media , is looking far from imperial with ribery 's commitment to bayern becoming increasingly tarnished during a summer of speculation .
outspoken bayern munich president franz beckenbauer blasted ribery , for , in his view , being more interested in his own career than the club and suggested that the player could still be sold - for 94 million euros -lrb- $ 135 million -rrb- .
" of course we would expect the market price , and if cristiano ronaldo is worth 94 million , then ribery is worth a comparable sum .
but if no offer is forthcoming he must fulfill the terms of his contract until 2011 , " he told sport bild newspaper .
commentators were not entirely convinced by a statement from bayern management which said : " bayern have at no time had and do not have the impression from franck ribery that he would only use bayern in order to further his own career .
he has always given himself and his abilities to the service of the team . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shorts say bayern , the expression says anywhere but here as another season in germany looms , ribery 's attitude continues to make headlines .
when the team assembled for the official pre-season photo session , observers noted the frenchman was unsmiling and distant .
he is due to miss the start of the season through injury and may spend his recuperation time wishing he was at a different stadium - namely the bernabeu in madrid , hob-nobbing with ronaldo , kaka and karim benzema as real madrid chairman florentino perez proudly showed off his multi-million euro signings in the spanish sun .
bayern , overtaken last season by wolfsburg at the top of the league , will be hoping they can hang onto ribery to provide ammunition for mario gomez .
bayern paid 30 million euros to obtain the striker from stuttgart , as they try and win back the coveted bundesliga title .
auf wiedersehen bayern bayern will be without brazilian stalwarts lucio and ze roberto who quit bavaria for inter milan and hamburg respectively in the close season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio expected more respect from new coach van gaal lucio , the veteran central defender , left bayern with a parting shot at new dutch manager louis van gaal who he accused of showing " a lack of respect . "
" i am a world champion -lrb- in the 2002 winning brazil team -rrb- as well as winning the confederations cup twice and was chosen best defender in the bundesliga , ” lucio said as he completed a reported eight million-euro move to the italian champions .
" surely i did not need to show him further proof of my abilities ? "
passing the brazilians on the way out is danijel pranjic , the croatian midfielder who joins bayern from heerenveen and dutch left-back edson braafheid from fc twente .
old boys come home stuttgart , anxious to replace gomez in attack , finally agreed with barcelona the return of their one-time player alexander hleb who spent an unhappy year at camp nou after his transfer from arsenal in 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hleb had a successful mid-decade spell with stuttgart the belarus international opted against a move to inter milan in favor of a move on loan back to the german club where he played from 2000-2005 .

manfred guellner , the head of the forsa institute , said that the dip in support for the spd was partly caused by a scandal involving health minister ulla schmidt who took her official car on holiday , prompting a public outcry .
" the affair stirred up all the reservations about the spd that were already there : incompetence and distance from the people , " said guellner .
frank-walter steinmeier , the spd 's chancellor candidate and current german foreign minister , has struggled to make dents in merkel 's popularity despite unveiling a campaign team including several new faces and making a contentious pledge to bring full employment to europe 's largest economy by 2020 .
however , in germany 's complex system of coalition politics , voters choose parties , not individuals , and elections do not boil down to a straight race between the two main parties .
end in sight for grand coalition ?

this would , in theory , give merkel the necessary majority to form her desired coalition after the september 27 election , albeit with a slim 51 percent .
the green party rose by one point to 13 percent and the far-left left party also gained in support , rising to 11 percent .

most of the people taken into custody have been released , though there are still around 250 in jail .
around 100 opposition supporters went on trial over the weekend .
the iranian government insists the presidential election was fair and transparent and has accused western nations of being complicit in the bloody post-election unrest .
criticism of sweden over attending the inauguration within the european union , there had been strong criticism of sweden 's plans to send its ambassador to attend the ceremony to represent the current eu council presidency .
german politician elmar brok , who is also the foreign policy spokesman for the conservatives in the european parliament , warned the eu should be more consistent in its criticism of tehran .
" over the past weeks , the eu has continuously demanded a recount of the vote and new elections .
we also have strongly condemned the arrests and the violence against the demonstrators , " he said .
" we can not now legitimize ahmadinejad 's re-election by attending the ceremony . "
eckhard von klaeden , the foreign policy spokesman for merkel 's cdu , said sweden should have followed the example of most other eu countries by not sending their ambassador .
" europe should stand united in its criticism of the rigged elections and the suppression of the opposition movement , " he said .
germany did not send its ambassador to the inauguration but only a lower-ranked diplomatic official. ai / dpa / ap / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

manfred guellner , the head of the forsa institute , said that the dip in support for the spd was partly caused by a scandal involving health minister ulla schmidt who took her official car on holiday , prompting a public outcry .
" the affair stirred up all the reservations about the spd that were already there : incompetence and distance from the people , " said guellner .
frank-walter steinmeier , the spd 's chancellor candidate and current german foreign minister , has struggled to make dents in merkel 's popularity despite unveiling a campaign team including several new faces and making a contentious pledge to bring full employment to europe 's largest economy by 2020 .
however , in germany 's complex system of coalition politics , voters choose parties , not individuals , and elections do not boil down to a straight race between the two main parties .

this would , in theory , give merkel the necessary majority to form her desired coalition after the september 27 election , albeit with a slim 51 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 05.08.2009 french fruit farmers slam eu demands to pay back subsidies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fruit and vegetable farmers in france say they are already suffering from falling prices and incomes the eu has extended a deadline for paris to explain how it will recover huge subsidies paid to its fruit farmers that are now deemed illegal .
but farmers are up in arms over demands to pay back up to 500 million euros . the european commission ruled in january that subsidies worth around 338 million euros -lrb- $ 486.4 million -rrb- paid between 1992 and 2002 by the french government to support its fruit and vegetable sector had violated european farm and state aid policy .
the eu executive has said the subsidies gave french farmers an unfair advantage over their european competitors .
the commission has ruled that french growers now owe a total sum of about 500 million euros , including interest charges .
farmers angry about pay back demands the announcement has been met with widespread anger and disbelief in orchards and vegetable markets across france .
the eu decision comes at a time when farmers in europe 's largest farm economy have already been protesting against a recession-linked drop in demand and sliding incomes .
" we just do n't understand it .
these recent weeks , we 've been telling the government how bad things are for us .
and the first answer we get is this - that we have to pay back money we received 10 even 15 years ago , " salvatore esorordu , a fruit grower from the southern region of gard , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : producer prices for fruit and vegetables are plummeting " it 's a provocation .
prices are at their worst level in 20 years , " he added .
producer prices for fruit and vegetables fell 3.1 percent in june , putting them down 17.6 percent year-on-year , according to latest data from french statistics office insee .
the french fruit and vegetable sector , the third-largest in europe , also says it faces growing cheap competition from fellow eu countries that have lower labor costs .
france to negotiate hefty sum france has disputed the hefty sum the eu wants to claw back from fruit and vegetable farmers .
but if the government fails to refund the money , it would be liable to pay a heavy fine .
typically , such fines are open-ended , calculated on the basis of the time it takes the government to act .
if it does n't comply , the fine goes on increasing .
farm minister bruno le maire said this week that france would accept the eu demand for recouping some of the subsidies , but emphasized that he would negotiate with the eu over the total sum .
he also said he wanted the recovery of subsidies to be done gradually and on a case-by-case basis so as to avoid forcing vulnerable farmers to pay back .
" we want the reimbursements to be spread over time .
it would put an unbearable strain on farmers if they 're forced to pay this money back immediately , " le maire said .
" unfair and immoral " this is not the first time france has been forced to ask farmers to pay back subsidies .
but in the past , french farmers received generous aid directly from the european commission .
this time , any recovery of subsidies will go back into the french budget , not eu coffers .
that 's why the french government has more of an incentive to recoup the cash .
but french farmers are unlikely to accept the demands without a fight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josé bové has urged french farmers to fight the eu demands to pay back subsidies josé bové , a french member of the european parliament and former president of the peasants confederation farmers ' union , has urged civil disobedience .
" the farmers must not reimburse this money , " bové said .
" if the government sends them letters telling them to do so , i encourage them to refuse and disobey because it 's unfair and immoral . "

ultimately neither real madrid , barcelona or manchester united were prepared to meet the ever-rising price tag set by the bavarian club where the french international is contracted until 2011 .
the man fans once hailed as " kaiser franck , " now known as " the bavarian diva " by german media , is looking far from imperial with ribery 's commitment to bayern becoming increasingly tarnished during a summer of speculation .
outspoken bayern munich president franz beckenbauer blasted ribery , for , in his view , being more interested in his own career than the club and suggested that the player could still be sold - for 94 million euros -lrb- $ 135 million -rrb- .
" of course we would expect the market price , and if cristiano ronaldo is worth 94 million , then ribery is worth a comparable sum .
but if no offer is forthcoming he must fulfill the terms of his contract until 2011 , " he told sport bild newspaper .
commentators were not entirely convinced by a statement from bayern management which said : " bayern have at no time had and do not have the impression from franck ribery that he would only use bayern in order to further his own career .
he has always given himself and his abilities to the service of the team . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shorts say bayern , the expression says anywhere but here as another season in germany looms , ribery 's attitude continues to make headlines .
when the team assembled for the official pre-season photo session , observers noted the frenchman was unsmiling and distant .
he is due to miss the start of the season through injury and may spend his recuperation time wishing he was at a different stadium - namely the bernabeu in madrid , hob-nobbing with ronaldo , kaka and karim benzema as real madrid chairman florentino perez proudly showed off his multi-million euro signings in the spanish sun .
bayern , overtaken last season by wolfsburg at the top of the league , will be hoping they can hang onto ribery to provide ammunition for mario gomez .
bayern paid 30 million euros to obtain the striker from stuttgart , as they try and win back the coveted bundesliga title .
auf wiedersehen bayern bayern will be without brazilian stalwarts lucio and ze roberto who quit bavaria for inter milan and hamburg respectively in the close season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio expected more respect from new coach van gaal lucio , the veteran central defender , left bayern with a parting shot at new dutch manager louis van gaal who he accused of showing " a lack of respect . "
" i am a world champion -lrb- in the 2002 winning brazil team -rrb- as well as winning the confederations cup twice and was chosen best defender in the bundesliga , ” lucio said as he completed a reported eight million-euro move to the italian champions .
" surely i did not need to show him further proof of my abilities ? "
passing the brazilians on the way out is danijel pranjic , the croatian midfielder who joins bayern from heerenveen and dutch left-back edson braafheid from fc twente .
old boys come home stuttgart , anxious to replace gomez in attack , finally agreed with barcelona the return of their one-time player alexander hleb who spent an unhappy year at camp nou after his transfer from arsenal in 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hleb had a successful mid-decade spell with stuttgart the belarus international opted against a move to inter milan in favor of a move on loan back to the german club where he played from 2000-2005 .
another old boy returning home is international midfielder tim borowski who will again turn out in the colors of german cup holders werder bremen after a spell loan at bayern .
one of the best bits of business in the close season trading frenzy actually did n't involve any exchange of money or player .
bundesliga champions wolfsburg pulled off a coup by managing to hang on to the league 's player of the year , 23-year-old bosnian playmaker edzin dzeko who had been tempted by ac milan .
wolves add martins and algerian whiz-kid wolfsburg also managed to tempt newcastle 's ex-inter milan striker obafemi martins to the bundesliga for a reported 8.5 million euros after the 24-year-old nigerian spent a frustrating five years on tyneside .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obafemi martins brings his skills to the german champs new wolves coach armin veh also added the speedy 26-year-old algeria international karim ziani to the champions ' midfield , paying marseille five million euros for his services .
ziani " fits well in the team and will help us get to our target next season , " veh said .
meanwhile , ex-wolfsburg manager felix magath will welcome talented youngster lewis holtby from aachen after off-loading last year 's expensive dutch midfield flop orlando engelaar onto psv eindhoven .
challengers spend wisely northern challengers hamburg are hoping to shore up their defense with the signature of czech defender david rozenhal from lazio .
" hamburg is a big club with great infrastructure and conditions .
the level at the bundesliga is extremely high and it is always my aim to play high level football , " rozenhal told the club 's web site .
german media have reported the transfer fee at around five million euros .
last season 's surprise package hoffenheim have splashed more of their owner 's cash by signing argentine teenage midfielder franco zuculini for 4.7 million euros from racing club avellaneda and croatian defender josip simunic from hertha berlin for seven million , while picking up ghanaian forward prince tagoe on a free transfer from saudi club al-ittifaq .
presumably looking for a club with a less comical name , argentine goal-scoring sensation lucas barrios has opted to spend this season at the more soberly named borussia dortmund after transferring from colo colo for 4.5 million euros .
the 24-year-old striker hit the net a record 37 times in the 2008 season for the chilean champions and replaces veteran swiss national skipper alexander frei who has departed for basel in his native country for 4.2 million euros. nda / dpa / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

just as their handcuffs were removed , their armed accomplices entered the room , threatened the five guards and helped the men flee .
the group later fired at police who were chasing them , and they have not been seen since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the palace of justice is impossible to secure , says justice minister de clerck belgian justice minister stefan de clerck has come under attack for the incident .
de clerck admitted that the accused men , each with a criminal record , should have been guarded by armed police instead of just security personnel .
he said the 19th century palace of justice was " a belgian icon , a monument with magnificent architecture " and numerous entrances that would be impossible to completely secure .
" we need to totally isolate and handle criminal cases in another part of the building , " he said .
multiple escapes plague justice minister the dramatic caper is the third such jailbreak in 12 days .
two weeks ago a helicopter airlifted three dangerous inmates out from a prison yard in bruges .
two of those men are still on the run , one of them 26-year-old ashraf sekkaki , described by the international police organization interpol as one of belgium 's most dangerous criminals .
last week six convicts were able to use a ladder from a construction site inside their prison in northern belgium to hop the prison wall .
while four escapees were immediately stopped , two of them , serving sentences for rape , torture and violent robbery , were able to get away in a car waiting for them .
oddly enough , it 's not a crime to break out of prison in belgium .
it 's natural to want freedom , goes the argument .
but it is illegal to help someone to escape .
for example , the elderly mother of one escaped prisoner could get three years in jail as she had been waiting with the getaway car .
the pressure is now on de clerck to explain the rash of escapes .
he was forced to resign from the same position he holds now in 1998 when a murderer and pedophile was able to escape for a few hours .
when the 1998 debacle came up in a television interview with de clerck after wednesday 's incident , the minister bristled at the host .
" i do my work .
i do what i have to do , " said de clerck , who only recently resumed his old post when a new government was formed late last year .
" i had six months time to work here and then you make such a laughable comment .
i think it 's inappropriate . "
the most significant effect of the escapes so far is that outdoor time for belgian prisoners has been limited .
another inmate of the bruges prison , freddy horion , convicted of multiple murders , has now sued the state for not allowing him to exercise in the fresh air. hf / afp / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the container ship was released with its 24-member crew on monday after somali pirates received the multi-million dollar ransom from hamburg-based shipping company leonhardt & blumberg .
the vessel was seized on april 4 , around 400 nautical miles off the somali coast , between kenya and the seychelles .
the crew on the container ship includes five germans , three russians , two filipinos , two ukrainians and 12 sailors from the south pacific nation of tuvalu .
frank-walter steinmeier , german foreign minister and social democratic chancellor candidate in up-coming elections , said ransom payments were not good " for dealing with kidnappings . "
" the federal government will not allow itself to be blackmailed in this case or in future kidnapping cases , " a foreign ministry spokesman said , expressing opposition to ransom payments made by the government .

thomas oppermann , parliamentary leader of the social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which is part of the governing grand coalition in berlin , was quoted by the daily hannoversche allgemeine zeitung as saying : " the problem of piracy wo n't get smaller this way . " meanwhile , the father of one of the crew members complained that the government did not do enough to rescue the ship .
" as associates of the government and the crisis group , we just felt abandoned in the end , " the father of the officer , identified as frederik e. , told the nordwest zeitung newspaper .
he said he had written to chancellor angela merkel , president horst koehler and other leading politicians , but never received a response .
the ship , en route to the kenyan port of mombasa , is expected to arrive there on saturday .
hamburg 's chief prosecutor was quoted as saying that a group of officers from the german federal criminal police were set to meet the ship in mombasa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 05.08.2009 french fruit farmers slam eu demands to pay back subsidies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fruit and vegetable farmers in france say they are already suffering from falling prices and incomes the eu has extended a deadline for paris to explain how it will recover huge subsidies paid to its fruit farmers that are now deemed illegal .
but farmers are up in arms over demands to pay back up to 500 million euros . the european commission ruled in january that subsidies worth around 338 million euros -lrb- $ 486.4 million -rrb- paid between 1992 and 2002 by the french government to support its fruit and vegetable sector had violated european farm and state aid policy .
the eu executive has said the subsidies gave french farmers an unfair advantage over their european competitors .
the commission has ruled that french growers now owe a total sum of about 500 million euros , including interest charges .
farmers angry about pay back demands the announcement has been met with widespread anger and disbelief in orchards and vegetable markets across france .
the eu decision comes at a time when farmers in europe 's largest farm economy have already been protesting against a recession-linked drop in demand and sliding incomes .
" we just do n't understand it .
these recent weeks , we 've been telling the government how bad things are for us .
and the first answer we get is this - that we have to pay back money we received 10 even 15 years ago , " salvatore esorordu , a fruit grower from the southern region of gard , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : producer prices for fruit and vegetables are plummeting " it 's a provocation .
prices are at their worst level in 20 years , " he added .
producer prices for fruit and vegetables fell 3.1 percent in june , putting them down 17.6 percent year-on-year , according to latest data from french statistics office insee .
the french fruit and vegetable sector , the third-largest in europe , also says it faces growing cheap competition from fellow eu countries that have lower labor costs .
france to negotiate hefty sum france has disputed the hefty sum the eu wants to claw back from fruit and vegetable farmers .
but if the government fails to refund the money , it would be liable to pay a heavy fine .
typically , such fines are open-ended , calculated on the basis of the time it takes the government to act .
if it does n't comply , the fine goes on increasing .
farm minister bruno le maire said this week that france would accept the eu demand for recouping some of the subsidies , but emphasized that he would negotiate with the eu over the total sum .
he also said he wanted the recovery of subsidies to be done gradually and on a case-by-case basis so as to avoid forcing vulnerable farmers to pay back .
" we want the reimbursements to be spread over time .
it would put an unbearable strain on farmers if they 're forced to pay this money back immediately , " le maire said .
" unfair and immoral " this is not the first time france has been forced to ask farmers to pay back subsidies .
but in the past , french farmers received generous aid directly from the european commission .
this time , any recovery of subsidies will go back into the french budget , not eu coffers .
that 's why the french government has more of an incentive to recoup the cash .
but french farmers are unlikely to accept the demands without a fight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josé bové has urged french farmers to fight the eu demands to pay back subsidies josé bové , a french member of the european parliament and former president of the peasants confederation farmers ' union , has urged civil disobedience .
" the farmers must not reimburse this money , " bové said .
" if the government sends them letters telling them to do so , i encourage them to refuse and disobey because it 's unfair and immoral . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 05.08.2009 german celebrities go on air to persuade people to vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " get out and vote " is the message from german celebrities german elections are less than two months away and , as the parties step up their campaigns , celebrities have been roped in to get the message across to the general public that voting is important . a few weeks ago an independent internet advertisement , produced by politik-digital.de , appeared , in which german celebrities , including two well-known news anchors , seemed to be telling people not to vote .
the video carried the slogan " don ’ t go to the polls " and was a copy of a us video campaign that ran ahead of the 2008 elections .
in the american version , a host of a-listers advise viewers not to bother to go and vote , complaining that politicians are all the same and asking why anyone should care what happens to health care , education or the environment .
the video was , of course , ironic and the same stars then told the public that the only way to make a difference on issues that mattered to them , was to vote .
a year later and politik-digital.de , headed by stefan gehrke , has produced a similar video using german celebrities and employing the same tactic .
but in the german version the clip ends with the celebrities still telling people not to vote .
provoking the public this change was a deliberate attempt by gehrke to provoke the public .
" we wanted to provoke , because we know there have been a lot of campaigns against voter apathy in recent years that have n't worked .
that ’ s why we thought we would take the risk that some people might not get the irony . we had the anchor man of the german news show , ' tagesschau ‘ and he is normally very conservative just reading the news .
he says in the video , ' you may not believe me , me but i don ’ t vote .
i think , if you think for just one second , you get that it would never be possible that this guy wouldn ’ t vote or would tell the people not to vote , " says gehrke .
a week later the company released a second video , which , like the us version , shows the stars abandoning all irony and telling the public to get out and vote .
replying to accusations that the campaign may have backfired and that the original irony was lost on the german public , gehrke says he is happy for the media attention this has brought to the problem he is actually trying to tackle , which is voter apathy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this way to vote " - the hope is that more voters will heed the call in 2009 since an all-time high in 1976 when 90 percent of the population cast their votes , voter turnout in germany has been decreasing .
and although the decline has been marginal – dropping from 79 percent in 1994 to 77.7 percent in 2005 – it is reason enough for the german institute for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- to want to play an active role in getting german voters back to the polling booths .
with just over fifty days to go before election day , more than 80 german celebrities and sports stars have taken part in a bpb advertising campaign that hopes to inspire people to go out and vote .
as of wednesday morning the ads are freely available to all radio stations .
" we don ’ t care who you vote for , just as long as you vote ! "
thomas krueger , president of the bpb , is running the radio ad campaign .
the production of the ads is part of a service , says krueger , to help radio stations find a way to reach the public that is not simply through the official party campaigns .
" it 's not about who you vote for , or which party you choose .
it 's that you vote in the first place , " krueger says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy is like sport .
if you do n't use it you lose it soccer players philipp lahm of bayern munich and per mertesacker of werder bremen , as well as boxing champion wladimir klitschko , are some of the sports stars taking part in the campaign , which all the celebrities have signed up for free of charge .
" we want to send out a message that federal elections are more than just an obligatory event that are more or less frustrating .
they are our constitutional right and a chance for us to decide which direction germany will take over the next four years . " says krueger .
" democracy is like sport " " if you don ’ t practise , you lose the hang of it , " wladimir klitschko says of democracy .
classical violin virtuoso , anne-sophie mutter asks voters to imagine their neighbor deciding every day what concert – rock , pop or classical - they should listen to .
every day for four years !
all together , 160 german celebrities have taken part in the campaign , which krüger says is about giving the public a political message from people they can actually relate to and not just politicians .
krüger also applauds gehrke ’ s efforts towards the same end , although , he says , you have to be careful to send the message in the right packaging .
" i have a lot of time for irony , but you do have to account for the fact that the german public is different to the us public .
you can ’ t always carry concepts across borders , one has to adapt the concept to the german public .
it 's possible that this sort of irony isn ’ t part of the german psyche yet .
but you have to try everything to get people ’ s attention , " he says .
krüger says he wants people to think again and realise that , even if they feel disillusioned or cynical , their vote is the only way to tackle the issues important to them .
these ads , he says , are our way of giving democracy a boost .

this year , three experienced managers take on new teams all capable of winning the league . when felix magath rolled up at wolfsburg before last season , more than a few eyebrows were raised .
the sometimes abrasive former bayern munich , who coached the bavarian giants to a double “ double ” of league and cup successes in his brief tenure , had offers from a number of top flight clubs after being sacked in february 2007 , but chose a struggling , mediocre team which had flirted with relegation for the previous two seasons .
the rest is history .
wolfsburg picked up their first league crown in may after magath had spent wisely and cannily in the transfer market and cast the wolves in his disciplined image .
wolfsburg , hardly a fashionable unit and usually mid- to lower table fodder for the big guns , were champions , hardly put a foot wrong last season as the side felix built swept the league .
bildunterschrift : magath 's arrival at schalke has taken expectations at the club even higher than usual maybe the 56-year-old magath did n't really believe that his new charges could win the league and he was as surprised as everyone else .
why else would he have agreed to leave the club before the season was even over , with his name penciled in as the new coach of schalke 04 for the 2009/10 season , before wolfsburg had shown what they were really capable of ?
but sign for schalke he did .
one wonders if a man of fewer scruples would have reneged on the agreement in the light of wolfsburg 's impressive season and stayed on to defend the title ?
felix magath may be a lot of things but he is not a deal breaker and as such will lead perennial bundesliga bridesmaids schalke this season and not the reigning champions of wolfsburg .
the royal blues spent most of last season in disarray and magath 's first job has to be to build some team spirit and plug gaps in their defense before their first league game against newly-promoted nuremburg on saturday .
after building a championship winning side out of wolfsburg , expectations are high – even by schalke 's standards .
a club which regularly promises much and more often than not delivers little -lrb- or at best waits until the final minute to choke and break the hearts of its fans -rrb- , schalke is desperate for success and magath comes with a record which suggests he could be the man to turn around their eternally disappointing fortunes .
armin veh : following in felix 's footsteps bildunterschrift : veh has quite an act to follow as he leads wolfsburg into a title defense and the champions league while magath attempts to awaken not so much a sleeping giant as a comatose one , armin veh takes over at wolfsburg with an equally challenging mission laid at his door .
with the wolves defending their first crown and with champions league soccer coming to the home of volkswagen this season , the former stuttgart coach has a high set of standards to maintain .
not only that but the fans have come to expect an attacking style of play rarely seen in wolfsburg .
veh comes to wolfsburg with championship credentials after leading stuttgart to the 2007 title .
but his team buckled during their defense the following season , sinking to the lower reaches of the league before rallying to a sixth-placed finish .
veh was sacked in november 2008 when stuttgart 's results suggested another season of mediocrity beckoned .
veh 's first game in charge is against his former club in the season 's opening game .
the new wolfsburg manager can count himself lucky that he has managed to keep hold of key strikers edwin dzeko and brazilian grafite despite interest from some of europe 's top clubs this summer .
between them , the pair netted 54 league goals , but it remains to be seen if the team can repeat their surprise success or handle the step up to the champions league where they will make their debut .
" the team is very motivated .
my initial impressions from the first training camp have absolutely been confirmed , " veh said , whose attacking options have been further boosted by the arrival of nigerian striker obafemi martins from newcastle .
" we are looking forward to the season and showing what we can do . "
direct dutchman talking tough in bayern bildunterschrift : van gaal will have to draw on his experience at europe 's top clubs to deal with bayern 's demands challenging both of these men is another manager taking the reins of a new club .
bayern munich , who sacked ex-germany coach juergen klinsmann in april , saw out last season under the considered eye caretaker coach jupp heynckes .
but it will be dutchman louis van gaal who takes on the highest-profile job in german league soccer this season .
the former barcelona , ajax and holland coach arrives in germany after leading unfancied az alkmaar to the dutch title last season .
he may have to dig into his experience at the bigger clubs on his cv to cope with the expectation which comes with managing bayern , where domestic honors are demanded and champions league success is expected .
the 57-year-old van gaal has inherited an embarrassment of riches in attack with bayern 's squad containing germany strikers mario gomez and miroslav klose , as well as italian world cup winner luca toni and croatia 's ivica olic .
promising youngster thomas mueller makes it five forwards pushing for two places in van gaal 's starting line-up and the straight-taking coach is expected to stamp his mark on the side .
bayern captain mark van bommel said the players are responding to his direct approach .
" he clearly tells us what he wants to see .
he 's a straight talker ; he corrects you and urges you on . "
raised voices on the practice ground from time to time are not a problem , says van bommel .
" it 's criticism to help you improve .
it 's well-intentioned , to stop it happening again . "
the dutchman 's first league game in charge is against last season 's dark horses hoffenheim who led the league on their debut bundesliga season at christmas before falling off the pace. nda / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the sometimes abrasive former bayern munich , who coached the bavarian giants to a double “ double ” of league and cup successes in his brief tenure , had offers from a number of top flight clubs after being sacked in february 2007 , but chose a struggling , mediocre team which had flirted with relegation for the previous two seasons .
the rest is history .
wolfsburg picked up their first league crown in may after magath had spent wisely and cannily in the transfer market and cast the wolves in his disciplined image .
wolfsburg , hardly a fashionable unit and usually mid- to lower table fodder for the big guns , were champions , hardly put a foot wrong last season as the side felix built swept the league .
bildunterschrift : magath 's arrival at schalke has taken expectations at the club even higher than usual maybe the 56-year-old magath did n't really believe that his new charges could win the league and he was as surprised as everyone else .
why else would he have agreed to leave the club before the season was even over , with his name penciled in as the new coach of schalke 04 for the 2009/10 season , before wolfsburg had shown what they were really capable of ?
but sign for schalke he did .
one wonders if a man of fewer scruples would have reneged on the agreement in the light of wolfsburg 's impressive season and stayed on to defend the title ?
felix magath may be a lot of things but he is not a deal breaker and as such will lead perennial bundesliga bridesmaids schalke this season and not the reigning champions of wolfsburg .
the royal blues spent most of last season in disarray and magath 's first job has to be to build some team spirit and plug gaps in their defense before their first league game against newly-promoted nuremburg on saturday .
after building a championship winning side out of wolfsburg , expectations are high – even by schalke 's standards .
a club which regularly promises much and more often than not delivers little -lrb- or at best waits until the final minute to choke and break the hearts of its fans -rrb- , schalke is desperate for success and magath comes with a record which suggests he could be the man to turn around their eternally disappointing fortunes .
armin veh : following in felix 's footsteps bildunterschrift : veh has quite an act to follow as he leads wolfsburg into a title defense and the champions league while magath attempts to awaken not so much a sleeping giant as a comatose one , armin veh takes over at wolfsburg with an equally challenging mission laid at his door .
with the wolves defending their first crown and with champions league soccer coming to the home of volkswagen this season , the former stuttgart coach has a high set of standards to maintain .
not only that but the fans have come to expect an attacking style of play rarely seen in wolfsburg .
veh comes to wolfsburg with championship credentials after leading stuttgart to the 2007 title .
but his team buckled during their defense the following season , sinking to the lower reaches of the league before rallying to a sixth-placed finish .
veh was sacked in november 2008 when stuttgart 's results suggested another season of mediocrity beckoned .
veh 's first game in charge is against his former club in the season 's opening game .
the new wolfsburg manager can count himself lucky that he has managed to keep hold of key strikers edwin dzeko and brazilian grafite despite interest from some of europe 's top clubs this summer .
between them , the pair netted 54 league goals , but it remains to be seen if the team can repeat their surprise success or handle the step up to the champions league where they will make their debut .
" the team is very motivated .
my initial impressions from the first training camp have absolutely been confirmed , " veh said , whose attacking options have been further boosted by the arrival of nigerian striker obafemi martins from newcastle .
" we are looking forward to the season and showing what we can do . "
direct dutchman talking tough in bayern bildunterschrift : van gaal will have to draw on his experience at europe 's top clubs to deal with bayern 's demands challenging both of these men is another manager taking the reins of a new club .
bayern munich , who sacked ex-germany coach juergen klinsmann in april , saw out last season under the considered eye caretaker coach jupp heynckes .
but it will be dutchman louis van gaal who takes on the highest-profile job in german league soccer this season .
the former barcelona , ajax and holland coach arrives in germany after leading unfancied az alkmaar to the dutch title last season .
he may have to dig into his experience at the bigger clubs on his cv to cope with the expectation which comes with managing bayern , where domestic honors are demanded and champions league success is expected .
the 57-year-old van gaal has inherited an embarrassment of riches in attack with bayern 's squad containing germany strikers mario gomez and miroslav klose , as well as italian world cup winner luca toni and croatia 's ivica olic .
promising youngster thomas mueller makes it five forwards pushing for two places in van gaal 's starting line-up and the straight-taking coach is expected to stamp his mark on the side .
bayern captain mark van bommel said the players are responding to his direct approach .
" he clearly tells us what he wants to see .
he 's a straight talker ; he corrects you and urges you on . "
raised voices on the practice ground from time to time are not a problem , says van bommel .
" it 's criticism to help you improve .
it 's well-intentioned , to stop it happening again . "
the dutchman 's first league game in charge is against last season 's dark horses hoffenheim who led the league on their debut bundesliga season at christmas before falling off the pace. nda / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but farmers are up in arms over demands to pay back up to 500 million euros . the european commission ruled in january that subsidies worth around 338 million euros -lrb- $ 486.4 million -rrb- paid between 1992 and 2002 by the french government to support its fruit and vegetable sector had violated european farm and state aid policy .
the eu executive has said the subsidies gave french farmers an unfair advantage over their european competitors .
the commission has ruled that french growers now owe a total sum of about 500 million euros , including interest charges .
farmers angry about pay back demands the announcement has been met with widespread anger and disbelief in orchards and vegetable markets across france .
the eu decision comes at a time when farmers in europe 's largest farm economy have already been protesting against a recession-linked drop in demand and sliding incomes .
" we just do n't understand it .
these recent weeks , we 've been telling the government how bad things are for us .
and the first answer we get is this - that we have to pay back money we received 10 even 15 years ago , " salvatore esorordu , a fruit grower from the southern region of gard , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : producer prices for fruit and vegetables are plummeting " it 's a provocation .
prices are at their worst level in 20 years , " he added .
producer prices for fruit and vegetables fell 3.1 percent in june , putting them down 17.6 percent year-on-year , according to latest data from french statistics office insee .
the french fruit and vegetable sector , the third-largest in europe , also says it faces growing cheap competition from fellow eu countries that have lower labor costs .
france to negotiate hefty sum france has disputed the hefty sum the eu wants to claw back from fruit and vegetable farmers .
but if the government fails to refund the money , it would be liable to pay a heavy fine .
typically , such fines are open-ended , calculated on the basis of the time it takes the government to act .
if it does n't comply , the fine goes on increasing .
farm minister bruno le maire said this week that france would accept the eu demand for recouping some of the subsidies , but emphasized that he would negotiate with the eu over the total sum .
he also said he wanted the recovery of subsidies to be done gradually and on a case-by-case basis so as to avoid forcing vulnerable farmers to pay back .
" we want the reimbursements to be spread over time .
it would put an unbearable strain on farmers if they 're forced to pay this money back immediately , " le maire said .
" unfair and immoral " this is not the first time france has been forced to ask farmers to pay back subsidies .
but in the past , french farmers received generous aid directly from the european commission .
this time , any recovery of subsidies will go back into the french budget , not eu coffers .
that 's why the french government has more of an incentive to recoup the cash .
but french farmers are unlikely to accept the demands without a fight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josé bové has urged french farmers to fight the eu demands to pay back subsidies josé bové , a french member of the european parliament and former president of the peasants confederation farmers ' union , has urged civil disobedience .

" if the government sends them letters telling them to do so , i encourage them to refuse and disobey because it 's unfair and immoral . "

he also said he wanted the recovery of subsidies to be done gradually and on a case-by-case basis so as to avoid forcing vulnerable farmers to pay back .
" we want the reimbursements to be spread over time .
it would put an unbearable strain on farmers if they 're forced to pay this money back immediately , " le maire said .
" unfair and immoral " this is not the first time france has been forced to ask farmers to pay back subsidies .
but in the past , french farmers received generous aid directly from the european commission .
this time , any recovery of subsidies will go back into the french budget , not eu coffers .
that 's why the french government has more of an incentive to recoup the cash .
but french farmers are unlikely to accept the demands without a fight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josé bové has urged french farmers to fight the eu demands to pay back subsidies josé bové , a french member of the european parliament and former president of the peasants confederation farmers ' union , has urged civil disobedience .
" the farmers must not reimburse this money , " bové said .
" if the government sends them letters telling them to do so , i encourage them to refuse and disobey because it 's unfair and immoral . "

the new iranian president has reacted in his inauguration speech by vowing that iran would continue to resist " oppressive powers . "
" we heard that some of the western leaders had decided to recognize but not congratulate the new government .
well , no one in iran is waiting for your messages . "
" iranians will neither value your scowling and bullying nor smiles and greetings , " he said in his speech on wednesday after taking the oath of office in parliament at the start of his second term as president .
ahmadinejad now has two weeks to present a new cabinet .

around 100 opposition supporters went on trial over the weekend .
the iranian government insists the presidential election was fair and transparent and has accused western nations of being complicit in the bloody post-election unrest .
criticism of sweden over attending the inauguration within the european union , there had been strong criticism of sweden 's plans to send its ambassador to attend the ceremony to represent the current eu council presidency .
german politician elmar brok , who is also the foreign policy spokesman for the conservatives in the european parliament , warned the eu should be more consistent in its criticism of tehran .
" over the past weeks , the eu has continuously demanded a recount of the vote and new elections .
we also have strongly condemned the arrests and the violence against the demonstrators , " he said .
" we can not now legitimize ahmadinejad 's re-election by attending the ceremony . "
eckhard von klaeden , the foreign policy spokesman for merkel 's cdu , said sweden should have followed the example of most other eu countries by not sending their ambassador .
" europe should stand united in its criticism of the rigged elections and the suppression of the opposition movement , " he said .
germany did not send its ambassador to the inauguration but only a lower-ranked diplomatic official. ai / dpa / ap / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the video carried the slogan " don ’ t go to the polls " and was a copy of a us video campaign that ran ahead of the 2008 elections .
in the american version , a host of a-listers advise viewers not to bother to go and vote , complaining that politicians are all the same and asking why anyone should care what happens to health care , education or the environment .
the video was , of course , ironic and the same stars then told the public that the only way to make a difference on issues that mattered to them , was to vote .
a year later and politik-digital.de , headed by stefan gehrke , has produced a similar video using german celebrities and employing the same tactic .
but in the german version the clip ends with the celebrities still telling people not to vote .
provoking the public this change was a deliberate attempt by gehrke to provoke the public .
" we wanted to provoke , because we know there have been a lot of campaigns against voter apathy in recent years that have n't worked .
that ’ s why we thought we would take the risk that some people might not get the irony . we had the anchor man of the german news show , ' tagesschau ‘ and he is normally very conservative just reading the news .
he says in the video , ' you may not believe me , me but i don ’ t vote .
i think , if you think for just one second , you get that it would never be possible that this guy wouldn ’ t vote or would tell the people not to vote , " says gehrke .
a week later the company released a second video , which , like the us version , shows the stars abandoning all irony and telling the public to get out and vote .
replying to accusations that the campaign may have backfired and that the original irony was lost on the german public , gehrke says he is happy for the media attention this has brought to the problem he is actually trying to tackle , which is voter apathy .

and although the decline has been marginal – dropping from 79 percent in 1994 to 77.7 percent in 2005 – it is reason enough for the german institute for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- to want to play an active role in getting german voters back to the polling booths .
with just over fifty days to go before election day , more than 80 german celebrities and sports stars have taken part in a bpb advertising campaign that hopes to inspire people to go out and vote .
as of wednesday morning the ads are freely available to all radio stations .
" we don ’ t care who you vote for , just as long as you vote ! "
thomas krueger , president of the bpb , is running the radio ad campaign .
the production of the ads is part of a service , says krueger , to help radio stations find a way to reach the public that is not simply through the official party campaigns .

it 's that you vote in the first place , " krueger says .

krüger also applauds gehrke ’ s efforts towards the same end , although , he says , you have to be careful to send the message in the right packaging .
" i have a lot of time for irony , but you do have to account for the fact that the german public is different to the us public .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 05.08.2009 german celebrities go on air to persuade people to vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " get out and vote " is the message from german celebrities german elections are less than two months away and , as the parties step up their campaigns , celebrities have been roped in to get the message across to the general public that voting is important . a few weeks ago an independent internet advertisement , produced by politik-digital.de , appeared , in which german celebrities , including two well-known news anchors , seemed to be telling people not to vote .
the video carried the slogan " don ’ t go to the polls " and was a copy of a us video campaign that ran ahead of the 2008 elections .
in the american version , a host of a-listers advise viewers not to bother to go and vote , complaining that politicians are all the same and asking why anyone should care what happens to health care , education or the environment .
the video was , of course , ironic and the same stars then told the public that the only way to make a difference on issues that mattered to them , was to vote .
a year later and politik-digital.de , headed by stefan gehrke , has produced a similar video using german celebrities and employing the same tactic .
but in the german version the clip ends with the celebrities still telling people not to vote .
provoking the public this change was a deliberate attempt by gehrke to provoke the public .
" we wanted to provoke , because we know there have been a lot of campaigns against voter apathy in recent years that have n't worked .
that ’ s why we thought we would take the risk that some people might not get the irony . we had the anchor man of the german news show , ' tagesschau ‘ and he is normally very conservative just reading the news .
he says in the video , ' you may not believe me , me but i don ’ t vote .
i think , if you think for just one second , you get that it would never be possible that this guy wouldn ’ t vote or would tell the people not to vote , " says gehrke .
a week later the company released a second video , which , like the us version , shows the stars abandoning all irony and telling the public to get out and vote .
replying to accusations that the campaign may have backfired and that the original irony was lost on the german public , gehrke says he is happy for the media attention this has brought to the problem he is actually trying to tackle , which is voter apathy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this way to vote " - the hope is that more voters will heed the call in 2009 since an all-time high in 1976 when 90 percent of the population cast their votes , voter turnout in germany has been decreasing .
and although the decline has been marginal – dropping from 79 percent in 1994 to 77.7 percent in 2005 – it is reason enough for the german institute for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- to want to play an active role in getting german voters back to the polling booths .
with just over fifty days to go before election day , more than 80 german celebrities and sports stars have taken part in a bpb advertising campaign that hopes to inspire people to go out and vote .
as of wednesday morning the ads are freely available to all radio stations .
" we don ’ t care who you vote for , just as long as you vote ! "
thomas krueger , president of the bpb , is running the radio ad campaign .
the production of the ads is part of a service , says krueger , to help radio stations find a way to reach the public that is not simply through the official party campaigns .
" it 's not about who you vote for , or which party you choose .
it 's that you vote in the first place , " krueger says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy is like sport .
if you do n't use it you lose it soccer players philipp lahm of bayern munich and per mertesacker of werder bremen , as well as boxing champion wladimir klitschko , are some of the sports stars taking part in the campaign , which all the celebrities have signed up for free of charge .
" we want to send out a message that federal elections are more than just an obligatory event that are more or less frustrating .
they are our constitutional right and a chance for us to decide which direction germany will take over the next four years . " says krueger .
" democracy is like sport " " if you don ’ t practise , you lose the hang of it , " wladimir klitschko says of democracy .
classical violin virtuoso , anne-sophie mutter asks voters to imagine their neighbor deciding every day what concert – rock , pop or classical - they should listen to .

this year , three experienced managers take on new teams all capable of winning the league . when felix magath rolled up at wolfsburg before last season , more than a few eyebrows were raised .
the sometimes abrasive former bayern munich , who coached the bavarian giants to a double “ double ” of league and cup successes in his brief tenure , had offers from a number of top flight clubs after being sacked in february 2007 , but chose a struggling , mediocre team which had flirted with relegation for the previous two seasons .
the rest is history .
wolfsburg picked up their first league crown in may after magath had spent wisely and cannily in the transfer market and cast the wolves in his disciplined image .
wolfsburg , hardly a fashionable unit and usually mid- to lower table fodder for the big guns , were champions , hardly put a foot wrong last season as the side felix built swept the league .
bildunterschrift : magath 's arrival at schalke has taken expectations at the club even higher than usual maybe the 56-year-old magath did n't really believe that his new charges could win the league and he was as surprised as everyone else .
why else would he have agreed to leave the club before the season was even over , with his name penciled in as the new coach of schalke 04 for the 2009/10 season , before wolfsburg had shown what they were really capable of ?
but sign for schalke he did .
one wonders if a man of fewer scruples would have reneged on the agreement in the light of wolfsburg 's impressive season and stayed on to defend the title ?
felix magath may be a lot of things but he is not a deal breaker and as such will lead perennial bundesliga bridesmaids schalke this season and not the reigning champions of wolfsburg .
the royal blues spent most of last season in disarray and magath 's first job has to be to build some team spirit and plug gaps in their defense before their first league game against newly-promoted nuremburg on saturday .
after building a championship winning side out of wolfsburg , expectations are high – even by schalke 's standards .
a club which regularly promises much and more often than not delivers little -lrb- or at best waits until the final minute to choke and break the hearts of its fans -rrb- , schalke is desperate for success and magath comes with a record which suggests he could be the man to turn around their eternally disappointing fortunes .
armin veh : following in felix 's footsteps bildunterschrift : veh has quite an act to follow as he leads wolfsburg into a title defense and the champions league while magath attempts to awaken not so much a sleeping giant as a comatose one , armin veh takes over at wolfsburg with an equally challenging mission laid at his door .
with the wolves defending their first crown and with champions league soccer coming to the home of volkswagen this season , the former stuttgart coach has a high set of standards to maintain .
not only that but the fans have come to expect an attacking style of play rarely seen in wolfsburg .
veh comes to wolfsburg with championship credentials after leading stuttgart to the 2007 title .
but his team buckled during their defense the following season , sinking to the lower reaches of the league before rallying to a sixth-placed finish .
veh was sacked in november 2008 when stuttgart 's results suggested another season of mediocrity beckoned .
veh 's first game in charge is against his former club in the season 's opening game .
the new wolfsburg manager can count himself lucky that he has managed to keep hold of key strikers edwin dzeko and brazilian grafite despite interest from some of europe 's top clubs this summer .
between them , the pair netted 54 league goals , but it remains to be seen if the team can repeat their surprise success or handle the step up to the champions league where they will make their debut .
" the team is very motivated .
my initial impressions from the first training camp have absolutely been confirmed , " veh said , whose attacking options have been further boosted by the arrival of nigerian striker obafemi martins from newcastle .

direct dutchman talking tough in bayern bildunterschrift : van gaal will have to draw on his experience at europe 's top clubs to deal with bayern 's demands challenging both of these men is another manager taking the reins of a new club .
bayern munich , who sacked ex-germany coach juergen klinsmann in april , saw out last season under the considered eye caretaker coach jupp heynckes .
but it will be dutchman louis van gaal who takes on the highest-profile job in german league soccer this season .
the former barcelona , ajax and holland coach arrives in germany after leading unfancied az alkmaar to the dutch title last season .
he may have to dig into his experience at the bigger clubs on his cv to cope with the expectation which comes with managing bayern , where domestic honors are demanded and champions league success is expected .
the 57-year-old van gaal has inherited an embarrassment of riches in attack with bayern 's squad containing germany strikers mario gomez and miroslav klose , as well as italian world cup winner luca toni and croatia 's ivica olic .
promising youngster thomas mueller makes it five forwards pushing for two places in van gaal 's starting line-up and the straight-taking coach is expected to stamp his mark on the side .
bayern captain mark van bommel said the players are responding to his direct approach .
" he clearly tells us what he wants to see .
he 's a straight talker ; he corrects you and urges you on . "

manfred guellner , the head of the forsa institute , said that the dip in support for the spd was partly caused by a scandal involving health minister ulla schmidt who took her official car on holiday , prompting a public outcry .
" the affair stirred up all the reservations about the spd that were already there : incompetence and distance from the people , " said guellner .
frank-walter steinmeier , the spd 's chancellor candidate and current german foreign minister , has struggled to make dents in merkel 's popularity despite unveiling a campaign team including several new faces and making a contentious pledge to bring full employment to europe 's largest economy by 2020 .
however , in germany 's complex system of coalition politics , voters choose parties , not individuals , and elections do not boil down to a straight race between the two main parties .
end in sight for grand coalition ?

this would , in theory , give merkel the necessary majority to form her desired coalition after the september 27 election , albeit with a slim 51 percent .
the green party rose by one point to 13 percent and the far-left left party also gained in support , rising to 11 percent .

ultimately neither real madrid , barcelona or manchester united were prepared to meet the ever-rising price tag set by the bavarian club where the french international is contracted until 2011 .
the man fans once hailed as " kaiser franck , " now known as " the bavarian diva " by german media , is looking far from imperial with ribery 's commitment to bayern becoming increasingly tarnished during a summer of speculation .
outspoken bayern munich president franz beckenbauer blasted ribery , for , in his view , being more interested in his own career than the club and suggested that the player could still be sold - for 94 million euros -lrb- $ 135 million -rrb- .
" of course we would expect the market price , and if cristiano ronaldo is worth 94 million , then ribery is worth a comparable sum .
but if no offer is forthcoming he must fulfill the terms of his contract until 2011 , " he told sport bild newspaper .
commentators were not entirely convinced by a statement from bayern management which said : " bayern have at no time had and do not have the impression from franck ribery that he would only use bayern in order to further his own career .
he has always given himself and his abilities to the service of the team . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shorts say bayern , the expression says anywhere but here as another season in germany looms , ribery 's attitude continues to make headlines .
when the team assembled for the official pre-season photo session , observers noted the frenchman was unsmiling and distant .
he is due to miss the start of the season through injury and may spend his recuperation time wishing he was at a different stadium - namely the bernabeu in madrid , hob-nobbing with ronaldo , kaka and karim benzema as real madrid chairman florentino perez proudly showed off his multi-million euro signings in the spanish sun .
bayern , overtaken last season by wolfsburg at the top of the league , will be hoping they can hang onto ribery to provide ammunition for mario gomez .
bayern paid 30 million euros to obtain the striker from stuttgart , as they try and win back the coveted bundesliga title .
auf wiedersehen bayern bayern will be without brazilian stalwarts lucio and ze roberto who quit bavaria for inter milan and hamburg respectively in the close season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio expected more respect from new coach van gaal lucio , the veteran central defender , left bayern with a parting shot at new dutch manager louis van gaal who he accused of showing " a lack of respect . "
" i am a world champion -lrb- in the 2002 winning brazil team -rrb- as well as winning the confederations cup twice and was chosen best defender in the bundesliga , ” lucio said as he completed a reported eight million-euro move to the italian champions .
" surely i did not need to show him further proof of my abilities ? "
passing the brazilians on the way out is danijel pranjic , the croatian midfielder who joins bayern from heerenveen and dutch left-back edson braafheid from fc twente .
old boys come home stuttgart , anxious to replace gomez in attack , finally agreed with barcelona the return of their one-time player alexander hleb who spent an unhappy year at camp nou after his transfer from arsenal in 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hleb had a successful mid-decade spell with stuttgart the belarus international opted against a move to inter milan in favor of a move on loan back to the german club where he played from 2000-2005 .
another old boy returning home is international midfielder tim borowski who will again turn out in the colors of german cup holders werder bremen after a spell loan at bayern .
one of the best bits of business in the close season trading frenzy actually did n't involve any exchange of money or player .
bundesliga champions wolfsburg pulled off a coup by managing to hang on to the league 's player of the year , 23-year-old bosnian playmaker edzin dzeko who had been tempted by ac milan .
wolves add martins and algerian whiz-kid wolfsburg also managed to tempt newcastle 's ex-inter milan striker obafemi martins to the bundesliga for a reported 8.5 million euros after the 24-year-old nigerian spent a frustrating five years on tyneside .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obafemi martins brings his skills to the german champs new wolves coach armin veh also added the speedy 26-year-old algeria international karim ziani to the champions ' midfield , paying marseille five million euros for his services .
ziani " fits well in the team and will help us get to our target next season , " veh said .
meanwhile , ex-wolfsburg manager felix magath will welcome talented youngster lewis holtby from aachen after off-loading last year 's expensive dutch midfield flop orlando engelaar onto psv eindhoven .
challengers spend wisely northern challengers hamburg are hoping to shore up their defense with the signature of czech defender david rozenhal from lazio .
" hamburg is a big club with great infrastructure and conditions .
the level at the bundesliga is extremely high and it is always my aim to play high level football , " rozenhal told the club 's web site .
german media have reported the transfer fee at around five million euros .
last season 's surprise package hoffenheim have splashed more of their owner 's cash by signing argentine teenage midfielder franco zuculini for 4.7 million euros from racing club avellaneda and croatian defender josip simunic from hertha berlin for seven million , while picking up ghanaian forward prince tagoe on a free transfer from saudi club al-ittifaq .
presumably looking for a club with a less comical name , argentine goal-scoring sensation lucas barrios has opted to spend this season at the more soberly named borussia dortmund after transferring from colo colo for 4.5 million euros .
the 24-year-old striker hit the net a record 37 times in the 2008 season for the chilean champions and replaces veteran swiss national skipper alexander frei who has departed for basel in his native country for 4.2 million euros. nda / dpa / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ultimately neither real madrid , barcelona or manchester united were prepared to meet the ever-rising price tag set by the bavarian club where the french international is contracted until 2011 .
the man fans once hailed as " kaiser franck , " now known as " the bavarian diva " by german media , is looking far from imperial with ribery 's commitment to bayern becoming increasingly tarnished during a summer of speculation .
outspoken bayern munich president franz beckenbauer blasted ribery , for , in his view , being more interested in his own career than the club and suggested that the player could still be sold - for 94 million euros -lrb- $ 135 million -rrb- .
" of course we would expect the market price , and if cristiano ronaldo is worth 94 million , then ribery is worth a comparable sum .
but if no offer is forthcoming he must fulfill the terms of his contract until 2011 , " he told sport bild newspaper .
commentators were not entirely convinced by a statement from bayern management which said : " bayern have at no time had and do not have the impression from franck ribery that he would only use bayern in order to further his own career .
he has always given himself and his abilities to the service of the team . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shorts say bayern , the expression says anywhere but here as another season in germany looms , ribery 's attitude continues to make headlines .
when the team assembled for the official pre-season photo session , observers noted the frenchman was unsmiling and distant .
he is due to miss the start of the season through injury and may spend his recuperation time wishing he was at a different stadium - namely the bernabeu in madrid , hob-nobbing with ronaldo , kaka and karim benzema as real madrid chairman florentino perez proudly showed off his multi-million euro signings in the spanish sun .
bayern , overtaken last season by wolfsburg at the top of the league , will be hoping they can hang onto ribery to provide ammunition for mario gomez .
bayern paid 30 million euros to obtain the striker from stuttgart , as they try and win back the coveted bundesliga title .
auf wiedersehen bayern bayern will be without brazilian stalwarts lucio and ze roberto who quit bavaria for inter milan and hamburg respectively in the close season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio expected more respect from new coach van gaal lucio , the veteran central defender , left bayern with a parting shot at new dutch manager louis van gaal who he accused of showing " a lack of respect . "
" i am a world champion -lrb- in the 2002 winning brazil team -rrb- as well as winning the confederations cup twice and was chosen best defender in the bundesliga , ” lucio said as he completed a reported eight million-euro move to the italian champions .
" surely i did not need to show him further proof of my abilities ? "
passing the brazilians on the way out is danijel pranjic , the croatian midfielder who joins bayern from heerenveen and dutch left-back edson braafheid from fc twente .
old boys come home stuttgart , anxious to replace gomez in attack , finally agreed with barcelona the return of their one-time player alexander hleb who spent an unhappy year at camp nou after his transfer from arsenal in 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hleb had a successful mid-decade spell with stuttgart the belarus international opted against a move to inter milan in favor of a move on loan back to the german club where he played from 2000-2005 .
another old boy returning home is international midfielder tim borowski who will again turn out in the colors of german cup holders werder bremen after a spell loan at bayern .
one of the best bits of business in the close season trading frenzy actually did n't involve any exchange of money or player .
bundesliga champions wolfsburg pulled off a coup by managing to hang on to the league 's player of the year , 23-year-old bosnian playmaker edzin dzeko who had been tempted by ac milan .
wolves add martins and algerian whiz-kid wolfsburg also managed to tempt newcastle 's ex-inter milan striker obafemi martins to the bundesliga for a reported 8.5 million euros after the 24-year-old nigerian spent a frustrating five years on tyneside .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obafemi martins brings his skills to the german champs new wolves coach armin veh also added the speedy 26-year-old algeria international karim ziani to the champions ' midfield , paying marseille five million euros for his services .
ziani " fits well in the team and will help us get to our target next season , " veh said .
meanwhile , ex-wolfsburg manager felix magath will welcome talented youngster lewis holtby from aachen after off-loading last year 's expensive dutch midfield flop orlando engelaar onto psv eindhoven .
challengers spend wisely northern challengers hamburg are hoping to shore up their defense with the signature of czech defender david rozenhal from lazio .
" hamburg is a big club with great infrastructure and conditions .
the level at the bundesliga is extremely high and it is always my aim to play high level football , " rozenhal told the club 's web site .
german media have reported the transfer fee at around five million euros .
last season 's surprise package hoffenheim have splashed more of their owner 's cash by signing argentine teenage midfielder franco zuculini for 4.7 million euros from racing club avellaneda and croatian defender josip simunic from hertha berlin for seven million , while picking up ghanaian forward prince tagoe on a free transfer from saudi club al-ittifaq .
presumably looking for a club with a less comical name , argentine goal-scoring sensation lucas barrios has opted to spend this season at the more soberly named borussia dortmund after transferring from colo colo for 4.5 million euros .
the 24-year-old striker hit the net a record 37 times in the 2008 season for the chilean champions and replaces veteran swiss national skipper alexander frei who has departed for basel in his native country for 4.2 million euros. nda / dpa / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the visit comes as taliban-led violence escalates ahead of the august 20 elections . on his maiden visit to afghanistan , anders fogh rasmussen repeated a pledge he made on his first working day in his job as nato secretary general : to make afghanistan his highest priority . " afghanistan is the first country i 'm visiting in my new capacity as secretary general of nato , " he said at a joint press conference with afghan president hamid karzai in kabul on wednesday . " i give very high priority to afghanistan ; actually it will be my highest priority as secretary general , " rasmussen added . he vowed that troops from the western military alliance would do their utmost to provide " the best possible security " for the august 20 presidential election . " i assure you , the afghan people , that we will stay to support you for as long as it takes to finish our job , " he said in a bid to reassure afghans in the run-up to the polls . first-hand appraisal over 64,000 of some 100,000 international troops deployed from 42 countries are serving in the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan .
nato troops operate alongside a us-led coalition . nato officials say their aim is to help stabilize a country suffering from three decades of war , resurgent islamists , poverty and corruption . rasmussen aims to assess first-hand the fight against an escalating taliban-led insurgency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai and 40 other candidates are in the race to lead the war-torn nation during the visit , which comes just two weeks ahead of nationwide elections , rasmussen was also due to hold talks with some of the other candidates for the presidency . although karzai leads a field of some 40 people standing for the top job , he has been widely criticized for avoiding the public campaign trail and deciding instead to carve out alliances with powerful but often corrupt political kingmakers . appeal to the taliban at wednesday 's press conference , karzai called on the taliban and hezbi islami , an associate group of the taliban , to renounce violence and participate in the elections . " we will request the taliban to have the afghan national interest in their hearts and minds and come and participate in the elections and , through voting , bring stability for afghanistan , " karzai said . " after elections , if i win , my first priority will be solidifying and speeding the peace process with the taliban and hezbi islami , and all other groups who are not part of al-qaeda or other terrorist networks , " he added . the worsening security and high casualties on the side of international troops have forced several nato and non-nato countries to call for talks with taliban militants , who , despite the ouster of their regime some eight years ago , are still a force to be reckoned with . rasmussen ’ s comments reflected that view .
" i am ready to take pragmatic steps that can include the security for our troops and even talks with a number of groups within the afghan society , " he said . however , he was at pains to clarify that a prerequisite for such an engagement was that the groups “ put down their weapons and abide by the laws in this country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and afghan forces have been working together to recapture areas held by taliban militants securing taliban strongholds with campaigning for the presidential and provincial council elections in full swing , nato forces are pressing ahead with operations designed to secure taliban strongholds in a last bid to allow voting to take place in restive areas . " our troops will do their utmost to ensure the best possible security around the elections , " rasmussen said , adding : " it is an opportunity for the afghan people to demonstrate that you do not bow to threats and violence of the enemies of afghanistan . " the election is afghanistan 's only second-ever democratic poll after the extremist taliban regime was ousted back in 2001 . the taliban , who ruled afghanistan between 1996 and 2001 , have managed to orchestrate an insurgency that has escalated to record levels .
the intensification is putting a huge strain on us and nato-led forces that have grown to number more than 100,000 . there are concerns that violence will overshadow the elections , deter afghans from going out to vote , and undermine the credibility of a poll that is being seen as a test of an internationally-funded drive to install democracy . bundeswehr troops in isaf bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 3,500 troops stationed in northern afghanistan as part of the isaf mission last month , officials in berlin confirmed that germany 's military , the bundeswehr , was engaged in its largest-ever offensive against the taliban .
this was in response to increased taliban attacks in the north of the country , where most of germany ’ s 3,700 troops are stationed . the latest deployment involved some 300 members of the bundeswehr 's quick reaction force and , for the first time , included armored units fighting with close air support . german defence minister franz josef jung justified the offensive , saying : " we are now being particularly challenged in kunduz . "
however , jung insisted on calling the operation a " stabilization deployment ” ahead of the elections . not an exit strategy the former danish prime minister took charge of the 28-nation nato on monday , pledging to make afghanistan his top priority and prevent the war-torn country from once again becoming a hub of international terrorism . rasmussen , who has a four-year mandate , said the long-term goal was to " move forward concretely and visibly with transferring lead security responsibility in afghanistan to the afghans . " " i believe , during my term , afghans must take over lead responsibility for security in most of their country , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community has spent a huge amount of resources to train afghanistan 's army and police however , he rejected any suggestion that such a strategy amounted to a cut and run strategy as pure propaganda .

nato must and will be there in support .
let no taliban propaganda try to sell my message as a run for -lrb- the -rrb- exit .

nato troops operate alongside a us-led coalition . nato officials say their aim is to help stabilize a country suffering from three decades of war , resurgent islamists , poverty and corruption . rasmussen aims to assess first-hand the fight against an escalating taliban-led insurgency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai and 40 other candidates are in the race to lead the war-torn nation during the visit , which comes just two weeks ahead of nationwide elections , rasmussen was also due to hold talks with some of the other candidates for the presidency . although karzai leads a field of some 40 people standing for the top job , he has been widely criticized for avoiding the public campaign trail and deciding instead to carve out alliances with powerful but often corrupt political kingmakers . appeal to the taliban at wednesday 's press conference , karzai called on the taliban and hezbi islami , an associate group of the taliban , to renounce violence and participate in the elections . " we will request the taliban to have the afghan national interest in their hearts and minds and come and participate in the elections and , through voting , bring stability for afghanistan , " karzai said . " after elections , if i win , my first priority will be solidifying and speeding the peace process with the taliban and hezbi islami , and all other groups who are not part of al-qaeda or other terrorist networks , " he added . the worsening security and high casualties on the side of international troops have forced several nato and non-nato countries to call for talks with taliban militants , who , despite the ouster of their regime some eight years ago , are still a force to be reckoned with . rasmussen ’ s comments reflected that view .
" i am ready to take pragmatic steps that can include the security for our troops and even talks with a number of groups within the afghan society , " he said . however , he was at pains to clarify that a prerequisite for such an engagement was that the groups “ put down their weapons and abide by the laws in this country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and afghan forces have been working together to recapture areas held by taliban militants securing taliban strongholds with campaigning for the presidential and provincial council elections in full swing , nato forces are pressing ahead with operations designed to secure taliban strongholds in a last bid to allow voting to take place in restive areas . " our troops will do their utmost to ensure the best possible security around the elections , " rasmussen said , adding : " it is an opportunity for the afghan people to demonstrate that you do not bow to threats and violence of the enemies of afghanistan . " the election is afghanistan 's only second-ever democratic poll after the extremist taliban regime was ousted back in 2001 . the taliban , who ruled afghanistan between 1996 and 2001 , have managed to orchestrate an insurgency that has escalated to record levels .
the intensification is putting a huge strain on us and nato-led forces that have grown to number more than 100,000 . there are concerns that violence will overshadow the elections , deter afghans from going out to vote , and undermine the credibility of a poll that is being seen as a test of an internationally-funded drive to install democracy . bundeswehr troops in isaf bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 3,500 troops stationed in northern afghanistan as part of the isaf mission last month , officials in berlin confirmed that germany 's military , the bundeswehr , was engaged in its largest-ever offensive against the taliban .
this was in response to increased taliban attacks in the north of the country , where most of germany ’ s 3,700 troops are stationed . the latest deployment involved some 300 members of the bundeswehr 's quick reaction force and , for the first time , included armored units fighting with close air support . german defence minister franz josef jung justified the offensive , saying : " we are now being particularly challenged in kunduz . "
however , jung insisted on calling the operation a " stabilization deployment ” ahead of the elections . not an exit strategy the former danish prime minister took charge of the 28-nation nato on monday , pledging to make afghanistan his top priority and prevent the war-torn country from once again becoming a hub of international terrorism . rasmussen , who has a four-year mandate , said the long-term goal was to " move forward concretely and visibly with transferring lead security responsibility in afghanistan to the afghans . " " i believe , during my term , afghans must take over lead responsibility for security in most of their country , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community has spent a huge amount of resources to train afghanistan 's army and police however , he rejected any suggestion that such a strategy amounted to a cut and run strategy as pure propaganda . " let me be clear .
nato must and will be there in support .
let no taliban propaganda try to sell my message as a run for -lrb- the -rrb- exit .
it is not , " he said . while rasmussen ’ s comments were aimed at reassuring afghans , his visit has come at an awkward time , with residents in the southern province of kandahar saying that a nato bomb attack had killed four civilians , including three children . afghan people have become increasingly vocal about their anger over the growing number of civilian casualties as a result of operations by nato and the us-led coalition . rb / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the visit comes as taliban-led violence escalates ahead of the august 20 elections . on his maiden visit to afghanistan , anders fogh rasmussen repeated a pledge he made on his first working day in his job as nato secretary general : to make afghanistan his highest priority . " afghanistan is the first country i 'm visiting in my new capacity as secretary general of nato , " he said at a joint press conference with afghan president hamid karzai in kabul on wednesday . " i give very high priority to afghanistan ; actually it will be my highest priority as secretary general , " rasmussen added . he vowed that troops from the western military alliance would do their utmost to provide " the best possible security " for the august 20 presidential election . " i assure you , the afghan people , that we will stay to support you for as long as it takes to finish our job , " he said in a bid to reassure afghans in the run-up to the polls . first-hand appraisal over 64,000 of some 100,000 international troops deployed from 42 countries are serving in the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan .
nato troops operate alongside a us-led coalition . nato officials say their aim is to help stabilize a country suffering from three decades of war , resurgent islamists , poverty and corruption . rasmussen aims to assess first-hand the fight against an escalating taliban-led insurgency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai and 40 other candidates are in the race to lead the war-torn nation during the visit , which comes just two weeks ahead of nationwide elections , rasmussen was also due to hold talks with some of the other candidates for the presidency . although karzai leads a field of some 40 people standing for the top job , he has been widely criticized for avoiding the public campaign trail and deciding instead to carve out alliances with powerful but often corrupt political kingmakers . appeal to the taliban at wednesday 's press conference , karzai called on the taliban and hezbi islami , an associate group of the taliban , to renounce violence and participate in the elections . " we will request the taliban to have the afghan national interest in their hearts and minds and come and participate in the elections and , through voting , bring stability for afghanistan , " karzai said . " after elections , if i win , my first priority will be solidifying and speeding the peace process with the taliban and hezbi islami , and all other groups who are not part of al-qaeda or other terrorist networks , " he added . the worsening security and high casualties on the side of international troops have forced several nato and non-nato countries to call for talks with taliban militants , who , despite the ouster of their regime some eight years ago , are still a force to be reckoned with . rasmussen ’ s comments reflected that view .
" i am ready to take pragmatic steps that can include the security for our troops and even talks with a number of groups within the afghan society , " he said . however , he was at pains to clarify that a prerequisite for such an engagement was that the groups “ put down their weapons and abide by the laws in this country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and afghan forces have been working together to recapture areas held by taliban militants securing taliban strongholds with campaigning for the presidential and provincial council elections in full swing , nato forces are pressing ahead with operations designed to secure taliban strongholds in a last bid to allow voting to take place in restive areas . " our troops will do their utmost to ensure the best possible security around the elections , " rasmussen said , adding : " it is an opportunity for the afghan people to demonstrate that you do not bow to threats and violence of the enemies of afghanistan . " the election is afghanistan 's only second-ever democratic poll after the extremist taliban regime was ousted back in 2001 . the taliban , who ruled afghanistan between 1996 and 2001 , have managed to orchestrate an insurgency that has escalated to record levels .
the intensification is putting a huge strain on us and nato-led forces that have grown to number more than 100,000 . there are concerns that violence will overshadow the elections , deter afghans from going out to vote , and undermine the credibility of a poll that is being seen as a test of an internationally-funded drive to install democracy . bundeswehr troops in isaf bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 3,500 troops stationed in northern afghanistan as part of the isaf mission last month , officials in berlin confirmed that germany 's military , the bundeswehr , was engaged in its largest-ever offensive against the taliban .
this was in response to increased taliban attacks in the north of the country , where most of germany ’ s 3,700 troops are stationed . the latest deployment involved some 300 members of the bundeswehr 's quick reaction force and , for the first time , included armored units fighting with close air support . german defence minister franz josef jung justified the offensive , saying : " we are now being particularly challenged in kunduz . "
however , jung insisted on calling the operation a " stabilization deployment ” ahead of the elections . not an exit strategy the former danish prime minister took charge of the 28-nation nato on monday , pledging to make afghanistan his top priority and prevent the war-torn country from once again becoming a hub of international terrorism . rasmussen , who has a four-year mandate , said the long-term goal was to " move forward concretely and visibly with transferring lead security responsibility in afghanistan to the afghans . " " i believe , during my term , afghans must take over lead responsibility for security in most of their country , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community has spent a huge amount of resources to train afghanistan 's army and police however , he rejected any suggestion that such a strategy amounted to a cut and run strategy as pure propaganda . " let me be clear .
nato must and will be there in support .
let no taliban propaganda try to sell my message as a run for -lrb- the -rrb- exit .
it is not , " he said . while rasmussen ’ s comments were aimed at reassuring afghans , his visit has come at an awkward time , with residents in the southern province of kandahar saying that a nato bomb attack had killed four civilians , including three children . afghan people have become increasingly vocal about their anger over the growing number of civilian casualties as a result of operations by nato and the us-led coalition . rb / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the visit comes as taliban-led violence escalates ahead of the august 20 elections . on his maiden visit to afghanistan , anders fogh rasmussen repeated a pledge he made on his first working day in his job as nato secretary general : to make afghanistan his highest priority . " afghanistan is the first country i 'm visiting in my new capacity as secretary general of nato , " he said at a joint press conference with afghan president hamid karzai in kabul on wednesday . " i give very high priority to afghanistan ; actually it will be my highest priority as secretary general , " rasmussen added . he vowed that troops from the western military alliance would do their utmost to provide " the best possible security " for the august 20 presidential election . " i assure you , the afghan people , that we will stay to support you for as long as it takes to finish our job , " he said in a bid to reassure afghans in the run-up to the polls . first-hand appraisal over 64,000 of some 100,000 international troops deployed from 42 countries are serving in the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan .
nato troops operate alongside a us-led coalition . nato officials say their aim is to help stabilize a country suffering from three decades of war , resurgent islamists , poverty and corruption . rasmussen aims to assess first-hand the fight against an escalating taliban-led insurgency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai and 40 other candidates are in the race to lead the war-torn nation during the visit , which comes just two weeks ahead of nationwide elections , rasmussen was also due to hold talks with some of the other candidates for the presidency . although karzai leads a field of some 40 people standing for the top job , he has been widely criticized for avoiding the public campaign trail and deciding instead to carve out alliances with powerful but often corrupt political kingmakers . appeal to the taliban at wednesday 's press conference , karzai called on the taliban and hezbi islami , an associate group of the taliban , to renounce violence and participate in the elections . " we will request the taliban to have the afghan national interest in their hearts and minds and come and participate in the elections and , through voting , bring stability for afghanistan , " karzai said . " after elections , if i win , my first priority will be solidifying and speeding the peace process with the taliban and hezbi islami , and all other groups who are not part of al-qaeda or other terrorist networks , " he added . the worsening security and high casualties on the side of international troops have forced several nato and non-nato countries to call for talks with taliban militants , who , despite the ouster of their regime some eight years ago , are still a force to be reckoned with . rasmussen ’ s comments reflected that view .
" i am ready to take pragmatic steps that can include the security for our troops and even talks with a number of groups within the afghan society , " he said . however , he was at pains to clarify that a prerequisite for such an engagement was that the groups “ put down their weapons and abide by the laws in this country .

" our troops will do their utmost to ensure the best possible security around the elections , " rasmussen said , adding : " it is an opportunity for the afghan people to demonstrate that you do not bow to threats and violence of the enemies of afghanistan . " the election is afghanistan 's only second-ever democratic poll after the extremist taliban regime was ousted back in 2001 . the taliban , who ruled afghanistan between 1996 and 2001 , have managed to orchestrate an insurgency that has escalated to record levels .
the intensification is putting a huge strain on us and nato-led forces that have grown to number more than 100,000 . there are concerns that violence will overshadow the elections , deter afghans from going out to vote , and undermine the credibility of a poll that is being seen as a test of an internationally-funded drive to install democracy . bundeswehr troops in isaf bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 3,500 troops stationed in northern afghanistan as part of the isaf mission last month , officials in berlin confirmed that germany 's military , the bundeswehr , was engaged in its largest-ever offensive against the taliban .
this was in response to increased taliban attacks in the north of the country , where most of germany ’ s 3,700 troops are stationed . the latest deployment involved some 300 members of the bundeswehr 's quick reaction force and , for the first time , included armored units fighting with close air support . german defence minister franz josef jung justified the offensive , saying : " we are now being particularly challenged in kunduz . "
however , jung insisted on calling the operation a " stabilization deployment ” ahead of the elections . not an exit strategy the former danish prime minister took charge of the 28-nation nato on monday , pledging to make afghanistan his top priority and prevent the war-torn country from once again becoming a hub of international terrorism . rasmussen , who has a four-year mandate , said the long-term goal was to " move forward concretely and visibly with transferring lead security responsibility in afghanistan to the afghans . " " i believe , during my term , afghans must take over lead responsibility for security in most of their country , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community has spent a huge amount of resources to train afghanistan 's army and police however , he rejected any suggestion that such a strategy amounted to a cut and run strategy as pure propaganda .

nato must and will be there in support .
let no taliban propaganda try to sell my message as a run for -lrb- the -rrb- exit .
it is not , " he said . while rasmussen ’ s comments were aimed at reassuring afghans , his visit has come at an awkward time , with residents in the southern province of kandahar saying that a nato bomb attack had killed four civilians , including three children . afghan people have become increasingly vocal about their anger over the growing number of civilian casualties as a result of operations by nato and the us-led coalition . rb / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.08.2009 old heads at new clubs hope to take teams to bundesliga title glory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg will defend their title under a new coach the bundesliga coach carousel is often as enthralling as the player swaps which take place every summer .
this year , three experienced managers take on new teams all capable of winning the league . when felix magath rolled up at wolfsburg before last season , more than a few eyebrows were raised .
the sometimes abrasive former bayern munich , who coached the bavarian giants to a double “ double ” of league and cup successes in his brief tenure , had offers from a number of top flight clubs after being sacked in february 2007 , but chose a struggling , mediocre team which had flirted with relegation for the previous two seasons .
the rest is history .
wolfsburg picked up their first league crown in may after magath had spent wisely and cannily in the transfer market and cast the wolves in his disciplined image .
wolfsburg , hardly a fashionable unit and usually mid- to lower table fodder for the big guns , were champions , hardly put a foot wrong last season as the side felix built swept the league .
bildunterschrift : magath 's arrival at schalke has taken expectations at the club even higher than usual maybe the 56-year-old magath did n't really believe that his new charges could win the league and he was as surprised as everyone else .
why else would he have agreed to leave the club before the season was even over , with his name penciled in as the new coach of schalke 04 for the 2009/10 season , before wolfsburg had shown what they were really capable of ?
but sign for schalke he did .
one wonders if a man of fewer scruples would have reneged on the agreement in the light of wolfsburg 's impressive season and stayed on to defend the title ?
felix magath may be a lot of things but he is not a deal breaker and as such will lead perennial bundesliga bridesmaids schalke this season and not the reigning champions of wolfsburg .
the royal blues spent most of last season in disarray and magath 's first job has to be to build some team spirit and plug gaps in their defense before their first league game against newly-promoted nuremburg on saturday .
after building a championship winning side out of wolfsburg , expectations are high – even by schalke 's standards .
a club which regularly promises much and more often than not delivers little -lrb- or at best waits until the final minute to choke and break the hearts of its fans -rrb- , schalke is desperate for success and magath comes with a record which suggests he could be the man to turn around their eternally disappointing fortunes .
armin veh : following in felix 's footsteps bildunterschrift : veh has quite an act to follow as he leads wolfsburg into a title defense and the champions league while magath attempts to awaken not so much a sleeping giant as a comatose one , armin veh takes over at wolfsburg with an equally challenging mission laid at his door .
with the wolves defending their first crown and with champions league soccer coming to the home of volkswagen this season , the former stuttgart coach has a high set of standards to maintain .
not only that but the fans have come to expect an attacking style of play rarely seen in wolfsburg .
veh comes to wolfsburg with championship credentials after leading stuttgart to the 2007 title .
but his team buckled during their defense the following season , sinking to the lower reaches of the league before rallying to a sixth-placed finish .
veh was sacked in november 2008 when stuttgart 's results suggested another season of mediocrity beckoned .
veh 's first game in charge is against his former club in the season 's opening game .
the new wolfsburg manager can count himself lucky that he has managed to keep hold of key strikers edwin dzeko and brazilian grafite despite interest from some of europe 's top clubs this summer .
between them , the pair netted 54 league goals , but it remains to be seen if the team can repeat their surprise success or handle the step up to the champions league where they will make their debut .
" the team is very motivated .
my initial impressions from the first training camp have absolutely been confirmed , " veh said , whose attacking options have been further boosted by the arrival of nigerian striker obafemi martins from newcastle .
" we are looking forward to the season and showing what we can do . "
direct dutchman talking tough in bayern bildunterschrift : van gaal will have to draw on his experience at europe 's top clubs to deal with bayern 's demands challenging both of these men is another manager taking the reins of a new club .
bayern munich , who sacked ex-germany coach juergen klinsmann in april , saw out last season under the considered eye caretaker coach jupp heynckes .
but it will be dutchman louis van gaal who takes on the highest-profile job in german league soccer this season .
the former barcelona , ajax and holland coach arrives in germany after leading unfancied az alkmaar to the dutch title last season .
he may have to dig into his experience at the bigger clubs on his cv to cope with the expectation which comes with managing bayern , where domestic honors are demanded and champions league success is expected .
the 57-year-old van gaal has inherited an embarrassment of riches in attack with bayern 's squad containing germany strikers mario gomez and miroslav klose , as well as italian world cup winner luca toni and croatia 's ivica olic .
promising youngster thomas mueller makes it five forwards pushing for two places in van gaal 's starting line-up and the straight-taking coach is expected to stamp his mark on the side .
bayern captain mark van bommel said the players are responding to his direct approach .
" he clearly tells us what he wants to see .
he 's a straight talker ; he corrects you and urges you on . "
raised voices on the practice ground from time to time are not a problem , says van bommel .
" it 's criticism to help you improve .
it 's well-intentioned , to stop it happening again . "
the dutchman 's first league game in charge is against last season 's dark horses hoffenheim who led the league on their debut bundesliga season at christmas before falling off the pace. nda / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ultimately neither real madrid , barcelona or manchester united were prepared to meet the ever-rising price tag set by the bavarian club where the french international is contracted until 2011 .
the man fans once hailed as " kaiser franck , " now known as " the bavarian diva " by german media , is looking far from imperial with ribery 's commitment to bayern becoming increasingly tarnished during a summer of speculation .
outspoken bayern munich president franz beckenbauer blasted ribery , for , in his view , being more interested in his own career than the club and suggested that the player could still be sold - for 94 million euros -lrb- $ 135 million -rrb- .
" of course we would expect the market price , and if cristiano ronaldo is worth 94 million , then ribery is worth a comparable sum .
but if no offer is forthcoming he must fulfill the terms of his contract until 2011 , " he told sport bild newspaper .
commentators were not entirely convinced by a statement from bayern management which said : " bayern have at no time had and do not have the impression from franck ribery that he would only use bayern in order to further his own career .
he has always given himself and his abilities to the service of the team . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shorts say bayern , the expression says anywhere but here as another season in germany looms , ribery 's attitude continues to make headlines .
when the team assembled for the official pre-season photo session , observers noted the frenchman was unsmiling and distant .
he is due to miss the start of the season through injury and may spend his recuperation time wishing he was at a different stadium - namely the bernabeu in madrid , hob-nobbing with ronaldo , kaka and karim benzema as real madrid chairman florentino perez proudly showed off his multi-million euro signings in the spanish sun .
bayern , overtaken last season by wolfsburg at the top of the league , will be hoping they can hang onto ribery to provide ammunition for mario gomez .
bayern paid 30 million euros to obtain the striker from stuttgart , as they try and win back the coveted bundesliga title .
auf wiedersehen bayern bayern will be without brazilian stalwarts lucio and ze roberto who quit bavaria for inter milan and hamburg respectively in the close season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio expected more respect from new coach van gaal lucio , the veteran central defender , left bayern with a parting shot at new dutch manager louis van gaal who he accused of showing " a lack of respect . "
" i am a world champion -lrb- in the 2002 winning brazil team -rrb- as well as winning the confederations cup twice and was chosen best defender in the bundesliga , ” lucio said as he completed a reported eight million-euro move to the italian champions .
" surely i did not need to show him further proof of my abilities ? "
passing the brazilians on the way out is danijel pranjic , the croatian midfielder who joins bayern from heerenveen and dutch left-back edson braafheid from fc twente .
old boys come home stuttgart , anxious to replace gomez in attack , finally agreed with barcelona the return of their one-time player alexander hleb who spent an unhappy year at camp nou after his transfer from arsenal in 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hleb had a successful mid-decade spell with stuttgart the belarus international opted against a move to inter milan in favor of a move on loan back to the german club where he played from 2000-2005 .
another old boy returning home is international midfielder tim borowski who will again turn out in the colors of german cup holders werder bremen after a spell loan at bayern .
one of the best bits of business in the close season trading frenzy actually did n't involve any exchange of money or player .
bundesliga champions wolfsburg pulled off a coup by managing to hang on to the league 's player of the year , 23-year-old bosnian playmaker edzin dzeko who had been tempted by ac milan .
wolves add martins and algerian whiz-kid wolfsburg also managed to tempt newcastle 's ex-inter milan striker obafemi martins to the bundesliga for a reported 8.5 million euros after the 24-year-old nigerian spent a frustrating five years on tyneside .

ziani " fits well in the team and will help us get to our target next season , " veh said .

ultimately neither real madrid , barcelona or manchester united were prepared to meet the ever-rising price tag set by the bavarian club where the french international is contracted until 2011 .
the man fans once hailed as " kaiser franck , " now known as " the bavarian diva " by german media , is looking far from imperial with ribery 's commitment to bayern becoming increasingly tarnished during a summer of speculation .
outspoken bayern munich president franz beckenbauer blasted ribery , for , in his view , being more interested in his own career than the club and suggested that the player could still be sold - for 94 million euros -lrb- $ 135 million -rrb- .
" of course we would expect the market price , and if cristiano ronaldo is worth 94 million , then ribery is worth a comparable sum .
but if no offer is forthcoming he must fulfill the terms of his contract until 2011 , " he told sport bild newspaper .
commentators were not entirely convinced by a statement from bayern management which said : " bayern have at no time had and do not have the impression from franck ribery that he would only use bayern in order to further his own career .
he has always given himself and his abilities to the service of the team . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shorts say bayern , the expression says anywhere but here as another season in germany looms , ribery 's attitude continues to make headlines .
when the team assembled for the official pre-season photo session , observers noted the frenchman was unsmiling and distant .
he is due to miss the start of the season through injury and may spend his recuperation time wishing he was at a different stadium - namely the bernabeu in madrid , hob-nobbing with ronaldo , kaka and karim benzema as real madrid chairman florentino perez proudly showed off his multi-million euro signings in the spanish sun .
bayern , overtaken last season by wolfsburg at the top of the league , will be hoping they can hang onto ribery to provide ammunition for mario gomez .
bayern paid 30 million euros to obtain the striker from stuttgart , as they try and win back the coveted bundesliga title .
auf wiedersehen bayern bayern will be without brazilian stalwarts lucio and ze roberto who quit bavaria for inter milan and hamburg respectively in the close season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio expected more respect from new coach van gaal lucio , the veteran central defender , left bayern with a parting shot at new dutch manager louis van gaal who he accused of showing " a lack of respect . "
" i am a world champion -lrb- in the 2002 winning brazil team -rrb- as well as winning the confederations cup twice and was chosen best defender in the bundesliga , ” lucio said as he completed a reported eight million-euro move to the italian champions .
" surely i did not need to show him further proof of my abilities ? "
passing the brazilians on the way out is danijel pranjic , the croatian midfielder who joins bayern from heerenveen and dutch left-back edson braafheid from fc twente .
old boys come home stuttgart , anxious to replace gomez in attack , finally agreed with barcelona the return of their one-time player alexander hleb who spent an unhappy year at camp nou after his transfer from arsenal in 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hleb had a successful mid-decade spell with stuttgart the belarus international opted against a move to inter milan in favor of a move on loan back to the german club where he played from 2000-2005 .
another old boy returning home is international midfielder tim borowski who will again turn out in the colors of german cup holders werder bremen after a spell loan at bayern .
one of the best bits of business in the close season trading frenzy actually did n't involve any exchange of money or player .
bundesliga champions wolfsburg pulled off a coup by managing to hang on to the league 's player of the year , 23-year-old bosnian playmaker edzin dzeko who had been tempted by ac milan .

this year , three experienced managers take on new teams all capable of winning the league . when felix magath rolled up at wolfsburg before last season , more than a few eyebrows were raised .
the sometimes abrasive former bayern munich , who coached the bavarian giants to a double “ double ” of league and cup successes in his brief tenure , had offers from a number of top flight clubs after being sacked in february 2007 , but chose a struggling , mediocre team which had flirted with relegation for the previous two seasons .
the rest is history .
wolfsburg picked up their first league crown in may after magath had spent wisely and cannily in the transfer market and cast the wolves in his disciplined image .
wolfsburg , hardly a fashionable unit and usually mid- to lower table fodder for the big guns , were champions , hardly put a foot wrong last season as the side felix built swept the league .
bildunterschrift : magath 's arrival at schalke has taken expectations at the club even higher than usual maybe the 56-year-old magath did n't really believe that his new charges could win the league and he was as surprised as everyone else .
why else would he have agreed to leave the club before the season was even over , with his name penciled in as the new coach of schalke 04 for the 2009/10 season , before wolfsburg had shown what they were really capable of ?
but sign for schalke he did .
one wonders if a man of fewer scruples would have reneged on the agreement in the light of wolfsburg 's impressive season and stayed on to defend the title ?
felix magath may be a lot of things but he is not a deal breaker and as such will lead perennial bundesliga bridesmaids schalke this season and not the reigning champions of wolfsburg .
the royal blues spent most of last season in disarray and magath 's first job has to be to build some team spirit and plug gaps in their defense before their first league game against newly-promoted nuremburg on saturday .
after building a championship winning side out of wolfsburg , expectations are high – even by schalke 's standards .
a club which regularly promises much and more often than not delivers little -lrb- or at best waits until the final minute to choke and break the hearts of its fans -rrb- , schalke is desperate for success and magath comes with a record which suggests he could be the man to turn around their eternally disappointing fortunes .
armin veh : following in felix 's footsteps bildunterschrift : veh has quite an act to follow as he leads wolfsburg into a title defense and the champions league while magath attempts to awaken not so much a sleeping giant as a comatose one , armin veh takes over at wolfsburg with an equally challenging mission laid at his door .
with the wolves defending their first crown and with champions league soccer coming to the home of volkswagen this season , the former stuttgart coach has a high set of standards to maintain .
not only that but the fans have come to expect an attacking style of play rarely seen in wolfsburg .
veh comes to wolfsburg with championship credentials after leading stuttgart to the 2007 title .
but his team buckled during their defense the following season , sinking to the lower reaches of the league before rallying to a sixth-placed finish .
veh was sacked in november 2008 when stuttgart 's results suggested another season of mediocrity beckoned .
veh 's first game in charge is against his former club in the season 's opening game .
the new wolfsburg manager can count himself lucky that he has managed to keep hold of key strikers edwin dzeko and brazilian grafite despite interest from some of europe 's top clubs this summer .
between them , the pair netted 54 league goals , but it remains to be seen if the team can repeat their surprise success or handle the step up to the champions league where they will make their debut .
" the team is very motivated .
my initial impressions from the first training camp have absolutely been confirmed , " veh said , whose attacking options have been further boosted by the arrival of nigerian striker obafemi martins from newcastle .
" we are looking forward to the season and showing what we can do . "
direct dutchman talking tough in bayern bildunterschrift : van gaal will have to draw on his experience at europe 's top clubs to deal with bayern 's demands challenging both of these men is another manager taking the reins of a new club .
bayern munich , who sacked ex-germany coach juergen klinsmann in april , saw out last season under the considered eye caretaker coach jupp heynckes .
but it will be dutchman louis van gaal who takes on the highest-profile job in german league soccer this season .
the former barcelona , ajax and holland coach arrives in germany after leading unfancied az alkmaar to the dutch title last season .
he may have to dig into his experience at the bigger clubs on his cv to cope with the expectation which comes with managing bayern , where domestic honors are demanded and champions league success is expected .
the 57-year-old van gaal has inherited an embarrassment of riches in attack with bayern 's squad containing germany strikers mario gomez and miroslav klose , as well as italian world cup winner luca toni and croatia 's ivica olic .
promising youngster thomas mueller makes it five forwards pushing for two places in van gaal 's starting line-up and the straight-taking coach is expected to stamp his mark on the side .
bayern captain mark van bommel said the players are responding to his direct approach .
" he clearly tells us what he wants to see .
he 's a straight talker ; he corrects you and urges you on . "
raised voices on the practice ground from time to time are not a problem , says van bommel .
" it 's criticism to help you improve .
it 's well-intentioned , to stop it happening again . "

this year , three experienced managers take on new teams all capable of winning the league . when felix magath rolled up at wolfsburg before last season , more than a few eyebrows were raised .
the sometimes abrasive former bayern munich , who coached the bavarian giants to a double “ double ” of league and cup successes in his brief tenure , had offers from a number of top flight clubs after being sacked in february 2007 , but chose a struggling , mediocre team which had flirted with relegation for the previous two seasons .
the rest is history .
wolfsburg picked up their first league crown in may after magath had spent wisely and cannily in the transfer market and cast the wolves in his disciplined image .
wolfsburg , hardly a fashionable unit and usually mid- to lower table fodder for the big guns , were champions , hardly put a foot wrong last season as the side felix built swept the league .
bildunterschrift : magath 's arrival at schalke has taken expectations at the club even higher than usual maybe the 56-year-old magath did n't really believe that his new charges could win the league and he was as surprised as everyone else .
why else would he have agreed to leave the club before the season was even over , with his name penciled in as the new coach of schalke 04 for the 2009/10 season , before wolfsburg had shown what they were really capable of ?
but sign for schalke he did .
one wonders if a man of fewer scruples would have reneged on the agreement in the light of wolfsburg 's impressive season and stayed on to defend the title ?
felix magath may be a lot of things but he is not a deal breaker and as such will lead perennial bundesliga bridesmaids schalke this season and not the reigning champions of wolfsburg .
the royal blues spent most of last season in disarray and magath 's first job has to be to build some team spirit and plug gaps in their defense before their first league game against newly-promoted nuremburg on saturday .
after building a championship winning side out of wolfsburg , expectations are high – even by schalke 's standards .
a club which regularly promises much and more often than not delivers little -lrb- or at best waits until the final minute to choke and break the hearts of its fans -rrb- , schalke is desperate for success and magath comes with a record which suggests he could be the man to turn around their eternally disappointing fortunes .
armin veh : following in felix 's footsteps bildunterschrift : veh has quite an act to follow as he leads wolfsburg into a title defense and the champions league while magath attempts to awaken not so much a sleeping giant as a comatose one , armin veh takes over at wolfsburg with an equally challenging mission laid at his door .
with the wolves defending their first crown and with champions league soccer coming to the home of volkswagen this season , the former stuttgart coach has a high set of standards to maintain .
not only that but the fans have come to expect an attacking style of play rarely seen in wolfsburg .
veh comes to wolfsburg with championship credentials after leading stuttgart to the 2007 title .
but his team buckled during their defense the following season , sinking to the lower reaches of the league before rallying to a sixth-placed finish .
veh was sacked in november 2008 when stuttgart 's results suggested another season of mediocrity beckoned .
veh 's first game in charge is against his former club in the season 's opening game .
the new wolfsburg manager can count himself lucky that he has managed to keep hold of key strikers edwin dzeko and brazilian grafite despite interest from some of europe 's top clubs this summer .
between them , the pair netted 54 league goals , but it remains to be seen if the team can repeat their surprise success or handle the step up to the champions league where they will make their debut .
" the team is very motivated .
my initial impressions from the first training camp have absolutely been confirmed , " veh said , whose attacking options have been further boosted by the arrival of nigerian striker obafemi martins from newcastle .
" we are looking forward to the season and showing what we can do . "
direct dutchman talking tough in bayern bildunterschrift : van gaal will have to draw on his experience at europe 's top clubs to deal with bayern 's demands challenging both of these men is another manager taking the reins of a new club .
bayern munich , who sacked ex-germany coach juergen klinsmann in april , saw out last season under the considered eye caretaker coach jupp heynckes .
but it will be dutchman louis van gaal who takes on the highest-profile job in german league soccer this season .
the former barcelona , ajax and holland coach arrives in germany after leading unfancied az alkmaar to the dutch title last season .
he may have to dig into his experience at the bigger clubs on his cv to cope with the expectation which comes with managing bayern , where domestic honors are demanded and champions league success is expected .
the 57-year-old van gaal has inherited an embarrassment of riches in attack with bayern 's squad containing germany strikers mario gomez and miroslav klose , as well as italian world cup winner luca toni and croatia 's ivica olic .
promising youngster thomas mueller makes it five forwards pushing for two places in van gaal 's starting line-up and the straight-taking coach is expected to stamp his mark on the side .
bayern captain mark van bommel said the players are responding to his direct approach .
" he clearly tells us what he wants to see .
he 's a straight talker ; he corrects you and urges you on . "
raised voices on the practice ground from time to time are not a problem , says van bommel .
" it 's criticism to help you improve .
it 's well-intentioned , to stop it happening again . "
the dutchman 's first league game in charge is against last season 's dark horses hoffenheim who led the league on their debut bundesliga season at christmas before falling off the pace. nda / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ultimately neither real madrid , barcelona or manchester united were prepared to meet the ever-rising price tag set by the bavarian club where the french international is contracted until 2011 .
the man fans once hailed as " kaiser franck , " now known as " the bavarian diva " by german media , is looking far from imperial with ribery 's commitment to bayern becoming increasingly tarnished during a summer of speculation .
outspoken bayern munich president franz beckenbauer blasted ribery , for , in his view , being more interested in his own career than the club and suggested that the player could still be sold - for 94 million euros -lrb- $ 135 million -rrb- .
" of course we would expect the market price , and if cristiano ronaldo is worth 94 million , then ribery is worth a comparable sum .
but if no offer is forthcoming he must fulfill the terms of his contract until 2011 , " he told sport bild newspaper .
commentators were not entirely convinced by a statement from bayern management which said : " bayern have at no time had and do not have the impression from franck ribery that he would only use bayern in order to further his own career .
he has always given himself and his abilities to the service of the team . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shorts say bayern , the expression says anywhere but here as another season in germany looms , ribery 's attitude continues to make headlines .
when the team assembled for the official pre-season photo session , observers noted the frenchman was unsmiling and distant .
he is due to miss the start of the season through injury and may spend his recuperation time wishing he was at a different stadium - namely the bernabeu in madrid , hob-nobbing with ronaldo , kaka and karim benzema as real madrid chairman florentino perez proudly showed off his multi-million euro signings in the spanish sun .
bayern , overtaken last season by wolfsburg at the top of the league , will be hoping they can hang onto ribery to provide ammunition for mario gomez .
bayern paid 30 million euros to obtain the striker from stuttgart , as they try and win back the coveted bundesliga title .
auf wiedersehen bayern bayern will be without brazilian stalwarts lucio and ze roberto who quit bavaria for inter milan and hamburg respectively in the close season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio expected more respect from new coach van gaal lucio , the veteran central defender , left bayern with a parting shot at new dutch manager louis van gaal who he accused of showing " a lack of respect . "
" i am a world champion -lrb- in the 2002 winning brazil team -rrb- as well as winning the confederations cup twice and was chosen best defender in the bundesliga , ” lucio said as he completed a reported eight million-euro move to the italian champions .
" surely i did not need to show him further proof of my abilities ? "
passing the brazilians on the way out is danijel pranjic , the croatian midfielder who joins bayern from heerenveen and dutch left-back edson braafheid from fc twente .
old boys come home stuttgart , anxious to replace gomez in attack , finally agreed with barcelona the return of their one-time player alexander hleb who spent an unhappy year at camp nou after his transfer from arsenal in 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hleb had a successful mid-decade spell with stuttgart the belarus international opted against a move to inter milan in favor of a move on loan back to the german club where he played from 2000-2005 .
another old boy returning home is international midfielder tim borowski who will again turn out in the colors of german cup holders werder bremen after a spell loan at bayern .
one of the best bits of business in the close season trading frenzy actually did n't involve any exchange of money or player .
bundesliga champions wolfsburg pulled off a coup by managing to hang on to the league 's player of the year , 23-year-old bosnian playmaker edzin dzeko who had been tempted by ac milan .
wolves add martins and algerian whiz-kid wolfsburg also managed to tempt newcastle 's ex-inter milan striker obafemi martins to the bundesliga for a reported 8.5 million euros after the 24-year-old nigerian spent a frustrating five years on tyneside .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obafemi martins brings his skills to the german champs new wolves coach armin veh also added the speedy 26-year-old algeria international karim ziani to the champions ' midfield , paying marseille five million euros for his services .
ziani " fits well in the team and will help us get to our target next season , " veh said .
meanwhile , ex-wolfsburg manager felix magath will welcome talented youngster lewis holtby from aachen after off-loading last year 's expensive dutch midfield flop orlando engelaar onto psv eindhoven .
challengers spend wisely northern challengers hamburg are hoping to shore up their defense with the signature of czech defender david rozenhal from lazio .
" hamburg is a big club with great infrastructure and conditions .
the level at the bundesliga is extremely high and it is always my aim to play high level football , " rozenhal told the club 's web site .
german media have reported the transfer fee at around five million euros .
last season 's surprise package hoffenheim have splashed more of their owner 's cash by signing argentine teenage midfielder franco zuculini for 4.7 million euros from racing club avellaneda and croatian defender josip simunic from hertha berlin for seven million , while picking up ghanaian forward prince tagoe on a free transfer from saudi club al-ittifaq .
presumably looking for a club with a less comical name , argentine goal-scoring sensation lucas barrios has opted to spend this season at the more soberly named borussia dortmund after transferring from colo colo for 4.5 million euros .

he has always given himself and his abilities to the service of the team . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shorts say bayern , the expression says anywhere but here as another season in germany looms , ribery 's attitude continues to make headlines .
when the team assembled for the official pre-season photo session , observers noted the frenchman was unsmiling and distant .
he is due to miss the start of the season through injury and may spend his recuperation time wishing he was at a different stadium - namely the bernabeu in madrid , hob-nobbing with ronaldo , kaka and karim benzema as real madrid chairman florentino perez proudly showed off his multi-million euro signings in the spanish sun .
bayern , overtaken last season by wolfsburg at the top of the league , will be hoping they can hang onto ribery to provide ammunition for mario gomez .
bayern paid 30 million euros to obtain the striker from stuttgart , as they try and win back the coveted bundesliga title .
auf wiedersehen bayern bayern will be without brazilian stalwarts lucio and ze roberto who quit bavaria for inter milan and hamburg respectively in the close season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio expected more respect from new coach van gaal lucio , the veteran central defender , left bayern with a parting shot at new dutch manager louis van gaal who he accused of showing " a lack of respect . "
" i am a world champion -lrb- in the 2002 winning brazil team -rrb- as well as winning the confederations cup twice and was chosen best defender in the bundesliga , ” lucio said as he completed a reported eight million-euro move to the italian champions .
" surely i did not need to show him further proof of my abilities ? "
passing the brazilians on the way out is danijel pranjic , the croatian midfielder who joins bayern from heerenveen and dutch left-back edson braafheid from fc twente .
old boys come home stuttgart , anxious to replace gomez in attack , finally agreed with barcelona the return of their one-time player alexander hleb who spent an unhappy year at camp nou after his transfer from arsenal in 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hleb had a successful mid-decade spell with stuttgart the belarus international opted against a move to inter milan in favor of a move on loan back to the german club where he played from 2000-2005 .
another old boy returning home is international midfielder tim borowski who will again turn out in the colors of german cup holders werder bremen after a spell loan at bayern .
one of the best bits of business in the close season trading frenzy actually did n't involve any exchange of money or player .
bundesliga champions wolfsburg pulled off a coup by managing to hang on to the league 's player of the year , 23-year-old bosnian playmaker edzin dzeko who had been tempted by ac milan .
wolves add martins and algerian whiz-kid wolfsburg also managed to tempt newcastle 's ex-inter milan striker obafemi martins to the bundesliga for a reported 8.5 million euros after the 24-year-old nigerian spent a frustrating five years on tyneside .

ziani " fits well in the team and will help us get to our target next season , " veh said .
meanwhile , ex-wolfsburg manager felix magath will welcome talented youngster lewis holtby from aachen after off-loading last year 's expensive dutch midfield flop orlando engelaar onto psv eindhoven .

" hamburg is a big club with great infrastructure and conditions .

german media have reported the transfer fee at around five million euros .

ultimately neither real madrid , barcelona or manchester united were prepared to meet the ever-rising price tag set by the bavarian club where the french international is contracted until 2011 .
the man fans once hailed as " kaiser franck , " now known as " the bavarian diva " by german media , is looking far from imperial with ribery 's commitment to bayern becoming increasingly tarnished during a summer of speculation .
outspoken bayern munich president franz beckenbauer blasted ribery , for , in his view , being more interested in his own career than the club and suggested that the player could still be sold - for 94 million euros -lrb- $ 135 million -rrb- .
" of course we would expect the market price , and if cristiano ronaldo is worth 94 million , then ribery is worth a comparable sum .
but if no offer is forthcoming he must fulfill the terms of his contract until 2011 , " he told sport bild newspaper .
commentators were not entirely convinced by a statement from bayern management which said : " bayern have at no time had and do not have the impression from franck ribery that he would only use bayern in order to further his own career .

wolfsburg picked up their first league crown in may after magath had spent wisely and cannily in the transfer market and cast the wolves in his disciplined image .
wolfsburg , hardly a fashionable unit and usually mid- to lower table fodder for the big guns , were champions , hardly put a foot wrong last season as the side felix built swept the league .
bildunterschrift : magath 's arrival at schalke has taken expectations at the club even higher than usual maybe the 56-year-old magath did n't really believe that his new charges could win the league and he was as surprised as everyone else .
why else would he have agreed to leave the club before the season was even over , with his name penciled in as the new coach of schalke 04 for the 2009/10 season , before wolfsburg had shown what they were really capable of ?
but sign for schalke he did .
one wonders if a man of fewer scruples would have reneged on the agreement in the light of wolfsburg 's impressive season and stayed on to defend the title ?
felix magath may be a lot of things but he is not a deal breaker and as such will lead perennial bundesliga bridesmaids schalke this season and not the reigning champions of wolfsburg .

he may have to dig into his experience at the bigger clubs on his cv to cope with the expectation which comes with managing bayern , where domestic honors are demanded and champions league success is expected .
the 57-year-old van gaal has inherited an embarrassment of riches in attack with bayern 's squad containing germany strikers mario gomez and miroslav klose , as well as italian world cup winner luca toni and croatia 's ivica olic .
promising youngster thomas mueller makes it five forwards pushing for two places in van gaal 's starting line-up and the straight-taking coach is expected to stamp his mark on the side .
bayern captain mark van bommel said the players are responding to his direct approach .
" he clearly tells us what he wants to see .
he 's a straight talker ; he corrects you and urges you on . "
raised voices on the practice ground from time to time are not a problem , says van bommel .
" it 's criticism to help you improve .

this year , three experienced managers take on new teams all capable of winning the league . when felix magath rolled up at wolfsburg before last season , more than a few eyebrows were raised .
the sometimes abrasive former bayern munich , who coached the bavarian giants to a double “ double ” of league and cup successes in his brief tenure , had offers from a number of top flight clubs after being sacked in february 2007 , but chose a struggling , mediocre team which had flirted with relegation for the previous two seasons .
the rest is history .
wolfsburg picked up their first league crown in may after magath had spent wisely and cannily in the transfer market and cast the wolves in his disciplined image .
wolfsburg , hardly a fashionable unit and usually mid- to lower table fodder for the big guns , were champions , hardly put a foot wrong last season as the side felix built swept the league .
bildunterschrift : magath 's arrival at schalke has taken expectations at the club even higher than usual maybe the 56-year-old magath did n't really believe that his new charges could win the league and he was as surprised as everyone else .
why else would he have agreed to leave the club before the season was even over , with his name penciled in as the new coach of schalke 04 for the 2009/10 season , before wolfsburg had shown what they were really capable of ?
but sign for schalke he did .
one wonders if a man of fewer scruples would have reneged on the agreement in the light of wolfsburg 's impressive season and stayed on to defend the title ?
felix magath may be a lot of things but he is not a deal breaker and as such will lead perennial bundesliga bridesmaids schalke this season and not the reigning champions of wolfsburg .
the royal blues spent most of last season in disarray and magath 's first job has to be to build some team spirit and plug gaps in their defense before their first league game against newly-promoted nuremburg on saturday .
after building a championship winning side out of wolfsburg , expectations are high – even by schalke 's standards .
a club which regularly promises much and more often than not delivers little -lrb- or at best waits until the final minute to choke and break the hearts of its fans -rrb- , schalke is desperate for success and magath comes with a record which suggests he could be the man to turn around their eternally disappointing fortunes .
armin veh : following in felix 's footsteps bildunterschrift : veh has quite an act to follow as he leads wolfsburg into a title defense and the champions league while magath attempts to awaken not so much a sleeping giant as a comatose one , armin veh takes over at wolfsburg with an equally challenging mission laid at his door .
with the wolves defending their first crown and with champions league soccer coming to the home of volkswagen this season , the former stuttgart coach has a high set of standards to maintain .
not only that but the fans have come to expect an attacking style of play rarely seen in wolfsburg .
veh comes to wolfsburg with championship credentials after leading stuttgart to the 2007 title .
but his team buckled during their defense the following season , sinking to the lower reaches of the league before rallying to a sixth-placed finish .
veh was sacked in november 2008 when stuttgart 's results suggested another season of mediocrity beckoned .
veh 's first game in charge is against his former club in the season 's opening game .
the new wolfsburg manager can count himself lucky that he has managed to keep hold of key strikers edwin dzeko and brazilian grafite despite interest from some of europe 's top clubs this summer .
between them , the pair netted 54 league goals , but it remains to be seen if the team can repeat their surprise success or handle the step up to the champions league where they will make their debut .
" the team is very motivated .
my initial impressions from the first training camp have absolutely been confirmed , " veh said , whose attacking options have been further boosted by the arrival of nigerian striker obafemi martins from newcastle .
" we are looking forward to the season and showing what we can do . "
direct dutchman talking tough in bayern bildunterschrift : van gaal will have to draw on his experience at europe 's top clubs to deal with bayern 's demands challenging both of these men is another manager taking the reins of a new club .
bayern munich , who sacked ex-germany coach juergen klinsmann in april , saw out last season under the considered eye caretaker coach jupp heynckes .
but it will be dutchman louis van gaal who takes on the highest-profile job in german league soccer this season .
the former barcelona , ajax and holland coach arrives in germany after leading unfancied az alkmaar to the dutch title last season .
he may have to dig into his experience at the bigger clubs on his cv to cope with the expectation which comes with managing bayern , where domestic honors are demanded and champions league success is expected .
the 57-year-old van gaal has inherited an embarrassment of riches in attack with bayern 's squad containing germany strikers mario gomez and miroslav klose , as well as italian world cup winner luca toni and croatia 's ivica olic .
promising youngster thomas mueller makes it five forwards pushing for two places in van gaal 's starting line-up and the straight-taking coach is expected to stamp his mark on the side .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de players -pipe- 05.08.2009 german clubs do good business in transfer market gone mad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german clubs have less to play with but still spend wisely german clubs may not have splashed the cash like some other clubs on the continent but they 've still done good business throughout the summer with all the title challengers adding more firepower ahead of the campaign . the bundesliga 's biggest transfer story during the close-season was the one which did n't happen - the much talked-about future of bayern munich 's franck ribery .
ultimately neither real madrid , barcelona or manchester united were prepared to meet the ever-rising price tag set by the bavarian club where the french international is contracted until 2011 .
the man fans once hailed as " kaiser franck , " now known as " the bavarian diva " by german media , is looking far from imperial with ribery 's commitment to bayern becoming increasingly tarnished during a summer of speculation .
outspoken bayern munich president franz beckenbauer blasted ribery , for , in his view , being more interested in his own career than the club and suggested that the player could still be sold - for 94 million euros -lrb- $ 135 million -rrb- .
" of course we would expect the market price , and if cristiano ronaldo is worth 94 million , then ribery is worth a comparable sum .
but if no offer is forthcoming he must fulfill the terms of his contract until 2011 , " he told sport bild newspaper .
commentators were not entirely convinced by a statement from bayern management which said : " bayern have at no time had and do not have the impression from franck ribery that he would only use bayern in order to further his own career .
he has always given himself and his abilities to the service of the team . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shorts say bayern , the expression says anywhere but here as another season in germany looms , ribery 's attitude continues to make headlines .
when the team assembled for the official pre-season photo session , observers noted the frenchman was unsmiling and distant .
he is due to miss the start of the season through injury and may spend his recuperation time wishing he was at a different stadium - namely the bernabeu in madrid , hob-nobbing with ronaldo , kaka and karim benzema as real madrid chairman florentino perez proudly showed off his multi-million euro signings in the spanish sun .
bayern , overtaken last season by wolfsburg at the top of the league , will be hoping they can hang onto ribery to provide ammunition for mario gomez .
bayern paid 30 million euros to obtain the striker from stuttgart , as they try and win back the coveted bundesliga title .
auf wiedersehen bayern bayern will be without brazilian stalwarts lucio and ze roberto who quit bavaria for inter milan and hamburg respectively in the close season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio expected more respect from new coach van gaal lucio , the veteran central defender , left bayern with a parting shot at new dutch manager louis van gaal who he accused of showing " a lack of respect . "
" i am a world champion -lrb- in the 2002 winning brazil team -rrb- as well as winning the confederations cup twice and was chosen best defender in the bundesliga , ” lucio said as he completed a reported eight million-euro move to the italian champions .
" surely i did not need to show him further proof of my abilities ? "
passing the brazilians on the way out is danijel pranjic , the croatian midfielder who joins bayern from heerenveen and dutch left-back edson braafheid from fc twente .
old boys come home stuttgart , anxious to replace gomez in attack , finally agreed with barcelona the return of their one-time player alexander hleb who spent an unhappy year at camp nou after his transfer from arsenal in 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hleb had a successful mid-decade spell with stuttgart the belarus international opted against a move to inter milan in favor of a move on loan back to the german club where he played from 2000-2005 .
another old boy returning home is international midfielder tim borowski who will again turn out in the colors of german cup holders werder bremen after a spell loan at bayern .
one of the best bits of business in the close season trading frenzy actually did n't involve any exchange of money or player .
bundesliga champions wolfsburg pulled off a coup by managing to hang on to the league 's player of the year , 23-year-old bosnian playmaker edzin dzeko who had been tempted by ac milan .
wolves add martins and algerian whiz-kid wolfsburg also managed to tempt newcastle 's ex-inter milan striker obafemi martins to the bundesliga for a reported 8.5 million euros after the 24-year-old nigerian spent a frustrating five years on tyneside .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obafemi martins brings his skills to the german champs new wolves coach armin veh also added the speedy 26-year-old algeria international karim ziani to the champions ' midfield , paying marseille five million euros for his services .
ziani " fits well in the team and will help us get to our target next season , " veh said .
meanwhile , ex-wolfsburg manager felix magath will welcome talented youngster lewis holtby from aachen after off-loading last year 's expensive dutch midfield flop orlando engelaar onto psv eindhoven .
challengers spend wisely northern challengers hamburg are hoping to shore up their defense with the signature of czech defender david rozenhal from lazio .
" hamburg is a big club with great infrastructure and conditions .
the level at the bundesliga is extremely high and it is always my aim to play high level football , " rozenhal told the club 's web site .
german media have reported the transfer fee at around five million euros .
last season 's surprise package hoffenheim have splashed more of their owner 's cash by signing argentine teenage midfielder franco zuculini for 4.7 million euros from racing club avellaneda and croatian defender josip simunic from hertha berlin for seven million , while picking up ghanaian forward prince tagoe on a free transfer from saudi club al-ittifaq .
presumably looking for a club with a less comical name , argentine goal-scoring sensation lucas barrios has opted to spend this season at the more soberly named borussia dortmund after transferring from colo colo for 4.5 million euros .
the 24-year-old striker hit the net a record 37 times in the 2008 season for the chilean champions and replaces veteran swiss national skipper alexander frei who has departed for basel in his native country for 4.2 million euros. nda / dpa / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this year , three experienced managers take on new teams all capable of winning the league . when felix magath rolled up at wolfsburg before last season , more than a few eyebrows were raised .
the sometimes abrasive former bayern munich , who coached the bavarian giants to a double “ double ” of league and cup successes in his brief tenure , had offers from a number of top flight clubs after being sacked in february 2007 , but chose a struggling , mediocre team which had flirted with relegation for the previous two seasons .
the rest is history .
wolfsburg picked up their first league crown in may after magath had spent wisely and cannily in the transfer market and cast the wolves in his disciplined image .
wolfsburg , hardly a fashionable unit and usually mid- to lower table fodder for the big guns , were champions , hardly put a foot wrong last season as the side felix built swept the league .
bildunterschrift : magath 's arrival at schalke has taken expectations at the club even higher than usual maybe the 56-year-old magath did n't really believe that his new charges could win the league and he was as surprised as everyone else .
why else would he have agreed to leave the club before the season was even over , with his name penciled in as the new coach of schalke 04 for the 2009/10 season , before wolfsburg had shown what they were really capable of ?
but sign for schalke he did .
one wonders if a man of fewer scruples would have reneged on the agreement in the light of wolfsburg 's impressive season and stayed on to defend the title ?
felix magath may be a lot of things but he is not a deal breaker and as such will lead perennial bundesliga bridesmaids schalke this season and not the reigning champions of wolfsburg .
the royal blues spent most of last season in disarray and magath 's first job has to be to build some team spirit and plug gaps in their defense before their first league game against newly-promoted nuremburg on saturday .
after building a championship winning side out of wolfsburg , expectations are high – even by schalke 's standards .
a club which regularly promises much and more often than not delivers little -lrb- or at best waits until the final minute to choke and break the hearts of its fans -rrb- , schalke is desperate for success and magath comes with a record which suggests he could be the man to turn around their eternally disappointing fortunes .
armin veh : following in felix 's footsteps bildunterschrift : veh has quite an act to follow as he leads wolfsburg into a title defense and the champions league while magath attempts to awaken not so much a sleeping giant as a comatose one , armin veh takes over at wolfsburg with an equally challenging mission laid at his door .
with the wolves defending their first crown and with champions league soccer coming to the home of volkswagen this season , the former stuttgart coach has a high set of standards to maintain .
not only that but the fans have come to expect an attacking style of play rarely seen in wolfsburg .
veh comes to wolfsburg with championship credentials after leading stuttgart to the 2007 title .
but his team buckled during their defense the following season , sinking to the lower reaches of the league before rallying to a sixth-placed finish .
veh was sacked in november 2008 when stuttgart 's results suggested another season of mediocrity beckoned .
veh 's first game in charge is against his former club in the season 's opening game .
the new wolfsburg manager can count himself lucky that he has managed to keep hold of key strikers edwin dzeko and brazilian grafite despite interest from some of europe 's top clubs this summer .
between them , the pair netted 54 league goals , but it remains to be seen if the team can repeat their surprise success or handle the step up to the champions league where they will make their debut .
" the team is very motivated .
my initial impressions from the first training camp have absolutely been confirmed , " veh said , whose attacking options have been further boosted by the arrival of nigerian striker obafemi martins from newcastle .
" we are looking forward to the season and showing what we can do . "
direct dutchman talking tough in bayern bildunterschrift : van gaal will have to draw on his experience at europe 's top clubs to deal with bayern 's demands challenging both of these men is another manager taking the reins of a new club .
bayern munich , who sacked ex-germany coach juergen klinsmann in april , saw out last season under the considered eye caretaker coach jupp heynckes .
but it will be dutchman louis van gaal who takes on the highest-profile job in german league soccer this season .
the former barcelona , ajax and holland coach arrives in germany after leading unfancied az alkmaar to the dutch title last season .
he may have to dig into his experience at the bigger clubs on his cv to cope with the expectation which comes with managing bayern , where domestic honors are demanded and champions league success is expected .
the 57-year-old van gaal has inherited an embarrassment of riches in attack with bayern 's squad containing germany strikers mario gomez and miroslav klose , as well as italian world cup winner luca toni and croatia 's ivica olic .
promising youngster thomas mueller makes it five forwards pushing for two places in van gaal 's starting line-up and the straight-taking coach is expected to stamp his mark on the side .
bayern captain mark van bommel said the players are responding to his direct approach .
" he clearly tells us what he wants to see .
he 's a straight talker ; he corrects you and urges you on . "
raised voices on the practice ground from time to time are not a problem , says van bommel .
" it 's criticism to help you improve .
it 's well-intentioned , to stop it happening again . "

this year , three experienced managers take on new teams all capable of winning the league . when felix magath rolled up at wolfsburg before last season , more than a few eyebrows were raised .
the sometimes abrasive former bayern munich , who coached the bavarian giants to a double “ double ” of league and cup successes in his brief tenure , had offers from a number of top flight clubs after being sacked in february 2007 , but chose a struggling , mediocre team which had flirted with relegation for the previous two seasons .
the rest is history .
wolfsburg picked up their first league crown in may after magath had spent wisely and cannily in the transfer market and cast the wolves in his disciplined image .
wolfsburg , hardly a fashionable unit and usually mid- to lower table fodder for the big guns , were champions , hardly put a foot wrong last season as the side felix built swept the league .
bildunterschrift : magath 's arrival at schalke has taken expectations at the club even higher than usual maybe the 56-year-old magath did n't really believe that his new charges could win the league and he was as surprised as everyone else .
why else would he have agreed to leave the club before the season was even over , with his name penciled in as the new coach of schalke 04 for the 2009/10 season , before wolfsburg had shown what they were really capable of ?
but sign for schalke he did .
one wonders if a man of fewer scruples would have reneged on the agreement in the light of wolfsburg 's impressive season and stayed on to defend the title ?
felix magath may be a lot of things but he is not a deal breaker and as such will lead perennial bundesliga bridesmaids schalke this season and not the reigning champions of wolfsburg .
the royal blues spent most of last season in disarray and magath 's first job has to be to build some team spirit and plug gaps in their defense before their first league game against newly-promoted nuremburg on saturday .
after building a championship winning side out of wolfsburg , expectations are high – even by schalke 's standards .
a club which regularly promises much and more often than not delivers little -lrb- or at best waits until the final minute to choke and break the hearts of its fans -rrb- , schalke is desperate for success and magath comes with a record which suggests he could be the man to turn around their eternally disappointing fortunes .
armin veh : following in felix 's footsteps bildunterschrift : veh has quite an act to follow as he leads wolfsburg into a title defense and the champions league while magath attempts to awaken not so much a sleeping giant as a comatose one , armin veh takes over at wolfsburg with an equally challenging mission laid at his door .
with the wolves defending their first crown and with champions league soccer coming to the home of volkswagen this season , the former stuttgart coach has a high set of standards to maintain .
not only that but the fans have come to expect an attacking style of play rarely seen in wolfsburg .
veh comes to wolfsburg with championship credentials after leading stuttgart to the 2007 title .
but his team buckled during their defense the following season , sinking to the lower reaches of the league before rallying to a sixth-placed finish .
veh was sacked in november 2008 when stuttgart 's results suggested another season of mediocrity beckoned .
veh 's first game in charge is against his former club in the season 's opening game .
the new wolfsburg manager can count himself lucky that he has managed to keep hold of key strikers edwin dzeko and brazilian grafite despite interest from some of europe 's top clubs this summer .
between them , the pair netted 54 league goals , but it remains to be seen if the team can repeat their surprise success or handle the step up to the champions league where they will make their debut .
" the team is very motivated .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 05.08.2009 one month since xinjiang unrest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ethnic uighur passes in front of chinese soldiers in urumqi , where unrest broke out last month bloody riots broke out a month ago in the northwestern chinese province of xinjiang .
the figures are still unknown .
the chinese authorities say 197 people died in the clashes between han chinese - the majority population in china - and uighurs - a muslim minority .
the government has accused the munich-based world uighur congress of inciting the violence .
a climate of fear currently reigns over the city of urumqi where the riots broke out . at a car dealership in urumqi , there are burnt-out cars and smoke-blackened walls . riot police with protective shields and machine guns stand on the opposite corner .
duan zongcheng is an 18-year-old mechanic .
he ’ s han chinese and he ’ s scared .
he recalled what had happened : " lots of uighurs went out onto the streets .
they trashed a lot of chinese businesses with rocks .
then they started killing people .
they even pulled them out of their cars .
i was scared .
there were five of us and we escaped to the cellar .
i am now mourning the victims .
they had no chance to defend themselves because they were beaten to death so fast .
i can sense a rift now .
before it used to be perfectly normal when i greeted my uighur neighbours but now it feels dishonest . "
duan zongcheng lives across the road from the car dealership - in a poor district with small houses .
most of his neighbours are uighurs .
but the streets have been empty since the clashes .
uighurs are also scared " the people in this neighbourhood are all from the south of the province of xinjiang , from aksu , hotan and kashgar , ” explained this uighur , who was willing to talk for a short amount of time .
“ when i arrived in urumqi i couldn ’ t speak a word of chinese .
a friend helped me and now it ’ s easier .
people like us don ’ t have land that we can cultivate back home .
that ’ s why we come here to find work .
since the riots , lots of people have left the city because they were scared .
i want to stay .
what else can i do ?
the government doesn ’ t give me anything .
business is bad .
i only have enough to keep my head above water . "
the man ran off after being asked for the reasons behind the violence last month , saying he didn ’ t know .
many han chinese , for their part , say that uighurs are ungrateful - they are allowed to have up to three children and have more access to higher education .
change in minority policy needed pan zhiping from the academy of social sciences in urumqi thinks such privileges should be maintained but that there also needs to be a change in chinese minority policy .
“ i think that in a modern society we have to strengthen the notion of the citizen , ” he said .
“ we should not highlight ethnic identity .
what ’ s it like in germany ?
does a german passport state what ethnic identity somebody is ?
that would not be allowed - it would be almost racist .
what we have to achieve is that if somebody says he belongs to a certain ethnic group and wants to be respected for it , he should get respect .
that ’ s the most important thing .
but if he doesn ’ t think it ’ s important we shouldn ’ t care about his ethnic identity at all . ”
on wednesday , the head of the world uighur congress rebiya kadeer said the chinese authorities had inflamed ethnic tensions in xinjiang by deceiving people about the unrest .
so far , hundreds of people have been detained in connection with the unrest .
according to chinese state media 83 people will formally face charges .

manfred guellner , the head of the forsa institute , said that the dip in support for the spd was partly caused by a scandal involving health minister ulla schmidt who took her official car on holiday , prompting a public outcry .
" the affair stirred up all the reservations about the spd that were already there : incompetence and distance from the people , " said guellner .
frank-walter steinmeier , the spd 's chancellor candidate and current german foreign minister , has struggled to make dents in merkel 's popularity despite unveiling a campaign team including several new faces and making a contentious pledge to bring full employment to europe 's largest economy by 2020 .

the visit comes as taliban-led violence escalates ahead of the august 20 elections . on his maiden visit to afghanistan , anders fogh rasmussen repeated a pledge he made on his first working day in his job as nato secretary general : to make afghanistan his highest priority . " afghanistan is the first country i 'm visiting in my new capacity as secretary general of nato , " he said at a joint press conference with afghan president hamid karzai in kabul on wednesday . " i give very high priority to afghanistan ; actually it will be my highest priority as secretary general , " rasmussen added . he vowed that troops from the western military alliance would do their utmost to provide " the best possible security " for the august 20 presidential election . " i assure you , the afghan people , that we will stay to support you for as long as it takes to finish our job , " he said in a bid to reassure afghans in the run-up to the polls . first-hand appraisal over 64,000 of some 100,000 international troops deployed from 42 countries are serving in the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan .
nato troops operate alongside a us-led coalition . nato officials say their aim is to help stabilize a country suffering from three decades of war , resurgent islamists , poverty and corruption . rasmussen aims to assess first-hand the fight against an escalating taliban-led insurgency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai and 40 other candidates are in the race to lead the war-torn nation during the visit , which comes just two weeks ahead of nationwide elections , rasmussen was also due to hold talks with some of the other candidates for the presidency . although karzai leads a field of some 40 people standing for the top job , he has been widely criticized for avoiding the public campaign trail and deciding instead to carve out alliances with powerful but often corrupt political kingmakers . appeal to the taliban at wednesday 's press conference , karzai called on the taliban and hezbi islami , an associate group of the taliban , to renounce violence and participate in the elections . " we will request the taliban to have the afghan national interest in their hearts and minds and come and participate in the elections and , through voting , bring stability for afghanistan , " karzai said . " after elections , if i win , my first priority will be solidifying and speeding the peace process with the taliban and hezbi islami , and all other groups who are not part of al-qaeda or other terrorist networks , " he added . the worsening security and high casualties on the side of international troops have forced several nato and non-nato countries to call for talks with taliban militants , who , despite the ouster of their regime some eight years ago , are still a force to be reckoned with . rasmussen ’ s comments reflected that view .
" i am ready to take pragmatic steps that can include the security for our troops and even talks with a number of groups within the afghan society , " he said . however , he was at pains to clarify that a prerequisite for such an engagement was that the groups “ put down their weapons and abide by the laws in this country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and afghan forces have been working together to recapture areas held by taliban militants securing taliban strongholds with campaigning for the presidential and provincial council elections in full swing , nato forces are pressing ahead with operations designed to secure taliban strongholds in a last bid to allow voting to take place in restive areas . " our troops will do their utmost to ensure the best possible security around the elections , " rasmussen said , adding : " it is an opportunity for the afghan people to demonstrate that you do not bow to threats and violence of the enemies of afghanistan . " the election is afghanistan 's only second-ever democratic poll after the extremist taliban regime was ousted back in 2001 . the taliban , who ruled afghanistan between 1996 and 2001 , have managed to orchestrate an insurgency that has escalated to record levels .
the intensification is putting a huge strain on us and nato-led forces that have grown to number more than 100,000 . there are concerns that violence will overshadow the elections , deter afghans from going out to vote , and undermine the credibility of a poll that is being seen as a test of an internationally-funded drive to install democracy . bundeswehr troops in isaf bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 3,500 troops stationed in northern afghanistan as part of the isaf mission last month , officials in berlin confirmed that germany 's military , the bundeswehr , was engaged in its largest-ever offensive against the taliban .
this was in response to increased taliban attacks in the north of the country , where most of germany ’ s 3,700 troops are stationed . the latest deployment involved some 300 members of the bundeswehr 's quick reaction force and , for the first time , included armored units fighting with close air support . german defence minister franz josef jung justified the offensive , saying : " we are now being particularly challenged in kunduz . "
however , jung insisted on calling the operation a " stabilization deployment ” ahead of the elections . not an exit strategy the former danish prime minister took charge of the 28-nation nato on monday , pledging to make afghanistan his top priority and prevent the war-torn country from once again becoming a hub of international terrorism . rasmussen , who has a four-year mandate , said the long-term goal was to " move forward concretely and visibly with transferring lead security responsibility in afghanistan to the afghans . " " i believe , during my term , afghans must take over lead responsibility for security in most of their country , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community has spent a huge amount of resources to train afghanistan 's army and police however , he rejected any suggestion that such a strategy amounted to a cut and run strategy as pure propaganda . " let me be clear .
nato must and will be there in support .
let no taliban propaganda try to sell my message as a run for -lrb- the -rrb- exit .
it is not , " he said . while rasmussen ’ s comments were aimed at reassuring afghans , his visit has come at an awkward time , with residents in the southern province of kandahar saying that a nato bomb attack had killed four civilians , including three children . afghan people have become increasingly vocal about their anger over the growing number of civilian casualties as a result of operations by nato and the us-led coalition . rb / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the data were not job-specific , they should not have been collected . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 05.08.2009 french fruit farmers slam eu demands to pay back subsidies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fruit and vegetable farmers in france say they are already suffering from falling prices and incomes the eu has extended a deadline for paris to explain how it will recover huge subsidies paid to its fruit farmers that are now deemed illegal .
but farmers are up in arms over demands to pay back up to 500 million euros . the european commission ruled in january that subsidies worth around 338 million euros -lrb- $ 486.4 million -rrb- paid between 1992 and 2002 by the french government to support its fruit and vegetable sector had violated european farm and state aid policy .
the eu executive has said the subsidies gave french farmers an unfair advantage over their european competitors .
the commission has ruled that french growers now owe a total sum of about 500 million euros , including interest charges .
farmers angry about pay back demands the announcement has been met with widespread anger and disbelief in orchards and vegetable markets across france .
the eu decision comes at a time when farmers in europe 's largest farm economy have already been protesting against a recession-linked drop in demand and sliding incomes .
" we just do n't understand it .
these recent weeks , we 've been telling the government how bad things are for us .
and the first answer we get is this - that we have to pay back money we received 10 even 15 years ago , " salvatore esorordu , a fruit grower from the southern region of gard , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : producer prices for fruit and vegetables are plummeting " it 's a provocation .
prices are at their worst level in 20 years , " he added .
producer prices for fruit and vegetables fell 3.1 percent in june , putting them down 17.6 percent year-on-year , according to latest data from french statistics office insee .
the french fruit and vegetable sector , the third-largest in europe , also says it faces growing cheap competition from fellow eu countries that have lower labor costs .
france to negotiate hefty sum france has disputed the hefty sum the eu wants to claw back from fruit and vegetable farmers .
but if the government fails to refund the money , it would be liable to pay a heavy fine .
typically , such fines are open-ended , calculated on the basis of the time it takes the government to act .
if it does n't comply , the fine goes on increasing .
farm minister bruno le maire said this week that france would accept the eu demand for recouping some of the subsidies , but emphasized that he would negotiate with the eu over the total sum .
he also said he wanted the recovery of subsidies to be done gradually and on a case-by-case basis so as to avoid forcing vulnerable farmers to pay back .
" we want the reimbursements to be spread over time .
it would put an unbearable strain on farmers if they 're forced to pay this money back immediately , " le maire said .
" unfair and immoral " this is not the first time france has been forced to ask farmers to pay back subsidies .
but in the past , french farmers received generous aid directly from the european commission .
this time , any recovery of subsidies will go back into the french budget , not eu coffers .
that 's why the french government has more of an incentive to recoup the cash .
but french farmers are unlikely to accept the demands without a fight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josé bové has urged french farmers to fight the eu demands to pay back subsidies josé bové , a french member of the european parliament and former president of the peasants confederation farmers ' union , has urged civil disobedience .
" the farmers must not reimburse this money , " bové said .
" if the government sends them letters telling them to do so , i encourage them to refuse and disobey because it 's unfair and immoral . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.08.2009 old heads at new clubs hope to take teams to bundesliga title glory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg will defend their title under a new coach the bundesliga coach carousel is often as enthralling as the player swaps which take place every summer .
this year , three experienced managers take on new teams all capable of winning the league . when felix magath rolled up at wolfsburg before last season , more than a few eyebrows were raised .
the sometimes abrasive former bayern munich , who coached the bavarian giants to a double “ double ” of league and cup successes in his brief tenure , had offers from a number of top flight clubs after being sacked in february 2007 , but chose a struggling , mediocre team which had flirted with relegation for the previous two seasons .
the rest is history .
wolfsburg picked up their first league crown in may after magath had spent wisely and cannily in the transfer market and cast the wolves in his disciplined image .
wolfsburg , hardly a fashionable unit and usually mid- to lower table fodder for the big guns , were champions , hardly put a foot wrong last season as the side felix built swept the league .
bildunterschrift : magath 's arrival at schalke has taken expectations at the club even higher than usual maybe the 56-year-old magath did n't really believe that his new charges could win the league and he was as surprised as everyone else .
why else would he have agreed to leave the club before the season was even over , with his name penciled in as the new coach of schalke 04 for the 2009/10 season , before wolfsburg had shown what they were really capable of ?
but sign for schalke he did .
one wonders if a man of fewer scruples would have reneged on the agreement in the light of wolfsburg 's impressive season and stayed on to defend the title ?
felix magath may be a lot of things but he is not a deal breaker and as such will lead perennial bundesliga bridesmaids schalke this season and not the reigning champions of wolfsburg .
the royal blues spent most of last season in disarray and magath 's first job has to be to build some team spirit and plug gaps in their defense before their first league game against newly-promoted nuremburg on saturday .
after building a championship winning side out of wolfsburg , expectations are high – even by schalke 's standards .
a club which regularly promises much and more often than not delivers little -lrb- or at best waits until the final minute to choke and break the hearts of its fans -rrb- , schalke is desperate for success and magath comes with a record which suggests he could be the man to turn around their eternally disappointing fortunes .
armin veh : following in felix 's footsteps bildunterschrift : veh has quite an act to follow as he leads wolfsburg into a title defense and the champions league while magath attempts to awaken not so much a sleeping giant as a comatose one , armin veh takes over at wolfsburg with an equally challenging mission laid at his door .
with the wolves defending their first crown and with champions league soccer coming to the home of volkswagen this season , the former stuttgart coach has a high set of standards to maintain .
not only that but the fans have come to expect an attacking style of play rarely seen in wolfsburg .
veh comes to wolfsburg with championship credentials after leading stuttgart to the 2007 title .
but his team buckled during their defense the following season , sinking to the lower reaches of the league before rallying to a sixth-placed finish .
veh was sacked in november 2008 when stuttgart 's results suggested another season of mediocrity beckoned .
veh 's first game in charge is against his former club in the season 's opening game .
the new wolfsburg manager can count himself lucky that he has managed to keep hold of key strikers edwin dzeko and brazilian grafite despite interest from some of europe 's top clubs this summer .
between them , the pair netted 54 league goals , but it remains to be seen if the team can repeat their surprise success or handle the step up to the champions league where they will make their debut .
" the team is very motivated .
my initial impressions from the first training camp have absolutely been confirmed , " veh said , whose attacking options have been further boosted by the arrival of nigerian striker obafemi martins from newcastle .
" we are looking forward to the season and showing what we can do . "
direct dutchman talking tough in bayern bildunterschrift : van gaal will have to draw on his experience at europe 's top clubs to deal with bayern 's demands challenging both of these men is another manager taking the reins of a new club .
bayern munich , who sacked ex-germany coach juergen klinsmann in april , saw out last season under the considered eye caretaker coach jupp heynckes .
but it will be dutchman louis van gaal who takes on the highest-profile job in german league soccer this season .
the former barcelona , ajax and holland coach arrives in germany after leading unfancied az alkmaar to the dutch title last season .
he may have to dig into his experience at the bigger clubs on his cv to cope with the expectation which comes with managing bayern , where domestic honors are demanded and champions league success is expected .
the 57-year-old van gaal has inherited an embarrassment of riches in attack with bayern 's squad containing germany strikers mario gomez and miroslav klose , as well as italian world cup winner luca toni and croatia 's ivica olic .
promising youngster thomas mueller makes it five forwards pushing for two places in van gaal 's starting line-up and the straight-taking coach is expected to stamp his mark on the side .
bayern captain mark van bommel said the players are responding to his direct approach .
" he clearly tells us what he wants to see .
he 's a straight talker ; he corrects you and urges you on . "
raised voices on the practice ground from time to time are not a problem , says van bommel .
" it 's criticism to help you improve .
it 's well-intentioned , to stop it happening again . "
the dutchman 's first league game in charge is against last season 's dark horses hoffenheim who led the league on their debut bundesliga season at christmas before falling off the pace. nda / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this year , three experienced managers take on new teams all capable of winning the league . when felix magath rolled up at wolfsburg before last season , more than a few eyebrows were raised .
the sometimes abrasive former bayern munich , who coached the bavarian giants to a double “ double ” of league and cup successes in his brief tenure , had offers from a number of top flight clubs after being sacked in february 2007 , but chose a struggling , mediocre team which had flirted with relegation for the previous two seasons .
the rest is history .
wolfsburg picked up their first league crown in may after magath had spent wisely and cannily in the transfer market and cast the wolves in his disciplined image .
wolfsburg , hardly a fashionable unit and usually mid- to lower table fodder for the big guns , were champions , hardly put a foot wrong last season as the side felix built swept the league .
bildunterschrift : magath 's arrival at schalke has taken expectations at the club even higher than usual maybe the 56-year-old magath did n't really believe that his new charges could win the league and he was as surprised as everyone else .
why else would he have agreed to leave the club before the season was even over , with his name penciled in as the new coach of schalke 04 for the 2009/10 season , before wolfsburg had shown what they were really capable of ?
but sign for schalke he did .
one wonders if a man of fewer scruples would have reneged on the agreement in the light of wolfsburg 's impressive season and stayed on to defend the title ?
felix magath may be a lot of things but he is not a deal breaker and as such will lead perennial bundesliga bridesmaids schalke this season and not the reigning champions of wolfsburg .
the royal blues spent most of last season in disarray and magath 's first job has to be to build some team spirit and plug gaps in their defense before their first league game against newly-promoted nuremburg on saturday .
after building a championship winning side out of wolfsburg , expectations are high – even by schalke 's standards .
a club which regularly promises much and more often than not delivers little -lrb- or at best waits until the final minute to choke and break the hearts of its fans -rrb- , schalke is desperate for success and magath comes with a record which suggests he could be the man to turn around their eternally disappointing fortunes .
armin veh : following in felix 's footsteps bildunterschrift : veh has quite an act to follow as he leads wolfsburg into a title defense and the champions league while magath attempts to awaken not so much a sleeping giant as a comatose one , armin veh takes over at wolfsburg with an equally challenging mission laid at his door .
with the wolves defending their first crown and with champions league soccer coming to the home of volkswagen this season , the former stuttgart coach has a high set of standards to maintain .
not only that but the fans have come to expect an attacking style of play rarely seen in wolfsburg .
veh comes to wolfsburg with championship credentials after leading stuttgart to the 2007 title .
but his team buckled during their defense the following season , sinking to the lower reaches of the league before rallying to a sixth-placed finish .
veh was sacked in november 2008 when stuttgart 's results suggested another season of mediocrity beckoned .
veh 's first game in charge is against his former club in the season 's opening game .
the new wolfsburg manager can count himself lucky that he has managed to keep hold of key strikers edwin dzeko and brazilian grafite despite interest from some of europe 's top clubs this summer .
between them , the pair netted 54 league goals , but it remains to be seen if the team can repeat their surprise success or handle the step up to the champions league where they will make their debut .
" the team is very motivated .

the former barcelona , ajax and holland coach arrives in germany after leading unfancied az alkmaar to the dutch title last season .
he may have to dig into his experience at the bigger clubs on his cv to cope with the expectation which comes with managing bayern , where domestic honors are demanded and champions league success is expected .

the container ship was released with its 24-member crew on monday after somali pirates received the multi-million dollar ransom from hamburg-based shipping company leonhardt & blumberg .
the vessel was seized on april 4 , around 400 nautical miles off the somali coast , between kenya and the seychelles .
the crew on the container ship includes five germans , three russians , two filipinos , two ukrainians and 12 sailors from the south pacific nation of tuvalu .
frank-walter steinmeier , german foreign minister and social democratic chancellor candidate in up-coming elections , said ransom payments were not good " for dealing with kidnappings . "
" the federal government will not allow itself to be blackmailed in this case or in future kidnapping cases , " a foreign ministry spokesman said , expressing opposition to ransom payments made by the government .
encouraging pirates parliamentarians also warned against encouraging somali pirates to continue taking ships hostage by giving in to ransom demands .

thomas oppermann , parliamentary leader of the social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which is part of the governing grand coalition in berlin , was quoted by the daily hannoversche allgemeine zeitung as saying : " the problem of piracy wo n't get smaller this way . " meanwhile , the father of one of the crew members complained that the government did not do enough to rescue the ship .
" as associates of the government and the crisis group , we just felt abandoned in the end , " the father of the officer , identified as frederik e. , told the nordwest zeitung newspaper .
he said he had written to chancellor angela merkel , president horst koehler and other leading politicians , but never received a response .
the ship , en route to the kenyan port of mombasa , is expected to arrive there on saturday .
hamburg 's chief prosecutor was quoted as saying that a group of officers from the german federal criminal police were set to meet the ship in mombasa .
they are expected to carry out investigations and interviews with crew members to gather evidence about the pirates . rb / dpa / ap editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

just as their handcuffs were removed , their armed accomplices entered the room , threatened the five guards and helped the men flee .
the group later fired at police who were chasing them , and they have not been seen since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the palace of justice is impossible to secure , says justice minister de clerck belgian justice minister stefan de clerck has come under attack for the incident .
de clerck admitted that the accused men , each with a criminal record , should have been guarded by armed police instead of just security personnel .
he said the 19th century palace of justice was " a belgian icon , a monument with magnificent architecture " and numerous entrances that would be impossible to completely secure .
" we need to totally isolate and handle criminal cases in another part of the building , " he said .
multiple escapes plague justice minister the dramatic caper is the third such jailbreak in 12 days .
two weeks ago a helicopter airlifted three dangerous inmates out from a prison yard in bruges .
two of those men are still on the run , one of them 26-year-old ashraf sekkaki , described by the international police organization interpol as one of belgium 's most dangerous criminals .
last week six convicts were able to use a ladder from a construction site inside their prison in northern belgium to hop the prison wall .
while four escapees were immediately stopped , two of them , serving sentences for rape , torture and violent robbery , were able to get away in a car waiting for them .
oddly enough , it 's not a crime to break out of prison in belgium .
it 's natural to want freedom , goes the argument .
but it is illegal to help someone to escape .
for example , the elderly mother of one escaped prisoner could get three years in jail as she had been waiting with the getaway car .
the pressure is now on de clerck to explain the rash of escapes .
he was forced to resign from the same position he holds now in 1998 when a murderer and pedophile was able to escape for a few hours .
when the 1998 debacle came up in a television interview with de clerck after wednesday 's incident , the minister bristled at the host .
" i do my work .
i do what i have to do , " said de clerck , who only recently resumed his old post when a new government was formed late last year .
" i had six months time to work here and then you make such a laughable comment .
i think it 's inappropriate . "
the most significant effect of the escapes so far is that outdoor time for belgian prisoners has been limited .
another inmate of the bruges prison , freddy horion , convicted of multiple murders , has now sued the state for not allowing him to exercise in the fresh air. hf / afp / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

still a labor of love , cargo-carrying bikes are n't proving lucrative for dreiradbau , according to lange . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cargo cruiser is around four feet wide and fit on bike paths currently , five cargo cruisers exist : two in berlin and three in the netherlands , where a pilot project has a small town is trying to its trash on the cruisers . " we still need a major client , " lange said , adding that there are few profits after investing in prototypes . the messenger courier agency is dreiradbau 's last hope .
though the cargo cruiser are unlikely to replace trucks in german urban areas , hoppe said he still believes the cruisers could eventually help cut down on some of the trips the trucks have to travel - one day making their construction viable for dreiradbau . achim beier , managing director of messenger , agreed . " according to our calculations , the cruiser could replace about 20 percent of cargo-carrying vehicles in berlin in the next five years , " he said .

this year , three experienced managers take on new teams all capable of winning the league . when felix magath rolled up at wolfsburg before last season , more than a few eyebrows were raised .
the sometimes abrasive former bayern munich , who coached the bavarian giants to a double “ double ” of league and cup successes in his brief tenure , had offers from a number of top flight clubs after being sacked in february 2007 , but chose a struggling , mediocre team which had flirted with relegation for the previous two seasons .
the rest is history .
wolfsburg picked up their first league crown in may after magath had spent wisely and cannily in the transfer market and cast the wolves in his disciplined image .
wolfsburg , hardly a fashionable unit and usually mid- to lower table fodder for the big guns , were champions , hardly put a foot wrong last season as the side felix built swept the league .
bildunterschrift : magath 's arrival at schalke has taken expectations at the club even higher than usual maybe the 56-year-old magath did n't really believe that his new charges could win the league and he was as surprised as everyone else .
why else would he have agreed to leave the club before the season was even over , with his name penciled in as the new coach of schalke 04 for the 2009/10 season , before wolfsburg had shown what they were really capable of ?
but sign for schalke he did .
one wonders if a man of fewer scruples would have reneged on the agreement in the light of wolfsburg 's impressive season and stayed on to defend the title ?
felix magath may be a lot of things but he is not a deal breaker and as such will lead perennial bundesliga bridesmaids schalke this season and not the reigning champions of wolfsburg .
the royal blues spent most of last season in disarray and magath 's first job has to be to build some team spirit and plug gaps in their defense before their first league game against newly-promoted nuremburg on saturday .
after building a championship winning side out of wolfsburg , expectations are high – even by schalke 's standards .
a club which regularly promises much and more often than not delivers little -lrb- or at best waits until the final minute to choke and break the hearts of its fans -rrb- , schalke is desperate for success and magath comes with a record which suggests he could be the man to turn around their eternally disappointing fortunes .
armin veh : following in felix 's footsteps bildunterschrift : veh has quite an act to follow as he leads wolfsburg into a title defense and the champions league while magath attempts to awaken not so much a sleeping giant as a comatose one , armin veh takes over at wolfsburg with an equally challenging mission laid at his door .
with the wolves defending their first crown and with champions league soccer coming to the home of volkswagen this season , the former stuttgart coach has a high set of standards to maintain .
not only that but the fans have come to expect an attacking style of play rarely seen in wolfsburg .
veh comes to wolfsburg with championship credentials after leading stuttgart to the 2007 title .
but his team buckled during their defense the following season , sinking to the lower reaches of the league before rallying to a sixth-placed finish .
veh was sacked in november 2008 when stuttgart 's results suggested another season of mediocrity beckoned .
veh 's first game in charge is against his former club in the season 's opening game .
the new wolfsburg manager can count himself lucky that he has managed to keep hold of key strikers edwin dzeko and brazilian grafite despite interest from some of europe 's top clubs this summer .
between them , the pair netted 54 league goals , but it remains to be seen if the team can repeat their surprise success or handle the step up to the champions league where they will make their debut .
" the team is very motivated .
my initial impressions from the first training camp have absolutely been confirmed , " veh said , whose attacking options have been further boosted by the arrival of nigerian striker obafemi martins from newcastle .
" we are looking forward to the season and showing what we can do . "
direct dutchman talking tough in bayern bildunterschrift : van gaal will have to draw on his experience at europe 's top clubs to deal with bayern 's demands challenging both of these men is another manager taking the reins of a new club .
bayern munich , who sacked ex-germany coach juergen klinsmann in april , saw out last season under the considered eye caretaker coach jupp heynckes .
but it will be dutchman louis van gaal who takes on the highest-profile job in german league soccer this season .
the former barcelona , ajax and holland coach arrives in germany after leading unfancied az alkmaar to the dutch title last season .
he may have to dig into his experience at the bigger clubs on his cv to cope with the expectation which comes with managing bayern , where domestic honors are demanded and champions league success is expected .
the 57-year-old van gaal has inherited an embarrassment of riches in attack with bayern 's squad containing germany strikers mario gomez and miroslav klose , as well as italian world cup winner luca toni and croatia 's ivica olic .
promising youngster thomas mueller makes it five forwards pushing for two places in van gaal 's starting line-up and the straight-taking coach is expected to stamp his mark on the side .
bayern captain mark van bommel said the players are responding to his direct approach .
" he clearly tells us what he wants to see .
he 's a straight talker ; he corrects you and urges you on . "
raised voices on the practice ground from time to time are not a problem , says van bommel .

the rest is history .
wolfsburg picked up their first league crown in may after magath had spent wisely and cannily in the transfer market and cast the wolves in his disciplined image .
wolfsburg , hardly a fashionable unit and usually mid- to lower table fodder for the big guns , were champions , hardly put a foot wrong last season as the side felix built swept the league .
bildunterschrift : magath 's arrival at schalke has taken expectations at the club even higher than usual maybe the 56-year-old magath did n't really believe that his new charges could win the league and he was as surprised as everyone else .
why else would he have agreed to leave the club before the season was even over , with his name penciled in as the new coach of schalke 04 for the 2009/10 season , before wolfsburg had shown what they were really capable of ?
but sign for schalke he did .
one wonders if a man of fewer scruples would have reneged on the agreement in the light of wolfsburg 's impressive season and stayed on to defend the title ?
felix magath may be a lot of things but he is not a deal breaker and as such will lead perennial bundesliga bridesmaids schalke this season and not the reigning champions of wolfsburg .
the royal blues spent most of last season in disarray and magath 's first job has to be to build some team spirit and plug gaps in their defense before their first league game against newly-promoted nuremburg on saturday .
after building a championship winning side out of wolfsburg , expectations are high – even by schalke 's standards .
a club which regularly promises much and more often than not delivers little -lrb- or at best waits until the final minute to choke and break the hearts of its fans -rrb- , schalke is desperate for success and magath comes with a record which suggests he could be the man to turn around their eternally disappointing fortunes .
armin veh : following in felix 's footsteps bildunterschrift : veh has quite an act to follow as he leads wolfsburg into a title defense and the champions league while magath attempts to awaken not so much a sleeping giant as a comatose one , armin veh takes over at wolfsburg with an equally challenging mission laid at his door .
with the wolves defending their first crown and with champions league soccer coming to the home of volkswagen this season , the former stuttgart coach has a high set of standards to maintain .
not only that but the fans have come to expect an attacking style of play rarely seen in wolfsburg .
veh comes to wolfsburg with championship credentials after leading stuttgart to the 2007 title .
but his team buckled during their defense the following season , sinking to the lower reaches of the league before rallying to a sixth-placed finish .
veh was sacked in november 2008 when stuttgart 's results suggested another season of mediocrity beckoned .
veh 's first game in charge is against his former club in the season 's opening game .
the new wolfsburg manager can count himself lucky that he has managed to keep hold of key strikers edwin dzeko and brazilian grafite despite interest from some of europe 's top clubs this summer .
between them , the pair netted 54 league goals , but it remains to be seen if the team can repeat their surprise success or handle the step up to the champions league where they will make their debut .
" the team is very motivated .
my initial impressions from the first training camp have absolutely been confirmed , " veh said , whose attacking options have been further boosted by the arrival of nigerian striker obafemi martins from newcastle .
" we are looking forward to the season and showing what we can do . "
direct dutchman talking tough in bayern bildunterschrift : van gaal will have to draw on his experience at europe 's top clubs to deal with bayern 's demands challenging both of these men is another manager taking the reins of a new club .
bayern munich , who sacked ex-germany coach juergen klinsmann in april , saw out last season under the considered eye caretaker coach jupp heynckes .
but it will be dutchman louis van gaal who takes on the highest-profile job in german league soccer this season .
the former barcelona , ajax and holland coach arrives in germany after leading unfancied az alkmaar to the dutch title last season .
he may have to dig into his experience at the bigger clubs on his cv to cope with the expectation which comes with managing bayern , where domestic honors are demanded and champions league success is expected .
the 57-year-old van gaal has inherited an embarrassment of riches in attack with bayern 's squad containing germany strikers mario gomez and miroslav klose , as well as italian world cup winner luca toni and croatia 's ivica olic .
promising youngster thomas mueller makes it five forwards pushing for two places in van gaal 's starting line-up and the straight-taking coach is expected to stamp his mark on the side .
bayern captain mark van bommel said the players are responding to his direct approach .
" he clearly tells us what he wants to see .
he 's a straight talker ; he corrects you and urges you on . "
raised voices on the practice ground from time to time are not a problem , says van bommel .
" it 's criticism to help you improve .
it 's well-intentioned , to stop it happening again . "
the dutchman 's first league game in charge is against last season 's dark horses hoffenheim who led the league on their debut bundesliga season at christmas before falling off the pace. nda / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ultimately neither real madrid , barcelona or manchester united were prepared to meet the ever-rising price tag set by the bavarian club where the french international is contracted until 2011 .
the man fans once hailed as " kaiser franck , " now known as " the bavarian diva " by german media , is looking far from imperial with ribery 's commitment to bayern becoming increasingly tarnished during a summer of speculation .
outspoken bayern munich president franz beckenbauer blasted ribery , for , in his view , being more interested in his own career than the club and suggested that the player could still be sold - for 94 million euros -lrb- $ 135 million -rrb- .
" of course we would expect the market price , and if cristiano ronaldo is worth 94 million , then ribery is worth a comparable sum .
but if no offer is forthcoming he must fulfill the terms of his contract until 2011 , " he told sport bild newspaper .
commentators were not entirely convinced by a statement from bayern management which said : " bayern have at no time had and do not have the impression from franck ribery that he would only use bayern in order to further his own career .
he has always given himself and his abilities to the service of the team . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shorts say bayern , the expression says anywhere but here as another season in germany looms , ribery 's attitude continues to make headlines .
when the team assembled for the official pre-season photo session , observers noted the frenchman was unsmiling and distant .
he is due to miss the start of the season through injury and may spend his recuperation time wishing he was at a different stadium - namely the bernabeu in madrid , hob-nobbing with ronaldo , kaka and karim benzema as real madrid chairman florentino perez proudly showed off his multi-million euro signings in the spanish sun .
bayern , overtaken last season by wolfsburg at the top of the league , will be hoping they can hang onto ribery to provide ammunition for mario gomez .
bayern paid 30 million euros to obtain the striker from stuttgart , as they try and win back the coveted bundesliga title .
auf wiedersehen bayern bayern will be without brazilian stalwarts lucio and ze roberto who quit bavaria for inter milan and hamburg respectively in the close season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio expected more respect from new coach van gaal lucio , the veteran central defender , left bayern with a parting shot at new dutch manager louis van gaal who he accused of showing " a lack of respect . "
" i am a world champion -lrb- in the 2002 winning brazil team -rrb- as well as winning the confederations cup twice and was chosen best defender in the bundesliga , ” lucio said as he completed a reported eight million-euro move to the italian champions .
" surely i did not need to show him further proof of my abilities ? "
passing the brazilians on the way out is danijel pranjic , the croatian midfielder who joins bayern from heerenveen and dutch left-back edson braafheid from fc twente .
old boys come home stuttgart , anxious to replace gomez in attack , finally agreed with barcelona the return of their one-time player alexander hleb who spent an unhappy year at camp nou after his transfer from arsenal in 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hleb had a successful mid-decade spell with stuttgart the belarus international opted against a move to inter milan in favor of a move on loan back to the german club where he played from 2000-2005 .
another old boy returning home is international midfielder tim borowski who will again turn out in the colors of german cup holders werder bremen after a spell loan at bayern .
one of the best bits of business in the close season trading frenzy actually did n't involve any exchange of money or player .
bundesliga champions wolfsburg pulled off a coup by managing to hang on to the league 's player of the year , 23-year-old bosnian playmaker edzin dzeko who had been tempted by ac milan .
wolves add martins and algerian whiz-kid wolfsburg also managed to tempt newcastle 's ex-inter milan striker obafemi martins to the bundesliga for a reported 8.5 million euros after the 24-year-old nigerian spent a frustrating five years on tyneside .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obafemi martins brings his skills to the german champs new wolves coach armin veh also added the speedy 26-year-old algeria international karim ziani to the champions ' midfield , paying marseille five million euros for his services .
ziani " fits well in the team and will help us get to our target next season , " veh said .
meanwhile , ex-wolfsburg manager felix magath will welcome talented youngster lewis holtby from aachen after off-loading last year 's expensive dutch midfield flop orlando engelaar onto psv eindhoven .
challengers spend wisely northern challengers hamburg are hoping to shore up their defense with the signature of czech defender david rozenhal from lazio .
" hamburg is a big club with great infrastructure and conditions .
the level at the bundesliga is extremely high and it is always my aim to play high level football , " rozenhal told the club 's web site .
german media have reported the transfer fee at around five million euros .
last season 's surprise package hoffenheim have splashed more of their owner 's cash by signing argentine teenage midfielder franco zuculini for 4.7 million euros from racing club avellaneda and croatian defender josip simunic from hertha berlin for seven million , while picking up ghanaian forward prince tagoe on a free transfer from saudi club al-ittifaq .
presumably looking for a club with a less comical name , argentine goal-scoring sensation lucas barrios has opted to spend this season at the more soberly named borussia dortmund after transferring from colo colo for 4.5 million euros .
the 24-year-old striker hit the net a record 37 times in the 2008 season for the chilean champions and replaces veteran swiss national skipper alexander frei who has departed for basel in his native country for 4.2 million euros. nda / dpa / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ultimately neither real madrid , barcelona or manchester united were prepared to meet the ever-rising price tag set by the bavarian club where the french international is contracted until 2011 .
the man fans once hailed as " kaiser franck , " now known as " the bavarian diva " by german media , is looking far from imperial with ribery 's commitment to bayern becoming increasingly tarnished during a summer of speculation .
outspoken bayern munich president franz beckenbauer blasted ribery , for , in his view , being more interested in his own career than the club and suggested that the player could still be sold - for 94 million euros -lrb- $ 135 million -rrb- .
" of course we would expect the market price , and if cristiano ronaldo is worth 94 million , then ribery is worth a comparable sum .
but if no offer is forthcoming he must fulfill the terms of his contract until 2011 , " he told sport bild newspaper .
commentators were not entirely convinced by a statement from bayern management which said : " bayern have at no time had and do not have the impression from franck ribery that he would only use bayern in order to further his own career .
he has always given himself and his abilities to the service of the team . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shorts say bayern , the expression says anywhere but here as another season in germany looms , ribery 's attitude continues to make headlines .
when the team assembled for the official pre-season photo session , observers noted the frenchman was unsmiling and distant .
he is due to miss the start of the season through injury and may spend his recuperation time wishing he was at a different stadium - namely the bernabeu in madrid , hob-nobbing with ronaldo , kaka and karim benzema as real madrid chairman florentino perez proudly showed off his multi-million euro signings in the spanish sun .
bayern , overtaken last season by wolfsburg at the top of the league , will be hoping they can hang onto ribery to provide ammunition for mario gomez .
bayern paid 30 million euros to obtain the striker from stuttgart , as they try and win back the coveted bundesliga title .
auf wiedersehen bayern bayern will be without brazilian stalwarts lucio and ze roberto who quit bavaria for inter milan and hamburg respectively in the close season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio expected more respect from new coach van gaal lucio , the veteran central defender , left bayern with a parting shot at new dutch manager louis van gaal who he accused of showing " a lack of respect . "
" i am a world champion -lrb- in the 2002 winning brazil team -rrb- as well as winning the confederations cup twice and was chosen best defender in the bundesliga , ” lucio said as he completed a reported eight million-euro move to the italian champions .

ultimately neither real madrid , barcelona or manchester united were prepared to meet the ever-rising price tag set by the bavarian club where the french international is contracted until 2011 .
the man fans once hailed as " kaiser franck , " now known as " the bavarian diva " by german media , is looking far from imperial with ribery 's commitment to bayern becoming increasingly tarnished during a summer of speculation .
outspoken bayern munich president franz beckenbauer blasted ribery , for , in his view , being more interested in his own career than the club and suggested that the player could still be sold - for 94 million euros -lrb- $ 135 million -rrb- .
" of course we would expect the market price , and if cristiano ronaldo is worth 94 million , then ribery is worth a comparable sum .
but if no offer is forthcoming he must fulfill the terms of his contract until 2011 , " he told sport bild newspaper .
commentators were not entirely convinced by a statement from bayern management which said : " bayern have at no time had and do not have the impression from franck ribery that he would only use bayern in order to further his own career .
he has always given himself and his abilities to the service of the team . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shorts say bayern , the expression says anywhere but here as another season in germany looms , ribery 's attitude continues to make headlines .
when the team assembled for the official pre-season photo session , observers noted the frenchman was unsmiling and distant .
he is due to miss the start of the season through injury and may spend his recuperation time wishing he was at a different stadium - namely the bernabeu in madrid , hob-nobbing with ronaldo , kaka and karim benzema as real madrid chairman florentino perez proudly showed off his multi-million euro signings in the spanish sun .
bayern , overtaken last season by wolfsburg at the top of the league , will be hoping they can hang onto ribery to provide ammunition for mario gomez .
bayern paid 30 million euros to obtain the striker from stuttgart , as they try and win back the coveted bundesliga title .
auf wiedersehen bayern bayern will be without brazilian stalwarts lucio and ze roberto who quit bavaria for inter milan and hamburg respectively in the close season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio expected more respect from new coach van gaal lucio , the veteran central defender , left bayern with a parting shot at new dutch manager louis van gaal who he accused of showing " a lack of respect . "
" i am a world champion -lrb- in the 2002 winning brazil team -rrb- as well as winning the confederations cup twice and was chosen best defender in the bundesliga , ” lucio said as he completed a reported eight million-euro move to the italian champions .
" surely i did not need to show him further proof of my abilities ? "
passing the brazilians on the way out is danijel pranjic , the croatian midfielder who joins bayern from heerenveen and dutch left-back edson braafheid from fc twente .
old boys come home stuttgart , anxious to replace gomez in attack , finally agreed with barcelona the return of their one-time player alexander hleb who spent an unhappy year at camp nou after his transfer from arsenal in 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hleb had a successful mid-decade spell with stuttgart the belarus international opted against a move to inter milan in favor of a move on loan back to the german club where he played from 2000-2005 .
another old boy returning home is international midfielder tim borowski who will again turn out in the colors of german cup holders werder bremen after a spell loan at bayern .
one of the best bits of business in the close season trading frenzy actually did n't involve any exchange of money or player .
bundesliga champions wolfsburg pulled off a coup by managing to hang on to the league 's player of the year , 23-year-old bosnian playmaker edzin dzeko who had been tempted by ac milan .
wolves add martins and algerian whiz-kid wolfsburg also managed to tempt newcastle 's ex-inter milan striker obafemi martins to the bundesliga for a reported 8.5 million euros after the 24-year-old nigerian spent a frustrating five years on tyneside .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obafemi martins brings his skills to the german champs new wolves coach armin veh also added the speedy 26-year-old algeria international karim ziani to the champions ' midfield , paying marseille five million euros for his services .
ziani " fits well in the team and will help us get to our target next season , " veh said .
meanwhile , ex-wolfsburg manager felix magath will welcome talented youngster lewis holtby from aachen after off-loading last year 's expensive dutch midfield flop orlando engelaar onto psv eindhoven .
challengers spend wisely northern challengers hamburg are hoping to shore up their defense with the signature of czech defender david rozenhal from lazio .
" hamburg is a big club with great infrastructure and conditions .
the level at the bundesliga is extremely high and it is always my aim to play high level football , " rozenhal told the club 's web site .
german media have reported the transfer fee at around five million euros .

pedestrians , he added , have learned to keep out of his way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an entire pallet of cargo can fit into the cruiser hoppe said he 's had to answer a lot of questions about the bike from curious onlookers in berlin who sometimes keep him from getting to his customers , which include federal ministries , the post office and several large companies .

" the job 's not going to make me rich . " olaf lange is also not going to get rich with his tricycle construction company dreiradbau .
also based in berlin , lange and two employees tinker away on a cargo cruiser in a small courtyard workshop . standing among the scattered bicycle parts , tools and cans of paint , lange looks into the half-finished driver 's cab of his latest creation , a " velotaxi " with room for luggage .

though the cargo cruiser are unlikely to replace trucks in german urban areas , hoppe said he still believes the cruisers could eventually help cut down on some of the trips the trucks have to travel - one day making their construction viable for dreiradbau . achim beier , managing director of messenger , agreed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.08.2009 old heads at new clubs hope to take teams to bundesliga title glory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg will defend their title under a new coach the bundesliga coach carousel is often as enthralling as the player swaps which take place every summer .
this year , three experienced managers take on new teams all capable of winning the league . when felix magath rolled up at wolfsburg before last season , more than a few eyebrows were raised .
the sometimes abrasive former bayern munich , who coached the bavarian giants to a double “ double ” of league and cup successes in his brief tenure , had offers from a number of top flight clubs after being sacked in february 2007 , but chose a struggling , mediocre team which had flirted with relegation for the previous two seasons .
the rest is history .
wolfsburg picked up their first league crown in may after magath had spent wisely and cannily in the transfer market and cast the wolves in his disciplined image .
wolfsburg , hardly a fashionable unit and usually mid- to lower table fodder for the big guns , were champions , hardly put a foot wrong last season as the side felix built swept the league .
bildunterschrift : magath 's arrival at schalke has taken expectations at the club even higher than usual maybe the 56-year-old magath did n't really believe that his new charges could win the league and he was as surprised as everyone else .
why else would he have agreed to leave the club before the season was even over , with his name penciled in as the new coach of schalke 04 for the 2009/10 season , before wolfsburg had shown what they were really capable of ?
but sign for schalke he did .
one wonders if a man of fewer scruples would have reneged on the agreement in the light of wolfsburg 's impressive season and stayed on to defend the title ?
felix magath may be a lot of things but he is not a deal breaker and as such will lead perennial bundesliga bridesmaids schalke this season and not the reigning champions of wolfsburg .
the royal blues spent most of last season in disarray and magath 's first job has to be to build some team spirit and plug gaps in their defense before their first league game against newly-promoted nuremburg on saturday .
after building a championship winning side out of wolfsburg , expectations are high – even by schalke 's standards .
a club which regularly promises much and more often than not delivers little -lrb- or at best waits until the final minute to choke and break the hearts of its fans -rrb- , schalke is desperate for success and magath comes with a record which suggests he could be the man to turn around their eternally disappointing fortunes .
armin veh : following in felix 's footsteps bildunterschrift : veh has quite an act to follow as he leads wolfsburg into a title defense and the champions league while magath attempts to awaken not so much a sleeping giant as a comatose one , armin veh takes over at wolfsburg with an equally challenging mission laid at his door .
with the wolves defending their first crown and with champions league soccer coming to the home of volkswagen this season , the former stuttgart coach has a high set of standards to maintain .
not only that but the fans have come to expect an attacking style of play rarely seen in wolfsburg .
veh comes to wolfsburg with championship credentials after leading stuttgart to the 2007 title .
but his team buckled during their defense the following season , sinking to the lower reaches of the league before rallying to a sixth-placed finish .
veh was sacked in november 2008 when stuttgart 's results suggested another season of mediocrity beckoned .
veh 's first game in charge is against his former club in the season 's opening game .
the new wolfsburg manager can count himself lucky that he has managed to keep hold of key strikers edwin dzeko and brazilian grafite despite interest from some of europe 's top clubs this summer .
between them , the pair netted 54 league goals , but it remains to be seen if the team can repeat their surprise success or handle the step up to the champions league where they will make their debut .
" the team is very motivated .
my initial impressions from the first training camp have absolutely been confirmed , " veh said , whose attacking options have been further boosted by the arrival of nigerian striker obafemi martins from newcastle .
" we are looking forward to the season and showing what we can do . "
direct dutchman talking tough in bayern bildunterschrift : van gaal will have to draw on his experience at europe 's top clubs to deal with bayern 's demands challenging both of these men is another manager taking the reins of a new club .
bayern munich , who sacked ex-germany coach juergen klinsmann in april , saw out last season under the considered eye caretaker coach jupp heynckes .
but it will be dutchman louis van gaal who takes on the highest-profile job in german league soccer this season .
the former barcelona , ajax and holland coach arrives in germany after leading unfancied az alkmaar to the dutch title last season .
he may have to dig into his experience at the bigger clubs on his cv to cope with the expectation which comes with managing bayern , where domestic honors are demanded and champions league success is expected .
the 57-year-old van gaal has inherited an embarrassment of riches in attack with bayern 's squad containing germany strikers mario gomez and miroslav klose , as well as italian world cup winner luca toni and croatia 's ivica olic .
promising youngster thomas mueller makes it five forwards pushing for two places in van gaal 's starting line-up and the straight-taking coach is expected to stamp his mark on the side .
bayern captain mark van bommel said the players are responding to his direct approach .
" he clearly tells us what he wants to see .
he 's a straight talker ; he corrects you and urges you on . "
raised voices on the practice ground from time to time are not a problem , says van bommel .
" it 's criticism to help you improve .
it 's well-intentioned , to stop it happening again . "
the dutchman 's first league game in charge is against last season 's dark horses hoffenheim who led the league on their debut bundesliga season at christmas before falling off the pace. nda / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pedestrians , he added , have learned to keep out of his way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an entire pallet of cargo can fit into the cruiser hoppe said he 's had to answer a lot of questions about the bike from curious onlookers in berlin who sometimes keep him from getting to his customers , which include federal ministries , the post office and several large companies . " it 's usually older men who want to take a closer look at my bike , " he added . not a moneymaker while pedaling hundreds of kilos of cargo around berlin keeps the 50-year-old fit , it 's not fattening his wallet . " i 'll be on the road for about 12 hours today , but i 'll only make about 80 to 90 euros -lrb- $ 115-130 -rrb- , " he said .
" the job 's not going to make me rich . " olaf lange is also not going to get rich with his tricycle construction company dreiradbau .
also based in berlin , lange and two employees tinker away on a cargo cruiser in a small courtyard workshop . standing among the scattered bicycle parts , tools and cans of paint , lange looks into the half-finished driver 's cab of his latest creation , a " velotaxi " with room for luggage .
still a labor of love , cargo-carrying bikes are n't proving lucrative for dreiradbau , according to lange . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cargo cruiser is around four feet wide and fit on bike paths currently , five cargo cruisers exist : two in berlin and three in the netherlands , where a pilot project has a small town is trying to its trash on the cruisers . " we still need a major client , " lange said , adding that there are few profits after investing in prototypes . the messenger courier agency is dreiradbau 's last hope .
though the cargo cruiser are unlikely to replace trucks in german urban areas , hoppe said he still believes the cruisers could eventually help cut down on some of the trips the trucks have to travel - one day making their construction viable for dreiradbau . achim beier , managing director of messenger , agreed . " according to our calculations , the cruiser could replace about 20 percent of cargo-carrying vehicles in berlin in the next five years , " he said .

this year , three experienced managers take on new teams all capable of winning the league . when felix magath rolled up at wolfsburg before last season , more than a few eyebrows were raised .
the sometimes abrasive former bayern munich , who coached the bavarian giants to a double “ double ” of league and cup successes in his brief tenure , had offers from a number of top flight clubs after being sacked in february 2007 , but chose a struggling , mediocre team which had flirted with relegation for the previous two seasons .
the rest is history .
wolfsburg picked up their first league crown in may after magath had spent wisely and cannily in the transfer market and cast the wolves in his disciplined image .
wolfsburg , hardly a fashionable unit and usually mid- to lower table fodder for the big guns , were champions , hardly put a foot wrong last season as the side felix built swept the league .

felix magath may be a lot of things but he is not a deal breaker and as such will lead perennial bundesliga bridesmaids schalke this season and not the reigning champions of wolfsburg .
the royal blues spent most of last season in disarray and magath 's first job has to be to build some team spirit and plug gaps in their defense before their first league game against newly-promoted nuremburg on saturday .
after building a championship winning side out of wolfsburg , expectations are high – even by schalke 's standards .
a club which regularly promises much and more often than not delivers little -lrb- or at best waits until the final minute to choke and break the hearts of its fans -rrb- , schalke is desperate for success and magath comes with a record which suggests he could be the man to turn around their eternally disappointing fortunes .

just as their handcuffs were removed , their armed accomplices entered the room , threatened the five guards and helped the men flee .
the group later fired at police who were chasing them , and they have not been seen since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the palace of justice is impossible to secure , says justice minister de clerck belgian justice minister stefan de clerck has come under attack for the incident .
de clerck admitted that the accused men , each with a criminal record , should have been guarded by armed police instead of just security personnel .
he said the 19th century palace of justice was " a belgian icon , a monument with magnificent architecture " and numerous entrances that would be impossible to completely secure .
" we need to totally isolate and handle criminal cases in another part of the building , " he said .
multiple escapes plague justice minister the dramatic caper is the third such jailbreak in 12 days .
two weeks ago a helicopter airlifted three dangerous inmates out from a prison yard in bruges .
two of those men are still on the run , one of them 26-year-old ashraf sekkaki , described by the international police organization interpol as one of belgium 's most dangerous criminals .
last week six convicts were able to use a ladder from a construction site inside their prison in northern belgium to hop the prison wall .
while four escapees were immediately stopped , two of them , serving sentences for rape , torture and violent robbery , were able to get away in a car waiting for them .
oddly enough , it 's not a crime to break out of prison in belgium .
it 's natural to want freedom , goes the argument .
but it is illegal to help someone to escape .
for example , the elderly mother of one escaped prisoner could get three years in jail as she had been waiting with the getaway car .
the pressure is now on de clerck to explain the rash of escapes .
he was forced to resign from the same position he holds now in 1998 when a murderer and pedophile was able to escape for a few hours .
when the 1998 debacle came up in a television interview with de clerck after wednesday 's incident , the minister bristled at the host .
" i do my work .
i do what i have to do , " said de clerck , who only recently resumed his old post when a new government was formed late last year .
" i had six months time to work here and then you make such a laughable comment .
i think it 's inappropriate . "
the most significant effect of the escapes so far is that outdoor time for belgian prisoners has been limited .
another inmate of the bruges prison , freddy horion , convicted of multiple murders , has now sued the state for not allowing him to exercise in the fresh air. hf / afp / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 05.08.2009 german celebrities go on air to persuade people to vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " get out and vote " is the message from german celebrities german elections are less than two months away and , as the parties step up their campaigns , celebrities have been roped in to get the message across to the general public that voting is important . a few weeks ago an independent internet advertisement , produced by politik-digital.de , appeared , in which german celebrities , including two well-known news anchors , seemed to be telling people not to vote .
the video carried the slogan " don ’ t go to the polls " and was a copy of a us video campaign that ran ahead of the 2008 elections .
in the american version , a host of a-listers advise viewers not to bother to go and vote , complaining that politicians are all the same and asking why anyone should care what happens to health care , education or the environment .
the video was , of course , ironic and the same stars then told the public that the only way to make a difference on issues that mattered to them , was to vote .
a year later and politik-digital.de , headed by stefan gehrke , has produced a similar video using german celebrities and employing the same tactic .
but in the german version the clip ends with the celebrities still telling people not to vote .
provoking the public this change was a deliberate attempt by gehrke to provoke the public .
" we wanted to provoke , because we know there have been a lot of campaigns against voter apathy in recent years that have n't worked .
that ’ s why we thought we would take the risk that some people might not get the irony . we had the anchor man of the german news show , ' tagesschau ‘ and he is normally very conservative just reading the news .
he says in the video , ' you may not believe me , me but i don ’ t vote .
i think , if you think for just one second , you get that it would never be possible that this guy wouldn ’ t vote or would tell the people not to vote , " says gehrke .
a week later the company released a second video , which , like the us version , shows the stars abandoning all irony and telling the public to get out and vote .
replying to accusations that the campaign may have backfired and that the original irony was lost on the german public , gehrke says he is happy for the media attention this has brought to the problem he is actually trying to tackle , which is voter apathy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this way to vote " - the hope is that more voters will heed the call in 2009 since an all-time high in 1976 when 90 percent of the population cast their votes , voter turnout in germany has been decreasing .
and although the decline has been marginal – dropping from 79 percent in 1994 to 77.7 percent in 2005 – it is reason enough for the german institute for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- to want to play an active role in getting german voters back to the polling booths .
with just over fifty days to go before election day , more than 80 german celebrities and sports stars have taken part in a bpb advertising campaign that hopes to inspire people to go out and vote .
as of wednesday morning the ads are freely available to all radio stations .
" we don ’ t care who you vote for , just as long as you vote ! "
thomas krueger , president of the bpb , is running the radio ad campaign .
the production of the ads is part of a service , says krueger , to help radio stations find a way to reach the public that is not simply through the official party campaigns .
" it 's not about who you vote for , or which party you choose .
it 's that you vote in the first place , " krueger says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy is like sport .
if you do n't use it you lose it soccer players philipp lahm of bayern munich and per mertesacker of werder bremen , as well as boxing champion wladimir klitschko , are some of the sports stars taking part in the campaign , which all the celebrities have signed up for free of charge .
" we want to send out a message that federal elections are more than just an obligatory event that are more or less frustrating .
they are our constitutional right and a chance for us to decide which direction germany will take over the next four years . " says krueger .
" democracy is like sport " " if you don ’ t practise , you lose the hang of it , " wladimir klitschko says of democracy .
classical violin virtuoso , anne-sophie mutter asks voters to imagine their neighbor deciding every day what concert – rock , pop or classical - they should listen to .
every day for four years !
all together , 160 german celebrities have taken part in the campaign , which krüger says is about giving the public a political message from people they can actually relate to and not just politicians .
krüger also applauds gehrke ’ s efforts towards the same end , although , he says , you have to be careful to send the message in the right packaging .
" i have a lot of time for irony , but you do have to account for the fact that the german public is different to the us public .
you can ’ t always carry concepts across borders , one has to adapt the concept to the german public .
it 's possible that this sort of irony isn ’ t part of the german psyche yet .
but you have to try everything to get people ’ s attention , " he says .
krüger says he wants people to think again and realise that , even if they feel disillusioned or cynical , their vote is the only way to tackle the issues important to them .
these ads , he says , are our way of giving democracy a boost .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de players -pipe- 05.08.2009 german clubs do good business in transfer market gone mad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german clubs have less to play with but still spend wisely german clubs may not have splashed the cash like some other clubs on the continent but they 've still done good business throughout the summer with all the title challengers adding more firepower ahead of the campaign . the bundesliga 's biggest transfer story during the close-season was the one which did n't happen - the much talked-about future of bayern munich 's franck ribery .
ultimately neither real madrid , barcelona or manchester united were prepared to meet the ever-rising price tag set by the bavarian club where the french international is contracted until 2011 .
the man fans once hailed as " kaiser franck , " now known as " the bavarian diva " by german media , is looking far from imperial with ribery 's commitment to bayern becoming increasingly tarnished during a summer of speculation .
outspoken bayern munich president franz beckenbauer blasted ribery , for , in his view , being more interested in his own career than the club and suggested that the player could still be sold - for 94 million euros -lrb- $ 135 million -rrb- .
" of course we would expect the market price , and if cristiano ronaldo is worth 94 million , then ribery is worth a comparable sum .
but if no offer is forthcoming he must fulfill the terms of his contract until 2011 , " he told sport bild newspaper .
commentators were not entirely convinced by a statement from bayern management which said : " bayern have at no time had and do not have the impression from franck ribery that he would only use bayern in order to further his own career .
he has always given himself and his abilities to the service of the team . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shorts say bayern , the expression says anywhere but here as another season in germany looms , ribery 's attitude continues to make headlines .
when the team assembled for the official pre-season photo session , observers noted the frenchman was unsmiling and distant .
he is due to miss the start of the season through injury and may spend his recuperation time wishing he was at a different stadium - namely the bernabeu in madrid , hob-nobbing with ronaldo , kaka and karim benzema as real madrid chairman florentino perez proudly showed off his multi-million euro signings in the spanish sun .
bayern , overtaken last season by wolfsburg at the top of the league , will be hoping they can hang onto ribery to provide ammunition for mario gomez .
bayern paid 30 million euros to obtain the striker from stuttgart , as they try and win back the coveted bundesliga title .
auf wiedersehen bayern bayern will be without brazilian stalwarts lucio and ze roberto who quit bavaria for inter milan and hamburg respectively in the close season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio expected more respect from new coach van gaal lucio , the veteran central defender , left bayern with a parting shot at new dutch manager louis van gaal who he accused of showing " a lack of respect . "
" i am a world champion -lrb- in the 2002 winning brazil team -rrb- as well as winning the confederations cup twice and was chosen best defender in the bundesliga , ” lucio said as he completed a reported eight million-euro move to the italian champions .
" surely i did not need to show him further proof of my abilities ? "
passing the brazilians on the way out is danijel pranjic , the croatian midfielder who joins bayern from heerenveen and dutch left-back edson braafheid from fc twente .
old boys come home stuttgart , anxious to replace gomez in attack , finally agreed with barcelona the return of their one-time player alexander hleb who spent an unhappy year at camp nou after his transfer from arsenal in 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hleb had a successful mid-decade spell with stuttgart the belarus international opted against a move to inter milan in favor of a move on loan back to the german club where he played from 2000-2005 .
another old boy returning home is international midfielder tim borowski who will again turn out in the colors of german cup holders werder bremen after a spell loan at bayern .
one of the best bits of business in the close season trading frenzy actually did n't involve any exchange of money or player .
bundesliga champions wolfsburg pulled off a coup by managing to hang on to the league 's player of the year , 23-year-old bosnian playmaker edzin dzeko who had been tempted by ac milan .
wolves add martins and algerian whiz-kid wolfsburg also managed to tempt newcastle 's ex-inter milan striker obafemi martins to the bundesliga for a reported 8.5 million euros after the 24-year-old nigerian spent a frustrating five years on tyneside .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obafemi martins brings his skills to the german champs new wolves coach armin veh also added the speedy 26-year-old algeria international karim ziani to the champions ' midfield , paying marseille five million euros for his services .
ziani " fits well in the team and will help us get to our target next season , " veh said .
meanwhile , ex-wolfsburg manager felix magath will welcome talented youngster lewis holtby from aachen after off-loading last year 's expensive dutch midfield flop orlando engelaar onto psv eindhoven .
challengers spend wisely northern challengers hamburg are hoping to shore up their defense with the signature of czech defender david rozenhal from lazio .
" hamburg is a big club with great infrastructure and conditions .
the level at the bundesliga is extremely high and it is always my aim to play high level football , " rozenhal told the club 's web site .
german media have reported the transfer fee at around five million euros .
last season 's surprise package hoffenheim have splashed more of their owner 's cash by signing argentine teenage midfielder franco zuculini for 4.7 million euros from racing club avellaneda and croatian defender josip simunic from hertha berlin for seven million , while picking up ghanaian forward prince tagoe on a free transfer from saudi club al-ittifaq .
presumably looking for a club with a less comical name , argentine goal-scoring sensation lucas barrios has opted to spend this season at the more soberly named borussia dortmund after transferring from colo colo for 4.5 million euros .
the 24-year-old striker hit the net a record 37 times in the 2008 season for the chilean champions and replaces veteran swiss national skipper alexander frei who has departed for basel in his native country for 4.2 million euros. nda / dpa / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ultimately neither real madrid , barcelona or manchester united were prepared to meet the ever-rising price tag set by the bavarian club where the french international is contracted until 2011 .
the man fans once hailed as " kaiser franck , " now known as " the bavarian diva " by german media , is looking far from imperial with ribery 's commitment to bayern becoming increasingly tarnished during a summer of speculation .
outspoken bayern munich president franz beckenbauer blasted ribery , for , in his view , being more interested in his own career than the club and suggested that the player could still be sold - for 94 million euros -lrb- $ 135 million -rrb- .
" of course we would expect the market price , and if cristiano ronaldo is worth 94 million , then ribery is worth a comparable sum .
but if no offer is forthcoming he must fulfill the terms of his contract until 2011 , " he told sport bild newspaper .
commentators were not entirely convinced by a statement from bayern management which said : " bayern have at no time had and do not have the impression from franck ribery that he would only use bayern in order to further his own career .
he has always given himself and his abilities to the service of the team . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shorts say bayern , the expression says anywhere but here as another season in germany looms , ribery 's attitude continues to make headlines .
when the team assembled for the official pre-season photo session , observers noted the frenchman was unsmiling and distant .
he is due to miss the start of the season through injury and may spend his recuperation time wishing he was at a different stadium - namely the bernabeu in madrid , hob-nobbing with ronaldo , kaka and karim benzema as real madrid chairman florentino perez proudly showed off his multi-million euro signings in the spanish sun .
bayern , overtaken last season by wolfsburg at the top of the league , will be hoping they can hang onto ribery to provide ammunition for mario gomez .
bayern paid 30 million euros to obtain the striker from stuttgart , as they try and win back the coveted bundesliga title .
auf wiedersehen bayern bayern will be without brazilian stalwarts lucio and ze roberto who quit bavaria for inter milan and hamburg respectively in the close season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio expected more respect from new coach van gaal lucio , the veteran central defender , left bayern with a parting shot at new dutch manager louis van gaal who he accused of showing " a lack of respect . "
" i am a world champion -lrb- in the 2002 winning brazil team -rrb- as well as winning the confederations cup twice and was chosen best defender in the bundesliga , ” lucio said as he completed a reported eight million-euro move to the italian champions .
" surely i did not need to show him further proof of my abilities ? "
passing the brazilians on the way out is danijel pranjic , the croatian midfielder who joins bayern from heerenveen and dutch left-back edson braafheid from fc twente .
old boys come home stuttgart , anxious to replace gomez in attack , finally agreed with barcelona the return of their one-time player alexander hleb who spent an unhappy year at camp nou after his transfer from arsenal in 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hleb had a successful mid-decade spell with stuttgart the belarus international opted against a move to inter milan in favor of a move on loan back to the german club where he played from 2000-2005 .
another old boy returning home is international midfielder tim borowski who will again turn out in the colors of german cup holders werder bremen after a spell loan at bayern .
one of the best bits of business in the close season trading frenzy actually did n't involve any exchange of money or player .
bundesliga champions wolfsburg pulled off a coup by managing to hang on to the league 's player of the year , 23-year-old bosnian playmaker edzin dzeko who had been tempted by ac milan .
wolves add martins and algerian whiz-kid wolfsburg also managed to tempt newcastle 's ex-inter milan striker obafemi martins to the bundesliga for a reported 8.5 million euros after the 24-year-old nigerian spent a frustrating five years on tyneside .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obafemi martins brings his skills to the german champs new wolves coach armin veh also added the speedy 26-year-old algeria international karim ziani to the champions ' midfield , paying marseille five million euros for his services .
ziani " fits well in the team and will help us get to our target next season , " veh said .
meanwhile , ex-wolfsburg manager felix magath will welcome talented youngster lewis holtby from aachen after off-loading last year 's expensive dutch midfield flop orlando engelaar onto psv eindhoven .
challengers spend wisely northern challengers hamburg are hoping to shore up their defense with the signature of czech defender david rozenhal from lazio .
" hamburg is a big club with great infrastructure and conditions .
the level at the bundesliga is extremely high and it is always my aim to play high level football , " rozenhal told the club 's web site .
german media have reported the transfer fee at around five million euros .
last season 's surprise package hoffenheim have splashed more of their owner 's cash by signing argentine teenage midfielder franco zuculini for 4.7 million euros from racing club avellaneda and croatian defender josip simunic from hertha berlin for seven million , while picking up ghanaian forward prince tagoe on a free transfer from saudi club al-ittifaq .
presumably looking for a club with a less comical name , argentine goal-scoring sensation lucas barrios has opted to spend this season at the more soberly named borussia dortmund after transferring from colo colo for 4.5 million euros .
the 24-year-old striker hit the net a record 37 times in the 2008 season for the chilean champions and replaces veteran swiss national skipper alexander frei who has departed for basel in his native country for 4.2 million euros. nda / dpa / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
german politicians have condemned the eu 's attendance of the ceremony as international criticism continues . german chancellor angela merkel and the leaders of the us , france , britain and italy have refused to offer congratulations to ahmadinejad on his re-election .
the new iranian president has reacted in his inauguration speech by vowing that iran would continue to resist " oppressive powers . "
" we heard that some of the western leaders had decided to recognize but not congratulate the new government .
well , no one in iran is waiting for your messages . "
" iranians will neither value your scowling and bullying nor smiles and greetings , " he said in his speech on wednesday after taking the oath of office in parliament at the start of his second term as president .
ahmadinejad now has two weeks to present a new cabinet .
demonstrations continue in tehran outside the parliamentary building in the capital tehran , police used teargas to try to disperse hundreds of protesters .
earlier , opposition leaders mir hossein mousavi and mehdi karubi said they would continue to contest the election results and would not collaborate with the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has repeatedly called for a recount of the disputed vote at least 20 protesters were killed and more than 1,000 were arrested in the demonstrations and unrest following the june 12 presidential elections .
most of the people taken into custody have been released , though there are still around 250 in jail .
around 100 opposition supporters went on trial over the weekend .
the iranian government insists the presidential election was fair and transparent and has accused western nations of being complicit in the bloody post-election unrest .
criticism of sweden over attending the inauguration within the european union , there had been strong criticism of sweden 's plans to send its ambassador to attend the ceremony to represent the current eu council presidency .
german politician elmar brok , who is also the foreign policy spokesman for the conservatives in the european parliament , warned the eu should be more consistent in its criticism of tehran .
" over the past weeks , the eu has continuously demanded a recount of the vote and new elections .
we also have strongly condemned the arrests and the violence against the demonstrators , " he said .
" we can not now legitimize ahmadinejad 's re-election by attending the ceremony . "
eckhard von klaeden , the foreign policy spokesman for merkel 's cdu , said sweden should have followed the example of most other eu countries by not sending their ambassador .
" europe should stand united in its criticism of the rigged elections and the suppression of the opposition movement , " he said .
germany did not send its ambassador to the inauguration but only a lower-ranked diplomatic official. ai / dpa / ap / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this year , three experienced managers take on new teams all capable of winning the league . when felix magath rolled up at wolfsburg before last season , more than a few eyebrows were raised .
the sometimes abrasive former bayern munich , who coached the bavarian giants to a double “ double ” of league and cup successes in his brief tenure , had offers from a number of top flight clubs after being sacked in february 2007 , but chose a struggling , mediocre team which had flirted with relegation for the previous two seasons .
the rest is history .
wolfsburg picked up their first league crown in may after magath had spent wisely and cannily in the transfer market and cast the wolves in his disciplined image .
wolfsburg , hardly a fashionable unit and usually mid- to lower table fodder for the big guns , were champions , hardly put a foot wrong last season as the side felix built swept the league .
bildunterschrift : magath 's arrival at schalke has taken expectations at the club even higher than usual maybe the 56-year-old magath did n't really believe that his new charges could win the league and he was as surprised as everyone else .
why else would he have agreed to leave the club before the season was even over , with his name penciled in as the new coach of schalke 04 for the 2009/10 season , before wolfsburg had shown what they were really capable of ?
but sign for schalke he did .
one wonders if a man of fewer scruples would have reneged on the agreement in the light of wolfsburg 's impressive season and stayed on to defend the title ?
felix magath may be a lot of things but he is not a deal breaker and as such will lead perennial bundesliga bridesmaids schalke this season and not the reigning champions of wolfsburg .
the royal blues spent most of last season in disarray and magath 's first job has to be to build some team spirit and plug gaps in their defense before their first league game against newly-promoted nuremburg on saturday .
after building a championship winning side out of wolfsburg , expectations are high – even by schalke 's standards .
a club which regularly promises much and more often than not delivers little -lrb- or at best waits until the final minute to choke and break the hearts of its fans -rrb- , schalke is desperate for success and magath comes with a record which suggests he could be the man to turn around their eternally disappointing fortunes .
armin veh : following in felix 's footsteps bildunterschrift : veh has quite an act to follow as he leads wolfsburg into a title defense and the champions league while magath attempts to awaken not so much a sleeping giant as a comatose one , armin veh takes over at wolfsburg with an equally challenging mission laid at his door .
with the wolves defending their first crown and with champions league soccer coming to the home of volkswagen this season , the former stuttgart coach has a high set of standards to maintain .
not only that but the fans have come to expect an attacking style of play rarely seen in wolfsburg .
veh comes to wolfsburg with championship credentials after leading stuttgart to the 2007 title .
but his team buckled during their defense the following season , sinking to the lower reaches of the league before rallying to a sixth-placed finish .
veh was sacked in november 2008 when stuttgart 's results suggested another season of mediocrity beckoned .
veh 's first game in charge is against his former club in the season 's opening game .
the new wolfsburg manager can count himself lucky that he has managed to keep hold of key strikers edwin dzeko and brazilian grafite despite interest from some of europe 's top clubs this summer .
between them , the pair netted 54 league goals , but it remains to be seen if the team can repeat their surprise success or handle the step up to the champions league where they will make their debut .
" the team is very motivated .
my initial impressions from the first training camp have absolutely been confirmed , " veh said , whose attacking options have been further boosted by the arrival of nigerian striker obafemi martins from newcastle .
" we are looking forward to the season and showing what we can do . "
direct dutchman talking tough in bayern bildunterschrift : van gaal will have to draw on his experience at europe 's top clubs to deal with bayern 's demands challenging both of these men is another manager taking the reins of a new club .
bayern munich , who sacked ex-germany coach juergen klinsmann in april , saw out last season under the considered eye caretaker coach jupp heynckes .
but it will be dutchman louis van gaal who takes on the highest-profile job in german league soccer this season .
the former barcelona , ajax and holland coach arrives in germany after leading unfancied az alkmaar to the dutch title last season .
he may have to dig into his experience at the bigger clubs on his cv to cope with the expectation which comes with managing bayern , where domestic honors are demanded and champions league success is expected .
the 57-year-old van gaal has inherited an embarrassment of riches in attack with bayern 's squad containing germany strikers mario gomez and miroslav klose , as well as italian world cup winner luca toni and croatia 's ivica olic .
promising youngster thomas mueller makes it five forwards pushing for two places in van gaal 's starting line-up and the straight-taking coach is expected to stamp his mark on the side .
bayern captain mark van bommel said the players are responding to his direct approach .
" he clearly tells us what he wants to see .
he 's a straight talker ; he corrects you and urges you on . "
raised voices on the practice ground from time to time are not a problem , says van bommel .
" it 's criticism to help you improve .
it 's well-intentioned , to stop it happening again . "
the dutchman 's first league game in charge is against last season 's dark horses hoffenheim who led the league on their debut bundesliga season at christmas before falling off the pace. nda / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the data were not job-specific , they should not have been collected . "
earlier this year , deutsche bahn confirmed it had scoured the personal data of 173,000 workers , around three-fourths of its workforce , for signs of dubious relations with suppliers .

the announcement came in response to a report by the german weekly der spiegel , which claimed that deutsche bahn had not only - as previously assumed - monitored hundreds of thousands of employees ' e-mails , but also secretly searched their computer hard drives . company rejects claim of spying on minister the existing spying quagmire was rendered even more treacherous by additional media reports linking the company 's monitoring activity to a german parliamentarian .
according to the berliner tagesspiegel newspaper , transportation expert and social democrat uwe beckmeyer was on a blacklist of 30 deutsche bahn critics whose e-mail correspondence with company employees had been screened since 2005 .
the company , however , adamantly rejected this specific allegation .
the resulting outcry eventually led to the resignation of the firm 's chief executive hartmut mehdorn. nda / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.08.2009 old heads at new clubs hope to take teams to bundesliga title glory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg will defend their title under a new coach the bundesliga coach carousel is often as enthralling as the player swaps which take place every summer .
this year , three experienced managers take on new teams all capable of winning the league . when felix magath rolled up at wolfsburg before last season , more than a few eyebrows were raised .
the sometimes abrasive former bayern munich , who coached the bavarian giants to a double “ double ” of league and cup successes in his brief tenure , had offers from a number of top flight clubs after being sacked in february 2007 , but chose a struggling , mediocre team which had flirted with relegation for the previous two seasons .
the rest is history .
wolfsburg picked up their first league crown in may after magath had spent wisely and cannily in the transfer market and cast the wolves in his disciplined image .
wolfsburg , hardly a fashionable unit and usually mid- to lower table fodder for the big guns , were champions , hardly put a foot wrong last season as the side felix built swept the league .
bildunterschrift : magath 's arrival at schalke has taken expectations at the club even higher than usual maybe the 56-year-old magath did n't really believe that his new charges could win the league and he was as surprised as everyone else .
why else would he have agreed to leave the club before the season was even over , with his name penciled in as the new coach of schalke 04 for the 2009/10 season , before wolfsburg had shown what they were really capable of ?
but sign for schalke he did .
one wonders if a man of fewer scruples would have reneged on the agreement in the light of wolfsburg 's impressive season and stayed on to defend the title ?
felix magath may be a lot of things but he is not a deal breaker and as such will lead perennial bundesliga bridesmaids schalke this season and not the reigning champions of wolfsburg .
the royal blues spent most of last season in disarray and magath 's first job has to be to build some team spirit and plug gaps in their defense before their first league game against newly-promoted nuremburg on saturday .
after building a championship winning side out of wolfsburg , expectations are high – even by schalke 's standards .
a club which regularly promises much and more often than not delivers little -lrb- or at best waits until the final minute to choke and break the hearts of its fans -rrb- , schalke is desperate for success and magath comes with a record which suggests he could be the man to turn around their eternally disappointing fortunes .
armin veh : following in felix 's footsteps bildunterschrift : veh has quite an act to follow as he leads wolfsburg into a title defense and the champions league while magath attempts to awaken not so much a sleeping giant as a comatose one , armin veh takes over at wolfsburg with an equally challenging mission laid at his door .
with the wolves defending their first crown and with champions league soccer coming to the home of volkswagen this season , the former stuttgart coach has a high set of standards to maintain .
not only that but the fans have come to expect an attacking style of play rarely seen in wolfsburg .
veh comes to wolfsburg with championship credentials after leading stuttgart to the 2007 title .
but his team buckled during their defense the following season , sinking to the lower reaches of the league before rallying to a sixth-placed finish .
veh was sacked in november 2008 when stuttgart 's results suggested another season of mediocrity beckoned .
veh 's first game in charge is against his former club in the season 's opening game .
the new wolfsburg manager can count himself lucky that he has managed to keep hold of key strikers edwin dzeko and brazilian grafite despite interest from some of europe 's top clubs this summer .
between them , the pair netted 54 league goals , but it remains to be seen if the team can repeat their surprise success or handle the step up to the champions league where they will make their debut .
" the team is very motivated .
my initial impressions from the first training camp have absolutely been confirmed , " veh said , whose attacking options have been further boosted by the arrival of nigerian striker obafemi martins from newcastle .
" we are looking forward to the season and showing what we can do . "
direct dutchman talking tough in bayern bildunterschrift : van gaal will have to draw on his experience at europe 's top clubs to deal with bayern 's demands challenging both of these men is another manager taking the reins of a new club .
bayern munich , who sacked ex-germany coach juergen klinsmann in april , saw out last season under the considered eye caretaker coach jupp heynckes .
but it will be dutchman louis van gaal who takes on the highest-profile job in german league soccer this season .
the former barcelona , ajax and holland coach arrives in germany after leading unfancied az alkmaar to the dutch title last season .
he may have to dig into his experience at the bigger clubs on his cv to cope with the expectation which comes with managing bayern , where domestic honors are demanded and champions league success is expected .
the 57-year-old van gaal has inherited an embarrassment of riches in attack with bayern 's squad containing germany strikers mario gomez and miroslav klose , as well as italian world cup winner luca toni and croatia 's ivica olic .
promising youngster thomas mueller makes it five forwards pushing for two places in van gaal 's starting line-up and the straight-taking coach is expected to stamp his mark on the side .
bayern captain mark van bommel said the players are responding to his direct approach .
" he clearly tells us what he wants to see .
he 's a straight talker ; he corrects you and urges you on . "
raised voices on the practice ground from time to time are not a problem , says van bommel .
" it 's criticism to help you improve .
it 's well-intentioned , to stop it happening again . "

the visit comes as taliban-led violence escalates ahead of the august 20 elections . on his maiden visit to afghanistan , anders fogh rasmussen repeated a pledge he made on his first working day in his job as nato secretary general : to make afghanistan his highest priority . " afghanistan is the first country i 'm visiting in my new capacity as secretary general of nato , " he said at a joint press conference with afghan president hamid karzai in kabul on wednesday . " i give very high priority to afghanistan ; actually it will be my highest priority as secretary general , " rasmussen added . he vowed that troops from the western military alliance would do their utmost to provide " the best possible security " for the august 20 presidential election . " i assure you , the afghan people , that we will stay to support you for as long as it takes to finish our job , " he said in a bid to reassure afghans in the run-up to the polls . first-hand appraisal over 64,000 of some 100,000 international troops deployed from 42 countries are serving in the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan .
nato troops operate alongside a us-led coalition . nato officials say their aim is to help stabilize a country suffering from three decades of war , resurgent islamists , poverty and corruption . rasmussen aims to assess first-hand the fight against an escalating taliban-led insurgency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai and 40 other candidates are in the race to lead the war-torn nation during the visit , which comes just two weeks ahead of nationwide elections , rasmussen was also due to hold talks with some of the other candidates for the presidency . although karzai leads a field of some 40 people standing for the top job , he has been widely criticized for avoiding the public campaign trail and deciding instead to carve out alliances with powerful but often corrupt political kingmakers . appeal to the taliban at wednesday 's press conference , karzai called on the taliban and hezbi islami , an associate group of the taliban , to renounce violence and participate in the elections . " we will request the taliban to have the afghan national interest in their hearts and minds and come and participate in the elections and , through voting , bring stability for afghanistan , " karzai said . " after elections , if i win , my first priority will be solidifying and speeding the peace process with the taliban and hezbi islami , and all other groups who are not part of al-qaeda or other terrorist networks , " he added . the worsening security and high casualties on the side of international troops have forced several nato and non-nato countries to call for talks with taliban militants , who , despite the ouster of their regime some eight years ago , are still a force to be reckoned with . rasmussen ’ s comments reflected that view .
" i am ready to take pragmatic steps that can include the security for our troops and even talks with a number of groups within the afghan society , " he said . however , he was at pains to clarify that a prerequisite for such an engagement was that the groups “ put down their weapons and abide by the laws in this country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and afghan forces have been working together to recapture areas held by taliban militants securing taliban strongholds with campaigning for the presidential and provincial council elections in full swing , nato forces are pressing ahead with operations designed to secure taliban strongholds in a last bid to allow voting to take place in restive areas . " our troops will do their utmost to ensure the best possible security around the elections , " rasmussen said , adding : " it is an opportunity for the afghan people to demonstrate that you do not bow to threats and violence of the enemies of afghanistan . " the election is afghanistan 's only second-ever democratic poll after the extremist taliban regime was ousted back in 2001 . the taliban , who ruled afghanistan between 1996 and 2001 , have managed to orchestrate an insurgency that has escalated to record levels .
the intensification is putting a huge strain on us and nato-led forces that have grown to number more than 100,000 . there are concerns that violence will overshadow the elections , deter afghans from going out to vote , and undermine the credibility of a poll that is being seen as a test of an internationally-funded drive to install democracy . bundeswehr troops in isaf bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 3,500 troops stationed in northern afghanistan as part of the isaf mission last month , officials in berlin confirmed that germany 's military , the bundeswehr , was engaged in its largest-ever offensive against the taliban .
this was in response to increased taliban attacks in the north of the country , where most of germany ’ s 3,700 troops are stationed . the latest deployment involved some 300 members of the bundeswehr 's quick reaction force and , for the first time , included armored units fighting with close air support . german defence minister franz josef jung justified the offensive , saying : " we are now being particularly challenged in kunduz . "
however , jung insisted on calling the operation a " stabilization deployment ” ahead of the elections . not an exit strategy the former danish prime minister took charge of the 28-nation nato on monday , pledging to make afghanistan his top priority and prevent the war-torn country from once again becoming a hub of international terrorism . rasmussen , who has a four-year mandate , said the long-term goal was to " move forward concretely and visibly with transferring lead security responsibility in afghanistan to the afghans . " " i believe , during my term , afghans must take over lead responsibility for security in most of their country , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community has spent a huge amount of resources to train afghanistan 's army and police however , he rejected any suggestion that such a strategy amounted to a cut and run strategy as pure propaganda . " let me be clear .
nato must and will be there in support .
let no taliban propaganda try to sell my message as a run for -lrb- the -rrb- exit .
it is not , " he said . while rasmussen ’ s comments were aimed at reassuring afghans , his visit has come at an awkward time , with residents in the southern province of kandahar saying that a nato bomb attack had killed four civilians , including three children . afghan people have become increasingly vocal about their anger over the growing number of civilian casualties as a result of operations by nato and the us-led coalition . rb / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the visit comes as taliban-led violence escalates ahead of the august 20 elections . on his maiden visit to afghanistan , anders fogh rasmussen repeated a pledge he made on his first working day in his job as nato secretary general : to make afghanistan his highest priority . " afghanistan is the first country i 'm visiting in my new capacity as secretary general of nato , " he said at a joint press conference with afghan president hamid karzai in kabul on wednesday . " i give very high priority to afghanistan ; actually it will be my highest priority as secretary general , " rasmussen added . he vowed that troops from the western military alliance would do their utmost to provide " the best possible security " for the august 20 presidential election . " i assure you , the afghan people , that we will stay to support you for as long as it takes to finish our job , " he said in a bid to reassure afghans in the run-up to the polls . first-hand appraisal over 64,000 of some 100,000 international troops deployed from 42 countries are serving in the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan .
nato troops operate alongside a us-led coalition . nato officials say their aim is to help stabilize a country suffering from three decades of war , resurgent islamists , poverty and corruption . rasmussen aims to assess first-hand the fight against an escalating taliban-led insurgency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai and 40 other candidates are in the race to lead the war-torn nation during the visit , which comes just two weeks ahead of nationwide elections , rasmussen was also due to hold talks with some of the other candidates for the presidency . although karzai leads a field of some 40 people standing for the top job , he has been widely criticized for avoiding the public campaign trail and deciding instead to carve out alliances with powerful but often corrupt political kingmakers . appeal to the taliban at wednesday 's press conference , karzai called on the taliban and hezbi islami , an associate group of the taliban , to renounce violence and participate in the elections . " we will request the taliban to have the afghan national interest in their hearts and minds and come and participate in the elections and , through voting , bring stability for afghanistan , " karzai said . " after elections , if i win , my first priority will be solidifying and speeding the peace process with the taliban and hezbi islami , and all other groups who are not part of al-qaeda or other terrorist networks , " he added . the worsening security and high casualties on the side of international troops have forced several nato and non-nato countries to call for talks with taliban militants , who , despite the ouster of their regime some eight years ago , are still a force to be reckoned with . rasmussen ’ s comments reflected that view .
" i am ready to take pragmatic steps that can include the security for our troops and even talks with a number of groups within the afghan society , " he said . however , he was at pains to clarify that a prerequisite for such an engagement was that the groups “ put down their weapons and abide by the laws in this country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and afghan forces have been working together to recapture areas held by taliban militants securing taliban strongholds with campaigning for the presidential and provincial council elections in full swing , nato forces are pressing ahead with operations designed to secure taliban strongholds in a last bid to allow voting to take place in restive areas . " our troops will do their utmost to ensure the best possible security around the elections , " rasmussen said , adding : " it is an opportunity for the afghan people to demonstrate that you do not bow to threats and violence of the enemies of afghanistan . " the election is afghanistan 's only second-ever democratic poll after the extremist taliban regime was ousted back in 2001 . the taliban , who ruled afghanistan between 1996 and 2001 , have managed to orchestrate an insurgency that has escalated to record levels .
the intensification is putting a huge strain on us and nato-led forces that have grown to number more than 100,000 . there are concerns that violence will overshadow the elections , deter afghans from going out to vote , and undermine the credibility of a poll that is being seen as a test of an internationally-funded drive to install democracy . bundeswehr troops in isaf bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 3,500 troops stationed in northern afghanistan as part of the isaf mission last month , officials in berlin confirmed that germany 's military , the bundeswehr , was engaged in its largest-ever offensive against the taliban .

" over the past weeks , the eu has continuously demanded a recount of the vote and new elections .
we also have strongly condemned the arrests and the violence against the demonstrators , " he said .
" we can not now legitimize ahmadinejad 's re-election by attending the ceremony . "
eckhard von klaeden , the foreign policy spokesman for merkel 's cdu , said sweden should have followed the example of most other eu countries by not sending their ambassador .
" europe should stand united in its criticism of the rigged elections and the suppression of the opposition movement , " he said .
germany did not send its ambassador to the inauguration but only a lower-ranked diplomatic official. ai / dpa / ap / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the announcement came in response to a report by the german weekly der spiegel , which claimed that deutsche bahn had not only - as previously assumed - monitored hundreds of thousands of employees ' e-mails , but also secretly searched their computer hard drives . company rejects claim of spying on minister the existing spying quagmire was rendered even more treacherous by additional media reports linking the company 's monitoring activity to a german parliamentarian .

just as their handcuffs were removed , their armed accomplices entered the room , threatened the five guards and helped the men flee .
the group later fired at police who were chasing them , and they have not been seen since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the palace of justice is impossible to secure , says justice minister de clerck belgian justice minister stefan de clerck has come under attack for the incident .
de clerck admitted that the accused men , each with a criminal record , should have been guarded by armed police instead of just security personnel .
he said the 19th century palace of justice was " a belgian icon , a monument with magnificent architecture " and numerous entrances that would be impossible to completely secure .
" we need to totally isolate and handle criminal cases in another part of the building , " he said .
multiple escapes plague justice minister the dramatic caper is the third such jailbreak in 12 days .
two weeks ago a helicopter airlifted three dangerous inmates out from a prison yard in bruges .
two of those men are still on the run , one of them 26-year-old ashraf sekkaki , described by the international police organization interpol as one of belgium 's most dangerous criminals .
last week six convicts were able to use a ladder from a construction site inside their prison in northern belgium to hop the prison wall .
while four escapees were immediately stopped , two of them , serving sentences for rape , torture and violent robbery , were able to get away in a car waiting for them .
oddly enough , it 's not a crime to break out of prison in belgium .
it 's natural to want freedom , goes the argument .
but it is illegal to help someone to escape .
for example , the elderly mother of one escaped prisoner could get three years in jail as she had been waiting with the getaway car .
the pressure is now on de clerck to explain the rash of escapes .
he was forced to resign from the same position he holds now in 1998 when a murderer and pedophile was able to escape for a few hours .
when the 1998 debacle came up in a television interview with de clerck after wednesday 's incident , the minister bristled at the host .
" i do my work .
i do what i have to do , " said de clerck , who only recently resumed his old post when a new government was formed late last year .
" i had six months time to work here and then you make such a laughable comment .
i think it 's inappropriate . "
the most significant effect of the escapes so far is that outdoor time for belgian prisoners has been limited .
another inmate of the bruges prison , freddy horion , convicted of multiple murders , has now sued the state for not allowing him to exercise in the fresh air. hf / afp / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the video carried the slogan " don ’ t go to the polls " and was a copy of a us video campaign that ran ahead of the 2008 elections .
in the american version , a host of a-listers advise viewers not to bother to go and vote , complaining that politicians are all the same and asking why anyone should care what happens to health care , education or the environment .
the video was , of course , ironic and the same stars then told the public that the only way to make a difference on issues that mattered to them , was to vote .
a year later and politik-digital.de , headed by stefan gehrke , has produced a similar video using german celebrities and employing the same tactic .
but in the german version the clip ends with the celebrities still telling people not to vote .
provoking the public this change was a deliberate attempt by gehrke to provoke the public .
" we wanted to provoke , because we know there have been a lot of campaigns against voter apathy in recent years that have n't worked .
that ’ s why we thought we would take the risk that some people might not get the irony . we had the anchor man of the german news show , ' tagesschau ‘ and he is normally very conservative just reading the news .
he says in the video , ' you may not believe me , me but i don ’ t vote .
i think , if you think for just one second , you get that it would never be possible that this guy wouldn ’ t vote or would tell the people not to vote , " says gehrke .
a week later the company released a second video , which , like the us version , shows the stars abandoning all irony and telling the public to get out and vote .
replying to accusations that the campaign may have backfired and that the original irony was lost on the german public , gehrke says he is happy for the media attention this has brought to the problem he is actually trying to tackle , which is voter apathy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this way to vote " - the hope is that more voters will heed the call in 2009 since an all-time high in 1976 when 90 percent of the population cast their votes , voter turnout in germany has been decreasing .
and although the decline has been marginal – dropping from 79 percent in 1994 to 77.7 percent in 2005 – it is reason enough for the german institute for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- to want to play an active role in getting german voters back to the polling booths .
with just over fifty days to go before election day , more than 80 german celebrities and sports stars have taken part in a bpb advertising campaign that hopes to inspire people to go out and vote .
as of wednesday morning the ads are freely available to all radio stations .
" we don ’ t care who you vote for , just as long as you vote ! "
thomas krueger , president of the bpb , is running the radio ad campaign .
the production of the ads is part of a service , says krueger , to help radio stations find a way to reach the public that is not simply through the official party campaigns .
" it 's not about who you vote for , or which party you choose .
it 's that you vote in the first place , " krueger says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy is like sport .

" we want to send out a message that federal elections are more than just an obligatory event that are more or less frustrating .

krüger also applauds gehrke ’ s efforts towards the same end , although , he says , you have to be careful to send the message in the right packaging .
" i have a lot of time for irony , but you do have to account for the fact that the german public is different to the us public .
you can ’ t always carry concepts across borders , one has to adapt the concept to the german public .
it 's possible that this sort of irony isn ’ t part of the german psyche yet .
but you have to try everything to get people ’ s attention , " he says .
krüger says he wants people to think again and realise that , even if they feel disillusioned or cynical , their vote is the only way to tackle the issues important to them .
these ads , he says , are our way of giving democracy a boost .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 05.08.2009 german celebrities go on air to persuade people to vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " get out and vote " is the message from german celebrities german elections are less than two months away and , as the parties step up their campaigns , celebrities have been roped in to get the message across to the general public that voting is important . a few weeks ago an independent internet advertisement , produced by politik-digital.de , appeared , in which german celebrities , including two well-known news anchors , seemed to be telling people not to vote .
the video carried the slogan " don ’ t go to the polls " and was a copy of a us video campaign that ran ahead of the 2008 elections .
in the american version , a host of a-listers advise viewers not to bother to go and vote , complaining that politicians are all the same and asking why anyone should care what happens to health care , education or the environment .
the video was , of course , ironic and the same stars then told the public that the only way to make a difference on issues that mattered to them , was to vote .
a year later and politik-digital.de , headed by stefan gehrke , has produced a similar video using german celebrities and employing the same tactic .
but in the german version the clip ends with the celebrities still telling people not to vote .
provoking the public this change was a deliberate attempt by gehrke to provoke the public .
" we wanted to provoke , because we know there have been a lot of campaigns against voter apathy in recent years that have n't worked .
that ’ s why we thought we would take the risk that some people might not get the irony . we had the anchor man of the german news show , ' tagesschau ‘ and he is normally very conservative just reading the news .
he says in the video , ' you may not believe me , me but i don ’ t vote .
i think , if you think for just one second , you get that it would never be possible that this guy wouldn ’ t vote or would tell the people not to vote , " says gehrke .
a week later the company released a second video , which , like the us version , shows the stars abandoning all irony and telling the public to get out and vote .
replying to accusations that the campaign may have backfired and that the original irony was lost on the german public , gehrke says he is happy for the media attention this has brought to the problem he is actually trying to tackle , which is voter apathy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this way to vote " - the hope is that more voters will heed the call in 2009 since an all-time high in 1976 when 90 percent of the population cast their votes , voter turnout in germany has been decreasing .
and although the decline has been marginal – dropping from 79 percent in 1994 to 77.7 percent in 2005 – it is reason enough for the german institute for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- to want to play an active role in getting german voters back to the polling booths .
with just over fifty days to go before election day , more than 80 german celebrities and sports stars have taken part in a bpb advertising campaign that hopes to inspire people to go out and vote .
as of wednesday morning the ads are freely available to all radio stations .
" we don ’ t care who you vote for , just as long as you vote ! "
thomas krueger , president of the bpb , is running the radio ad campaign .
the production of the ads is part of a service , says krueger , to help radio stations find a way to reach the public that is not simply through the official party campaigns .
" it 's not about who you vote for , or which party you choose .
it 's that you vote in the first place , " krueger says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy is like sport .
if you do n't use it you lose it soccer players philipp lahm of bayern munich and per mertesacker of werder bremen , as well as boxing champion wladimir klitschko , are some of the sports stars taking part in the campaign , which all the celebrities have signed up for free of charge .
" we want to send out a message that federal elections are more than just an obligatory event that are more or less frustrating .
they are our constitutional right and a chance for us to decide which direction germany will take over the next four years . " says krueger .
" democracy is like sport " " if you don ’ t practise , you lose the hang of it , " wladimir klitschko says of democracy .
classical violin virtuoso , anne-sophie mutter asks voters to imagine their neighbor deciding every day what concert – rock , pop or classical - they should listen to .
every day for four years !
all together , 160 german celebrities have taken part in the campaign , which krüger says is about giving the public a political message from people they can actually relate to and not just politicians .
krüger also applauds gehrke ’ s efforts towards the same end , although , he says , you have to be careful to send the message in the right packaging .
" i have a lot of time for irony , but you do have to account for the fact that the german public is different to the us public .
you can ’ t always carry concepts across borders , one has to adapt the concept to the german public .
it 's possible that this sort of irony isn ’ t part of the german psyche yet .
but you have to try everything to get people ’ s attention , " he says .
krüger says he wants people to think again and realise that , even if they feel disillusioned or cynical , their vote is the only way to tackle the issues important to them .
these ads , he says , are our way of giving democracy a boost .

the visit comes as taliban-led violence escalates ahead of the august 20 elections . on his maiden visit to afghanistan , anders fogh rasmussen repeated a pledge he made on his first working day in his job as nato secretary general : to make afghanistan his highest priority . " afghanistan is the first country i 'm visiting in my new capacity as secretary general of nato , " he said at a joint press conference with afghan president hamid karzai in kabul on wednesday . " i give very high priority to afghanistan ; actually it will be my highest priority as secretary general , " rasmussen added . he vowed that troops from the western military alliance would do their utmost to provide " the best possible security " for the august 20 presidential election . " i assure you , the afghan people , that we will stay to support you for as long as it takes to finish our job , " he said in a bid to reassure afghans in the run-up to the polls . first-hand appraisal over 64,000 of some 100,000 international troops deployed from 42 countries are serving in the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan .
nato troops operate alongside a us-led coalition . nato officials say their aim is to help stabilize a country suffering from three decades of war , resurgent islamists , poverty and corruption . rasmussen aims to assess first-hand the fight against an escalating taliban-led insurgency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai and 40 other candidates are in the race to lead the war-torn nation during the visit , which comes just two weeks ahead of nationwide elections , rasmussen was also due to hold talks with some of the other candidates for the presidency . although karzai leads a field of some 40 people standing for the top job , he has been widely criticized for avoiding the public campaign trail and deciding instead to carve out alliances with powerful but often corrupt political kingmakers . appeal to the taliban at wednesday 's press conference , karzai called on the taliban and hezbi islami , an associate group of the taliban , to renounce violence and participate in the elections . " we will request the taliban to have the afghan national interest in their hearts and minds and come and participate in the elections and , through voting , bring stability for afghanistan , " karzai said . " after elections , if i win , my first priority will be solidifying and speeding the peace process with the taliban and hezbi islami , and all other groups who are not part of al-qaeda or other terrorist networks , " he added . the worsening security and high casualties on the side of international troops have forced several nato and non-nato countries to call for talks with taliban militants , who , despite the ouster of their regime some eight years ago , are still a force to be reckoned with . rasmussen ’ s comments reflected that view .
" i am ready to take pragmatic steps that can include the security for our troops and even talks with a number of groups within the afghan society , " he said . however , he was at pains to clarify that a prerequisite for such an engagement was that the groups “ put down their weapons and abide by the laws in this country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and afghan forces have been working together to recapture areas held by taliban militants securing taliban strongholds with campaigning for the presidential and provincial council elections in full swing , nato forces are pressing ahead with operations designed to secure taliban strongholds in a last bid to allow voting to take place in restive areas . " our troops will do their utmost to ensure the best possible security around the elections , " rasmussen said , adding : " it is an opportunity for the afghan people to demonstrate that you do not bow to threats and violence of the enemies of afghanistan . " the election is afghanistan 's only second-ever democratic poll after the extremist taliban regime was ousted back in 2001 . the taliban , who ruled afghanistan between 1996 and 2001 , have managed to orchestrate an insurgency that has escalated to record levels .
the intensification is putting a huge strain on us and nato-led forces that have grown to number more than 100,000 . there are concerns that violence will overshadow the elections , deter afghans from going out to vote , and undermine the credibility of a poll that is being seen as a test of an internationally-funded drive to install democracy . bundeswehr troops in isaf bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 3,500 troops stationed in northern afghanistan as part of the isaf mission last month , officials in berlin confirmed that germany 's military , the bundeswehr , was engaged in its largest-ever offensive against the taliban .
this was in response to increased taliban attacks in the north of the country , where most of germany ’ s 3,700 troops are stationed . the latest deployment involved some 300 members of the bundeswehr 's quick reaction force and , for the first time , included armored units fighting with close air support . german defence minister franz josef jung justified the offensive , saying : " we are now being particularly challenged in kunduz . "
however , jung insisted on calling the operation a " stabilization deployment ” ahead of the elections . not an exit strategy the former danish prime minister took charge of the 28-nation nato on monday , pledging to make afghanistan his top priority and prevent the war-torn country from once again becoming a hub of international terrorism . rasmussen , who has a four-year mandate , said the long-term goal was to " move forward concretely and visibly with transferring lead security responsibility in afghanistan to the afghans . " " i believe , during my term , afghans must take over lead responsibility for security in most of their country , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community has spent a huge amount of resources to train afghanistan 's army and police however , he rejected any suggestion that such a strategy amounted to a cut and run strategy as pure propaganda . " let me be clear .
nato must and will be there in support .
let no taliban propaganda try to sell my message as a run for -lrb- the -rrb- exit .
it is not , " he said . while rasmussen ’ s comments were aimed at reassuring afghans , his visit has come at an awkward time , with residents in the southern province of kandahar saying that a nato bomb attack had killed four civilians , including three children . afghan people have become increasingly vocal about their anger over the growing number of civilian casualties as a result of operations by nato and the us-led coalition . rb / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i am ready to take pragmatic steps that can include the security for our troops and even talks with a number of groups within the afghan society , " he said . however , he was at pains to clarify that a prerequisite for such an engagement was that the groups “ put down their weapons and abide by the laws in this country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and afghan forces have been working together to recapture areas held by taliban militants securing taliban strongholds with campaigning for the presidential and provincial council elections in full swing , nato forces are pressing ahead with operations designed to secure taliban strongholds in a last bid to allow voting to take place in restive areas . " our troops will do their utmost to ensure the best possible security around the elections , " rasmussen said , adding : " it is an opportunity for the afghan people to demonstrate that you do not bow to threats and violence of the enemies of afghanistan . " the election is afghanistan 's only second-ever democratic poll after the extremist taliban regime was ousted back in 2001 . the taliban , who ruled afghanistan between 1996 and 2001 , have managed to orchestrate an insurgency that has escalated to record levels .
the intensification is putting a huge strain on us and nato-led forces that have grown to number more than 100,000 . there are concerns that violence will overshadow the elections , deter afghans from going out to vote , and undermine the credibility of a poll that is being seen as a test of an internationally-funded drive to install democracy . bundeswehr troops in isaf bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 3,500 troops stationed in northern afghanistan as part of the isaf mission last month , officials in berlin confirmed that germany 's military , the bundeswehr , was engaged in its largest-ever offensive against the taliban .
this was in response to increased taliban attacks in the north of the country , where most of germany ’ s 3,700 troops are stationed . the latest deployment involved some 300 members of the bundeswehr 's quick reaction force and , for the first time , included armored units fighting with close air support . german defence minister franz josef jung justified the offensive , saying : " we are now being particularly challenged in kunduz . "
however , jung insisted on calling the operation a " stabilization deployment ” ahead of the elections . not an exit strategy the former danish prime minister took charge of the 28-nation nato on monday , pledging to make afghanistan his top priority and prevent the war-torn country from once again becoming a hub of international terrorism . rasmussen , who has a four-year mandate , said the long-term goal was to " move forward concretely and visibly with transferring lead security responsibility in afghanistan to the afghans . " " i believe , during my term , afghans must take over lead responsibility for security in most of their country , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community has spent a huge amount of resources to train afghanistan 's army and police however , he rejected any suggestion that such a strategy amounted to a cut and run strategy as pure propaganda . " let me be clear .
nato must and will be there in support .
let no taliban propaganda try to sell my message as a run for -lrb- the -rrb- exit .
it is not , " he said . while rasmussen ’ s comments were aimed at reassuring afghans , his visit has come at an awkward time , with residents in the southern province of kandahar saying that a nato bomb attack had killed four civilians , including three children . afghan people have become increasingly vocal about their anger over the growing number of civilian casualties as a result of operations by nato and the us-led coalition . rb / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the video carried the slogan " don ’ t go to the polls " and was a copy of a us video campaign that ran ahead of the 2008 elections .
in the american version , a host of a-listers advise viewers not to bother to go and vote , complaining that politicians are all the same and asking why anyone should care what happens to health care , education or the environment .
the video was , of course , ironic and the same stars then told the public that the only way to make a difference on issues that mattered to them , was to vote .
a year later and politik-digital.de , headed by stefan gehrke , has produced a similar video using german celebrities and employing the same tactic .
but in the german version the clip ends with the celebrities still telling people not to vote .
provoking the public this change was a deliberate attempt by gehrke to provoke the public .
" we wanted to provoke , because we know there have been a lot of campaigns against voter apathy in recent years that have n't worked .
that ’ s why we thought we would take the risk that some people might not get the irony . we had the anchor man of the german news show , ' tagesschau ‘ and he is normally very conservative just reading the news .
he says in the video , ' you may not believe me , me but i don ’ t vote .
i think , if you think for just one second , you get that it would never be possible that this guy wouldn ’ t vote or would tell the people not to vote , " says gehrke .
a week later the company released a second video , which , like the us version , shows the stars abandoning all irony and telling the public to get out and vote .
replying to accusations that the campaign may have backfired and that the original irony was lost on the german public , gehrke says he is happy for the media attention this has brought to the problem he is actually trying to tackle , which is voter apathy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this way to vote " - the hope is that more voters will heed the call in 2009 since an all-time high in 1976 when 90 percent of the population cast their votes , voter turnout in germany has been decreasing .
and although the decline has been marginal – dropping from 79 percent in 1994 to 77.7 percent in 2005 – it is reason enough for the german institute for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- to want to play an active role in getting german voters back to the polling booths .
with just over fifty days to go before election day , more than 80 german celebrities and sports stars have taken part in a bpb advertising campaign that hopes to inspire people to go out and vote .
as of wednesday morning the ads are freely available to all radio stations .
" we don ’ t care who you vote for , just as long as you vote ! "
thomas krueger , president of the bpb , is running the radio ad campaign .
the production of the ads is part of a service , says krueger , to help radio stations find a way to reach the public that is not simply through the official party campaigns .
" it 's not about who you vote for , or which party you choose .
it 's that you vote in the first place , " krueger says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy is like sport .
if you do n't use it you lose it soccer players philipp lahm of bayern munich and per mertesacker of werder bremen , as well as boxing champion wladimir klitschko , are some of the sports stars taking part in the campaign , which all the celebrities have signed up for free of charge .
" we want to send out a message that federal elections are more than just an obligatory event that are more or less frustrating .
they are our constitutional right and a chance for us to decide which direction germany will take over the next four years . " says krueger .
" democracy is like sport " " if you don ’ t practise , you lose the hang of it , " wladimir klitschko says of democracy .
classical violin virtuoso , anne-sophie mutter asks voters to imagine their neighbor deciding every day what concert – rock , pop or classical - they should listen to .
every day for four years !
all together , 160 german celebrities have taken part in the campaign , which krüger says is about giving the public a political message from people they can actually relate to and not just politicians .
krüger also applauds gehrke ’ s efforts towards the same end , although , he says , you have to be careful to send the message in the right packaging .
" i have a lot of time for irony , but you do have to account for the fact that the german public is different to the us public .
you can ’ t always carry concepts across borders , one has to adapt the concept to the german public .
it 's possible that this sort of irony isn ’ t part of the german psyche yet .
but you have to try everything to get people ’ s attention , " he says .
krüger says he wants people to think again and realise that , even if they feel disillusioned or cynical , their vote is the only way to tackle the issues important to them .
these ads , he says , are our way of giving democracy a boost .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 05.08.2009 one month since xinjiang unrest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ethnic uighur passes in front of chinese soldiers in urumqi , where unrest broke out last month bloody riots broke out a month ago in the northwestern chinese province of xinjiang .
the figures are still unknown .
the chinese authorities say 197 people died in the clashes between han chinese - the majority population in china - and uighurs - a muslim minority .
the government has accused the munich-based world uighur congress of inciting the violence .
a climate of fear currently reigns over the city of urumqi where the riots broke out . at a car dealership in urumqi , there are burnt-out cars and smoke-blackened walls . riot police with protective shields and machine guns stand on the opposite corner .
duan zongcheng is an 18-year-old mechanic .
he ’ s han chinese and he ’ s scared .
he recalled what had happened : " lots of uighurs went out onto the streets .
they trashed a lot of chinese businesses with rocks .
then they started killing people .
they even pulled them out of their cars .
i was scared .
there were five of us and we escaped to the cellar .
i am now mourning the victims .
they had no chance to defend themselves because they were beaten to death so fast .
i can sense a rift now .
before it used to be perfectly normal when i greeted my uighur neighbours but now it feels dishonest . "
duan zongcheng lives across the road from the car dealership - in a poor district with small houses .
most of his neighbours are uighurs .
but the streets have been empty since the clashes .
uighurs are also scared " the people in this neighbourhood are all from the south of the province of xinjiang , from aksu , hotan and kashgar , ” explained this uighur , who was willing to talk for a short amount of time .
“ when i arrived in urumqi i couldn ’ t speak a word of chinese .
a friend helped me and now it ’ s easier .
people like us don ’ t have land that we can cultivate back home .
that ’ s why we come here to find work .
since the riots , lots of people have left the city because they were scared .
i want to stay .
what else can i do ?
the government doesn ’ t give me anything .
business is bad .
i only have enough to keep my head above water . "
the man ran off after being asked for the reasons behind the violence last month , saying he didn ’ t know .
many han chinese , for their part , say that uighurs are ungrateful - they are allowed to have up to three children and have more access to higher education .
change in minority policy needed pan zhiping from the academy of social sciences in urumqi thinks such privileges should be maintained but that there also needs to be a change in chinese minority policy .
“ i think that in a modern society we have to strengthen the notion of the citizen , ” he said .
“ we should not highlight ethnic identity .
what ’ s it like in germany ?
does a german passport state what ethnic identity somebody is ?
that would not be allowed - it would be almost racist .
what we have to achieve is that if somebody says he belongs to a certain ethnic group and wants to be respected for it , he should get respect .
that ’ s the most important thing .
but if he doesn ’ t think it ’ s important we shouldn ’ t care about his ethnic identity at all . ”
on wednesday , the head of the world uighur congress rebiya kadeer said the chinese authorities had inflamed ethnic tensions in xinjiang by deceiving people about the unrest .
so far , hundreds of people have been detained in connection with the unrest .
according to chinese state media 83 people will formally face charges .

the eu executive has said the subsidies gave french farmers an unfair advantage over their european competitors .
the commission has ruled that french growers now owe a total sum of about 500 million euros , including interest charges .
farmers angry about pay back demands the announcement has been met with widespread anger and disbelief in orchards and vegetable markets across france .
the eu decision comes at a time when farmers in europe 's largest farm economy have already been protesting against a recession-linked drop in demand and sliding incomes .
" we just do n't understand it .
these recent weeks , we 've been telling the government how bad things are for us .
and the first answer we get is this - that we have to pay back money we received 10 even 15 years ago , " salvatore esorordu , a fruit grower from the southern region of gard , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : producer prices for fruit and vegetables are plummeting " it 's a provocation .
prices are at their worst level in 20 years , " he added .
producer prices for fruit and vegetables fell 3.1 percent in june , putting them down 17.6 percent year-on-year , according to latest data from french statistics office insee .
the french fruit and vegetable sector , the third-largest in europe , also says it faces growing cheap competition from fellow eu countries that have lower labor costs .
france to negotiate hefty sum france has disputed the hefty sum the eu wants to claw back from fruit and vegetable farmers .
but if the government fails to refund the money , it would be liable to pay a heavy fine .
typically , such fines are open-ended , calculated on the basis of the time it takes the government to act .
if it does n't comply , the fine goes on increasing .
farm minister bruno le maire said this week that france would accept the eu demand for recouping some of the subsidies , but emphasized that he would negotiate with the eu over the total sum .
he also said he wanted the recovery of subsidies to be done gradually and on a case-by-case basis so as to avoid forcing vulnerable farmers to pay back .
" we want the reimbursements to be spread over time .
it would put an unbearable strain on farmers if they 're forced to pay this money back immediately , " le maire said .
" unfair and immoral " this is not the first time france has been forced to ask farmers to pay back subsidies .
but in the past , french farmers received generous aid directly from the european commission .
this time , any recovery of subsidies will go back into the french budget , not eu coffers .
that 's why the french government has more of an incentive to recoup the cash .
but french farmers are unlikely to accept the demands without a fight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josé bové has urged french farmers to fight the eu demands to pay back subsidies josé bové , a french member of the european parliament and former president of the peasants confederation farmers ' union , has urged civil disobedience .
" the farmers must not reimburse this money , " bové said .
" if the government sends them letters telling them to do so , i encourage them to refuse and disobey because it 's unfair and immoral . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 05.08.2009 french fruit farmers slam eu demands to pay back subsidies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fruit and vegetable farmers in france say they are already suffering from falling prices and incomes the eu has extended a deadline for paris to explain how it will recover huge subsidies paid to its fruit farmers that are now deemed illegal .
but farmers are up in arms over demands to pay back up to 500 million euros . the european commission ruled in january that subsidies worth around 338 million euros -lrb- $ 486.4 million -rrb- paid between 1992 and 2002 by the french government to support its fruit and vegetable sector had violated european farm and state aid policy .
the eu executive has said the subsidies gave french farmers an unfair advantage over their european competitors .
the commission has ruled that french growers now owe a total sum of about 500 million euros , including interest charges .
farmers angry about pay back demands the announcement has been met with widespread anger and disbelief in orchards and vegetable markets across france .
the eu decision comes at a time when farmers in europe 's largest farm economy have already been protesting against a recession-linked drop in demand and sliding incomes .
" we just do n't understand it .
these recent weeks , we 've been telling the government how bad things are for us .
and the first answer we get is this - that we have to pay back money we received 10 even 15 years ago , " salvatore esorordu , a fruit grower from the southern region of gard , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : producer prices for fruit and vegetables are plummeting " it 's a provocation .
prices are at their worst level in 20 years , " he added .
producer prices for fruit and vegetables fell 3.1 percent in june , putting them down 17.6 percent year-on-year , according to latest data from french statistics office insee .
the french fruit and vegetable sector , the third-largest in europe , also says it faces growing cheap competition from fellow eu countries that have lower labor costs .
france to negotiate hefty sum france has disputed the hefty sum the eu wants to claw back from fruit and vegetable farmers .
but if the government fails to refund the money , it would be liable to pay a heavy fine .
typically , such fines are open-ended , calculated on the basis of the time it takes the government to act .
if it does n't comply , the fine goes on increasing .
farm minister bruno le maire said this week that france would accept the eu demand for recouping some of the subsidies , but emphasized that he would negotiate with the eu over the total sum .
he also said he wanted the recovery of subsidies to be done gradually and on a case-by-case basis so as to avoid forcing vulnerable farmers to pay back .
" we want the reimbursements to be spread over time .
it would put an unbearable strain on farmers if they 're forced to pay this money back immediately , " le maire said .
" unfair and immoral " this is not the first time france has been forced to ask farmers to pay back subsidies .
but in the past , french farmers received generous aid directly from the european commission .
this time , any recovery of subsidies will go back into the french budget , not eu coffers .
that 's why the french government has more of an incentive to recoup the cash .
but french farmers are unlikely to accept the demands without a fight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josé bové has urged french farmers to fight the eu demands to pay back subsidies josé bové , a french member of the european parliament and former president of the peasants confederation farmers ' union , has urged civil disobedience .
" the farmers must not reimburse this money , " bové said .
" if the government sends them letters telling them to do so , i encourage them to refuse and disobey because it 's unfair and immoral . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de players -pipe- 05.08.2009 german clubs do good business in transfer market gone mad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german clubs have less to play with but still spend wisely german clubs may not have splashed the cash like some other clubs on the continent but they 've still done good business throughout the summer with all the title challengers adding more firepower ahead of the campaign . the bundesliga 's biggest transfer story during the close-season was the one which did n't happen - the much talked-about future of bayern munich 's franck ribery .
ultimately neither real madrid , barcelona or manchester united were prepared to meet the ever-rising price tag set by the bavarian club where the french international is contracted until 2011 .
the man fans once hailed as " kaiser franck , " now known as " the bavarian diva " by german media , is looking far from imperial with ribery 's commitment to bayern becoming increasingly tarnished during a summer of speculation .
outspoken bayern munich president franz beckenbauer blasted ribery , for , in his view , being more interested in his own career than the club and suggested that the player could still be sold - for 94 million euros -lrb- $ 135 million -rrb- .
" of course we would expect the market price , and if cristiano ronaldo is worth 94 million , then ribery is worth a comparable sum .
but if no offer is forthcoming he must fulfill the terms of his contract until 2011 , " he told sport bild newspaper .
commentators were not entirely convinced by a statement from bayern management which said : " bayern have at no time had and do not have the impression from franck ribery that he would only use bayern in order to further his own career .
he has always given himself and his abilities to the service of the team . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shorts say bayern , the expression says anywhere but here as another season in germany looms , ribery 's attitude continues to make headlines .
when the team assembled for the official pre-season photo session , observers noted the frenchman was unsmiling and distant .
he is due to miss the start of the season through injury and may spend his recuperation time wishing he was at a different stadium - namely the bernabeu in madrid , hob-nobbing with ronaldo , kaka and karim benzema as real madrid chairman florentino perez proudly showed off his multi-million euro signings in the spanish sun .
bayern , overtaken last season by wolfsburg at the top of the league , will be hoping they can hang onto ribery to provide ammunition for mario gomez .
bayern paid 30 million euros to obtain the striker from stuttgart , as they try and win back the coveted bundesliga title .
auf wiedersehen bayern bayern will be without brazilian stalwarts lucio and ze roberto who quit bavaria for inter milan and hamburg respectively in the close season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio expected more respect from new coach van gaal lucio , the veteran central defender , left bayern with a parting shot at new dutch manager louis van gaal who he accused of showing " a lack of respect . "
" i am a world champion -lrb- in the 2002 winning brazil team -rrb- as well as winning the confederations cup twice and was chosen best defender in the bundesliga , ” lucio said as he completed a reported eight million-euro move to the italian champions .
" surely i did not need to show him further proof of my abilities ? "
passing the brazilians on the way out is danijel pranjic , the croatian midfielder who joins bayern from heerenveen and dutch left-back edson braafheid from fc twente .
old boys come home stuttgart , anxious to replace gomez in attack , finally agreed with barcelona the return of their one-time player alexander hleb who spent an unhappy year at camp nou after his transfer from arsenal in 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hleb had a successful mid-decade spell with stuttgart the belarus international opted against a move to inter milan in favor of a move on loan back to the german club where he played from 2000-2005 .
another old boy returning home is international midfielder tim borowski who will again turn out in the colors of german cup holders werder bremen after a spell loan at bayern .
one of the best bits of business in the close season trading frenzy actually did n't involve any exchange of money or player .

ultimately neither real madrid , barcelona or manchester united were prepared to meet the ever-rising price tag set by the bavarian club where the french international is contracted until 2011 .
the man fans once hailed as " kaiser franck , " now known as " the bavarian diva " by german media , is looking far from imperial with ribery 's commitment to bayern becoming increasingly tarnished during a summer of speculation .
outspoken bayern munich president franz beckenbauer blasted ribery , for , in his view , being more interested in his own career than the club and suggested that the player could still be sold - for 94 million euros -lrb- $ 135 million -rrb- .
" of course we would expect the market price , and if cristiano ronaldo is worth 94 million , then ribery is worth a comparable sum .
but if no offer is forthcoming he must fulfill the terms of his contract until 2011 , " he told sport bild newspaper .
commentators were not entirely convinced by a statement from bayern management which said : " bayern have at no time had and do not have the impression from franck ribery that he would only use bayern in order to further his own career .
he has always given himself and his abilities to the service of the team . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shorts say bayern , the expression says anywhere but here as another season in germany looms , ribery 's attitude continues to make headlines .
when the team assembled for the official pre-season photo session , observers noted the frenchman was unsmiling and distant .
he is due to miss the start of the season through injury and may spend his recuperation time wishing he was at a different stadium - namely the bernabeu in madrid , hob-nobbing with ronaldo , kaka and karim benzema as real madrid chairman florentino perez proudly showed off his multi-million euro signings in the spanish sun .
bayern , overtaken last season by wolfsburg at the top of the league , will be hoping they can hang onto ribery to provide ammunition for mario gomez .
bayern paid 30 million euros to obtain the striker from stuttgart , as they try and win back the coveted bundesliga title .
auf wiedersehen bayern bayern will be without brazilian stalwarts lucio and ze roberto who quit bavaria for inter milan and hamburg respectively in the close season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio expected more respect from new coach van gaal lucio , the veteran central defender , left bayern with a parting shot at new dutch manager louis van gaal who he accused of showing " a lack of respect . "
" i am a world champion -lrb- in the 2002 winning brazil team -rrb- as well as winning the confederations cup twice and was chosen best defender in the bundesliga , ” lucio said as he completed a reported eight million-euro move to the italian champions .
" surely i did not need to show him further proof of my abilities ? "
passing the brazilians on the way out is danijel pranjic , the croatian midfielder who joins bayern from heerenveen and dutch left-back edson braafheid from fc twente .
old boys come home stuttgart , anxious to replace gomez in attack , finally agreed with barcelona the return of their one-time player alexander hleb who spent an unhappy year at camp nou after his transfer from arsenal in 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hleb had a successful mid-decade spell with stuttgart the belarus international opted against a move to inter milan in favor of a move on loan back to the german club where he played from 2000-2005 .
another old boy returning home is international midfielder tim borowski who will again turn out in the colors of german cup holders werder bremen after a spell loan at bayern .
one of the best bits of business in the close season trading frenzy actually did n't involve any exchange of money or player .

ultimately neither real madrid , barcelona or manchester united were prepared to meet the ever-rising price tag set by the bavarian club where the french international is contracted until 2011 .
the man fans once hailed as " kaiser franck , " now known as " the bavarian diva " by german media , is looking far from imperial with ribery 's commitment to bayern becoming increasingly tarnished during a summer of speculation .
outspoken bayern munich president franz beckenbauer blasted ribery , for , in his view , being more interested in his own career than the club and suggested that the player could still be sold - for 94 million euros -lrb- $ 135 million -rrb- .
" of course we would expect the market price , and if cristiano ronaldo is worth 94 million , then ribery is worth a comparable sum .
but if no offer is forthcoming he must fulfill the terms of his contract until 2011 , " he told sport bild newspaper .
commentators were not entirely convinced by a statement from bayern management which said : " bayern have at no time had and do not have the impression from franck ribery that he would only use bayern in order to further his own career .
he has always given himself and his abilities to the service of the team . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shorts say bayern , the expression says anywhere but here as another season in germany looms , ribery 's attitude continues to make headlines .
when the team assembled for the official pre-season photo session , observers noted the frenchman was unsmiling and distant .
he is due to miss the start of the season through injury and may spend his recuperation time wishing he was at a different stadium - namely the bernabeu in madrid , hob-nobbing with ronaldo , kaka and karim benzema as real madrid chairman florentino perez proudly showed off his multi-million euro signings in the spanish sun .
bayern , overtaken last season by wolfsburg at the top of the league , will be hoping they can hang onto ribery to provide ammunition for mario gomez .
bayern paid 30 million euros to obtain the striker from stuttgart , as they try and win back the coveted bundesliga title .
auf wiedersehen bayern bayern will be without brazilian stalwarts lucio and ze roberto who quit bavaria for inter milan and hamburg respectively in the close season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio expected more respect from new coach van gaal lucio , the veteran central defender , left bayern with a parting shot at new dutch manager louis van gaal who he accused of showing " a lack of respect . "
" i am a world champion -lrb- in the 2002 winning brazil team -rrb- as well as winning the confederations cup twice and was chosen best defender in the bundesliga , ” lucio said as he completed a reported eight million-euro move to the italian champions .
" surely i did not need to show him further proof of my abilities ? "
passing the brazilians on the way out is danijel pranjic , the croatian midfielder who joins bayern from heerenveen and dutch left-back edson braafheid from fc twente .
old boys come home stuttgart , anxious to replace gomez in attack , finally agreed with barcelona the return of their one-time player alexander hleb who spent an unhappy year at camp nou after his transfer from arsenal in 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hleb had a successful mid-decade spell with stuttgart the belarus international opted against a move to inter milan in favor of a move on loan back to the german club where he played from 2000-2005 .
another old boy returning home is international midfielder tim borowski who will again turn out in the colors of german cup holders werder bremen after a spell loan at bayern .
one of the best bits of business in the close season trading frenzy actually did n't involve any exchange of money or player .
bundesliga champions wolfsburg pulled off a coup by managing to hang on to the league 's player of the year , 23-year-old bosnian playmaker edzin dzeko who had been tempted by ac milan .
wolves add martins and algerian whiz-kid wolfsburg also managed to tempt newcastle 's ex-inter milan striker obafemi martins to the bundesliga for a reported 8.5 million euros after the 24-year-old nigerian spent a frustrating five years on tyneside .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obafemi martins brings his skills to the german champs new wolves coach armin veh also added the speedy 26-year-old algeria international karim ziani to the champions ' midfield , paying marseille five million euros for his services .
ziani " fits well in the team and will help us get to our target next season , " veh said .
meanwhile , ex-wolfsburg manager felix magath will welcome talented youngster lewis holtby from aachen after off-loading last year 's expensive dutch midfield flop orlando engelaar onto psv eindhoven .
challengers spend wisely northern challengers hamburg are hoping to shore up their defense with the signature of czech defender david rozenhal from lazio .
" hamburg is a big club with great infrastructure and conditions .
the level at the bundesliga is extremely high and it is always my aim to play high level football , " rozenhal told the club 's web site .
german media have reported the transfer fee at around five million euros .
last season 's surprise package hoffenheim have splashed more of their owner 's cash by signing argentine teenage midfielder franco zuculini for 4.7 million euros from racing club avellaneda and croatian defender josip simunic from hertha berlin for seven million , while picking up ghanaian forward prince tagoe on a free transfer from saudi club al-ittifaq .
presumably looking for a club with a less comical name , argentine goal-scoring sensation lucas barrios has opted to spend this season at the more soberly named borussia dortmund after transferring from colo colo for 4.5 million euros .
the 24-year-old striker hit the net a record 37 times in the 2008 season for the chilean champions and replaces veteran swiss national skipper alexander frei who has departed for basel in his native country for 4.2 million euros. nda / dpa / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 05.08.2009 german celebrities go on air to persuade people to vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " get out and vote " is the message from german celebrities german elections are less than two months away and , as the parties step up their campaigns , celebrities have been roped in to get the message across to the general public that voting is important . a few weeks ago an independent internet advertisement , produced by politik-digital.de , appeared , in which german celebrities , including two well-known news anchors , seemed to be telling people not to vote .
the video carried the slogan " don ’ t go to the polls " and was a copy of a us video campaign that ran ahead of the 2008 elections .
in the american version , a host of a-listers advise viewers not to bother to go and vote , complaining that politicians are all the same and asking why anyone should care what happens to health care , education or the environment .
the video was , of course , ironic and the same stars then told the public that the only way to make a difference on issues that mattered to them , was to vote .
a year later and politik-digital.de , headed by stefan gehrke , has produced a similar video using german celebrities and employing the same tactic .
but in the german version the clip ends with the celebrities still telling people not to vote .
provoking the public this change was a deliberate attempt by gehrke to provoke the public .
" we wanted to provoke , because we know there have been a lot of campaigns against voter apathy in recent years that have n't worked .
that ’ s why we thought we would take the risk that some people might not get the irony . we had the anchor man of the german news show , ' tagesschau ‘ and he is normally very conservative just reading the news .
he says in the video , ' you may not believe me , me but i don ’ t vote .
i think , if you think for just one second , you get that it would never be possible that this guy wouldn ’ t vote or would tell the people not to vote , " says gehrke .
a week later the company released a second video , which , like the us version , shows the stars abandoning all irony and telling the public to get out and vote .
replying to accusations that the campaign may have backfired and that the original irony was lost on the german public , gehrke says he is happy for the media attention this has brought to the problem he is actually trying to tackle , which is voter apathy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this way to vote " - the hope is that more voters will heed the call in 2009 since an all-time high in 1976 when 90 percent of the population cast their votes , voter turnout in germany has been decreasing .
and although the decline has been marginal – dropping from 79 percent in 1994 to 77.7 percent in 2005 – it is reason enough for the german institute for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- to want to play an active role in getting german voters back to the polling booths .
with just over fifty days to go before election day , more than 80 german celebrities and sports stars have taken part in a bpb advertising campaign that hopes to inspire people to go out and vote .
as of wednesday morning the ads are freely available to all radio stations .
" we don ’ t care who you vote for , just as long as you vote ! "
thomas krueger , president of the bpb , is running the radio ad campaign .
the production of the ads is part of a service , says krueger , to help radio stations find a way to reach the public that is not simply through the official party campaigns .
" it 's not about who you vote for , or which party you choose .
it 's that you vote in the first place , " krueger says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy is like sport .
if you do n't use it you lose it soccer players philipp lahm of bayern munich and per mertesacker of werder bremen , as well as boxing champion wladimir klitschko , are some of the sports stars taking part in the campaign , which all the celebrities have signed up for free of charge .
" we want to send out a message that federal elections are more than just an obligatory event that are more or less frustrating .
they are our constitutional right and a chance for us to decide which direction germany will take over the next four years . " says krueger .
" democracy is like sport " " if you don ’ t practise , you lose the hang of it , " wladimir klitschko says of democracy .
classical violin virtuoso , anne-sophie mutter asks voters to imagine their neighbor deciding every day what concert – rock , pop or classical - they should listen to .
every day for four years !
all together , 160 german celebrities have taken part in the campaign , which krüger says is about giving the public a political message from people they can actually relate to and not just politicians .
krüger also applauds gehrke ’ s efforts towards the same end , although , he says , you have to be careful to send the message in the right packaging .
" i have a lot of time for irony , but you do have to account for the fact that the german public is different to the us public .
you can ’ t always carry concepts across borders , one has to adapt the concept to the german public .
it 's possible that this sort of irony isn ’ t part of the german psyche yet .
but you have to try everything to get people ’ s attention , " he says .
krüger says he wants people to think again and realise that , even if they feel disillusioned or cynical , their vote is the only way to tackle the issues important to them .
these ads , he says , are our way of giving democracy a boost .

the video carried the slogan " don ’ t go to the polls " and was a copy of a us video campaign that ran ahead of the 2008 elections .
in the american version , a host of a-listers advise viewers not to bother to go and vote , complaining that politicians are all the same and asking why anyone should care what happens to health care , education or the environment .
the video was , of course , ironic and the same stars then told the public that the only way to make a difference on issues that mattered to them , was to vote .
a year later and politik-digital.de , headed by stefan gehrke , has produced a similar video using german celebrities and employing the same tactic .
but in the german version the clip ends with the celebrities still telling people not to vote .
provoking the public this change was a deliberate attempt by gehrke to provoke the public .
" we wanted to provoke , because we know there have been a lot of campaigns against voter apathy in recent years that have n't worked .
that ’ s why we thought we would take the risk that some people might not get the irony . we had the anchor man of the german news show , ' tagesschau ‘ and he is normally very conservative just reading the news .
he says in the video , ' you may not believe me , me but i don ’ t vote .
i think , if you think for just one second , you get that it would never be possible that this guy wouldn ’ t vote or would tell the people not to vote , " says gehrke .
a week later the company released a second video , which , like the us version , shows the stars abandoning all irony and telling the public to get out and vote .
replying to accusations that the campaign may have backfired and that the original irony was lost on the german public , gehrke says he is happy for the media attention this has brought to the problem he is actually trying to tackle , which is voter apathy .

just as their handcuffs were removed , their armed accomplices entered the room , threatened the five guards and helped the men flee .
the group later fired at police who were chasing them , and they have not been seen since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the palace of justice is impossible to secure , says justice minister de clerck belgian justice minister stefan de clerck has come under attack for the incident .
de clerck admitted that the accused men , each with a criminal record , should have been guarded by armed police instead of just security personnel .
he said the 19th century palace of justice was " a belgian icon , a monument with magnificent architecture " and numerous entrances that would be impossible to completely secure .
" we need to totally isolate and handle criminal cases in another part of the building , " he said .
multiple escapes plague justice minister the dramatic caper is the third such jailbreak in 12 days .
two weeks ago a helicopter airlifted three dangerous inmates out from a prison yard in bruges .
two of those men are still on the run , one of them 26-year-old ashraf sekkaki , described by the international police organization interpol as one of belgium 's most dangerous criminals .
last week six convicts were able to use a ladder from a construction site inside their prison in northern belgium to hop the prison wall .
while four escapees were immediately stopped , two of them , serving sentences for rape , torture and violent robbery , were able to get away in a car waiting for them .
oddly enough , it 's not a crime to break out of prison in belgium .
it 's natural to want freedom , goes the argument .
but it is illegal to help someone to escape .
for example , the elderly mother of one escaped prisoner could get three years in jail as she had been waiting with the getaway car .
the pressure is now on de clerck to explain the rash of escapes .
he was forced to resign from the same position he holds now in 1998 when a murderer and pedophile was able to escape for a few hours .
when the 1998 debacle came up in a television interview with de clerck after wednesday 's incident , the minister bristled at the host .
" i do my work .
i do what i have to do , " said de clerck , who only recently resumed his old post when a new government was formed late last year .
" i had six months time to work here and then you make such a laughable comment .
i think it 's inappropriate . "
the most significant effect of the escapes so far is that outdoor time for belgian prisoners has been limited .
another inmate of the bruges prison , freddy horion , convicted of multiple murders , has now sued the state for not allowing him to exercise in the fresh air. hf / afp / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the visit comes as taliban-led violence escalates ahead of the august 20 elections . on his maiden visit to afghanistan , anders fogh rasmussen repeated a pledge he made on his first working day in his job as nato secretary general : to make afghanistan his highest priority . " afghanistan is the first country i 'm visiting in my new capacity as secretary general of nato , " he said at a joint press conference with afghan president hamid karzai in kabul on wednesday . " i give very high priority to afghanistan ; actually it will be my highest priority as secretary general , " rasmussen added . he vowed that troops from the western military alliance would do their utmost to provide " the best possible security " for the august 20 presidential election . " i assure you , the afghan people , that we will stay to support you for as long as it takes to finish our job , " he said in a bid to reassure afghans in the run-up to the polls . first-hand appraisal over 64,000 of some 100,000 international troops deployed from 42 countries are serving in the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan .
nato troops operate alongside a us-led coalition . nato officials say their aim is to help stabilize a country suffering from three decades of war , resurgent islamists , poverty and corruption . rasmussen aims to assess first-hand the fight against an escalating taliban-led insurgency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai and 40 other candidates are in the race to lead the war-torn nation during the visit , which comes just two weeks ahead of nationwide elections , rasmussen was also due to hold talks with some of the other candidates for the presidency . although karzai leads a field of some 40 people standing for the top job , he has been widely criticized for avoiding the public campaign trail and deciding instead to carve out alliances with powerful but often corrupt political kingmakers . appeal to the taliban at wednesday 's press conference , karzai called on the taliban and hezbi islami , an associate group of the taliban , to renounce violence and participate in the elections . " we will request the taliban to have the afghan national interest in their hearts and minds and come and participate in the elections and , through voting , bring stability for afghanistan , " karzai said . " after elections , if i win , my first priority will be solidifying and speeding the peace process with the taliban and hezbi islami , and all other groups who are not part of al-qaeda or other terrorist networks , " he added . the worsening security and high casualties on the side of international troops have forced several nato and non-nato countries to call for talks with taliban militants , who , despite the ouster of their regime some eight years ago , are still a force to be reckoned with . rasmussen ’ s comments reflected that view .
" i am ready to take pragmatic steps that can include the security for our troops and even talks with a number of groups within the afghan society , " he said . however , he was at pains to clarify that a prerequisite for such an engagement was that the groups “ put down their weapons and abide by the laws in this country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and afghan forces have been working together to recapture areas held by taliban militants securing taliban strongholds with campaigning for the presidential and provincial council elections in full swing , nato forces are pressing ahead with operations designed to secure taliban strongholds in a last bid to allow voting to take place in restive areas . " our troops will do their utmost to ensure the best possible security around the elections , " rasmussen said , adding : " it is an opportunity for the afghan people to demonstrate that you do not bow to threats and violence of the enemies of afghanistan . " the election is afghanistan 's only second-ever democratic poll after the extremist taliban regime was ousted back in 2001 . the taliban , who ruled afghanistan between 1996 and 2001 , have managed to orchestrate an insurgency that has escalated to record levels .
the intensification is putting a huge strain on us and nato-led forces that have grown to number more than 100,000 . there are concerns that violence will overshadow the elections , deter afghans from going out to vote , and undermine the credibility of a poll that is being seen as a test of an internationally-funded drive to install democracy . bundeswehr troops in isaf bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 3,500 troops stationed in northern afghanistan as part of the isaf mission last month , officials in berlin confirmed that germany 's military , the bundeswehr , was engaged in its largest-ever offensive against the taliban .
this was in response to increased taliban attacks in the north of the country , where most of germany ’ s 3,700 troops are stationed . the latest deployment involved some 300 members of the bundeswehr 's quick reaction force and , for the first time , included armored units fighting with close air support . german defence minister franz josef jung justified the offensive , saying : " we are now being particularly challenged in kunduz . "
however , jung insisted on calling the operation a " stabilization deployment ” ahead of the elections . not an exit strategy the former danish prime minister took charge of the 28-nation nato on monday , pledging to make afghanistan his top priority and prevent the war-torn country from once again becoming a hub of international terrorism . rasmussen , who has a four-year mandate , said the long-term goal was to " move forward concretely and visibly with transferring lead security responsibility in afghanistan to the afghans . " " i believe , during my term , afghans must take over lead responsibility for security in most of their country , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community has spent a huge amount of resources to train afghanistan 's army and police however , he rejected any suggestion that such a strategy amounted to a cut and run strategy as pure propaganda .

nato must and will be there in support .
let no taliban propaganda try to sell my message as a run for -lrb- the -rrb- exit .
it is not , " he said . while rasmussen ’ s comments were aimed at reassuring afghans , his visit has come at an awkward time , with residents in the southern province of kandahar saying that a nato bomb attack had killed four civilians , including three children . afghan people have become increasingly vocal about their anger over the growing number of civilian casualties as a result of operations by nato and the us-led coalition . rb / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the visit comes as taliban-led violence escalates ahead of the august 20 elections . on his maiden visit to afghanistan , anders fogh rasmussen repeated a pledge he made on his first working day in his job as nato secretary general : to make afghanistan his highest priority . " afghanistan is the first country i 'm visiting in my new capacity as secretary general of nato , " he said at a joint press conference with afghan president hamid karzai in kabul on wednesday . " i give very high priority to afghanistan ; actually it will be my highest priority as secretary general , " rasmussen added . he vowed that troops from the western military alliance would do their utmost to provide " the best possible security " for the august 20 presidential election . " i assure you , the afghan people , that we will stay to support you for as long as it takes to finish our job , " he said in a bid to reassure afghans in the run-up to the polls . first-hand appraisal over 64,000 of some 100,000 international troops deployed from 42 countries are serving in the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan .
nato troops operate alongside a us-led coalition . nato officials say their aim is to help stabilize a country suffering from three decades of war , resurgent islamists , poverty and corruption . rasmussen aims to assess first-hand the fight against an escalating taliban-led insurgency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai and 40 other candidates are in the race to lead the war-torn nation during the visit , which comes just two weeks ahead of nationwide elections , rasmussen was also due to hold talks with some of the other candidates for the presidency . although karzai leads a field of some 40 people standing for the top job , he has been widely criticized for avoiding the public campaign trail and deciding instead to carve out alliances with powerful but often corrupt political kingmakers . appeal to the taliban at wednesday 's press conference , karzai called on the taliban and hezbi islami , an associate group of the taliban , to renounce violence and participate in the elections . " we will request the taliban to have the afghan national interest in their hearts and minds and come and participate in the elections and , through voting , bring stability for afghanistan , " karzai said . " after elections , if i win , my first priority will be solidifying and speeding the peace process with the taliban and hezbi islami , and all other groups who are not part of al-qaeda or other terrorist networks , " he added . the worsening security and high casualties on the side of international troops have forced several nato and non-nato countries to call for talks with taliban militants , who , despite the ouster of their regime some eight years ago , are still a force to be reckoned with . rasmussen ’ s comments reflected that view .
" i am ready to take pragmatic steps that can include the security for our troops and even talks with a number of groups within the afghan society , " he said . however , he was at pains to clarify that a prerequisite for such an engagement was that the groups “ put down their weapons and abide by the laws in this country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and afghan forces have been working together to recapture areas held by taliban militants securing taliban strongholds with campaigning for the presidential and provincial council elections in full swing , nato forces are pressing ahead with operations designed to secure taliban strongholds in a last bid to allow voting to take place in restive areas . " our troops will do their utmost to ensure the best possible security around the elections , " rasmussen said , adding : " it is an opportunity for the afghan people to demonstrate that you do not bow to threats and violence of the enemies of afghanistan . " the election is afghanistan 's only second-ever democratic poll after the extremist taliban regime was ousted back in 2001 . the taliban , who ruled afghanistan between 1996 and 2001 , have managed to orchestrate an insurgency that has escalated to record levels .
the intensification is putting a huge strain on us and nato-led forces that have grown to number more than 100,000 . there are concerns that violence will overshadow the elections , deter afghans from going out to vote , and undermine the credibility of a poll that is being seen as a test of an internationally-funded drive to install democracy . bundeswehr troops in isaf bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 3,500 troops stationed in northern afghanistan as part of the isaf mission last month , officials in berlin confirmed that germany 's military , the bundeswehr , was engaged in its largest-ever offensive against the taliban .
this was in response to increased taliban attacks in the north of the country , where most of germany ’ s 3,700 troops are stationed . the latest deployment involved some 300 members of the bundeswehr 's quick reaction force and , for the first time , included armored units fighting with close air support . german defence minister franz josef jung justified the offensive , saying : " we are now being particularly challenged in kunduz . "
however , jung insisted on calling the operation a " stabilization deployment ” ahead of the elections . not an exit strategy the former danish prime minister took charge of the 28-nation nato on monday , pledging to make afghanistan his top priority and prevent the war-torn country from once again becoming a hub of international terrorism . rasmussen , who has a four-year mandate , said the long-term goal was to " move forward concretely and visibly with transferring lead security responsibility in afghanistan to the afghans . " " i believe , during my term , afghans must take over lead responsibility for security in most of their country , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community has spent a huge amount of resources to train afghanistan 's army and police however , he rejected any suggestion that such a strategy amounted to a cut and run strategy as pure propaganda . " let me be clear .
nato must and will be there in support .
let no taliban propaganda try to sell my message as a run for -lrb- the -rrb- exit .
it is not , " he said . while rasmussen ’ s comments were aimed at reassuring afghans , his visit has come at an awkward time , with residents in the southern province of kandahar saying that a nato bomb attack had killed four civilians , including three children . afghan people have become increasingly vocal about their anger over the growing number of civilian casualties as a result of operations by nato and the us-led coalition . rb / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i give very high priority to afghanistan ; actually it will be my highest priority as secretary general , " rasmussen added . he vowed that troops from the western military alliance would do their utmost to provide " the best possible security " for the august 20 presidential election . " i assure you , the afghan people , that we will stay to support you for as long as it takes to finish our job , " he said in a bid to reassure afghans in the run-up to the polls . first-hand appraisal over 64,000 of some 100,000 international troops deployed from 42 countries are serving in the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan .
nato troops operate alongside a us-led coalition . nato officials say their aim is to help stabilize a country suffering from three decades of war , resurgent islamists , poverty and corruption . rasmussen aims to assess first-hand the fight against an escalating taliban-led insurgency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai and 40 other candidates are in the race to lead the war-torn nation during the visit , which comes just two weeks ahead of nationwide elections , rasmussen was also due to hold talks with some of the other candidates for the presidency . although karzai leads a field of some 40 people standing for the top job , he has been widely criticized for avoiding the public campaign trail and deciding instead to carve out alliances with powerful but often corrupt political kingmakers . appeal to the taliban at wednesday 's press conference , karzai called on the taliban and hezbi islami , an associate group of the taliban , to renounce violence and participate in the elections . " we will request the taliban to have the afghan national interest in their hearts and minds and come and participate in the elections and , through voting , bring stability for afghanistan , " karzai said . " after elections , if i win , my first priority will be solidifying and speeding the peace process with the taliban and hezbi islami , and all other groups who are not part of al-qaeda or other terrorist networks , " he added . the worsening security and high casualties on the side of international troops have forced several nato and non-nato countries to call for talks with taliban militants , who , despite the ouster of their regime some eight years ago , are still a force to be reckoned with . rasmussen ’ s comments reflected that view .
" i am ready to take pragmatic steps that can include the security for our troops and even talks with a number of groups within the afghan society , " he said . however , he was at pains to clarify that a prerequisite for such an engagement was that the groups “ put down their weapons and abide by the laws in this country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and afghan forces have been working together to recapture areas held by taliban militants securing taliban strongholds with campaigning for the presidential and provincial council elections in full swing , nato forces are pressing ahead with operations designed to secure taliban strongholds in a last bid to allow voting to take place in restive areas . " our troops will do their utmost to ensure the best possible security around the elections , " rasmussen said , adding : " it is an opportunity for the afghan people to demonstrate that you do not bow to threats and violence of the enemies of afghanistan . " the election is afghanistan 's only second-ever democratic poll after the extremist taliban regime was ousted back in 2001 . the taliban , who ruled afghanistan between 1996 and 2001 , have managed to orchestrate an insurgency that has escalated to record levels .
the intensification is putting a huge strain on us and nato-led forces that have grown to number more than 100,000 . there are concerns that violence will overshadow the elections , deter afghans from going out to vote , and undermine the credibility of a poll that is being seen as a test of an internationally-funded drive to install democracy . bundeswehr troops in isaf bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 3,500 troops stationed in northern afghanistan as part of the isaf mission last month , officials in berlin confirmed that germany 's military , the bundeswehr , was engaged in its largest-ever offensive against the taliban .
this was in response to increased taliban attacks in the north of the country , where most of germany ’ s 3,700 troops are stationed . the latest deployment involved some 300 members of the bundeswehr 's quick reaction force and , for the first time , included armored units fighting with close air support . german defence minister franz josef jung justified the offensive , saying : " we are now being particularly challenged in kunduz . "
however , jung insisted on calling the operation a " stabilization deployment ” ahead of the elections . not an exit strategy the former danish prime minister took charge of the 28-nation nato on monday , pledging to make afghanistan his top priority and prevent the war-torn country from once again becoming a hub of international terrorism . rasmussen , who has a four-year mandate , said the long-term goal was to " move forward concretely and visibly with transferring lead security responsibility in afghanistan to the afghans . " " i believe , during my term , afghans must take over lead responsibility for security in most of their country , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community has spent a huge amount of resources to train afghanistan 's army and police however , he rejected any suggestion that such a strategy amounted to a cut and run strategy as pure propaganda . " let me be clear .
nato must and will be there in support .
let no taliban propaganda try to sell my message as a run for -lrb- the -rrb- exit .
it is not , " he said . while rasmussen ’ s comments were aimed at reassuring afghans , his visit has come at an awkward time , with residents in the southern province of kandahar saying that a nato bomb attack had killed four civilians , including three children . afghan people have become increasingly vocal about their anger over the growing number of civilian casualties as a result of operations by nato and the us-led coalition . rb / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but farmers are up in arms over demands to pay back up to 500 million euros . the european commission ruled in january that subsidies worth around 338 million euros -lrb- $ 486.4 million -rrb- paid between 1992 and 2002 by the french government to support its fruit and vegetable sector had violated european farm and state aid policy .
the eu executive has said the subsidies gave french farmers an unfair advantage over their european competitors .
the commission has ruled that french growers now owe a total sum of about 500 million euros , including interest charges .
farmers angry about pay back demands the announcement has been met with widespread anger and disbelief in orchards and vegetable markets across france .
the eu decision comes at a time when farmers in europe 's largest farm economy have already been protesting against a recession-linked drop in demand and sliding incomes .
" we just do n't understand it .
these recent weeks , we 've been telling the government how bad things are for us .
and the first answer we get is this - that we have to pay back money we received 10 even 15 years ago , " salvatore esorordu , a fruit grower from the southern region of gard , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : producer prices for fruit and vegetables are plummeting " it 's a provocation .
prices are at their worst level in 20 years , " he added .
producer prices for fruit and vegetables fell 3.1 percent in june , putting them down 17.6 percent year-on-year , according to latest data from french statistics office insee .
the french fruit and vegetable sector , the third-largest in europe , also says it faces growing cheap competition from fellow eu countries that have lower labor costs .
france to negotiate hefty sum france has disputed the hefty sum the eu wants to claw back from fruit and vegetable farmers .
but if the government fails to refund the money , it would be liable to pay a heavy fine .
typically , such fines are open-ended , calculated on the basis of the time it takes the government to act .
if it does n't comply , the fine goes on increasing .
farm minister bruno le maire said this week that france would accept the eu demand for recouping some of the subsidies , but emphasized that he would negotiate with the eu over the total sum .
he also said he wanted the recovery of subsidies to be done gradually and on a case-by-case basis so as to avoid forcing vulnerable farmers to pay back .
" we want the reimbursements to be spread over time .
it would put an unbearable strain on farmers if they 're forced to pay this money back immediately , " le maire said .
" unfair and immoral " this is not the first time france has been forced to ask farmers to pay back subsidies .
but in the past , french farmers received generous aid directly from the european commission .
this time , any recovery of subsidies will go back into the french budget , not eu coffers .
that 's why the french government has more of an incentive to recoup the cash .
but french farmers are unlikely to accept the demands without a fight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josé bové has urged french farmers to fight the eu demands to pay back subsidies josé bové , a french member of the european parliament and former president of the peasants confederation farmers ' union , has urged civil disobedience .

but farmers are up in arms over demands to pay back up to 500 million euros . the european commission ruled in january that subsidies worth around 338 million euros -lrb- $ 486.4 million -rrb- paid between 1992 and 2002 by the french government to support its fruit and vegetable sector had violated european farm and state aid policy .
the eu executive has said the subsidies gave french farmers an unfair advantage over their european competitors .
the commission has ruled that french growers now owe a total sum of about 500 million euros , including interest charges .
farmers angry about pay back demands the announcement has been met with widespread anger and disbelief in orchards and vegetable markets across france .
the eu decision comes at a time when farmers in europe 's largest farm economy have already been protesting against a recession-linked drop in demand and sliding incomes .
" we just do n't understand it .
these recent weeks , we 've been telling the government how bad things are for us .
and the first answer we get is this - that we have to pay back money we received 10 even 15 years ago , " salvatore esorordu , a fruit grower from the southern region of gard , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : producer prices for fruit and vegetables are plummeting " it 's a provocation .
prices are at their worst level in 20 years , " he added .
producer prices for fruit and vegetables fell 3.1 percent in june , putting them down 17.6 percent year-on-year , according to latest data from french statistics office insee .
the french fruit and vegetable sector , the third-largest in europe , also says it faces growing cheap competition from fellow eu countries that have lower labor costs .
france to negotiate hefty sum france has disputed the hefty sum the eu wants to claw back from fruit and vegetable farmers .
but if the government fails to refund the money , it would be liable to pay a heavy fine .
typically , such fines are open-ended , calculated on the basis of the time it takes the government to act .
if it does n't comply , the fine goes on increasing .
farm minister bruno le maire said this week that france would accept the eu demand for recouping some of the subsidies , but emphasized that he would negotiate with the eu over the total sum .
he also said he wanted the recovery of subsidies to be done gradually and on a case-by-case basis so as to avoid forcing vulnerable farmers to pay back .
" we want the reimbursements to be spread over time .
it would put an unbearable strain on farmers if they 're forced to pay this money back immediately , " le maire said .

the container ship was released with its 24-member crew on monday after somali pirates received the multi-million dollar ransom from hamburg-based shipping company leonhardt & blumberg .

just as their handcuffs were removed , their armed accomplices entered the room , threatened the five guards and helped the men flee .
the group later fired at police who were chasing them , and they have not been seen since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the palace of justice is impossible to secure , says justice minister de clerck belgian justice minister stefan de clerck has come under attack for the incident .
de clerck admitted that the accused men , each with a criminal record , should have been guarded by armed police instead of just security personnel .
he said the 19th century palace of justice was " a belgian icon , a monument with magnificent architecture " and numerous entrances that would be impossible to completely secure .
" we need to totally isolate and handle criminal cases in another part of the building , " he said .
multiple escapes plague justice minister the dramatic caper is the third such jailbreak in 12 days .
two weeks ago a helicopter airlifted three dangerous inmates out from a prison yard in bruges .
two of those men are still on the run , one of them 26-year-old ashraf sekkaki , described by the international police organization interpol as one of belgium 's most dangerous criminals .
last week six convicts were able to use a ladder from a construction site inside their prison in northern belgium to hop the prison wall .
while four escapees were immediately stopped , two of them , serving sentences for rape , torture and violent robbery , were able to get away in a car waiting for them .
oddly enough , it 's not a crime to break out of prison in belgium .
it 's natural to want freedom , goes the argument .
but it is illegal to help someone to escape .
for example , the elderly mother of one escaped prisoner could get three years in jail as she had been waiting with the getaway car .
the pressure is now on de clerck to explain the rash of escapes .
he was forced to resign from the same position he holds now in 1998 when a murderer and pedophile was able to escape for a few hours .
when the 1998 debacle came up in a television interview with de clerck after wednesday 's incident , the minister bristled at the host .
" i do my work .
i do what i have to do , " said de clerck , who only recently resumed his old post when a new government was formed late last year .
" i had six months time to work here and then you make such a laughable comment .
i think it 's inappropriate . "
the most significant effect of the escapes so far is that outdoor time for belgian prisoners has been limited .
another inmate of the bruges prison , freddy horion , convicted of multiple murders , has now sued the state for not allowing him to exercise in the fresh air. hf / afp / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but farmers are up in arms over demands to pay back up to 500 million euros . the european commission ruled in january that subsidies worth around 338 million euros -lrb- $ 486.4 million -rrb- paid between 1992 and 2002 by the french government to support its fruit and vegetable sector had violated european farm and state aid policy .
the eu executive has said the subsidies gave french farmers an unfair advantage over their european competitors .
the commission has ruled that french growers now owe a total sum of about 500 million euros , including interest charges .
farmers angry about pay back demands the announcement has been met with widespread anger and disbelief in orchards and vegetable markets across france .
the eu decision comes at a time when farmers in europe 's largest farm economy have already been protesting against a recession-linked drop in demand and sliding incomes .
" we just do n't understand it .
these recent weeks , we 've been telling the government how bad things are for us .
and the first answer we get is this - that we have to pay back money we received 10 even 15 years ago , " salvatore esorordu , a fruit grower from the southern region of gard , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : producer prices for fruit and vegetables are plummeting " it 's a provocation .
prices are at their worst level in 20 years , " he added .
producer prices for fruit and vegetables fell 3.1 percent in june , putting them down 17.6 percent year-on-year , according to latest data from french statistics office insee .
the french fruit and vegetable sector , the third-largest in europe , also says it faces growing cheap competition from fellow eu countries that have lower labor costs .
france to negotiate hefty sum france has disputed the hefty sum the eu wants to claw back from fruit and vegetable farmers .
but if the government fails to refund the money , it would be liable to pay a heavy fine .
typically , such fines are open-ended , calculated on the basis of the time it takes the government to act .
if it does n't comply , the fine goes on increasing .
farm minister bruno le maire said this week that france would accept the eu demand for recouping some of the subsidies , but emphasized that he would negotiate with the eu over the total sum .
he also said he wanted the recovery of subsidies to be done gradually and on a case-by-case basis so as to avoid forcing vulnerable farmers to pay back .
" we want the reimbursements to be spread over time .
it would put an unbearable strain on farmers if they 're forced to pay this money back immediately , " le maire said .
" unfair and immoral " this is not the first time france has been forced to ask farmers to pay back subsidies .
but in the past , french farmers received generous aid directly from the european commission .
this time , any recovery of subsidies will go back into the french budget , not eu coffers .
that 's why the french government has more of an incentive to recoup the cash .
but french farmers are unlikely to accept the demands without a fight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josé bové has urged french farmers to fight the eu demands to pay back subsidies josé bové , a french member of the european parliament and former president of the peasants confederation farmers ' union , has urged civil disobedience .

the new iranian president has reacted in his inauguration speech by vowing that iran would continue to resist " oppressive powers . "
" we heard that some of the western leaders had decided to recognize but not congratulate the new government .
well , no one in iran is waiting for your messages . "
" iranians will neither value your scowling and bullying nor smiles and greetings , " he said in his speech on wednesday after taking the oath of office in parliament at the start of his second term as president .
ahmadinejad now has two weeks to present a new cabinet .
demonstrations continue in tehran outside the parliamentary building in the capital tehran , police used teargas to try to disperse hundreds of protesters .

around 100 opposition supporters went on trial over the weekend .
the iranian government insists the presidential election was fair and transparent and has accused western nations of being complicit in the bloody post-election unrest .
criticism of sweden over attending the inauguration within the european union , there had been strong criticism of sweden 's plans to send its ambassador to attend the ceremony to represent the current eu council presidency .
german politician elmar brok , who is also the foreign policy spokesman for the conservatives in the european parliament , warned the eu should be more consistent in its criticism of tehran .
" over the past weeks , the eu has continuously demanded a recount of the vote and new elections .
we also have strongly condemned the arrests and the violence against the demonstrators , " he said .
" we can not now legitimize ahmadinejad 's re-election by attending the ceremony . "
eckhard von klaeden , the foreign policy spokesman for merkel 's cdu , said sweden should have followed the example of most other eu countries by not sending their ambassador .
" europe should stand united in its criticism of the rigged elections and the suppression of the opposition movement , " he said .

manfred guellner , the head of the forsa institute , said that the dip in support for the spd was partly caused by a scandal involving health minister ulla schmidt who took her official car on holiday , prompting a public outcry .
" the affair stirred up all the reservations about the spd that were already there : incompetence and distance from the people , " said guellner .
frank-walter steinmeier , the spd 's chancellor candidate and current german foreign minister , has struggled to make dents in merkel 's popularity despite unveiling a campaign team including several new faces and making a contentious pledge to bring full employment to europe 's largest economy by 2020 .
however , in germany 's complex system of coalition politics , voters choose parties , not individuals , and elections do not boil down to a straight race between the two main parties .
end in sight for grand coalition ?

this would , in theory , give merkel the necessary majority to form her desired coalition after the september 27 election , albeit with a slim 51 percent .
the green party rose by one point to 13 percent and the far-left left party also gained in support , rising to 11 percent .

but farmers are up in arms over demands to pay back up to 500 million euros . the european commission ruled in january that subsidies worth around 338 million euros -lrb- $ 486.4 million -rrb- paid between 1992 and 2002 by the french government to support its fruit and vegetable sector had violated european farm and state aid policy .
the eu executive has said the subsidies gave french farmers an unfair advantage over their european competitors .
the commission has ruled that french growers now owe a total sum of about 500 million euros , including interest charges .
farmers angry about pay back demands the announcement has been met with widespread anger and disbelief in orchards and vegetable markets across france .
the eu decision comes at a time when farmers in europe 's largest farm economy have already been protesting against a recession-linked drop in demand and sliding incomes .
" we just do n't understand it .
these recent weeks , we 've been telling the government how bad things are for us .
and the first answer we get is this - that we have to pay back money we received 10 even 15 years ago , " salvatore esorordu , a fruit grower from the southern region of gard , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : producer prices for fruit and vegetables are plummeting " it 's a provocation .
prices are at their worst level in 20 years , " he added .
producer prices for fruit and vegetables fell 3.1 percent in june , putting them down 17.6 percent year-on-year , according to latest data from french statistics office insee .
the french fruit and vegetable sector , the third-largest in europe , also says it faces growing cheap competition from fellow eu countries that have lower labor costs .
france to negotiate hefty sum france has disputed the hefty sum the eu wants to claw back from fruit and vegetable farmers .
but if the government fails to refund the money , it would be liable to pay a heavy fine .
typically , such fines are open-ended , calculated on the basis of the time it takes the government to act .
if it does n't comply , the fine goes on increasing .
farm minister bruno le maire said this week that france would accept the eu demand for recouping some of the subsidies , but emphasized that he would negotiate with the eu over the total sum .
he also said he wanted the recovery of subsidies to be done gradually and on a case-by-case basis so as to avoid forcing vulnerable farmers to pay back .
" we want the reimbursements to be spread over time .
it would put an unbearable strain on farmers if they 're forced to pay this money back immediately , " le maire said .
" unfair and immoral " this is not the first time france has been forced to ask farmers to pay back subsidies .
but in the past , french farmers received generous aid directly from the european commission .
this time , any recovery of subsidies will go back into the french budget , not eu coffers .
that 's why the french government has more of an incentive to recoup the cash .
but french farmers are unlikely to accept the demands without a fight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josé bové has urged french farmers to fight the eu demands to pay back subsidies josé bové , a french member of the european parliament and former president of the peasants confederation farmers ' union , has urged civil disobedience .
" the farmers must not reimburse this money , " bové said .
" if the government sends them letters telling them to do so , i encourage them to refuse and disobey because it 's unfair and immoral . "

and the first answer we get is this - that we have to pay back money we received 10 even 15 years ago , " salvatore esorordu , a fruit grower from the southern region of gard , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : producer prices for fruit and vegetables are plummeting " it 's a provocation .
prices are at their worst level in 20 years , " he added .
producer prices for fruit and vegetables fell 3.1 percent in june , putting them down 17.6 percent year-on-year , according to latest data from french statistics office insee .
the french fruit and vegetable sector , the third-largest in europe , also says it faces growing cheap competition from fellow eu countries that have lower labor costs .
france to negotiate hefty sum france has disputed the hefty sum the eu wants to claw back from fruit and vegetable farmers .
but if the government fails to refund the money , it would be liable to pay a heavy fine .
typically , such fines are open-ended , calculated on the basis of the time it takes the government to act .
if it does n't comply , the fine goes on increasing .
farm minister bruno le maire said this week that france would accept the eu demand for recouping some of the subsidies , but emphasized that he would negotiate with the eu over the total sum .
he also said he wanted the recovery of subsidies to be done gradually and on a case-by-case basis so as to avoid forcing vulnerable farmers to pay back .
" we want the reimbursements to be spread over time .
it would put an unbearable strain on farmers if they 're forced to pay this money back immediately , " le maire said .
" unfair and immoral " this is not the first time france has been forced to ask farmers to pay back subsidies .
but in the past , french farmers received generous aid directly from the european commission .
this time , any recovery of subsidies will go back into the french budget , not eu coffers .
that 's why the french government has more of an incentive to recoup the cash .
but french farmers are unlikely to accept the demands without a fight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josé bové has urged french farmers to fight the eu demands to pay back subsidies josé bové , a french member of the european parliament and former president of the peasants confederation farmers ' union , has urged civil disobedience .
" the farmers must not reimburse this money , " bové said .
" if the government sends them letters telling them to do so , i encourage them to refuse and disobey because it 's unfair and immoral . "

well , no one in iran is waiting for your messages . "
" iranians will neither value your scowling and bullying nor smiles and greetings , " he said in his speech on wednesday after taking the oath of office in parliament at the start of his second term as president .

the video carried the slogan " don ’ t go to the polls " and was a copy of a us video campaign that ran ahead of the 2008 elections .
in the american version , a host of a-listers advise viewers not to bother to go and vote , complaining that politicians are all the same and asking why anyone should care what happens to health care , education or the environment .
the video was , of course , ironic and the same stars then told the public that the only way to make a difference on issues that mattered to them , was to vote .
a year later and politik-digital.de , headed by stefan gehrke , has produced a similar video using german celebrities and employing the same tactic .
but in the german version the clip ends with the celebrities still telling people not to vote .
provoking the public this change was a deliberate attempt by gehrke to provoke the public .
" we wanted to provoke , because we know there have been a lot of campaigns against voter apathy in recent years that have n't worked .
that ’ s why we thought we would take the risk that some people might not get the irony . we had the anchor man of the german news show , ' tagesschau ‘ and he is normally very conservative just reading the news .
he says in the video , ' you may not believe me , me but i don ’ t vote .
i think , if you think for just one second , you get that it would never be possible that this guy wouldn ’ t vote or would tell the people not to vote , " says gehrke .
a week later the company released a second video , which , like the us version , shows the stars abandoning all irony and telling the public to get out and vote .
replying to accusations that the campaign may have backfired and that the original irony was lost on the german public , gehrke says he is happy for the media attention this has brought to the problem he is actually trying to tackle , which is voter apathy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this way to vote " - the hope is that more voters will heed the call in 2009 since an all-time high in 1976 when 90 percent of the population cast their votes , voter turnout in germany has been decreasing .
and although the decline has been marginal – dropping from 79 percent in 1994 to 77.7 percent in 2005 – it is reason enough for the german institute for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- to want to play an active role in getting german voters back to the polling booths .
with just over fifty days to go before election day , more than 80 german celebrities and sports stars have taken part in a bpb advertising campaign that hopes to inspire people to go out and vote .
as of wednesday morning the ads are freely available to all radio stations .
" we don ’ t care who you vote for , just as long as you vote ! "
thomas krueger , president of the bpb , is running the radio ad campaign .
the production of the ads is part of a service , says krueger , to help radio stations find a way to reach the public that is not simply through the official party campaigns .
" it 's not about who you vote for , or which party you choose .
it 's that you vote in the first place , " krueger says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy is like sport .
if you do n't use it you lose it soccer players philipp lahm of bayern munich and per mertesacker of werder bremen , as well as boxing champion wladimir klitschko , are some of the sports stars taking part in the campaign , which all the celebrities have signed up for free of charge .
" we want to send out a message that federal elections are more than just an obligatory event that are more or less frustrating .
they are our constitutional right and a chance for us to decide which direction germany will take over the next four years . " says krueger .
" democracy is like sport " " if you don ’ t practise , you lose the hang of it , " wladimir klitschko says of democracy .
classical violin virtuoso , anne-sophie mutter asks voters to imagine their neighbor deciding every day what concert – rock , pop or classical - they should listen to .
every day for four years !
all together , 160 german celebrities have taken part in the campaign , which krüger says is about giving the public a political message from people they can actually relate to and not just politicians .
krüger also applauds gehrke ’ s efforts towards the same end , although , he says , you have to be careful to send the message in the right packaging .
" i have a lot of time for irony , but you do have to account for the fact that the german public is different to the us public .
you can ’ t always carry concepts across borders , one has to adapt the concept to the german public .
it 's possible that this sort of irony isn ’ t part of the german psyche yet .
but you have to try everything to get people ’ s attention , " he says .
krüger says he wants people to think again and realise that , even if they feel disillusioned or cynical , their vote is the only way to tackle the issues important to them .
these ads , he says , are our way of giving democracy a boost .

the video carried the slogan " don ’ t go to the polls " and was a copy of a us video campaign that ran ahead of the 2008 elections .
in the american version , a host of a-listers advise viewers not to bother to go and vote , complaining that politicians are all the same and asking why anyone should care what happens to health care , education or the environment .
the video was , of course , ironic and the same stars then told the public that the only way to make a difference on issues that mattered to them , was to vote .
a year later and politik-digital.de , headed by stefan gehrke , has produced a similar video using german celebrities and employing the same tactic .
but in the german version the clip ends with the celebrities still telling people not to vote .
provoking the public this change was a deliberate attempt by gehrke to provoke the public .
" we wanted to provoke , because we know there have been a lot of campaigns against voter apathy in recent years that have n't worked .
that ’ s why we thought we would take the risk that some people might not get the irony . we had the anchor man of the german news show , ' tagesschau ‘ and he is normally very conservative just reading the news .
he says in the video , ' you may not believe me , me but i don ’ t vote .
i think , if you think for just one second , you get that it would never be possible that this guy wouldn ’ t vote or would tell the people not to vote , " says gehrke .
a week later the company released a second video , which , like the us version , shows the stars abandoning all irony and telling the public to get out and vote .
replying to accusations that the campaign may have backfired and that the original irony was lost on the german public , gehrke says he is happy for the media attention this has brought to the problem he is actually trying to tackle , which is voter apathy .

as of wednesday morning the ads are freely available to all radio stations .
" we don ’ t care who you vote for , just as long as you vote ! "

the visit comes as taliban-led violence escalates ahead of the august 20 elections . on his maiden visit to afghanistan , anders fogh rasmussen repeated a pledge he made on his first working day in his job as nato secretary general : to make afghanistan his highest priority . " afghanistan is the first country i 'm visiting in my new capacity as secretary general of nato , " he said at a joint press conference with afghan president hamid karzai in kabul on wednesday . " i give very high priority to afghanistan ; actually it will be my highest priority as secretary general , " rasmussen added . he vowed that troops from the western military alliance would do their utmost to provide " the best possible security " for the august 20 presidential election . " i assure you , the afghan people , that we will stay to support you for as long as it takes to finish our job , " he said in a bid to reassure afghans in the run-up to the polls . first-hand appraisal over 64,000 of some 100,000 international troops deployed from 42 countries are serving in the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan .
nato troops operate alongside a us-led coalition . nato officials say their aim is to help stabilize a country suffering from three decades of war , resurgent islamists , poverty and corruption . rasmussen aims to assess first-hand the fight against an escalating taliban-led insurgency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai and 40 other candidates are in the race to lead the war-torn nation during the visit , which comes just two weeks ahead of nationwide elections , rasmussen was also due to hold talks with some of the other candidates for the presidency . although karzai leads a field of some 40 people standing for the top job , he has been widely criticized for avoiding the public campaign trail and deciding instead to carve out alliances with powerful but often corrupt political kingmakers . appeal to the taliban at wednesday 's press conference , karzai called on the taliban and hezbi islami , an associate group of the taliban , to renounce violence and participate in the elections . " we will request the taliban to have the afghan national interest in their hearts and minds and come and participate in the elections and , through voting , bring stability for afghanistan , " karzai said . " after elections , if i win , my first priority will be solidifying and speeding the peace process with the taliban and hezbi islami , and all other groups who are not part of al-qaeda or other terrorist networks , " he added . the worsening security and high casualties on the side of international troops have forced several nato and non-nato countries to call for talks with taliban militants , who , despite the ouster of their regime some eight years ago , are still a force to be reckoned with . rasmussen ’ s comments reflected that view .
" i am ready to take pragmatic steps that can include the security for our troops and even talks with a number of groups within the afghan society , " he said . however , he was at pains to clarify that a prerequisite for such an engagement was that the groups “ put down their weapons and abide by the laws in this country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and afghan forces have been working together to recapture areas held by taliban militants securing taliban strongholds with campaigning for the presidential and provincial council elections in full swing , nato forces are pressing ahead with operations designed to secure taliban strongholds in a last bid to allow voting to take place in restive areas . " our troops will do their utmost to ensure the best possible security around the elections , " rasmussen said , adding : " it is an opportunity for the afghan people to demonstrate that you do not bow to threats and violence of the enemies of afghanistan . " the election is afghanistan 's only second-ever democratic poll after the extremist taliban regime was ousted back in 2001 . the taliban , who ruled afghanistan between 1996 and 2001 , have managed to orchestrate an insurgency that has escalated to record levels .
the intensification is putting a huge strain on us and nato-led forces that have grown to number more than 100,000 . there are concerns that violence will overshadow the elections , deter afghans from going out to vote , and undermine the credibility of a poll that is being seen as a test of an internationally-funded drive to install democracy . bundeswehr troops in isaf bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 3,500 troops stationed in northern afghanistan as part of the isaf mission last month , officials in berlin confirmed that germany 's military , the bundeswehr , was engaged in its largest-ever offensive against the taliban .
this was in response to increased taliban attacks in the north of the country , where most of germany ’ s 3,700 troops are stationed . the latest deployment involved some 300 members of the bundeswehr 's quick reaction force and , for the first time , included armored units fighting with close air support . german defence minister franz josef jung justified the offensive , saying : " we are now being particularly challenged in kunduz . "
however , jung insisted on calling the operation a " stabilization deployment ” ahead of the elections . not an exit strategy the former danish prime minister took charge of the 28-nation nato on monday , pledging to make afghanistan his top priority and prevent the war-torn country from once again becoming a hub of international terrorism . rasmussen , who has a four-year mandate , said the long-term goal was to " move forward concretely and visibly with transferring lead security responsibility in afghanistan to the afghans . " " i believe , during my term , afghans must take over lead responsibility for security in most of their country , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community has spent a huge amount of resources to train afghanistan 's army and police however , he rejected any suggestion that such a strategy amounted to a cut and run strategy as pure propaganda . " let me be clear .
nato must and will be there in support .
let no taliban propaganda try to sell my message as a run for -lrb- the -rrb- exit .
it is not , " he said . while rasmussen ’ s comments were aimed at reassuring afghans , his visit has come at an awkward time , with residents in the southern province of kandahar saying that a nato bomb attack had killed four civilians , including three children . afghan people have become increasingly vocal about their anger over the growing number of civilian casualties as a result of operations by nato and the us-led coalition . rb / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the visit comes as taliban-led violence escalates ahead of the august 20 elections . on his maiden visit to afghanistan , anders fogh rasmussen repeated a pledge he made on his first working day in his job as nato secretary general : to make afghanistan his highest priority . " afghanistan is the first country i 'm visiting in my new capacity as secretary general of nato , " he said at a joint press conference with afghan president hamid karzai in kabul on wednesday . " i give very high priority to afghanistan ; actually it will be my highest priority as secretary general , " rasmussen added . he vowed that troops from the western military alliance would do their utmost to provide " the best possible security " for the august 20 presidential election . " i assure you , the afghan people , that we will stay to support you for as long as it takes to finish our job , " he said in a bid to reassure afghans in the run-up to the polls . first-hand appraisal over 64,000 of some 100,000 international troops deployed from 42 countries are serving in the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan .
nato troops operate alongside a us-led coalition . nato officials say their aim is to help stabilize a country suffering from three decades of war , resurgent islamists , poverty and corruption . rasmussen aims to assess first-hand the fight against an escalating taliban-led insurgency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai and 40 other candidates are in the race to lead the war-torn nation during the visit , which comes just two weeks ahead of nationwide elections , rasmussen was also due to hold talks with some of the other candidates for the presidency . although karzai leads a field of some 40 people standing for the top job , he has been widely criticized for avoiding the public campaign trail and deciding instead to carve out alliances with powerful but often corrupt political kingmakers . appeal to the taliban at wednesday 's press conference , karzai called on the taliban and hezbi islami , an associate group of the taliban , to renounce violence and participate in the elections . " we will request the taliban to have the afghan national interest in their hearts and minds and come and participate in the elections and , through voting , bring stability for afghanistan , " karzai said . " after elections , if i win , my first priority will be solidifying and speeding the peace process with the taliban and hezbi islami , and all other groups who are not part of al-qaeda or other terrorist networks , " he added . the worsening security and high casualties on the side of international troops have forced several nato and non-nato countries to call for talks with taliban militants , who , despite the ouster of their regime some eight years ago , are still a force to be reckoned with . rasmussen ’ s comments reflected that view .
" i am ready to take pragmatic steps that can include the security for our troops and even talks with a number of groups within the afghan society , " he said . however , he was at pains to clarify that a prerequisite for such an engagement was that the groups “ put down their weapons and abide by the laws in this country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and afghan forces have been working together to recapture areas held by taliban militants securing taliban strongholds with campaigning for the presidential and provincial council elections in full swing , nato forces are pressing ahead with operations designed to secure taliban strongholds in a last bid to allow voting to take place in restive areas . " our troops will do their utmost to ensure the best possible security around the elections , " rasmussen said , adding : " it is an opportunity for the afghan people to demonstrate that you do not bow to threats and violence of the enemies of afghanistan . " the election is afghanistan 's only second-ever democratic poll after the extremist taliban regime was ousted back in 2001 . the taliban , who ruled afghanistan between 1996 and 2001 , have managed to orchestrate an insurgency that has escalated to record levels .
the intensification is putting a huge strain on us and nato-led forces that have grown to number more than 100,000 . there are concerns that violence will overshadow the elections , deter afghans from going out to vote , and undermine the credibility of a poll that is being seen as a test of an internationally-funded drive to install democracy . bundeswehr troops in isaf bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 3,500 troops stationed in northern afghanistan as part of the isaf mission last month , officials in berlin confirmed that germany 's military , the bundeswehr , was engaged in its largest-ever offensive against the taliban .
this was in response to increased taliban attacks in the north of the country , where most of germany ’ s 3,700 troops are stationed . the latest deployment involved some 300 members of the bundeswehr 's quick reaction force and , for the first time , included armored units fighting with close air support . german defence minister franz josef jung justified the offensive , saying : " we are now being particularly challenged in kunduz . "
however , jung insisted on calling the operation a " stabilization deployment ” ahead of the elections . not an exit strategy the former danish prime minister took charge of the 28-nation nato on monday , pledging to make afghanistan his top priority and prevent the war-torn country from once again becoming a hub of international terrorism . rasmussen , who has a four-year mandate , said the long-term goal was to " move forward concretely and visibly with transferring lead security responsibility in afghanistan to the afghans . " " i believe , during my term , afghans must take over lead responsibility for security in most of their country , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community has spent a huge amount of resources to train afghanistan 's army and police however , he rejected any suggestion that such a strategy amounted to a cut and run strategy as pure propaganda . " let me be clear .
nato must and will be there in support .
let no taliban propaganda try to sell my message as a run for -lrb- the -rrb- exit .
it is not , " he said . while rasmussen ’ s comments were aimed at reassuring afghans , his visit has come at an awkward time , with residents in the southern province of kandahar saying that a nato bomb attack had killed four civilians , including three children . afghan people have become increasingly vocal about their anger over the growing number of civilian casualties as a result of operations by nato and the us-led coalition . rb / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we will request the taliban to have the afghan national interest in their hearts and minds and come and participate in the elections and , through voting , bring stability for afghanistan , " karzai said . " after elections , if i win , my first priority will be solidifying and speeding the peace process with the taliban and hezbi islami , and all other groups who are not part of al-qaeda or other terrorist networks , " he added . the worsening security and high casualties on the side of international troops have forced several nato and non-nato countries to call for talks with taliban militants , who , despite the ouster of their regime some eight years ago , are still a force to be reckoned with . rasmussen ’ s comments reflected that view .
" i am ready to take pragmatic steps that can include the security for our troops and even talks with a number of groups within the afghan society , " he said . however , he was at pains to clarify that a prerequisite for such an engagement was that the groups “ put down their weapons and abide by the laws in this country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and afghan forces have been working together to recapture areas held by taliban militants securing taliban strongholds with campaigning for the presidential and provincial council elections in full swing , nato forces are pressing ahead with operations designed to secure taliban strongholds in a last bid to allow voting to take place in restive areas . " our troops will do their utmost to ensure the best possible security around the elections , " rasmussen said , adding : " it is an opportunity for the afghan people to demonstrate that you do not bow to threats and violence of the enemies of afghanistan . " the election is afghanistan 's only second-ever democratic poll after the extremist taliban regime was ousted back in 2001 . the taliban , who ruled afghanistan between 1996 and 2001 , have managed to orchestrate an insurgency that has escalated to record levels .
the intensification is putting a huge strain on us and nato-led forces that have grown to number more than 100,000 . there are concerns that violence will overshadow the elections , deter afghans from going out to vote , and undermine the credibility of a poll that is being seen as a test of an internationally-funded drive to install democracy . bundeswehr troops in isaf bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 3,500 troops stationed in northern afghanistan as part of the isaf mission last month , officials in berlin confirmed that germany 's military , the bundeswehr , was engaged in its largest-ever offensive against the taliban .
this was in response to increased taliban attacks in the north of the country , where most of germany ’ s 3,700 troops are stationed . the latest deployment involved some 300 members of the bundeswehr 's quick reaction force and , for the first time , included armored units fighting with close air support . german defence minister franz josef jung justified the offensive , saying : " we are now being particularly challenged in kunduz . "
however , jung insisted on calling the operation a " stabilization deployment ” ahead of the elections . not an exit strategy the former danish prime minister took charge of the 28-nation nato on monday , pledging to make afghanistan his top priority and prevent the war-torn country from once again becoming a hub of international terrorism . rasmussen , who has a four-year mandate , said the long-term goal was to " move forward concretely and visibly with transferring lead security responsibility in afghanistan to the afghans . " " i believe , during my term , afghans must take over lead responsibility for security in most of their country , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community has spent a huge amount of resources to train afghanistan 's army and police however , he rejected any suggestion that such a strategy amounted to a cut and run strategy as pure propaganda .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 05.08.2009 french fruit farmers slam eu demands to pay back subsidies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fruit and vegetable farmers in france say they are already suffering from falling prices and incomes the eu has extended a deadline for paris to explain how it will recover huge subsidies paid to its fruit farmers that are now deemed illegal .
but farmers are up in arms over demands to pay back up to 500 million euros . the european commission ruled in january that subsidies worth around 338 million euros -lrb- $ 486.4 million -rrb- paid between 1992 and 2002 by the french government to support its fruit and vegetable sector had violated european farm and state aid policy .
the eu executive has said the subsidies gave french farmers an unfair advantage over their european competitors .
the commission has ruled that french growers now owe a total sum of about 500 million euros , including interest charges .
farmers angry about pay back demands the announcement has been met with widespread anger and disbelief in orchards and vegetable markets across france .
the eu decision comes at a time when farmers in europe 's largest farm economy have already been protesting against a recession-linked drop in demand and sliding incomes .
" we just do n't understand it .
these recent weeks , we 've been telling the government how bad things are for us .
and the first answer we get is this - that we have to pay back money we received 10 even 15 years ago , " salvatore esorordu , a fruit grower from the southern region of gard , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : producer prices for fruit and vegetables are plummeting " it 's a provocation .
prices are at their worst level in 20 years , " he added .
producer prices for fruit and vegetables fell 3.1 percent in june , putting them down 17.6 percent year-on-year , according to latest data from french statistics office insee .
the french fruit and vegetable sector , the third-largest in europe , also says it faces growing cheap competition from fellow eu countries that have lower labor costs .
france to negotiate hefty sum france has disputed the hefty sum the eu wants to claw back from fruit and vegetable farmers .
but if the government fails to refund the money , it would be liable to pay a heavy fine .
typically , such fines are open-ended , calculated on the basis of the time it takes the government to act .
if it does n't comply , the fine goes on increasing .
farm minister bruno le maire said this week that france would accept the eu demand for recouping some of the subsidies , but emphasized that he would negotiate with the eu over the total sum .
he also said he wanted the recovery of subsidies to be done gradually and on a case-by-case basis so as to avoid forcing vulnerable farmers to pay back .
" we want the reimbursements to be spread over time .
it would put an unbearable strain on farmers if they 're forced to pay this money back immediately , " le maire said .
" unfair and immoral " this is not the first time france has been forced to ask farmers to pay back subsidies .
but in the past , french farmers received generous aid directly from the european commission .
this time , any recovery of subsidies will go back into the french budget , not eu coffers .
that 's why the french government has more of an incentive to recoup the cash .
but french farmers are unlikely to accept the demands without a fight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josé bové has urged french farmers to fight the eu demands to pay back subsidies josé bové , a french member of the european parliament and former president of the peasants confederation farmers ' union , has urged civil disobedience .
" the farmers must not reimburse this money , " bové said .
" if the government sends them letters telling them to do so , i encourage them to refuse and disobey because it 's unfair and immoral . "

the video carried the slogan " don ’ t go to the polls " and was a copy of a us video campaign that ran ahead of the 2008 elections .
in the american version , a host of a-listers advise viewers not to bother to go and vote , complaining that politicians are all the same and asking why anyone should care what happens to health care , education or the environment .
the video was , of course , ironic and the same stars then told the public that the only way to make a difference on issues that mattered to them , was to vote .
a year later and politik-digital.de , headed by stefan gehrke , has produced a similar video using german celebrities and employing the same tactic .
but in the german version the clip ends with the celebrities still telling people not to vote .
provoking the public this change was a deliberate attempt by gehrke to provoke the public .
" we wanted to provoke , because we know there have been a lot of campaigns against voter apathy in recent years that have n't worked .
that ’ s why we thought we would take the risk that some people might not get the irony . we had the anchor man of the german news show , ' tagesschau ‘ and he is normally very conservative just reading the news .
he says in the video , ' you may not believe me , me but i don ’ t vote .
i think , if you think for just one second , you get that it would never be possible that this guy wouldn ’ t vote or would tell the people not to vote , " says gehrke .
a week later the company released a second video , which , like the us version , shows the stars abandoning all irony and telling the public to get out and vote .
replying to accusations that the campaign may have backfired and that the original irony was lost on the german public , gehrke says he is happy for the media attention this has brought to the problem he is actually trying to tackle , which is voter apathy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this way to vote " - the hope is that more voters will heed the call in 2009 since an all-time high in 1976 when 90 percent of the population cast their votes , voter turnout in germany has been decreasing .
and although the decline has been marginal – dropping from 79 percent in 1994 to 77.7 percent in 2005 – it is reason enough for the german institute for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- to want to play an active role in getting german voters back to the polling booths .
with just over fifty days to go before election day , more than 80 german celebrities and sports stars have taken part in a bpb advertising campaign that hopes to inspire people to go out and vote .
as of wednesday morning the ads are freely available to all radio stations .
" we don ’ t care who you vote for , just as long as you vote ! "
thomas krueger , president of the bpb , is running the radio ad campaign .
the production of the ads is part of a service , says krueger , to help radio stations find a way to reach the public that is not simply through the official party campaigns .
" it 's not about who you vote for , or which party you choose .
it 's that you vote in the first place , " krueger says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy is like sport .
if you do n't use it you lose it soccer players philipp lahm of bayern munich and per mertesacker of werder bremen , as well as boxing champion wladimir klitschko , are some of the sports stars taking part in the campaign , which all the celebrities have signed up for free of charge .
" we want to send out a message that federal elections are more than just an obligatory event that are more or less frustrating .
they are our constitutional right and a chance for us to decide which direction germany will take over the next four years . " says krueger .
" democracy is like sport " " if you don ’ t practise , you lose the hang of it , " wladimir klitschko says of democracy .
classical violin virtuoso , anne-sophie mutter asks voters to imagine their neighbor deciding every day what concert – rock , pop or classical - they should listen to .
every day for four years !
all together , 160 german celebrities have taken part in the campaign , which krüger says is about giving the public a political message from people they can actually relate to and not just politicians .
krüger also applauds gehrke ’ s efforts towards the same end , although , he says , you have to be careful to send the message in the right packaging .
" i have a lot of time for irony , but you do have to account for the fact that the german public is different to the us public .
you can ’ t always carry concepts across borders , one has to adapt the concept to the german public .
it 's possible that this sort of irony isn ’ t part of the german psyche yet .
but you have to try everything to get people ’ s attention , " he says .
krüger says he wants people to think again and realise that , even if they feel disillusioned or cynical , their vote is the only way to tackle the issues important to them .
these ads , he says , are our way of giving democracy a boost .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 05.08.2009 french fruit farmers slam eu demands to pay back subsidies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fruit and vegetable farmers in france say they are already suffering from falling prices and incomes the eu has extended a deadline for paris to explain how it will recover huge subsidies paid to its fruit farmers that are now deemed illegal .
but farmers are up in arms over demands to pay back up to 500 million euros . the european commission ruled in january that subsidies worth around 338 million euros -lrb- $ 486.4 million -rrb- paid between 1992 and 2002 by the french government to support its fruit and vegetable sector had violated european farm and state aid policy .
the eu executive has said the subsidies gave french farmers an unfair advantage over their european competitors .
the commission has ruled that french growers now owe a total sum of about 500 million euros , including interest charges .
farmers angry about pay back demands the announcement has been met with widespread anger and disbelief in orchards and vegetable markets across france .
the eu decision comes at a time when farmers in europe 's largest farm economy have already been protesting against a recession-linked drop in demand and sliding incomes .
" we just do n't understand it .
these recent weeks , we 've been telling the government how bad things are for us .
and the first answer we get is this - that we have to pay back money we received 10 even 15 years ago , " salvatore esorordu , a fruit grower from the southern region of gard , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : producer prices for fruit and vegetables are plummeting " it 's a provocation .
prices are at their worst level in 20 years , " he added .
producer prices for fruit and vegetables fell 3.1 percent in june , putting them down 17.6 percent year-on-year , according to latest data from french statistics office insee .
the french fruit and vegetable sector , the third-largest in europe , also says it faces growing cheap competition from fellow eu countries that have lower labor costs .
france to negotiate hefty sum france has disputed the hefty sum the eu wants to claw back from fruit and vegetable farmers .
but if the government fails to refund the money , it would be liable to pay a heavy fine .
typically , such fines are open-ended , calculated on the basis of the time it takes the government to act .
if it does n't comply , the fine goes on increasing .
farm minister bruno le maire said this week that france would accept the eu demand for recouping some of the subsidies , but emphasized that he would negotiate with the eu over the total sum .
he also said he wanted the recovery of subsidies to be done gradually and on a case-by-case basis so as to avoid forcing vulnerable farmers to pay back .
" we want the reimbursements to be spread over time .
it would put an unbearable strain on farmers if they 're forced to pay this money back immediately , " le maire said .
" unfair and immoral " this is not the first time france has been forced to ask farmers to pay back subsidies .
but in the past , french farmers received generous aid directly from the european commission .
this time , any recovery of subsidies will go back into the french budget , not eu coffers .
that 's why the french government has more of an incentive to recoup the cash .
but french farmers are unlikely to accept the demands without a fight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josé bové has urged french farmers to fight the eu demands to pay back subsidies josé bové , a french member of the european parliament and former president of the peasants confederation farmers ' union , has urged civil disobedience .
" the farmers must not reimburse this money , " bové said .
" if the government sends them letters telling them to do so , i encourage them to refuse and disobey because it 's unfair and immoral . "

the vessel was seized on april 4 , around 400 nautical miles off the somali coast , between kenya and the seychelles .
the crew on the container ship includes five germans , three russians , two filipinos , two ukrainians and 12 sailors from the south pacific nation of tuvalu .
frank-walter steinmeier , german foreign minister and social democratic chancellor candidate in up-coming elections , said ransom payments were not good " for dealing with kidnappings . "

he said he had written to chancellor angela merkel , president horst koehler and other leading politicians , but never received a response .

the visit comes as taliban-led violence escalates ahead of the august 20 elections . on his maiden visit to afghanistan , anders fogh rasmussen repeated a pledge he made on his first working day in his job as nato secretary general : to make afghanistan his highest priority . " afghanistan is the first country i 'm visiting in my new capacity as secretary general of nato , " he said at a joint press conference with afghan president hamid karzai in kabul on wednesday . " i give very high priority to afghanistan ; actually it will be my highest priority as secretary general , " rasmussen added . he vowed that troops from the western military alliance would do their utmost to provide " the best possible security " for the august 20 presidential election . " i assure you , the afghan people , that we will stay to support you for as long as it takes to finish our job , " he said in a bid to reassure afghans in the run-up to the polls . first-hand appraisal over 64,000 of some 100,000 international troops deployed from 42 countries are serving in the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan .
nato troops operate alongside a us-led coalition . nato officials say their aim is to help stabilize a country suffering from three decades of war , resurgent islamists , poverty and corruption . rasmussen aims to assess first-hand the fight against an escalating taliban-led insurgency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai and 40 other candidates are in the race to lead the war-torn nation during the visit , which comes just two weeks ahead of nationwide elections , rasmussen was also due to hold talks with some of the other candidates for the presidency . although karzai leads a field of some 40 people standing for the top job , he has been widely criticized for avoiding the public campaign trail and deciding instead to carve out alliances with powerful but often corrupt political kingmakers . appeal to the taliban at wednesday 's press conference , karzai called on the taliban and hezbi islami , an associate group of the taliban , to renounce violence and participate in the elections . " we will request the taliban to have the afghan national interest in their hearts and minds and come and participate in the elections and , through voting , bring stability for afghanistan , " karzai said . " after elections , if i win , my first priority will be solidifying and speeding the peace process with the taliban and hezbi islami , and all other groups who are not part of al-qaeda or other terrorist networks , " he added . the worsening security and high casualties on the side of international troops have forced several nato and non-nato countries to call for talks with taliban militants , who , despite the ouster of their regime some eight years ago , are still a force to be reckoned with . rasmussen ’ s comments reflected that view .
" i am ready to take pragmatic steps that can include the security for our troops and even talks with a number of groups within the afghan society , " he said . however , he was at pains to clarify that a prerequisite for such an engagement was that the groups “ put down their weapons and abide by the laws in this country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and afghan forces have been working together to recapture areas held by taliban militants securing taliban strongholds with campaigning for the presidential and provincial council elections in full swing , nato forces are pressing ahead with operations designed to secure taliban strongholds in a last bid to allow voting to take place in restive areas . " our troops will do their utmost to ensure the best possible security around the elections , " rasmussen said , adding : " it is an opportunity for the afghan people to demonstrate that you do not bow to threats and violence of the enemies of afghanistan . " the election is afghanistan 's only second-ever democratic poll after the extremist taliban regime was ousted back in 2001 . the taliban , who ruled afghanistan between 1996 and 2001 , have managed to orchestrate an insurgency that has escalated to record levels .
the intensification is putting a huge strain on us and nato-led forces that have grown to number more than 100,000 . there are concerns that violence will overshadow the elections , deter afghans from going out to vote , and undermine the credibility of a poll that is being seen as a test of an internationally-funded drive to install democracy . bundeswehr troops in isaf bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 3,500 troops stationed in northern afghanistan as part of the isaf mission last month , officials in berlin confirmed that germany 's military , the bundeswehr , was engaged in its largest-ever offensive against the taliban .
this was in response to increased taliban attacks in the north of the country , where most of germany ’ s 3,700 troops are stationed . the latest deployment involved some 300 members of the bundeswehr 's quick reaction force and , for the first time , included armored units fighting with close air support . german defence minister franz josef jung justified the offensive , saying : " we are now being particularly challenged in kunduz . "
however , jung insisted on calling the operation a " stabilization deployment ” ahead of the elections . not an exit strategy the former danish prime minister took charge of the 28-nation nato on monday , pledging to make afghanistan his top priority and prevent the war-torn country from once again becoming a hub of international terrorism . rasmussen , who has a four-year mandate , said the long-term goal was to " move forward concretely and visibly with transferring lead security responsibility in afghanistan to the afghans . " " i believe , during my term , afghans must take over lead responsibility for security in most of their country , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community has spent a huge amount of resources to train afghanistan 's army and police however , he rejected any suggestion that such a strategy amounted to a cut and run strategy as pure propaganda . " let me be clear .

the visit comes as taliban-led violence escalates ahead of the august 20 elections . on his maiden visit to afghanistan , anders fogh rasmussen repeated a pledge he made on his first working day in his job as nato secretary general : to make afghanistan his highest priority . " afghanistan is the first country i 'm visiting in my new capacity as secretary general of nato , " he said at a joint press conference with afghan president hamid karzai in kabul on wednesday . " i give very high priority to afghanistan ; actually it will be my highest priority as secretary general , " rasmussen added . he vowed that troops from the western military alliance would do their utmost to provide " the best possible security " for the august 20 presidential election . " i assure you , the afghan people , that we will stay to support you for as long as it takes to finish our job , " he said in a bid to reassure afghans in the run-up to the polls . first-hand appraisal over 64,000 of some 100,000 international troops deployed from 42 countries are serving in the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan .
nato troops operate alongside a us-led coalition . nato officials say their aim is to help stabilize a country suffering from three decades of war , resurgent islamists , poverty and corruption . rasmussen aims to assess first-hand the fight against an escalating taliban-led insurgency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai and 40 other candidates are in the race to lead the war-torn nation during the visit , which comes just two weeks ahead of nationwide elections , rasmussen was also due to hold talks with some of the other candidates for the presidency . although karzai leads a field of some 40 people standing for the top job , he has been widely criticized for avoiding the public campaign trail and deciding instead to carve out alliances with powerful but often corrupt political kingmakers . appeal to the taliban at wednesday 's press conference , karzai called on the taliban and hezbi islami , an associate group of the taliban , to renounce violence and participate in the elections . " we will request the taliban to have the afghan national interest in their hearts and minds and come and participate in the elections and , through voting , bring stability for afghanistan , " karzai said . " after elections , if i win , my first priority will be solidifying and speeding the peace process with the taliban and hezbi islami , and all other groups who are not part of al-qaeda or other terrorist networks , " he added . the worsening security and high casualties on the side of international troops have forced several nato and non-nato countries to call for talks with taliban militants , who , despite the ouster of their regime some eight years ago , are still a force to be reckoned with . rasmussen ’ s comments reflected that view .
" i am ready to take pragmatic steps that can include the security for our troops and even talks with a number of groups within the afghan society , " he said . however , he was at pains to clarify that a prerequisite for such an engagement was that the groups “ put down their weapons and abide by the laws in this country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and afghan forces have been working together to recapture areas held by taliban militants securing taliban strongholds with campaigning for the presidential and provincial council elections in full swing , nato forces are pressing ahead with operations designed to secure taliban strongholds in a last bid to allow voting to take place in restive areas . " our troops will do their utmost to ensure the best possible security around the elections , " rasmussen said , adding : " it is an opportunity for the afghan people to demonstrate that you do not bow to threats and violence of the enemies of afghanistan . " the election is afghanistan 's only second-ever democratic poll after the extremist taliban regime was ousted back in 2001 . the taliban , who ruled afghanistan between 1996 and 2001 , have managed to orchestrate an insurgency that has escalated to record levels .
the intensification is putting a huge strain on us and nato-led forces that have grown to number more than 100,000 . there are concerns that violence will overshadow the elections , deter afghans from going out to vote , and undermine the credibility of a poll that is being seen as a test of an internationally-funded drive to install democracy . bundeswehr troops in isaf bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 3,500 troops stationed in northern afghanistan as part of the isaf mission last month , officials in berlin confirmed that germany 's military , the bundeswehr , was engaged in its largest-ever offensive against the taliban .
this was in response to increased taliban attacks in the north of the country , where most of germany ’ s 3,700 troops are stationed . the latest deployment involved some 300 members of the bundeswehr 's quick reaction force and , for the first time , included armored units fighting with close air support . german defence minister franz josef jung justified the offensive , saying : " we are now being particularly challenged in kunduz . "
however , jung insisted on calling the operation a " stabilization deployment ” ahead of the elections . not an exit strategy the former danish prime minister took charge of the 28-nation nato on monday , pledging to make afghanistan his top priority and prevent the war-torn country from once again becoming a hub of international terrorism . rasmussen , who has a four-year mandate , said the long-term goal was to " move forward concretely and visibly with transferring lead security responsibility in afghanistan to the afghans . " " i believe , during my term , afghans must take over lead responsibility for security in most of their country , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community has spent a huge amount of resources to train afghanistan 's army and police however , he rejected any suggestion that such a strategy amounted to a cut and run strategy as pure propaganda .

just as their handcuffs were removed , their armed accomplices entered the room , threatened the five guards and helped the men flee .
the group later fired at police who were chasing them , and they have not been seen since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the palace of justice is impossible to secure , says justice minister de clerck belgian justice minister stefan de clerck has come under attack for the incident .
de clerck admitted that the accused men , each with a criminal record , should have been guarded by armed police instead of just security personnel .
he said the 19th century palace of justice was " a belgian icon , a monument with magnificent architecture " and numerous entrances that would be impossible to completely secure .
" we need to totally isolate and handle criminal cases in another part of the building , " he said .
multiple escapes plague justice minister the dramatic caper is the third such jailbreak in 12 days .
two weeks ago a helicopter airlifted three dangerous inmates out from a prison yard in bruges .
two of those men are still on the run , one of them 26-year-old ashraf sekkaki , described by the international police organization interpol as one of belgium 's most dangerous criminals .
last week six convicts were able to use a ladder from a construction site inside their prison in northern belgium to hop the prison wall .
while four escapees were immediately stopped , two of them , serving sentences for rape , torture and violent robbery , were able to get away in a car waiting for them .
oddly enough , it 's not a crime to break out of prison in belgium .
it 's natural to want freedom , goes the argument .
but it is illegal to help someone to escape .
for example , the elderly mother of one escaped prisoner could get three years in jail as she had been waiting with the getaway car .
the pressure is now on de clerck to explain the rash of escapes .
he was forced to resign from the same position he holds now in 1998 when a murderer and pedophile was able to escape for a few hours .
when the 1998 debacle came up in a television interview with de clerck after wednesday 's incident , the minister bristled at the host .
" i do my work .
i do what i have to do , " said de clerck , who only recently resumed his old post when a new government was formed late last year .
" i had six months time to work here and then you make such a laughable comment .
i think it 's inappropriate . "
the most significant effect of the escapes so far is that outdoor time for belgian prisoners has been limited .

the video carried the slogan " don ’ t go to the polls " and was a copy of a us video campaign that ran ahead of the 2008 elections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 05.08.2009 german celebrities go on air to persuade people to vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " get out and vote " is the message from german celebrities german elections are less than two months away and , as the parties step up their campaigns , celebrities have been roped in to get the message across to the general public that voting is important . a few weeks ago an independent internet advertisement , produced by politik-digital.de , appeared , in which german celebrities , including two well-known news anchors , seemed to be telling people not to vote .
the video carried the slogan " don ’ t go to the polls " and was a copy of a us video campaign that ran ahead of the 2008 elections .
in the american version , a host of a-listers advise viewers not to bother to go and vote , complaining that politicians are all the same and asking why anyone should care what happens to health care , education or the environment .
the video was , of course , ironic and the same stars then told the public that the only way to make a difference on issues that mattered to them , was to vote .
a year later and politik-digital.de , headed by stefan gehrke , has produced a similar video using german celebrities and employing the same tactic .
but in the german version the clip ends with the celebrities still telling people not to vote .
provoking the public this change was a deliberate attempt by gehrke to provoke the public .
" we wanted to provoke , because we know there have been a lot of campaigns against voter apathy in recent years that have n't worked .
that ’ s why we thought we would take the risk that some people might not get the irony . we had the anchor man of the german news show , ' tagesschau ‘ and he is normally very conservative just reading the news .
he says in the video , ' you may not believe me , me but i don ’ t vote .
i think , if you think for just one second , you get that it would never be possible that this guy wouldn ’ t vote or would tell the people not to vote , " says gehrke .
a week later the company released a second video , which , like the us version , shows the stars abandoning all irony and telling the public to get out and vote .
replying to accusations that the campaign may have backfired and that the original irony was lost on the german public , gehrke says he is happy for the media attention this has brought to the problem he is actually trying to tackle , which is voter apathy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this way to vote " - the hope is that more voters will heed the call in 2009 since an all-time high in 1976 when 90 percent of the population cast their votes , voter turnout in germany has been decreasing .
and although the decline has been marginal – dropping from 79 percent in 1994 to 77.7 percent in 2005 – it is reason enough for the german institute for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- to want to play an active role in getting german voters back to the polling booths .
with just over fifty days to go before election day , more than 80 german celebrities and sports stars have taken part in a bpb advertising campaign that hopes to inspire people to go out and vote .
as of wednesday morning the ads are freely available to all radio stations .
" we don ’ t care who you vote for , just as long as you vote ! "
thomas krueger , president of the bpb , is running the radio ad campaign .
the production of the ads is part of a service , says krueger , to help radio stations find a way to reach the public that is not simply through the official party campaigns .
" it 's not about who you vote for , or which party you choose .
it 's that you vote in the first place , " krueger says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy is like sport .
if you do n't use it you lose it soccer players philipp lahm of bayern munich and per mertesacker of werder bremen , as well as boxing champion wladimir klitschko , are some of the sports stars taking part in the campaign , which all the celebrities have signed up for free of charge .
" we want to send out a message that federal elections are more than just an obligatory event that are more or less frustrating .
they are our constitutional right and a chance for us to decide which direction germany will take over the next four years . " says krueger .
" democracy is like sport " " if you don ’ t practise , you lose the hang of it , " wladimir klitschko says of democracy .
classical violin virtuoso , anne-sophie mutter asks voters to imagine their neighbor deciding every day what concert – rock , pop or classical - they should listen to .
every day for four years !
all together , 160 german celebrities have taken part in the campaign , which krüger says is about giving the public a political message from people they can actually relate to and not just politicians .
krüger also applauds gehrke ’ s efforts towards the same end , although , he says , you have to be careful to send the message in the right packaging .
" i have a lot of time for irony , but you do have to account for the fact that the german public is different to the us public .
you can ’ t always carry concepts across borders , one has to adapt the concept to the german public .
it 's possible that this sort of irony isn ’ t part of the german psyche yet .
but you have to try everything to get people ’ s attention , " he says .
krüger says he wants people to think again and realise that , even if they feel disillusioned or cynical , their vote is the only way to tackle the issues important to them .
these ads , he says , are our way of giving democracy a boost .

the visit comes as taliban-led violence escalates ahead of the august 20 elections . on his maiden visit to afghanistan , anders fogh rasmussen repeated a pledge he made on his first working day in his job as nato secretary general : to make afghanistan his highest priority . " afghanistan is the first country i 'm visiting in my new capacity as secretary general of nato , " he said at a joint press conference with afghan president hamid karzai in kabul on wednesday . " i give very high priority to afghanistan ; actually it will be my highest priority as secretary general , " rasmussen added . he vowed that troops from the western military alliance would do their utmost to provide " the best possible security " for the august 20 presidential election . " i assure you , the afghan people , that we will stay to support you for as long as it takes to finish our job , " he said in a bid to reassure afghans in the run-up to the polls . first-hand appraisal over 64,000 of some 100,000 international troops deployed from 42 countries are serving in the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan .
nato troops operate alongside a us-led coalition . nato officials say their aim is to help stabilize a country suffering from three decades of war , resurgent islamists , poverty and corruption . rasmussen aims to assess first-hand the fight against an escalating taliban-led insurgency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai and 40 other candidates are in the race to lead the war-torn nation during the visit , which comes just two weeks ahead of nationwide elections , rasmussen was also due to hold talks with some of the other candidates for the presidency . although karzai leads a field of some 40 people standing for the top job , he has been widely criticized for avoiding the public campaign trail and deciding instead to carve out alliances with powerful but often corrupt political kingmakers . appeal to the taliban at wednesday 's press conference , karzai called on the taliban and hezbi islami , an associate group of the taliban , to renounce violence and participate in the elections . " we will request the taliban to have the afghan national interest in their hearts and minds and come and participate in the elections and , through voting , bring stability for afghanistan , " karzai said . " after elections , if i win , my first priority will be solidifying and speeding the peace process with the taliban and hezbi islami , and all other groups who are not part of al-qaeda or other terrorist networks , " he added . the worsening security and high casualties on the side of international troops have forced several nato and non-nato countries to call for talks with taliban militants , who , despite the ouster of their regime some eight years ago , are still a force to be reckoned with . rasmussen ’ s comments reflected that view .
" i am ready to take pragmatic steps that can include the security for our troops and even talks with a number of groups within the afghan society , " he said . however , he was at pains to clarify that a prerequisite for such an engagement was that the groups “ put down their weapons and abide by the laws in this country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and afghan forces have been working together to recapture areas held by taliban militants securing taliban strongholds with campaigning for the presidential and provincial council elections in full swing , nato forces are pressing ahead with operations designed to secure taliban strongholds in a last bid to allow voting to take place in restive areas . " our troops will do their utmost to ensure the best possible security around the elections , " rasmussen said , adding : " it is an opportunity for the afghan people to demonstrate that you do not bow to threats and violence of the enemies of afghanistan . " the election is afghanistan 's only second-ever democratic poll after the extremist taliban regime was ousted back in 2001 . the taliban , who ruled afghanistan between 1996 and 2001 , have managed to orchestrate an insurgency that has escalated to record levels .
the intensification is putting a huge strain on us and nato-led forces that have grown to number more than 100,000 . there are concerns that violence will overshadow the elections , deter afghans from going out to vote , and undermine the credibility of a poll that is being seen as a test of an internationally-funded drive to install democracy . bundeswehr troops in isaf bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 3,500 troops stationed in northern afghanistan as part of the isaf mission last month , officials in berlin confirmed that germany 's military , the bundeswehr , was engaged in its largest-ever offensive against the taliban .
this was in response to increased taliban attacks in the north of the country , where most of germany ’ s 3,700 troops are stationed . the latest deployment involved some 300 members of the bundeswehr 's quick reaction force and , for the first time , included armored units fighting with close air support . german defence minister franz josef jung justified the offensive , saying : " we are now being particularly challenged in kunduz . "

manfred guellner , the head of the forsa institute , said that the dip in support for the spd was partly caused by a scandal involving health minister ulla schmidt who took her official car on holiday , prompting a public outcry .
" the affair stirred up all the reservations about the spd that were already there : incompetence and distance from the people , " said guellner .
frank-walter steinmeier , the spd 's chancellor candidate and current german foreign minister , has struggled to make dents in merkel 's popularity despite unveiling a campaign team including several new faces and making a contentious pledge to bring full employment to europe 's largest economy by 2020 .
however , in germany 's complex system of coalition politics , voters choose parties , not individuals , and elections do not boil down to a straight race between the two main parties .
end in sight for grand coalition ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants to cut steinmeier 's spd loose merkel wants to ditch the spd – currently junior partners in an unwieldy grand coalition – and govern instead with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , whose support also rose by one point to 14 percent , according to the poll .
this would , in theory , give merkel the necessary majority to form her desired coalition after the september 27 election , albeit with a slim 51 percent .
the green party rose by one point to 13 percent and the far-left left party also gained in support , rising to 11 percent .

but farmers are up in arms over demands to pay back up to 500 million euros . the european commission ruled in january that subsidies worth around 338 million euros -lrb- $ 486.4 million -rrb- paid between 1992 and 2002 by the french government to support its fruit and vegetable sector had violated european farm and state aid policy .
the eu executive has said the subsidies gave french farmers an unfair advantage over their european competitors .
the commission has ruled that french growers now owe a total sum of about 500 million euros , including interest charges .
farmers angry about pay back demands the announcement has been met with widespread anger and disbelief in orchards and vegetable markets across france .
the eu decision comes at a time when farmers in europe 's largest farm economy have already been protesting against a recession-linked drop in demand and sliding incomes .
" we just do n't understand it .
these recent weeks , we 've been telling the government how bad things are for us .
and the first answer we get is this - that we have to pay back money we received 10 even 15 years ago , " salvatore esorordu , a fruit grower from the southern region of gard , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : producer prices for fruit and vegetables are plummeting " it 's a provocation .
prices are at their worst level in 20 years , " he added .
producer prices for fruit and vegetables fell 3.1 percent in june , putting them down 17.6 percent year-on-year , according to latest data from french statistics office insee .
the french fruit and vegetable sector , the third-largest in europe , also says it faces growing cheap competition from fellow eu countries that have lower labor costs .
france to negotiate hefty sum france has disputed the hefty sum the eu wants to claw back from fruit and vegetable farmers .
but if the government fails to refund the money , it would be liable to pay a heavy fine .
typically , such fines are open-ended , calculated on the basis of the time it takes the government to act .
if it does n't comply , the fine goes on increasing .
farm minister bruno le maire said this week that france would accept the eu demand for recouping some of the subsidies , but emphasized that he would negotiate with the eu over the total sum .
he also said he wanted the recovery of subsidies to be done gradually and on a case-by-case basis so as to avoid forcing vulnerable farmers to pay back .
" we want the reimbursements to be spread over time .
it would put an unbearable strain on farmers if they 're forced to pay this money back immediately , " le maire said .
" unfair and immoral " this is not the first time france has been forced to ask farmers to pay back subsidies .
but in the past , french farmers received generous aid directly from the european commission .
this time , any recovery of subsidies will go back into the french budget , not eu coffers .
that 's why the french government has more of an incentive to recoup the cash .
but french farmers are unlikely to accept the demands without a fight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josé bové has urged french farmers to fight the eu demands to pay back subsidies josé bové , a french member of the european parliament and former president of the peasants confederation farmers ' union , has urged civil disobedience .
" the farmers must not reimburse this money , " bové said .
" if the government sends them letters telling them to do so , i encourage them to refuse and disobey because it 's unfair and immoral . "

but farmers are up in arms over demands to pay back up to 500 million euros . the european commission ruled in january that subsidies worth around 338 million euros -lrb- $ 486.4 million -rrb- paid between 1992 and 2002 by the french government to support its fruit and vegetable sector had violated european farm and state aid policy .
the eu executive has said the subsidies gave french farmers an unfair advantage over their european competitors .
the commission has ruled that french growers now owe a total sum of about 500 million euros , including interest charges .
farmers angry about pay back demands the announcement has been met with widespread anger and disbelief in orchards and vegetable markets across france .
the eu decision comes at a time when farmers in europe 's largest farm economy have already been protesting against a recession-linked drop in demand and sliding incomes .
" we just do n't understand it .
these recent weeks , we 've been telling the government how bad things are for us .
and the first answer we get is this - that we have to pay back money we received 10 even 15 years ago , " salvatore esorordu , a fruit grower from the southern region of gard , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : producer prices for fruit and vegetables are plummeting " it 's a provocation .
prices are at their worst level in 20 years , " he added .
producer prices for fruit and vegetables fell 3.1 percent in june , putting them down 17.6 percent year-on-year , according to latest data from french statistics office insee .
the french fruit and vegetable sector , the third-largest in europe , also says it faces growing cheap competition from fellow eu countries that have lower labor costs .
france to negotiate hefty sum france has disputed the hefty sum the eu wants to claw back from fruit and vegetable farmers .
but if the government fails to refund the money , it would be liable to pay a heavy fine .
typically , such fines are open-ended , calculated on the basis of the time it takes the government to act .
if it does n't comply , the fine goes on increasing .
farm minister bruno le maire said this week that france would accept the eu demand for recouping some of the subsidies , but emphasized that he would negotiate with the eu over the total sum .
he also said he wanted the recovery of subsidies to be done gradually and on a case-by-case basis so as to avoid forcing vulnerable farmers to pay back .
" we want the reimbursements to be spread over time .
it would put an unbearable strain on farmers if they 're forced to pay this money back immediately , " le maire said .
" unfair and immoral " this is not the first time france has been forced to ask farmers to pay back subsidies .
but in the past , french farmers received generous aid directly from the european commission .
this time , any recovery of subsidies will go back into the french budget , not eu coffers .
that 's why the french government has more of an incentive to recoup the cash .
but french farmers are unlikely to accept the demands without a fight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josé bové has urged french farmers to fight the eu demands to pay back subsidies josé bové , a french member of the european parliament and former president of the peasants confederation farmers ' union , has urged civil disobedience .
" the farmers must not reimburse this money , " bové said .
" if the government sends them letters telling them to do so , i encourage them to refuse and disobey because it 's unfair and immoral . "

just as their handcuffs were removed , their armed accomplices entered the room , threatened the five guards and helped the men flee .
the group later fired at police who were chasing them , and they have not been seen since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the palace of justice is impossible to secure , says justice minister de clerck belgian justice minister stefan de clerck has come under attack for the incident .
de clerck admitted that the accused men , each with a criminal record , should have been guarded by armed police instead of just security personnel .
he said the 19th century palace of justice was " a belgian icon , a monument with magnificent architecture " and numerous entrances that would be impossible to completely secure .
" we need to totally isolate and handle criminal cases in another part of the building , " he said .
multiple escapes plague justice minister the dramatic caper is the third such jailbreak in 12 days .
two weeks ago a helicopter airlifted three dangerous inmates out from a prison yard in bruges .
two of those men are still on the run , one of them 26-year-old ashraf sekkaki , described by the international police organization interpol as one of belgium 's most dangerous criminals .
last week six convicts were able to use a ladder from a construction site inside their prison in northern belgium to hop the prison wall .
while four escapees were immediately stopped , two of them , serving sentences for rape , torture and violent robbery , were able to get away in a car waiting for them .
oddly enough , it 's not a crime to break out of prison in belgium .
it 's natural to want freedom , goes the argument .
but it is illegal to help someone to escape .
for example , the elderly mother of one escaped prisoner could get three years in jail as she had been waiting with the getaway car .
the pressure is now on de clerck to explain the rash of escapes .
he was forced to resign from the same position he holds now in 1998 when a murderer and pedophile was able to escape for a few hours .
when the 1998 debacle came up in a television interview with de clerck after wednesday 's incident , the minister bristled at the host .
" i do my work .
i do what i have to do , " said de clerck , who only recently resumed his old post when a new government was formed late last year .
" i had six months time to work here and then you make such a laughable comment .
i think it 's inappropriate . "
the most significant effect of the escapes so far is that outdoor time for belgian prisoners has been limited .
another inmate of the bruges prison , freddy horion , convicted of multiple murders , has now sued the state for not allowing him to exercise in the fresh air. hf / afp / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

just as their handcuffs were removed , their armed accomplices entered the room , threatened the five guards and helped the men flee .
the group later fired at police who were chasing them , and they have not been seen since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the palace of justice is impossible to secure , says justice minister de clerck belgian justice minister stefan de clerck has come under attack for the incident .
de clerck admitted that the accused men , each with a criminal record , should have been guarded by armed police instead of just security personnel .
he said the 19th century palace of justice was " a belgian icon , a monument with magnificent architecture " and numerous entrances that would be impossible to completely secure .
" we need to totally isolate and handle criminal cases in another part of the building , " he said .
multiple escapes plague justice minister the dramatic caper is the third such jailbreak in 12 days .
two weeks ago a helicopter airlifted three dangerous inmates out from a prison yard in bruges .
two of those men are still on the run , one of them 26-year-old ashraf sekkaki , described by the international police organization interpol as one of belgium 's most dangerous criminals .
last week six convicts were able to use a ladder from a construction site inside their prison in northern belgium to hop the prison wall .
while four escapees were immediately stopped , two of them , serving sentences for rape , torture and violent robbery , were able to get away in a car waiting for them .
oddly enough , it 's not a crime to break out of prison in belgium .
it 's natural to want freedom , goes the argument .
but it is illegal to help someone to escape .
for example , the elderly mother of one escaped prisoner could get three years in jail as she had been waiting with the getaway car .
the pressure is now on de clerck to explain the rash of escapes .
he was forced to resign from the same position he holds now in 1998 when a murderer and pedophile was able to escape for a few hours .

the visit comes as taliban-led violence escalates ahead of the august 20 elections . on his maiden visit to afghanistan , anders fogh rasmussen repeated a pledge he made on his first working day in his job as nato secretary general : to make afghanistan his highest priority . " afghanistan is the first country i 'm visiting in my new capacity as secretary general of nato , " he said at a joint press conference with afghan president hamid karzai in kabul on wednesday . " i give very high priority to afghanistan ; actually it will be my highest priority as secretary general , " rasmussen added . he vowed that troops from the western military alliance would do their utmost to provide " the best possible security " for the august 20 presidential election . " i assure you , the afghan people , that we will stay to support you for as long as it takes to finish our job , " he said in a bid to reassure afghans in the run-up to the polls . first-hand appraisal over 64,000 of some 100,000 international troops deployed from 42 countries are serving in the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan .
nato troops operate alongside a us-led coalition . nato officials say their aim is to help stabilize a country suffering from three decades of war , resurgent islamists , poverty and corruption . rasmussen aims to assess first-hand the fight against an escalating taliban-led insurgency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai and 40 other candidates are in the race to lead the war-torn nation during the visit , which comes just two weeks ahead of nationwide elections , rasmussen was also due to hold talks with some of the other candidates for the presidency . although karzai leads a field of some 40 people standing for the top job , he has been widely criticized for avoiding the public campaign trail and deciding instead to carve out alliances with powerful but often corrupt political kingmakers . appeal to the taliban at wednesday 's press conference , karzai called on the taliban and hezbi islami , an associate group of the taliban , to renounce violence and participate in the elections . " we will request the taliban to have the afghan national interest in their hearts and minds and come and participate in the elections and , through voting , bring stability for afghanistan , " karzai said . " after elections , if i win , my first priority will be solidifying and speeding the peace process with the taliban and hezbi islami , and all other groups who are not part of al-qaeda or other terrorist networks , " he added . the worsening security and high casualties on the side of international troops have forced several nato and non-nato countries to call for talks with taliban militants , who , despite the ouster of their regime some eight years ago , are still a force to be reckoned with . rasmussen ’ s comments reflected that view .
" i am ready to take pragmatic steps that can include the security for our troops and even talks with a number of groups within the afghan society , " he said . however , he was at pains to clarify that a prerequisite for such an engagement was that the groups “ put down their weapons and abide by the laws in this country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and afghan forces have been working together to recapture areas held by taliban militants securing taliban strongholds with campaigning for the presidential and provincial council elections in full swing , nato forces are pressing ahead with operations designed to secure taliban strongholds in a last bid to allow voting to take place in restive areas . " our troops will do their utmost to ensure the best possible security around the elections , " rasmussen said , adding : " it is an opportunity for the afghan people to demonstrate that you do not bow to threats and violence of the enemies of afghanistan . " the election is afghanistan 's only second-ever democratic poll after the extremist taliban regime was ousted back in 2001 . the taliban , who ruled afghanistan between 1996 and 2001 , have managed to orchestrate an insurgency that has escalated to record levels .
the intensification is putting a huge strain on us and nato-led forces that have grown to number more than 100,000 . there are concerns that violence will overshadow the elections , deter afghans from going out to vote , and undermine the credibility of a poll that is being seen as a test of an internationally-funded drive to install democracy . bundeswehr troops in isaf bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 3,500 troops stationed in northern afghanistan as part of the isaf mission last month , officials in berlin confirmed that germany 's military , the bundeswehr , was engaged in its largest-ever offensive against the taliban .
this was in response to increased taliban attacks in the north of the country , where most of germany ’ s 3,700 troops are stationed . the latest deployment involved some 300 members of the bundeswehr 's quick reaction force and , for the first time , included armored units fighting with close air support . german defence minister franz josef jung justified the offensive , saying : " we are now being particularly challenged in kunduz . "
however , jung insisted on calling the operation a " stabilization deployment ” ahead of the elections . not an exit strategy the former danish prime minister took charge of the 28-nation nato on monday , pledging to make afghanistan his top priority and prevent the war-torn country from once again becoming a hub of international terrorism . rasmussen , who has a four-year mandate , said the long-term goal was to " move forward concretely and visibly with transferring lead security responsibility in afghanistan to the afghans . " " i believe , during my term , afghans must take over lead responsibility for security in most of their country , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community has spent a huge amount of resources to train afghanistan 's army and police however , he rejected any suggestion that such a strategy amounted to a cut and run strategy as pure propaganda . " let me be clear .
nato must and will be there in support .
let no taliban propaganda try to sell my message as a run for -lrb- the -rrb- exit .
it is not , " he said . while rasmussen ’ s comments were aimed at reassuring afghans , his visit has come at an awkward time , with residents in the southern province of kandahar saying that a nato bomb attack had killed four civilians , including three children . afghan people have become increasingly vocal about their anger over the growing number of civilian casualties as a result of operations by nato and the us-led coalition . rb / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

manfred guellner , the head of the forsa institute , said that the dip in support for the spd was partly caused by a scandal involving health minister ulla schmidt who took her official car on holiday , prompting a public outcry .
" the affair stirred up all the reservations about the spd that were already there : incompetence and distance from the people , " said guellner .
frank-walter steinmeier , the spd 's chancellor candidate and current german foreign minister , has struggled to make dents in merkel 's popularity despite unveiling a campaign team including several new faces and making a contentious pledge to bring full employment to europe 's largest economy by 2020 .
however , in germany 's complex system of coalition politics , voters choose parties , not individuals , and elections do not boil down to a straight race between the two main parties .
end in sight for grand coalition ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants to cut steinmeier 's spd loose merkel wants to ditch the spd – currently junior partners in an unwieldy grand coalition – and govern instead with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , whose support also rose by one point to 14 percent , according to the poll .

but farmers are up in arms over demands to pay back up to 500 million euros . the european commission ruled in january that subsidies worth around 338 million euros -lrb- $ 486.4 million -rrb- paid between 1992 and 2002 by the french government to support its fruit and vegetable sector had violated european farm and state aid policy .
the eu executive has said the subsidies gave french farmers an unfair advantage over their european competitors .
the commission has ruled that french growers now owe a total sum of about 500 million euros , including interest charges .
farmers angry about pay back demands the announcement has been met with widespread anger and disbelief in orchards and vegetable markets across france .
the eu decision comes at a time when farmers in europe 's largest farm economy have already been protesting against a recession-linked drop in demand and sliding incomes .
" we just do n't understand it .
these recent weeks , we 've been telling the government how bad things are for us .
and the first answer we get is this - that we have to pay back money we received 10 even 15 years ago , " salvatore esorordu , a fruit grower from the southern region of gard , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : producer prices for fruit and vegetables are plummeting " it 's a provocation .
prices are at their worst level in 20 years , " he added .
producer prices for fruit and vegetables fell 3.1 percent in june , putting them down 17.6 percent year-on-year , according to latest data from french statistics office insee .
the french fruit and vegetable sector , the third-largest in europe , also says it faces growing cheap competition from fellow eu countries that have lower labor costs .
france to negotiate hefty sum france has disputed the hefty sum the eu wants to claw back from fruit and vegetable farmers .
but if the government fails to refund the money , it would be liable to pay a heavy fine .
typically , such fines are open-ended , calculated on the basis of the time it takes the government to act .
if it does n't comply , the fine goes on increasing .
farm minister bruno le maire said this week that france would accept the eu demand for recouping some of the subsidies , but emphasized that he would negotiate with the eu over the total sum .
he also said he wanted the recovery of subsidies to be done gradually and on a case-by-case basis so as to avoid forcing vulnerable farmers to pay back .
" we want the reimbursements to be spread over time .
it would put an unbearable strain on farmers if they 're forced to pay this money back immediately , " le maire said .
" unfair and immoral " this is not the first time france has been forced to ask farmers to pay back subsidies .
but in the past , french farmers received generous aid directly from the european commission .
this time , any recovery of subsidies will go back into the french budget , not eu coffers .
that 's why the french government has more of an incentive to recoup the cash .
but french farmers are unlikely to accept the demands without a fight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josé bové has urged french farmers to fight the eu demands to pay back subsidies josé bové , a french member of the european parliament and former president of the peasants confederation farmers ' union , has urged civil disobedience .
" the farmers must not reimburse this money , " bové said .
" if the government sends them letters telling them to do so , i encourage them to refuse and disobey because it 's unfair and immoral . "

consultants lane clark & peacock -lrb- lcp -rrb- said firms listed in the ftse 100 stock index had a combined deficit last month of £ 96bn - the largest on record .
this compared with a £ 41bn deficit in mid-july 2008 and a surplus of £ 12bn in the same month of 2007 .
lcp warned that the growing deficit meant even more final salary pension schemes were likely to close .
last month the pension protection fund -lrb- ppf -rrb- calculated that all the the uk 's 7,400 defined benefit schemes had seen their collective deficit rise to £ 200.1bn by the end of may .
bbc business reporter brian milligan said the main reason for the fall in value of pension scheme assets was a drop in share prices .
he added that just as markets had begun to recover , bond yields had collapsed , making pensions more expensive to fund .
' uncertain future ' lcp 's accounting for pensions report said the fallout from the collapse of wall street giant lehman brothers in september 2008 had hit pension scheme assets particularly hard .
only one of the top 100 companies - bp - still offers a final salary pension scheme to new members , the report said , adding that more closures of final salary schemes were expected .
bp has recently announced its intention to close its scheme to new recruits .
the report also said the ftse 100 share index would need to rise from its current level of just over 4,600 to more than 7,000 to wipe out the deficits entirely .
bob scott , partner at lcp , said that because the outlook for the economy and financial markets remained unclear , pension scheme finances would face more uncertainty .
he added : " those companies which work with their pension scheme trustees to identify and reduce pensions risk will be better placed to weather any future financial storms than those which fail to act . "
barclays and supermarket group morrisons are among those companies that have recently closed their final salary pension schemes .

consultants lane clark & peacock -lrb- lcp -rrb- said firms listed in the ftse 100 stock index had a combined deficit last month of £ 96bn - the largest on record .
this compared with a £ 41bn deficit in mid-july 2008 and a surplus of £ 12bn in the same month of 2007 .
lcp warned that the growing deficit meant even more final salary pension schemes were likely to close .
last month the pension protection fund -lrb- ppf -rrb- calculated that all the the uk 's 7,400 defined benefit schemes had seen their collective deficit rise to £ 200.1bn by the end of may .
bbc business reporter brian milligan said the main reason for the fall in value of pension scheme assets was a drop in share prices .
he added that just as markets had begun to recover , bond yields had collapsed , making pensions more expensive to fund .
' uncertain future ' lcp 's accounting for pensions report said the fallout from the collapse of wall street giant lehman brothers in september 2008 had hit pension scheme assets particularly hard .
only one of the top 100 companies - bp - still offers a final salary pension scheme to new members , the report said , adding that more closures of final salary schemes were expected .
bp has recently announced its intention to close its scheme to new recruits .
the report also said the ftse 100 share index would need to rise from its current level of just over 4,600 to more than 7,000 to wipe out the deficits entirely .
bob scott , partner at lcp , said that because the outlook for the economy and financial markets remained unclear , pension scheme finances would face more uncertainty .
he added : " those companies which work with their pension scheme trustees to identify and reduce pensions risk will be better placed to weather any future financial storms than those which fail to act . "
barclays and supermarket group morrisons are among those companies that have recently closed their final salary pension schemes .

the independent ministerial advisory group on transport wants the assembly government to begin an urgent review , arguing it is becoming unaffordable .
instead , the group suggests a more targeted approach for certain areas or social groups to save £ 25m a year .
but ministers say there are " no plans whatsoever " to scrap the scheme and they wanted to reassure the public .
one pensioners ' group said ending free bus travel for all older people would " not be justifiable " and would place a " considerable burden " on their incomes .
free bus travel for 600,000 elderly and disabled people in wales was introduced in 2002 under a scheme which was priced at the time at £ 17.7m.
karen morris and joan evans , both 63 and from newport , have had free bus passes for three years mrs evans : i use my bus pass every day , whether it 's going shopping in cardiff or just popping back and forth around newport where i live visiting family and friends .
i even go to cribbs causeway in bristol .
it 's great .
i do n't drive so it really gives me freedom .
today we 've just met with some friends .
one came from caerphilly and the other from swansea and we all used our free bus passes .
we meet every month in cardiff for lunch .
that would have to stop if they took away our free passes .
to be honest , the best thing about turning 60 is getting your bus pass .
it 's the only thing we get for nothing !
most of the people we mix with use them all the time .
i think a lot of people would be quite sad if they stopped mrs morris : i use the bus all the time .
i can drive but with the cost of petrol these days it can get quite expensive .
plus you ca n't drive into newport or cardiff because it 's so expensive to park in the car parks .
my dad , who 's 87 , goes all over the place with his pass , going on day trips .
they 've spent a couple of days in mid wales before using it .
it 's good because it gives elderly people a bit of freedom i think it would be a really bad move to stop the passes .
you work hard all your life and you finally get something for free and then it gets taken away .
if you 're elderly and on a pension , it could make a difference as a lot of people do n't have money to spare .
the advisory group estimate that today , as an example , about £ 25m a year could be saved by restricting free travel on local buses to pensioners with below average incomes .
it said : " the current approach to subsidising public transport -lrb- at a cost of some £ 230m in 2008-09 -rrb- is rapidly becoming unaffordable .
" there is an urgent need for a review to consider how to target the subsidies in the most efficient and effective way ...
" it should also examine whether there is scope to bring public transport fares more into line with market rates and then target support on particular social groups , perhaps using new technology . "
the advisory group acknowledged policies such as concessionary fares had proved popular and were securing " beneficial social outcomes " .
it also agreed there had been important spin-off benefits for the transport network , for example by sustaining marginal bus services which would otherwise have been withdrawn .
but the advisers said these policies were expensive and they concluded that " with limited resources , the current approach is rapidly becoming unaffordable . "
national old age pensioners association of wales assistant secretary emlyn lloyd warned older people currently benefitting from free bus passes would be " very very concerned " by suggestions they should be scrapped .
he said : " they do recognise the fact that it has been of tremendous use to them in being able to travel , meet people , do their shopping .
we would like to reassure these people that there will be no change to the scheme welsh assembly government statement " if it was to be removed then there is no doubt that the cost of present day transport would be a considerable burden on -lrb- their income -rrb- . "
mr lloyd added that , far from removing the bus passes , ministers should seek to go much further in extending ' free ' services to older people .
he said : " the provision of bus passes is seen by many of our european members as an essential element in improving the welfare and mobility of elderly people .
value for money " in the case of cyprus it even goes further , where they give not only a bus pass but also a social card which allows access for elderly people to concerts and other venues . "

the independent ministerial advisory group on transport wants the assembly government to begin an urgent review , arguing it is becoming unaffordable .
instead , the group suggests a more targeted approach for certain areas or social groups to save £ 25m a year .
but ministers say there are " no plans whatsoever " to scrap the scheme and they wanted to reassure the public .
one pensioners ' group said ending free bus travel for all older people would " not be justifiable " and would place a " considerable burden " on their incomes .
free bus travel for 600,000 elderly and disabled people in wales was introduced in 2002 under a scheme which was priced at the time at £ 17.7m.
karen morris and joan evans , both 63 and from newport , have had free bus passes for three years mrs evans : i use my bus pass every day , whether it 's going shopping in cardiff or just popping back and forth around newport where i live visiting family and friends .
i even go to cribbs causeway in bristol .
it 's great .
i do n't drive so it really gives me freedom .
today we 've just met with some friends .
one came from caerphilly and the other from swansea and we all used our free bus passes .
we meet every month in cardiff for lunch .
that would have to stop if they took away our free passes .
to be honest , the best thing about turning 60 is getting your bus pass .
it 's the only thing we get for nothing !
most of the people we mix with use them all the time .
i think a lot of people would be quite sad if they stopped mrs morris : i use the bus all the time .
i can drive but with the cost of petrol these days it can get quite expensive .
plus you ca n't drive into newport or cardiff because it 's so expensive to park in the car parks .
my dad , who 's 87 , goes all over the place with his pass , going on day trips .
they 've spent a couple of days in mid wales before using it .
it 's good because it gives elderly people a bit of freedom i think it would be a really bad move to stop the passes .
you work hard all your life and you finally get something for free and then it gets taken away .
if you 're elderly and on a pension , it could make a difference as a lot of people do n't have money to spare .
the advisory group estimate that today , as an example , about £ 25m a year could be saved by restricting free travel on local buses to pensioners with below average incomes .
it said : " the current approach to subsidising public transport -lrb- at a cost of some £ 230m in 2008-09 -rrb- is rapidly becoming unaffordable .
" there is an urgent need for a review to consider how to target the subsidies in the most efficient and effective way ...
" it should also examine whether there is scope to bring public transport fares more into line with market rates and then target support on particular social groups , perhaps using new technology . "
the advisory group acknowledged policies such as concessionary fares had proved popular and were securing " beneficial social outcomes " .
it also agreed there had been important spin-off benefits for the transport network , for example by sustaining marginal bus services which would otherwise have been withdrawn .
but the advisers said these policies were expensive and they concluded that " with limited resources , the current approach is rapidly becoming unaffordable . "
national old age pensioners association of wales assistant secretary emlyn lloyd warned older people currently benefitting from free bus passes would be " very very concerned " by suggestions they should be scrapped .
he said : " they do recognise the fact that it has been of tremendous use to them in being able to travel , meet people , do their shopping .
we would like to reassure these people that there will be no change to the scheme welsh assembly government statement " if it was to be removed then there is no doubt that the cost of present day transport would be a considerable burden on -lrb- their income -rrb- . "
mr lloyd added that , far from removing the bus passes , ministers should seek to go much further in extending ' free ' services to older people .
he said : " the provision of bus passes is seen by many of our european members as an essential element in improving the welfare and mobility of elderly people .
value for money " in the case of cyprus it even goes further , where they give not only a bus pass but also a social card which allows access for elderly people to concerts and other venues . "
mr lloyd said removing the passes would not be justifiable and that pensioners would find such a change " quite onerous " given that state pensions here " are well below many of the european averages . "

the advisory group estimate that today , as an example , about £ 25m a year could be saved by restricting free travel on local buses to pensioners with below average incomes .
it said : " the current approach to subsidising public transport -lrb- at a cost of some £ 230m in 2008-09 -rrb- is rapidly becoming unaffordable .
" there is an urgent need for a review to consider how to target the subsidies in the most efficient and effective way ...
" it should also examine whether there is scope to bring public transport fares more into line with market rates and then target support on particular social groups , perhaps using new technology . "
the advisory group acknowledged policies such as concessionary fares had proved popular and were securing " beneficial social outcomes " .
it also agreed there had been important spin-off benefits for the transport network , for example by sustaining marginal bus services which would otherwise have been withdrawn .
but the advisers said these policies were expensive and they concluded that " with limited resources , the current approach is rapidly becoming unaffordable . "
national old age pensioners association of wales assistant secretary emlyn lloyd warned older people currently benefitting from free bus passes would be " very very concerned " by suggestions they should be scrapped .
he said : " they do recognise the fact that it has been of tremendous use to them in being able to travel , meet people , do their shopping .
we would like to reassure these people that there will be no change to the scheme welsh assembly government statement " if it was to be removed then there is no doubt that the cost of present day transport would be a considerable burden on -lrb- their income -rrb- . "
mr lloyd added that , far from removing the bus passes , ministers should seek to go much further in extending ' free ' services to older people .
he said : " the provision of bus passes is seen by many of our european members as an essential element in improving the welfare and mobility of elderly people .
value for money " in the case of cyprus it even goes further , where they give not only a bus pass but also a social card which allows access for elderly people to concerts and other venues . "
mr lloyd said removing the passes would not be justifiable and that pensioners would find such a change " quite onerous " given that state pensions here " are well below many of the european averages . "
in a statement , an assembly government spokesman said ministers " had made it absolutely clear that we have no plans whatsoever to scrap the highly successful and popular concessionary travel scheme " .
" neither are there any plans to change the entitlement or eligibility criteria for the half a million people in wales who currently benefit from the scheme , " he added .
" we would like to reassure these people that there will be no change to the scheme - we are simply running an audit of the reimbursement mechanism between the assembly government , local authorities and bus operators . "
conservative transport spokesman david melding am said : " we 've been advising the assembly government for some time to review this scheme .
" the best way of making public transport spending more efficient would be to make the pensioner bus travel scheme apply at off peak times only .
the danger of the current policy is that it is eating up far too much of the transport budget and not allowing us to develop other public transport networks . "
