program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 01.05.2009 experts call eu expansion historic success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebration in prague five years ago on may 1 , 2004 , europe celebrated the enlargement of the eu .
five years later , many europeans do n't feel much like commemorating the historic occasion , even though there are still plenty of reasons to celebrate . the economic data are convincing .
according to figures just released by the german statistical bureau -lrb- destatis -rrb- , the economic output of the ten new member states has grown drastically since they joined the eu five years ago .
the inflation-adjusted gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- of the new members increased by 23 percent until 2008 when compared to 2004 , the year they entered the eu .
slovakia , whose gdp grew by 36 percent topped the list , followed by lithuania and latvia whose output rose by more than 30 percent respectively .
even hungary 's economy , which experienced the weakest increase of all new member states with only ten percent , grew significantly faster than the economies of the 15 older member states which registered eight percent .
the strong economic performance by the new members is not the sole consequence of eu membership .
most eastern european countries had begun to drastically reform and remodel their economies after the collapse of the berlin wall and had recorded strong gdp growth long before joining the eu .
so while eu membership was n't the decisive factor , becoming part of the large european market was a definite boost for the new members .
it not only enabled the new countries to sell their products across europe without any hurdles .
it also forced them to adapt their production and quality standards to compete on the international market .
obviously , the global economic meltdown has n't spared the new member states .
growth rates have slowed in many countries ; some states , such as hungary , face severe difficulties .
still , when judged by economic standards , the eu expansion is a success .
downbeat perception of enlargement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : symbol of the past : border post between germany and poland then why do the feelings of many europeans towards the expansion range somewhere between lukewarm and negative ?
in the latest eurobarometer poll , a regular europe-wide survey measuring public opinion toward the eu , less than half -lrb- 48 percent -rrb- of the participants felt that the expansion made the eu stronger .
36 percent believe that the expansion weakened the bloc .
in some countries , among them germany and france , a majority of those polled holds the view that enlargement weakened the eu .
" i am quite puzzled by these polls , " admits petr drulak , director of the institute of international relations in prague , " but i think it reflects a general feeling about the eu as a whole .
many people are simply tired of the eu and do n't like any news that comes out of brussels , even if there are no objective and tangible reasons for it . "
drulak argues that the most dominant fear of eu enlargement in germany and other countries simply did n't materialize .
" the flooding of the german labor market with eastern european workers never happened because germany protected its labor market . "
and even a country with an unprotected labor market such as britain , says drulak , managed to integrate the workers from eastern europe quite well until the global economic meltdown started to take effect . jonas cicinskas , head of the european studies department at vilnius university in lithuania , blames the deteriorating economic situation for the negative public opinion toward enlargement .
cicinskas believes that the global economic crisis currently overshadows everything and negatively influences how people judge the eu and enlargement .
" many people in the traditional eu donor countries understandably are not in favor of paying money for poorer countries and supporting sectors such as agriculture . "
proof that eu is a viable project despite the trend towards eu scepticism both drulak and cicinskas consider the enlargement of the eu a tremendous achievement .
" i think it is one of the great successes of the european union , " says drulak .
" if i had to give a grade i would give it not just a ' very good , ' but an ' excellent . '
it proved that the eu can absorb many new members and remain a viable project . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factory in budapest producing eu flags the experts also agree that the division between old and new members becomes increasingly irrelevant .
drulak contends that there is not a single political issue where the alleged old europe-new europe divide is still in place today .
" even on russia , this dividing line does n't work anymore , " he says .
" while poland and the baltic states , with some support by the scandinavian countries , are tough on russia , hungary and slovakia tend more towards the more lenient german position on russia . " and cicinskas points out that , economically , the differences between the new countries are growing as well .
he predicts that in the future , sub-regional factors will play a more important role than when a country joined the eu .
eu should remain open for new members as for the never-ending debate about further enlargement , drulak and cicinskas , not surprisingly , are clearly in favor of other nations joining the eu .
" ideally , every european country should be a member of the eu , " says cicinskas .
" but we need to calculate more carefully if we can afford new members financially and we have to reconsider the current regional and structural funds of the eu . "
on a global scale , the eu is still a small player when compared to the us or future powers , such as china and india , argues drulak .
" its openness for new members will make it stronger in the long term .
if a country has the commitment to get through the very difficult and long accession process , then it should be able to become a member of the eu . "

" based on the medical information before the court ... the court can not find that the petitioner 's removal to germany is likely to cause irreparable harm sufficient to warrant a stay of removal , " the judges ruled .
" his motion for a stay of removal pending review is denied . " the decision overturns an 11th-hour reprieve granted to demjanjuk on april 14 , when a federal appeals court gave the suspect a temporary stay of deportation shortly after immigration officials carried him out of his home in a wheelchair to be taken to a waiting flight . the new decision can , however , be appealed .
spiegel online reports that demjanjuk 's lawyer has already taken legal action against the german government in a bid to prevent his deportation from the united states . german authorities first gave the green light for a munich-based court to issue an arrest warrant for demjanjuk on march 11 . however , his lawyer argues that german officials neglected to file an application for demjanjuk 's extradition and also failed to check whether he was fit enough to travel or stand trial . demjanjuk 's lawyer maintains that his client is too ill to travel , despite a video filed by prosecutors last week which showed the alleged nazi guard walking and talking animatedly . his lawyer said demjanjuk may be able to walk a few steps unassisted , but that medical evidence showed that arrest , incarceration and a possible trial would cause severe pain . the us justice department accuses demjanjuk of numerous delaying tactics , saying that reasons no longer existed for an emergency stay of deportation . demjanjuk is wanted in germany on charges of being an accessory to the deaths of at least 29,000 jews in concentration camps in nazi-occupied poland during world war ii .

now the suspect 's lawyer is pressing charges against the german govenment . the lawyer of the alleged nazi camp guard john demjanjuk has taken legal action against the german government in a bid to prevent the 89-year old 's deportation from the united states , according to spiegel online .
german authorities gave the green light for a munich-based court to issue an arrest warrant for demjanjuk on march 11 .
however , his lawyer argues that german authorities neglected to file an application for demjanjuk 's extradition and also failed to check whether he was fit enough to travel or stand trial .
demjanjuk 's lawyer maintains that his client is too ill to travel , despite a video filed by prosecutors last week which showed the alleged nazi guard walking and talking animatedly .
his lawyer said demjanjuk may be able to walk a few steps unassisted , but that medical evidence showed that arrest , incarceration and a possible trial would cause severe pain .
the us justice department accuses demjanjuk of numerous delaying tactics saying that reasons no longer existed for an emergency stay of deportation .
demjanjuk got an 11th-hour reprieve on april 14 when a federal appeals court in ohio granted the 89-year old 's request for a stay of deportation shortly after he had been carried in a wheelchair out of his home to be taken to a waiting flight .
demjanjuk is wanted in germany on charges of aiding the deaths of at least 29,000 jews in concentration camps in nazi-occupied poland during world war ii .

now the suspect 's lawyer is pressing charges against the german govenment . the lawyer of the alleged nazi camp guard john demjanjuk has taken legal action against the german government in a bid to prevent the 89-year old 's deportation from the united states , according to spiegel online .
german authorities gave the green light for a munich-based court to issue an arrest warrant for demjanjuk on march 11 .
however , his lawyer argues that german authorities neglected to file an application for demjanjuk 's extradition and also failed to check whether he was fit enough to travel or stand trial .
demjanjuk 's lawyer maintains that his client is too ill to travel , despite a video filed by prosecutors last week which showed the alleged nazi guard walking and talking animatedly .
his lawyer said demjanjuk may be able to walk a few steps unassisted , but that medical evidence showed that arrest , incarceration and a possible trial would cause severe pain .
the us justice department accuses demjanjuk of numerous delaying tactics saying that reasons no longer existed for an emergency stay of deportation .
demjanjuk got an 11th-hour reprieve on april 14 when a federal appeals court in ohio granted the 89-year old 's request for a stay of deportation shortly after he had been carried in a wheelchair out of his home to be taken to a waiting flight .

hamburg 's coach says their position is good for the second leg , but bremen is not giving up . hamburg went into the match in bremen 's weser-stadium determined to make up for last week 's disappointment in the german cup semi-final , when bremen beat hamburg on penalties .
and the determination paid off , when , in the 28th minute , hamburg midfielder piotr trochowski headed a guy demel cross into the back of the net – the ball sailing over the outstretched arms of goalkeeper tim wiese .
" even though i am not very tall , i went up wanting to put the ball into the back of the net , " trochowski said afterwards .
hamburg coach martin jol said his team did well in the first half , and said they 're in a good position going into the second leg of the semi-finals .

hamburg only has to avoid defeat in next week 's second leg to qualify for the may 20 uefa cup final in istanbul .
bremen still optimistic bremen were certainly more aggressive after half time but – as midfielder torsten frings later lamented – the side just could n't come home with the goods .
" we conceded a stupid goal after a mistake and then failed to make the most of our many chances , " frings said , " but everything is still open for the return leg and nothing is lost . " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 01.05.2009 experts call eu expansion historic success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebration in prague five years ago on may 1 , 2004 , europe celebrated the enlargement of the eu .
five years later , many europeans do n't feel much like commemorating the historic occasion , even though there are still plenty of reasons to celebrate . the economic data are convincing .
according to figures just released by the german statistical bureau -lrb- destatis -rrb- , the economic output of the ten new member states has grown drastically since they joined the eu five years ago .
the inflation-adjusted gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- of the new members increased by 23 percent until 2008 when compared to 2004 , the year they entered the eu .
slovakia , whose gdp grew by 36 percent topped the list , followed by lithuania and latvia whose output rose by more than 30 percent respectively .
even hungary 's economy , which experienced the weakest increase of all new member states with only ten percent , grew significantly faster than the economies of the 15 older member states which registered eight percent .
the strong economic performance by the new members is not the sole consequence of eu membership .
most eastern european countries had begun to drastically reform and remodel their economies after the collapse of the berlin wall and had recorded strong gdp growth long before joining the eu .
so while eu membership was n't the decisive factor , becoming part of the large european market was a definite boost for the new members .
it not only enabled the new countries to sell their products across europe without any hurdles .
it also forced them to adapt their production and quality standards to compete on the international market .
obviously , the global economic meltdown has n't spared the new member states .
growth rates have slowed in many countries ; some states , such as hungary , face severe difficulties .
still , when judged by economic standards , the eu expansion is a success .
downbeat perception of enlargement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : symbol of the past : border post between germany and poland then why do the feelings of many europeans towards the expansion range somewhere between lukewarm and negative ?
in the latest eurobarometer poll , a regular europe-wide survey measuring public opinion toward the eu , less than half -lrb- 48 percent -rrb- of the participants felt that the expansion made the eu stronger .
36 percent believe that the expansion weakened the bloc .
in some countries , among them germany and france , a majority of those polled holds the view that enlargement weakened the eu .
" i am quite puzzled by these polls , " admits petr drulak , director of the institute of international relations in prague , " but i think it reflects a general feeling about the eu as a whole .
many people are simply tired of the eu and do n't like any news that comes out of brussels , even if there are no objective and tangible reasons for it . "
drulak argues that the most dominant fear of eu enlargement in germany and other countries simply did n't materialize .
" the flooding of the german labor market with eastern european workers never happened because germany protected its labor market . "
and even a country with an unprotected labor market such as britain , says drulak , managed to integrate the workers from eastern europe quite well until the global economic meltdown started to take effect . jonas cicinskas , head of the european studies department at vilnius university in lithuania , blames the deteriorating economic situation for the negative public opinion toward enlargement .
cicinskas believes that the global economic crisis currently overshadows everything and negatively influences how people judge the eu and enlargement .
" many people in the traditional eu donor countries understandably are not in favor of paying money for poorer countries and supporting sectors such as agriculture . "
proof that eu is a viable project despite the trend towards eu scepticism both drulak and cicinskas consider the enlargement of the eu a tremendous achievement .
" i think it is one of the great successes of the european union , " says drulak .
" if i had to give a grade i would give it not just a ' very good , ' but an ' excellent . '
it proved that the eu can absorb many new members and remain a viable project . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factory in budapest producing eu flags the experts also agree that the division between old and new members becomes increasingly irrelevant .
drulak contends that there is not a single political issue where the alleged old europe-new europe divide is still in place today .
" even on russia , this dividing line does n't work anymore , " he says .
" while poland and the baltic states , with some support by the scandinavian countries , are tough on russia , hungary and slovakia tend more towards the more lenient german position on russia . " and cicinskas points out that , economically , the differences between the new countries are growing as well .
he predicts that in the future , sub-regional factors will play a more important role than when a country joined the eu .
eu should remain open for new members as for the never-ending debate about further enlargement , drulak and cicinskas , not surprisingly , are clearly in favor of other nations joining the eu .
" ideally , every european country should be a member of the eu , " says cicinskas .
" but we need to calculate more carefully if we can afford new members financially and we have to reconsider the current regional and structural funds of the eu . "
on a global scale , the eu is still a small player when compared to the us or future powers , such as china and india , argues drulak .
" its openness for new members will make it stronger in the long term .
if a country has the commitment to get through the very difficult and long accession process , then it should be able to become a member of the eu . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 01.05.2009 germany reports first case of swine flu transmission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts fear the h1n1 virus could mutate into a more lethal strain the swine flu crisis is taken to a new level as german authorities confirm the first transmission of the h1n1 virus within germany . german authorities said on friday that a nurse who has not been in mexico but who has treated a patient with swine flu , had contracted the virus but had since recovered .
it is is the first time that the h1n1 virus has been contracted within germany , the bavarian health ministry said in a statement .
the other three confirmed infections in germany are in people who had recently been to mexico , the suspected epicenter of the disease .
eu rejects travel ban to mexico at an emergency meeting in luxembourg on thursday , eu health ministers rejected a french proposal to suspend all air travel to mexico .
" in the current state of the situation , we are not yet taking this decision , " french health minister roselyne bachelot said , adding that the plan may be revisited in the future .
previously other countries such as germany and spain had balked at the flight ban proposal , considering it too drastic and having little value , considering the outbreak had already spread to four continents .
european ministers also shot down an italian proposal that member states should set up a " drug bank " of flu remedies and vaccines , saying that it was up to each member state to decide how best to deal with health problems .
" i am very much in favor of the suggestion that every member state is responsible for having a sufficient supply of drugs , " germany 's health minister ulla schmidt said as she arrived at the meeting .
the question of whether eu member states should share information on their drugs supplies has long been a divisive one , setting eu member states at loggerheads during earlier scares over bird flu and severe acute respiratory syndrome -lrb- sars -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's ulla schmidt -lrb- right -rrb- did not see eye to eye with france 's roselyne bachelot on the issue of travel bans do n't panic the hastily arranged meeting in luxembourg came as a growing number of european countries announced swine flu infections .
dutch officials said a three-year-old child had become the first confirmed case in the netherlands , while irish authorities said they were investigating one likely infection in a young man who recently returned from mexico .
swine flu cases are also being treated in germany , austria , britain and spain .
the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- said that , while it was clear the disease was spreading , it saw no evidence to suggest it should raise its pandemic alert to the highest level .
the who 's six-stage flu alert is currently set at level five .
eu health commissioner androulla vassiliou warned against panicking over the spread of the potentially deadly virus .
" we have to be careful , we have to exercise vigilance , we should not panic , we have to be prepared , " vassiliou said hours after the world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- warned a pandemic was imminent .
her spokeswoman stressed that " we do not have any casualties at the eu level yet " and that all cases so far in europe were " mildly affected and recovering . "
she warned against drawing parallels with the situation in mexico because the state of preparedness was much higher in europe .
vaccine development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fukuda says the who does not need to raise its pandemic alert level " on wednesday , eu health commissioner vassiliou hosted representatives from a number of european pharmaceutical companies in brussels , calling on them to develop a vaccine against the new form of swine flu as fast as possible .
it 's something that we have to coordinate with member states , because the industry has to receive some directions from member states on what they want , " she said as she arrived in luxembourg .
asked how long it could take to develop such a vaccine , she said that it would " most probably take several months . "
diplomats said eu health ministers also debated whether they could speed up their national drug-registration programs in order to approve a vaccine faster , once one is developed .
who flu chief keiji fukuda told reporters that swiss pharmaceuticals giant roche has indicated it was stepping up production of its antiviral tamiflu to deal with the infection .
known generically as oseltamivir , the drug has proven effective against the new strain .
fukuda said the united nations agency has already released some of its own tamiflu stockpiles to the developing countries deemed most in need , including mexico .

it is is the first time that the h1n1 virus has been contracted within germany , the bavarian health ministry said in a statement .
the other three confirmed infections in germany are in people who had recently been to mexico , the suspected epicenter of the disease .
eu rejects travel ban to mexico at an emergency meeting in luxembourg on thursday , eu health ministers rejected a french proposal to suspend all air travel to mexico .
" in the current state of the situation , we are not yet taking this decision , " french health minister roselyne bachelot said , adding that the plan may be revisited in the future .
previously other countries such as germany and spain had balked at the flight ban proposal , considering it too drastic and having little value , considering the outbreak had already spread to four continents .
european ministers also shot down an italian proposal that member states should set up a " drug bank " of flu remedies and vaccines , saying that it was up to each member state to decide how best to deal with health problems .
" i am very much in favor of the suggestion that every member state is responsible for having a sufficient supply of drugs , " germany 's health minister ulla schmidt said as she arrived at the meeting .
the question of whether eu member states should share information on their drugs supplies has long been a divisive one , setting eu member states at loggerheads during earlier scares over bird flu and severe acute respiratory syndrome -lrb- sars -rrb- .

dutch officials said a three-year-old child had become the first confirmed case in the netherlands , while irish authorities said they were investigating one likely infection in a young man who recently returned from mexico .
swine flu cases are also being treated in germany , austria , britain and spain .
the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- said that , while it was clear the disease was spreading , it saw no evidence to suggest it should raise its pandemic alert to the highest level .
the who 's six-stage flu alert is currently set at level five .
eu health commissioner androulla vassiliou warned against panicking over the spread of the potentially deadly virus .
" we have to be careful , we have to exercise vigilance , we should not panic , we have to be prepared , " vassiliou said hours after the world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- warned a pandemic was imminent .
her spokeswoman stressed that " we do not have any casualties at the eu level yet " and that all cases so far in europe were " mildly affected and recovering . "
she warned against drawing parallels with the situation in mexico because the state of preparedness was much higher in europe .
vaccine development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fukuda says the who does not need to raise its pandemic alert level " on wednesday , eu health commissioner vassiliou hosted representatives from a number of european pharmaceutical companies in brussels , calling on them to develop a vaccine against the new form of swine flu as fast as possible .
it 's something that we have to coordinate with member states , because the industry has to receive some directions from member states on what they want , " she said as she arrived in luxembourg .
asked how long it could take to develop such a vaccine , she said that it would " most probably take several months . "
diplomats said eu health ministers also debated whether they could speed up their national drug-registration programs in order to approve a vaccine faster , once one is developed .
who flu chief keiji fukuda told reporters that swiss pharmaceuticals giant roche has indicated it was stepping up production of its antiviral tamiflu to deal with the infection .
known generically as oseltamivir , the drug has proven effective against the new strain .

it is is the first time that the h1n1 virus has been contracted within germany , the bavarian health ministry said in a statement .
the other three confirmed infections in germany are in people who had recently been to mexico , the suspected epicenter of the disease .
eu rejects travel ban to mexico at an emergency meeting in luxembourg on thursday , eu health ministers rejected a french proposal to suspend all air travel to mexico .
" in the current state of the situation , we are not yet taking this decision , " french health minister roselyne bachelot said , adding that the plan may be revisited in the future .
previously other countries such as germany and spain had balked at the flight ban proposal , considering it too drastic and having little value , considering the outbreak had already spread to four continents .
european ministers also shot down an italian proposal that member states should set up a " drug bank " of flu remedies and vaccines , saying that it was up to each member state to decide how best to deal with health problems .
" i am very much in favor of the suggestion that every member state is responsible for having a sufficient supply of drugs , " germany 's health minister ulla schmidt said as she arrived at the meeting .
the question of whether eu member states should share information on their drugs supplies has long been a divisive one , setting eu member states at loggerheads during earlier scares over bird flu and severe acute respiratory syndrome -lrb- sars -rrb- .

her spokeswoman stressed that " we do not have any casualties at the eu level yet " and that all cases so far in europe were " mildly affected and recovering . "
she warned against drawing parallels with the situation in mexico because the state of preparedness was much higher in europe .

it 's something that we have to coordinate with member states , because the industry has to receive some directions from member states on what they want , " she said as she arrived in luxembourg .
asked how long it could take to develop such a vaccine , she said that it would " most probably take several months . "
diplomats said eu health ministers also debated whether they could speed up their national drug-registration programs in order to approve a vaccine faster , once one is developed .

five years later , many europeans do n't feel much like commemorating the historic occasion , even though there are still plenty of reasons to celebrate . the economic data are convincing .
according to figures just released by the german statistical bureau -lrb- destatis -rrb- , the economic output of the ten new member states has grown drastically since they joined the eu five years ago .
the inflation-adjusted gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- of the new members increased by 23 percent until 2008 when compared to 2004 , the year they entered the eu .
slovakia , whose gdp grew by 36 percent topped the list , followed by lithuania and latvia whose output rose by more than 30 percent respectively .
even hungary 's economy , which experienced the weakest increase of all new member states with only ten percent , grew significantly faster than the economies of the 15 older member states which registered eight percent .
the strong economic performance by the new members is not the sole consequence of eu membership .
most eastern european countries had begun to drastically reform and remodel their economies after the collapse of the berlin wall and had recorded strong gdp growth long before joining the eu .
so while eu membership was n't the decisive factor , becoming part of the large european market was a definite boost for the new members .
it not only enabled the new countries to sell their products across europe without any hurdles .
it also forced them to adapt their production and quality standards to compete on the international market .
obviously , the global economic meltdown has n't spared the new member states .
growth rates have slowed in many countries ; some states , such as hungary , face severe difficulties .
still , when judged by economic standards , the eu expansion is a success .
downbeat perception of enlargement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : symbol of the past : border post between germany and poland then why do the feelings of many europeans towards the expansion range somewhere between lukewarm and negative ?
in the latest eurobarometer poll , a regular europe-wide survey measuring public opinion toward the eu , less than half -lrb- 48 percent -rrb- of the participants felt that the expansion made the eu stronger .
36 percent believe that the expansion weakened the bloc .
in some countries , among them germany and france , a majority of those polled holds the view that enlargement weakened the eu .
" i am quite puzzled by these polls , " admits petr drulak , director of the institute of international relations in prague , " but i think it reflects a general feeling about the eu as a whole .
many people are simply tired of the eu and do n't like any news that comes out of brussels , even if there are no objective and tangible reasons for it . "
drulak argues that the most dominant fear of eu enlargement in germany and other countries simply did n't materialize .
" the flooding of the german labor market with eastern european workers never happened because germany protected its labor market . "
and even a country with an unprotected labor market such as britain , says drulak , managed to integrate the workers from eastern europe quite well until the global economic meltdown started to take effect . jonas cicinskas , head of the european studies department at vilnius university in lithuania , blames the deteriorating economic situation for the negative public opinion toward enlargement .
cicinskas believes that the global economic crisis currently overshadows everything and negatively influences how people judge the eu and enlargement .
" many people in the traditional eu donor countries understandably are not in favor of paying money for poorer countries and supporting sectors such as agriculture . "
proof that eu is a viable project despite the trend towards eu scepticism both drulak and cicinskas consider the enlargement of the eu a tremendous achievement .
" i think it is one of the great successes of the european union , " says drulak .
" if i had to give a grade i would give it not just a ' very good , ' but an ' excellent . '
it proved that the eu can absorb many new members and remain a viable project . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factory in budapest producing eu flags the experts also agree that the division between old and new members becomes increasingly irrelevant .
drulak contends that there is not a single political issue where the alleged old europe-new europe divide is still in place today .
" even on russia , this dividing line does n't work anymore , " he says .
" while poland and the baltic states , with some support by the scandinavian countries , are tough on russia , hungary and slovakia tend more towards the more lenient german position on russia . " and cicinskas points out that , economically , the differences between the new countries are growing as well .
he predicts that in the future , sub-regional factors will play a more important role than when a country joined the eu .
eu should remain open for new members as for the never-ending debate about further enlargement , drulak and cicinskas , not surprisingly , are clearly in favor of other nations joining the eu .
" ideally , every european country should be a member of the eu , " says cicinskas .
" but we need to calculate more carefully if we can afford new members financially and we have to reconsider the current regional and structural funds of the eu . "
on a global scale , the eu is still a small player when compared to the us or future powers , such as china and india , argues drulak .
" its openness for new members will make it stronger in the long term .
if a country has the commitment to get through the very difficult and long accession process , then it should be able to become a member of the eu . "

five years later , many europeans do n't feel much like commemorating the historic occasion , even though there are still plenty of reasons to celebrate . the economic data are convincing .
according to figures just released by the german statistical bureau -lrb- destatis -rrb- , the economic output of the ten new member states has grown drastically since they joined the eu five years ago .
the inflation-adjusted gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- of the new members increased by 23 percent until 2008 when compared to 2004 , the year they entered the eu .
slovakia , whose gdp grew by 36 percent topped the list , followed by lithuania and latvia whose output rose by more than 30 percent respectively .
even hungary 's economy , which experienced the weakest increase of all new member states with only ten percent , grew significantly faster than the economies of the 15 older member states which registered eight percent .
the strong economic performance by the new members is not the sole consequence of eu membership .
most eastern european countries had begun to drastically reform and remodel their economies after the collapse of the berlin wall and had recorded strong gdp growth long before joining the eu .
so while eu membership was n't the decisive factor , becoming part of the large european market was a definite boost for the new members .
it not only enabled the new countries to sell their products across europe without any hurdles .
it also forced them to adapt their production and quality standards to compete on the international market .
obviously , the global economic meltdown has n't spared the new member states .
growth rates have slowed in many countries ; some states , such as hungary , face severe difficulties .
still , when judged by economic standards , the eu expansion is a success .
downbeat perception of enlargement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : symbol of the past : border post between germany and poland then why do the feelings of many europeans towards the expansion range somewhere between lukewarm and negative ?
in the latest eurobarometer poll , a regular europe-wide survey measuring public opinion toward the eu , less than half -lrb- 48 percent -rrb- of the participants felt that the expansion made the eu stronger .

drulak argues that the most dominant fear of eu enlargement in germany and other countries simply did n't materialize .
" the flooding of the german labor market with eastern european workers never happened because germany protected its labor market . "
and even a country with an unprotected labor market such as britain , says drulak , managed to integrate the workers from eastern europe quite well until the global economic meltdown started to take effect . jonas cicinskas , head of the european studies department at vilnius university in lithuania , blames the deteriorating economic situation for the negative public opinion toward enlargement .
cicinskas believes that the global economic crisis currently overshadows everything and negatively influences how people judge the eu and enlargement .
" many people in the traditional eu donor countries understandably are not in favor of paying money for poorer countries and supporting sectors such as agriculture . "
proof that eu is a viable project despite the trend towards eu scepticism both drulak and cicinskas consider the enlargement of the eu a tremendous achievement .
" i think it is one of the great successes of the european union , " says drulak .
" if i had to give a grade i would give it not just a ' very good , ' but an ' excellent . '
it proved that the eu can absorb many new members and remain a viable project . "

" and cicinskas points out that , economically , the differences between the new countries are growing as well .
he predicts that in the future , sub-regional factors will play a more important role than when a country joined the eu .
eu should remain open for new members as for the never-ending debate about further enlargement , drulak and cicinskas , not surprisingly , are clearly in favor of other nations joining the eu .
" ideally , every european country should be a member of the eu , " says cicinskas .
" but we need to calculate more carefully if we can afford new members financially and we have to reconsider the current regional and structural funds of the eu . "
on a global scale , the eu is still a small player when compared to the us or future powers , such as china and india , argues drulak .

and even a country with an unprotected labor market such as britain , says drulak , managed to integrate the workers from eastern europe quite well until the global economic meltdown started to take effect . jonas cicinskas , head of the european studies department at vilnius university in lithuania , blames the deteriorating economic situation for the negative public opinion toward enlargement .
cicinskas believes that the global economic crisis currently overshadows everything and negatively influences how people judge the eu and enlargement .
" many people in the traditional eu donor countries understandably are not in favor of paying money for poorer countries and supporting sectors such as agriculture . "
proof that eu is a viable project despite the trend towards eu scepticism both drulak and cicinskas consider the enlargement of the eu a tremendous achievement .
" i think it is one of the great successes of the european union , " says drulak .
" if i had to give a grade i would give it not just a ' very good , ' but an ' excellent . '
it proved that the eu can absorb many new members and remain a viable project . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factory in budapest producing eu flags the experts also agree that the division between old and new members becomes increasingly irrelevant .
drulak contends that there is not a single political issue where the alleged old europe-new europe divide is still in place today .
" even on russia , this dividing line does n't work anymore , " he says .
" while poland and the baltic states , with some support by the scandinavian countries , are tough on russia , hungary and slovakia tend more towards the more lenient german position on russia . " and cicinskas points out that , economically , the differences between the new countries are growing as well .
he predicts that in the future , sub-regional factors will play a more important role than when a country joined the eu .
eu should remain open for new members as for the never-ending debate about further enlargement , drulak and cicinskas , not surprisingly , are clearly in favor of other nations joining the eu .
" ideally , every european country should be a member of the eu , " says cicinskas .
" but we need to calculate more carefully if we can afford new members financially and we have to reconsider the current regional and structural funds of the eu . "
on a global scale , the eu is still a small player when compared to the us or future powers , such as china and india , argues drulak .
" its openness for new members will make it stronger in the long term .
if a country has the commitment to get through the very difficult and long accession process , then it should be able to become a member of the eu . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 01.05.2009 experts call eu expansion historic success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebration in prague five years ago on may 1 , 2004 , europe celebrated the enlargement of the eu .
five years later , many europeans do n't feel much like commemorating the historic occasion , even though there are still plenty of reasons to celebrate . the economic data are convincing .
according to figures just released by the german statistical bureau -lrb- destatis -rrb- , the economic output of the ten new member states has grown drastically since they joined the eu five years ago .
the inflation-adjusted gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- of the new members increased by 23 percent until 2008 when compared to 2004 , the year they entered the eu .
slovakia , whose gdp grew by 36 percent topped the list , followed by lithuania and latvia whose output rose by more than 30 percent respectively .
even hungary 's economy , which experienced the weakest increase of all new member states with only ten percent , grew significantly faster than the economies of the 15 older member states which registered eight percent .
the strong economic performance by the new members is not the sole consequence of eu membership .
most eastern european countries had begun to drastically reform and remodel their economies after the collapse of the berlin wall and had recorded strong gdp growth long before joining the eu .
so while eu membership was n't the decisive factor , becoming part of the large european market was a definite boost for the new members .
it not only enabled the new countries to sell their products across europe without any hurdles .
it also forced them to adapt their production and quality standards to compete on the international market .
obviously , the global economic meltdown has n't spared the new member states .
growth rates have slowed in many countries ; some states , such as hungary , face severe difficulties .
still , when judged by economic standards , the eu expansion is a success .
downbeat perception of enlargement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : symbol of the past : border post between germany and poland then why do the feelings of many europeans towards the expansion range somewhere between lukewarm and negative ?
in the latest eurobarometer poll , a regular europe-wide survey measuring public opinion toward the eu , less than half -lrb- 48 percent -rrb- of the participants felt that the expansion made the eu stronger .
36 percent believe that the expansion weakened the bloc .
in some countries , among them germany and france , a majority of those polled holds the view that enlargement weakened the eu .
" i am quite puzzled by these polls , " admits petr drulak , director of the institute of international relations in prague , " but i think it reflects a general feeling about the eu as a whole .
many people are simply tired of the eu and do n't like any news that comes out of brussels , even if there are no objective and tangible reasons for it . "
drulak argues that the most dominant fear of eu enlargement in germany and other countries simply did n't materialize .
" the flooding of the german labor market with eastern european workers never happened because germany protected its labor market . "
and even a country with an unprotected labor market such as britain , says drulak , managed to integrate the workers from eastern europe quite well until the global economic meltdown started to take effect . jonas cicinskas , head of the european studies department at vilnius university in lithuania , blames the deteriorating economic situation for the negative public opinion toward enlargement .
cicinskas believes that the global economic crisis currently overshadows everything and negatively influences how people judge the eu and enlargement .
" many people in the traditional eu donor countries understandably are not in favor of paying money for poorer countries and supporting sectors such as agriculture . "
proof that eu is a viable project despite the trend towards eu scepticism both drulak and cicinskas consider the enlargement of the eu a tremendous achievement .
" i think it is one of the great successes of the european union , " says drulak .
" if i had to give a grade i would give it not just a ' very good , ' but an ' excellent . '
it proved that the eu can absorb many new members and remain a viable project . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factory in budapest producing eu flags the experts also agree that the division between old and new members becomes increasingly irrelevant .
drulak contends that there is not a single political issue where the alleged old europe-new europe divide is still in place today .
" even on russia , this dividing line does n't work anymore , " he says .
" while poland and the baltic states , with some support by the scandinavian countries , are tough on russia , hungary and slovakia tend more towards the more lenient german position on russia . " and cicinskas points out that , economically , the differences between the new countries are growing as well .
he predicts that in the future , sub-regional factors will play a more important role than when a country joined the eu .
eu should remain open for new members as for the never-ending debate about further enlargement , drulak and cicinskas , not surprisingly , are clearly in favor of other nations joining the eu .
" ideally , every european country should be a member of the eu , " says cicinskas .
" but we need to calculate more carefully if we can afford new members financially and we have to reconsider the current regional and structural funds of the eu . "
on a global scale , the eu is still a small player when compared to the us or future powers , such as china and india , argues drulak .
" its openness for new members will make it stronger in the long term .
if a country has the commitment to get through the very difficult and long accession process , then it should be able to become a member of the eu . "

babacan 's switch of portfolio was welcomed by markets as a sign that erdogan finally wants to tackle the economic crisis aggressively .
davutoglu 's appointment marks a rare phenomenon in turkish politics : an official joining the cabinet without being a member of parliament .
davutoglu is credited with being the architect of turkey 's growing role in the middle east .
in another significant change , former parliamentary speaker bulent arinc , who has often angered secularists with comments they regard as targeting turkey 's secular system , becomes the second of three deputy prime ministers .
eight ministers , including those of justice , finance , energy and education , have lost their posts , while 10 - among them the ministers of the interior and defense- remain in offices .
the changes are seen as a move to reinvigorate erdogan 's islamist-roooted akp government which was punished with a reduced share of the vote in local elections in march . gb / sh , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 01.05.2009 experts call eu expansion historic success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebration in prague five years ago on may 1 , 2004 , europe celebrated the enlargement of the eu .
five years later , many europeans do n't feel much like commemorating the historic occasion , even though there are still plenty of reasons to celebrate . the economic data are convincing .
according to figures just released by the german statistical bureau -lrb- destatis -rrb- , the economic output of the ten new member states has grown drastically since they joined the eu five years ago .
the inflation-adjusted gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- of the new members increased by 23 percent until 2008 when compared to 2004 , the year they entered the eu .
slovakia , whose gdp grew by 36 percent topped the list , followed by lithuania and latvia whose output rose by more than 30 percent respectively .
even hungary 's economy , which experienced the weakest increase of all new member states with only ten percent , grew significantly faster than the economies of the 15 older member states which registered eight percent .
the strong economic performance by the new members is not the sole consequence of eu membership .
most eastern european countries had begun to drastically reform and remodel their economies after the collapse of the berlin wall and had recorded strong gdp growth long before joining the eu .
so while eu membership was n't the decisive factor , becoming part of the large european market was a definite boost for the new members .
it not only enabled the new countries to sell their products across europe without any hurdles .
it also forced them to adapt their production and quality standards to compete on the international market .
obviously , the global economic meltdown has n't spared the new member states .
growth rates have slowed in many countries ; some states , such as hungary , face severe difficulties .
still , when judged by economic standards , the eu expansion is a success .
downbeat perception of enlargement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : symbol of the past : border post between germany and poland then why do the feelings of many europeans towards the expansion range somewhere between lukewarm and negative ?
in the latest eurobarometer poll , a regular europe-wide survey measuring public opinion toward the eu , less than half -lrb- 48 percent -rrb- of the participants felt that the expansion made the eu stronger .
36 percent believe that the expansion weakened the bloc .
in some countries , among them germany and france , a majority of those polled holds the view that enlargement weakened the eu .
" i am quite puzzled by these polls , " admits petr drulak , director of the institute of international relations in prague , " but i think it reflects a general feeling about the eu as a whole .
many people are simply tired of the eu and do n't like any news that comes out of brussels , even if there are no objective and tangible reasons for it . "
drulak argues that the most dominant fear of eu enlargement in germany and other countries simply did n't materialize .
" the flooding of the german labor market with eastern european workers never happened because germany protected its labor market . "
and even a country with an unprotected labor market such as britain , says drulak , managed to integrate the workers from eastern europe quite well until the global economic meltdown started to take effect . jonas cicinskas , head of the european studies department at vilnius university in lithuania , blames the deteriorating economic situation for the negative public opinion toward enlargement .
cicinskas believes that the global economic crisis currently overshadows everything and negatively influences how people judge the eu and enlargement .
" many people in the traditional eu donor countries understandably are not in favor of paying money for poorer countries and supporting sectors such as agriculture . "
proof that eu is a viable project despite the trend towards eu scepticism both drulak and cicinskas consider the enlargement of the eu a tremendous achievement .
" i think it is one of the great successes of the european union , " says drulak .
" if i had to give a grade i would give it not just a ' very good , ' but an ' excellent . '
it proved that the eu can absorb many new members and remain a viable project . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factory in budapest producing eu flags the experts also agree that the division between old and new members becomes increasingly irrelevant .
drulak contends that there is not a single political issue where the alleged old europe-new europe divide is still in place today .
" even on russia , this dividing line does n't work anymore , " he says .
" while poland and the baltic states , with some support by the scandinavian countries , are tough on russia , hungary and slovakia tend more towards the more lenient german position on russia . " and cicinskas points out that , economically , the differences between the new countries are growing as well .
he predicts that in the future , sub-regional factors will play a more important role than when a country joined the eu .
eu should remain open for new members as for the never-ending debate about further enlargement , drulak and cicinskas , not surprisingly , are clearly in favor of other nations joining the eu .
" ideally , every european country should be a member of the eu , " says cicinskas .
" but we need to calculate more carefully if we can afford new members financially and we have to reconsider the current regional and structural funds of the eu . "
on a global scale , the eu is still a small player when compared to the us or future powers , such as china and india , argues drulak .
" its openness for new members will make it stronger in the long term .
if a country has the commitment to get through the very difficult and long accession process , then it should be able to become a member of the eu . "

five years later , many europeans do n't feel much like commemorating the historic occasion , even though there are still plenty of reasons to celebrate . the economic data are convincing .
according to figures just released by the german statistical bureau -lrb- destatis -rrb- , the economic output of the ten new member states has grown drastically since they joined the eu five years ago .
the inflation-adjusted gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- of the new members increased by 23 percent until 2008 when compared to 2004 , the year they entered the eu .
slovakia , whose gdp grew by 36 percent topped the list , followed by lithuania and latvia whose output rose by more than 30 percent respectively .
even hungary 's economy , which experienced the weakest increase of all new member states with only ten percent , grew significantly faster than the economies of the 15 older member states which registered eight percent .
the strong economic performance by the new members is not the sole consequence of eu membership .
most eastern european countries had begun to drastically reform and remodel their economies after the collapse of the berlin wall and had recorded strong gdp growth long before joining the eu .
so while eu membership was n't the decisive factor , becoming part of the large european market was a definite boost for the new members .
it not only enabled the new countries to sell their products across europe without any hurdles .
it also forced them to adapt their production and quality standards to compete on the international market .
obviously , the global economic meltdown has n't spared the new member states .
growth rates have slowed in many countries ; some states , such as hungary , face severe difficulties .
still , when judged by economic standards , the eu expansion is a success .
downbeat perception of enlargement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : symbol of the past : border post between germany and poland then why do the feelings of many europeans towards the expansion range somewhere between lukewarm and negative ?
in the latest eurobarometer poll , a regular europe-wide survey measuring public opinion toward the eu , less than half -lrb- 48 percent -rrb- of the participants felt that the expansion made the eu stronger .
36 percent believe that the expansion weakened the bloc .
in some countries , among them germany and france , a majority of those polled holds the view that enlargement weakened the eu .
" i am quite puzzled by these polls , " admits petr drulak , director of the institute of international relations in prague , " but i think it reflects a general feeling about the eu as a whole .
many people are simply tired of the eu and do n't like any news that comes out of brussels , even if there are no objective and tangible reasons for it . "
drulak argues that the most dominant fear of eu enlargement in germany and other countries simply did n't materialize .
" the flooding of the german labor market with eastern european workers never happened because germany protected its labor market . "
and even a country with an unprotected labor market such as britain , says drulak , managed to integrate the workers from eastern europe quite well until the global economic meltdown started to take effect . jonas cicinskas , head of the european studies department at vilnius university in lithuania , blames the deteriorating economic situation for the negative public opinion toward enlargement .
cicinskas believes that the global economic crisis currently overshadows everything and negatively influences how people judge the eu and enlargement .
" many people in the traditional eu donor countries understandably are not in favor of paying money for poorer countries and supporting sectors such as agriculture . "
proof that eu is a viable project despite the trend towards eu scepticism both drulak and cicinskas consider the enlargement of the eu a tremendous achievement .
" i think it is one of the great successes of the european union , " says drulak .
" if i had to give a grade i would give it not just a ' very good , ' but an ' excellent . '
it proved that the eu can absorb many new members and remain a viable project . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factory in budapest producing eu flags the experts also agree that the division between old and new members becomes increasingly irrelevant .
drulak contends that there is not a single political issue where the alleged old europe-new europe divide is still in place today .
" even on russia , this dividing line does n't work anymore , " he says .
" while poland and the baltic states , with some support by the scandinavian countries , are tough on russia , hungary and slovakia tend more towards the more lenient german position on russia . " and cicinskas points out that , economically , the differences between the new countries are growing as well .
he predicts that in the future , sub-regional factors will play a more important role than when a country joined the eu .
eu should remain open for new members as for the never-ending debate about further enlargement , drulak and cicinskas , not surprisingly , are clearly in favor of other nations joining the eu .
" ideally , every european country should be a member of the eu , " says cicinskas .
" but we need to calculate more carefully if we can afford new members financially and we have to reconsider the current regional and structural funds of the eu . "
on a global scale , the eu is still a small player when compared to the us or future powers , such as china and india , argues drulak .
" its openness for new members will make it stronger in the long term .
if a country has the commitment to get through the very difficult and long accession process , then it should be able to become a member of the eu . "

it is is the first time that the h1n1 virus has been contracted within germany , the bavarian health ministry said in a statement .
the other three confirmed infections in germany are in people who had recently been to mexico , the suspected epicenter of the disease .
eu rejects travel ban to mexico at an emergency meeting in luxembourg on thursday , eu health ministers rejected a french proposal to suspend all air travel to mexico .
" in the current state of the situation , we are not yet taking this decision , " french health minister roselyne bachelot said , adding that the plan may be revisited in the future .
previously other countries such as germany and spain had balked at the flight ban proposal , considering it too drastic and having little value , considering the outbreak had already spread to four continents .
european ministers also shot down an italian proposal that member states should set up a " drug bank " of flu remedies and vaccines , saying that it was up to each member state to decide how best to deal with health problems .
" i am very much in favor of the suggestion that every member state is responsible for having a sufficient supply of drugs , " germany 's health minister ulla schmidt said as she arrived at the meeting .
the question of whether eu member states should share information on their drugs supplies has long been a divisive one , setting eu member states at loggerheads during earlier scares over bird flu and severe acute respiratory syndrome -lrb- sars -rrb- .

dutch officials said a three-year-old child had become the first confirmed case in the netherlands , while irish authorities said they were investigating one likely infection in a young man who recently returned from mexico .
swine flu cases are also being treated in germany , austria , britain and spain .
the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- said that , while it was clear the disease was spreading , it saw no evidence to suggest it should raise its pandemic alert to the highest level .
the who 's six-stage flu alert is currently set at level five .
eu health commissioner androulla vassiliou warned against panicking over the spread of the potentially deadly virus .
" we have to be careful , we have to exercise vigilance , we should not panic , we have to be prepared , " vassiliou said hours after the world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- warned a pandemic was imminent .
her spokeswoman stressed that " we do not have any casualties at the eu level yet " and that all cases so far in europe were " mildly affected and recovering . "
she warned against drawing parallels with the situation in mexico because the state of preparedness was much higher in europe .
vaccine development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fukuda says the who does not need to raise its pandemic alert level " on wednesday , eu health commissioner vassiliou hosted representatives from a number of european pharmaceutical companies in brussels , calling on them to develop a vaccine against the new form of swine flu as fast as possible .
it 's something that we have to coordinate with member states , because the industry has to receive some directions from member states on what they want , " she said as she arrived in luxembourg .
asked how long it could take to develop such a vaccine , she said that it would " most probably take several months . "
diplomats said eu health ministers also debated whether they could speed up their national drug-registration programs in order to approve a vaccine faster , once one is developed .
who flu chief keiji fukuda told reporters that swiss pharmaceuticals giant roche has indicated it was stepping up production of its antiviral tamiflu to deal with the infection .
known generically as oseltamivir , the drug has proven effective against the new strain .
fukuda said the united nations agency has already released some of its own tamiflu stockpiles to the developing countries deemed most in need , including mexico .

now the suspect 's lawyer is pressing charges against the german govenment . the lawyer of the alleged nazi camp guard john demjanjuk has taken legal action against the german government in a bid to prevent the 89-year old 's deportation from the united states , according to spiegel online .
german authorities gave the green light for a munich-based court to issue an arrest warrant for demjanjuk on march 11 .
however , his lawyer argues that german authorities neglected to file an application for demjanjuk 's extradition and also failed to check whether he was fit enough to travel or stand trial .
demjanjuk 's lawyer maintains that his client is too ill to travel , despite a video filed by prosecutors last week which showed the alleged nazi guard walking and talking animatedly .
his lawyer said demjanjuk may be able to walk a few steps unassisted , but that medical evidence showed that arrest , incarceration and a possible trial would cause severe pain .
the us justice department accuses demjanjuk of numerous delaying tactics saying that reasons no longer existed for an emergency stay of deportation .
demjanjuk got an 11th-hour reprieve on april 14 when a federal appeals court in ohio granted the 89-year old 's request for a stay of deportation shortly after he had been carried in a wheelchair out of his home to be taken to a waiting flight .

now the suspect 's lawyer is pressing charges against the german govenment . the lawyer of the alleged nazi camp guard john demjanjuk has taken legal action against the german government in a bid to prevent the 89-year old 's deportation from the united states , according to spiegel online .
german authorities gave the green light for a munich-based court to issue an arrest warrant for demjanjuk on march 11 .
however , his lawyer argues that german authorities neglected to file an application for demjanjuk 's extradition and also failed to check whether he was fit enough to travel or stand trial .
demjanjuk 's lawyer maintains that his client is too ill to travel , despite a video filed by prosecutors last week which showed the alleged nazi guard walking and talking animatedly .
his lawyer said demjanjuk may be able to walk a few steps unassisted , but that medical evidence showed that arrest , incarceration and a possible trial would cause severe pain .
the us justice department accuses demjanjuk of numerous delaying tactics saying that reasons no longer existed for an emergency stay of deportation .
demjanjuk got an 11th-hour reprieve on april 14 when a federal appeals court in ohio granted the 89-year old 's request for a stay of deportation shortly after he had been carried in a wheelchair out of his home to be taken to a waiting flight .
demjanjuk is wanted in germany on charges of aiding the deaths of at least 29,000 jews in concentration camps in nazi-occupied poland during world war ii .

hamburg 's coach says their position is good for the second leg , but bremen is not giving up . hamburg went into the match in bremen 's weser-stadium determined to make up for last week 's disappointment in the german cup semi-final , when bremen beat hamburg on penalties .
and the determination paid off , when , in the 28th minute , hamburg midfielder piotr trochowski headed a guy demel cross into the back of the net – the ball sailing over the outstretched arms of goalkeeper tim wiese .
" even though i am not very tall , i went up wanting to put the ball into the back of the net , " trochowski said afterwards .
hamburg coach martin jol said his team did well in the first half , and said they 're in a good position going into the second leg of the semi-finals .

hamburg only has to avoid defeat in next week 's second leg to qualify for the may 20 uefa cup final in istanbul .
bremen still optimistic bremen were certainly more aggressive after half time but – as midfielder torsten frings later lamented – the side just could n't come home with the goods .
" we conceded a stupid goal after a mistake and then failed to make the most of our many chances , " frings said , " but everything is still open for the return leg and nothing is lost . " .
bremen coach thomas schaaf is also still optimistic , despite thursday night 's setback .

hamburg 's coach says their position is good for the second leg , but bremen is not giving up . hamburg went into the match in bremen 's weser-stadium determined to make up for last week 's disappointment in the german cup semi-final , when bremen beat hamburg on penalties .

" even though i am not very tall , i went up wanting to put the ball into the back of the net , " trochowski said afterwards .
hamburg coach martin jol said his team did well in the first half , and said they 're in a good position going into the second leg of the semi-finals .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trochowski 's said he 'd been " determined " to make the goal but jol also said his players should have scored again in the second half of thursday 's game .

" we conceded a stupid goal after a mistake and then failed to make the most of our many chances , " frings said , " but everything is still open for the return leg and nothing is lost . " .
bremen coach thomas schaaf is also still optimistic , despite thursday night 's setback .

" based on the medical information before the court ... the court can not find that the petitioner 's removal to germany is likely to cause irreparable harm sufficient to warrant a stay of removal , " the judges ruled .
" his motion for a stay of removal pending review is denied . " the decision overturns an 11th-hour reprieve granted to demjanjuk on april 14 , when a federal appeals court gave the suspect a temporary stay of deportation shortly after immigration officials carried him out of his home in a wheelchair to be taken to a waiting flight . the new decision can , however , be appealed .
spiegel online reports that demjanjuk 's lawyer has already taken legal action against the german government in a bid to prevent his deportation from the united states . german authorities first gave the green light for a munich-based court to issue an arrest warrant for demjanjuk on march 11 . however , his lawyer argues that german officials neglected to file an application for demjanjuk 's extradition and also failed to check whether he was fit enough to travel or stand trial . demjanjuk 's lawyer maintains that his client is too ill to travel , despite a video filed by prosecutors last week which showed the alleged nazi guard walking and talking animatedly . his lawyer said demjanjuk may be able to walk a few steps unassisted , but that medical evidence showed that arrest , incarceration and a possible trial would cause severe pain . the us justice department accuses demjanjuk of numerous delaying tactics , saying that reasons no longer existed for an emergency stay of deportation . demjanjuk is wanted in germany on charges of being an accessory to the deaths of at least 29,000 jews in concentration camps in nazi-occupied poland during world war ii .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.05.2009 chrysler files for bankruptcy , enters deal with fiat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama wants chrysler to get a new lease of life .
after surviving for months on government loans , america 's third largest car manufacturer filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and at the same time announced a partnership with italian automaker fiat . american carmaker chrysler has become the first of the big three us automakers to be forced into bankruptcy protection to help it form an alliance with fiat and create the 6th largest global car manufacturer .
if approved by a bankruptcy court , the plan would create a new company controlled by the united auto workers trade union and fiat , with small stakes held by the us and canadian governments .
the us and canadian governments will provide billions of dollars in funding to support the company 's operations during the transition .
chrysler says it will close all its plants on monday , and keep them closed until the company has come out of bankruptcy .
convincing chrysler 's creditors to forgive most of the loans the carmaker owes them was crucial to save the company from bankruptcy but lenders resisted washington 's pressure .
in 2008 , chrysler had an $ 8 billion loss , and us sales fell 30 percent to 1.45 million vehicles .
us president barack obama said the " necessary steps " had been to taken to " to give one of america 's most storied automakers , chrysler , a new lease on life . "
" i have every confidence that chrysler will emerge from this process stronger and more competitive , " obama said .
the announcement came less than 24 hours before the expiry of a 30-day deadline set by the obama administration for chrysler to come up with a recovery plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrysler hopes a new alliance with fiat will reverse its bad fortune .
deal with fiat fiat will initially take a 20 percent stake in the firm that would rise to 35 percent and could reach 51 percent as early as 2013 if chrysler is able to repay its government loans .
autoworkers have voted to approve a new contract with chrysler and fiat , agreeing to concessions designed to secure the survival of the number three us automaker . fiat , which is looking to buy into chrysler , has also shown an interest in taking over german carmaker gm .
fiat reportedly needs to expand in order to survive the economic downturn .

hamburg 's coach says their position is good for the second leg , but bremen is not giving up . hamburg went into the match in bremen 's weser-stadium determined to make up for last week 's disappointment in the german cup semi-final , when bremen beat hamburg on penalties .
and the determination paid off , when , in the 28th minute , hamburg midfielder piotr trochowski headed a guy demel cross into the back of the net – the ball sailing over the outstretched arms of goalkeeper tim wiese .
" even though i am not very tall , i went up wanting to put the ball into the back of the net , " trochowski said afterwards .
hamburg coach martin jol said his team did well in the first half , and said they 're in a good position going into the second leg of the semi-finals .
" we proved that we can overcome a setback like the penalty shoot-out loss … a week ago . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trochowski 's said he 'd been " determined " to make the goal but jol also said his players should have scored again in the second half of thursday 's game .
" bremen are a very dangerous team and they know how to score goals , " he said .
hamburg only has to avoid defeat in next week 's second leg to qualify for the may 20 uefa cup final in istanbul .
bremen still optimistic bremen were certainly more aggressive after half time but – as midfielder torsten frings later lamented – the side just could n't come home with the goods .
" we conceded a stupid goal after a mistake and then failed to make the most of our many chances , " frings said , " but everything is still open for the return leg and nothing is lost . " .
bremen coach thomas schaaf is also still optimistic , despite thursday night 's setback .
" it is just one goal and there are of course still possibilities for the second match . "

kiev coach yuri semin was disappointed after the match .
" the game was very difficult , nervy and our players failed to stand the pressure , " he said .
" they did n't play their best . "
his donetsk counterpart mircea lucescu said the game had been difficult , but said he was satisfied with the result .

now the suspect 's lawyer is pressing charges against the german govenment . the lawyer of the alleged nazi camp guard john demjanjuk has taken legal action against the german government in a bid to prevent the 89-year old 's deportation from the united states , according to spiegel online .
german authorities gave the green light for a munich-based court to issue an arrest warrant for demjanjuk on march 11 .
however , his lawyer argues that german authorities neglected to file an application for demjanjuk 's extradition and also failed to check whether he was fit enough to travel or stand trial .
demjanjuk 's lawyer maintains that his client is too ill to travel , despite a video filed by prosecutors last week which showed the alleged nazi guard walking and talking animatedly .
his lawyer said demjanjuk may be able to walk a few steps unassisted , but that medical evidence showed that arrest , incarceration and a possible trial would cause severe pain .
the us justice department accuses demjanjuk of numerous delaying tactics saying that reasons no longer existed for an emergency stay of deportation .
demjanjuk got an 11th-hour reprieve on april 14 when a federal appeals court in ohio granted the 89-year old 's request for a stay of deportation shortly after he had been carried in a wheelchair out of his home to be taken to a waiting flight .

now the suspect 's lawyer is pressing charges against the german govenment . the lawyer of the alleged nazi camp guard john demjanjuk has taken legal action against the german government in a bid to prevent the 89-year old 's deportation from the united states , according to spiegel online .
german authorities gave the green light for a munich-based court to issue an arrest warrant for demjanjuk on march 11 .
however , his lawyer argues that german authorities neglected to file an application for demjanjuk 's extradition and also failed to check whether he was fit enough to travel or stand trial .
demjanjuk 's lawyer maintains that his client is too ill to travel , despite a video filed by prosecutors last week which showed the alleged nazi guard walking and talking animatedly .
his lawyer said demjanjuk may be able to walk a few steps unassisted , but that medical evidence showed that arrest , incarceration and a possible trial would cause severe pain .
the us justice department accuses demjanjuk of numerous delaying tactics saying that reasons no longer existed for an emergency stay of deportation .
demjanjuk got an 11th-hour reprieve on april 14 when a federal appeals court in ohio granted the 89-year old 's request for a stay of deportation shortly after he had been carried in a wheelchair out of his home to be taken to a waiting flight .

it is is the first time that the h1n1 virus has been contracted within germany , the bavarian health ministry said in a statement .
the other three confirmed infections in germany are in people who had recently been to mexico , the suspected epicenter of the disease .
eu rejects travel ban to mexico at an emergency meeting in luxembourg on thursday , eu health ministers rejected a french proposal to suspend all air travel to mexico .
" in the current state of the situation , we are not yet taking this decision , " french health minister roselyne bachelot said , adding that the plan may be revisited in the future .
previously other countries such as germany and spain had balked at the flight ban proposal , considering it too drastic and having little value , considering the outbreak had already spread to four continents .
european ministers also shot down an italian proposal that member states should set up a " drug bank " of flu remedies and vaccines , saying that it was up to each member state to decide how best to deal with health problems .
" i am very much in favor of the suggestion that every member state is responsible for having a sufficient supply of drugs , " germany 's health minister ulla schmidt said as she arrived at the meeting .
the question of whether eu member states should share information on their drugs supplies has long been a divisive one , setting eu member states at loggerheads during earlier scares over bird flu and severe acute respiratory syndrome -lrb- sars -rrb- .

dutch officials said a three-year-old child had become the first confirmed case in the netherlands , while irish authorities said they were investigating one likely infection in a young man who recently returned from mexico .
swine flu cases are also being treated in germany , austria , britain and spain .
the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- said that , while it was clear the disease was spreading , it saw no evidence to suggest it should raise its pandemic alert to the highest level .
the who 's six-stage flu alert is currently set at level five .
eu health commissioner androulla vassiliou warned against panicking over the spread of the potentially deadly virus .
" we have to be careful , we have to exercise vigilance , we should not panic , we have to be prepared , " vassiliou said hours after the world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- warned a pandemic was imminent .
her spokeswoman stressed that " we do not have any casualties at the eu level yet " and that all cases so far in europe were " mildly affected and recovering . "
she warned against drawing parallels with the situation in mexico because the state of preparedness was much higher in europe .
vaccine development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fukuda says the who does not need to raise its pandemic alert level " on wednesday , eu health commissioner vassiliou hosted representatives from a number of european pharmaceutical companies in brussels , calling on them to develop a vaccine against the new form of swine flu as fast as possible .
it 's something that we have to coordinate with member states , because the industry has to receive some directions from member states on what they want , " she said as she arrived in luxembourg .
asked how long it could take to develop such a vaccine , she said that it would " most probably take several months . "
diplomats said eu health ministers also debated whether they could speed up their national drug-registration programs in order to approve a vaccine faster , once one is developed .
who flu chief keiji fukuda told reporters that swiss pharmaceuticals giant roche has indicated it was stepping up production of its antiviral tamiflu to deal with the infection .
known generically as oseltamivir , the drug has proven effective against the new strain .
fukuda said the united nations agency has already released some of its own tamiflu stockpiles to the developing countries deemed most in need , including mexico .

" in the current state of the situation , we are not yet taking this decision , " french health minister roselyne bachelot said , adding that the plan may be revisited in the future .
previously other countries such as germany and spain had balked at the flight ban proposal , considering it too drastic and having little value , considering the outbreak had already spread to four continents .
european ministers also shot down an italian proposal that member states should set up a " drug bank " of flu remedies and vaccines , saying that it was up to each member state to decide how best to deal with health problems .
" i am very much in favor of the suggestion that every member state is responsible for having a sufficient supply of drugs , " germany 's health minister ulla schmidt said as she arrived at the meeting .

" we have to be careful , we have to exercise vigilance , we should not panic , we have to be prepared , " vassiliou said hours after the world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- warned a pandemic was imminent .
her spokeswoman stressed that " we do not have any casualties at the eu level yet " and that all cases so far in europe were " mildly affected and recovering . "
she warned against drawing parallels with the situation in mexico because the state of preparedness was much higher in europe .
vaccine development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fukuda says the who does not need to raise its pandemic alert level " on wednesday , eu health commissioner vassiliou hosted representatives from a number of european pharmaceutical companies in brussels , calling on them to develop a vaccine against the new form of swine flu as fast as possible .
it 's something that we have to coordinate with member states , because the industry has to receive some directions from member states on what they want , " she said as she arrived in luxembourg .
asked how long it could take to develop such a vaccine , she said that it would " most probably take several months . "

babacan 's switch of portfolio was welcomed by markets as a sign that erdogan finally wants to tackle the economic crisis aggressively .
davutoglu 's appointment marks a rare phenomenon in turkish politics : an official joining the cabinet without being a member of parliament .
davutoglu is credited with being the architect of turkey 's growing role in the middle east .
in another significant change , former parliamentary speaker bulent arinc , who has often angered secularists with comments they regard as targeting turkey 's secular system , becomes the second of three deputy prime ministers .
eight ministers , including those of justice , finance , energy and education , have lost their posts , while 10 - among them the ministers of the interior and defense- remain in offices .
the changes are seen as a move to reinvigorate erdogan 's islamist-roooted akp government which was punished with a reduced share of the vote in local elections in march . gb / sh , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

five years later , many europeans do n't feel much like commemorating the historic occasion , even though there are still plenty of reasons to celebrate . the economic data are convincing .
according to figures just released by the german statistical bureau -lrb- destatis -rrb- , the economic output of the ten new member states has grown drastically since they joined the eu five years ago .
the inflation-adjusted gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- of the new members increased by 23 percent until 2008 when compared to 2004 , the year they entered the eu .
slovakia , whose gdp grew by 36 percent topped the list , followed by lithuania and latvia whose output rose by more than 30 percent respectively .
even hungary 's economy , which experienced the weakest increase of all new member states with only ten percent , grew significantly faster than the economies of the 15 older member states which registered eight percent .
the strong economic performance by the new members is not the sole consequence of eu membership .
most eastern european countries had begun to drastically reform and remodel their economies after the collapse of the berlin wall and had recorded strong gdp growth long before joining the eu .
so while eu membership was n't the decisive factor , becoming part of the large european market was a definite boost for the new members .
it not only enabled the new countries to sell their products across europe without any hurdles .
it also forced them to adapt their production and quality standards to compete on the international market .
obviously , the global economic meltdown has n't spared the new member states .
growth rates have slowed in many countries ; some states , such as hungary , face severe difficulties .
still , when judged by economic standards , the eu expansion is a success .
downbeat perception of enlargement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : symbol of the past : border post between germany and poland then why do the feelings of many europeans towards the expansion range somewhere between lukewarm and negative ?
in the latest eurobarometer poll , a regular europe-wide survey measuring public opinion toward the eu , less than half -lrb- 48 percent -rrb- of the participants felt that the expansion made the eu stronger .
36 percent believe that the expansion weakened the bloc .
in some countries , among them germany and france , a majority of those polled holds the view that enlargement weakened the eu .
" i am quite puzzled by these polls , " admits petr drulak , director of the institute of international relations in prague , " but i think it reflects a general feeling about the eu as a whole .
many people are simply tired of the eu and do n't like any news that comes out of brussels , even if there are no objective and tangible reasons for it . "
drulak argues that the most dominant fear of eu enlargement in germany and other countries simply did n't materialize .
" the flooding of the german labor market with eastern european workers never happened because germany protected its labor market . "
and even a country with an unprotected labor market such as britain , says drulak , managed to integrate the workers from eastern europe quite well until the global economic meltdown started to take effect . jonas cicinskas , head of the european studies department at vilnius university in lithuania , blames the deteriorating economic situation for the negative public opinion toward enlargement .
cicinskas believes that the global economic crisis currently overshadows everything and negatively influences how people judge the eu and enlargement .
" many people in the traditional eu donor countries understandably are not in favor of paying money for poorer countries and supporting sectors such as agriculture . "
proof that eu is a viable project despite the trend towards eu scepticism both drulak and cicinskas consider the enlargement of the eu a tremendous achievement .
" i think it is one of the great successes of the european union , " says drulak .
" if i had to give a grade i would give it not just a ' very good , ' but an ' excellent . '
it proved that the eu can absorb many new members and remain a viable project . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factory in budapest producing eu flags the experts also agree that the division between old and new members becomes increasingly irrelevant .
drulak contends that there is not a single political issue where the alleged old europe-new europe divide is still in place today .
" even on russia , this dividing line does n't work anymore , " he says .
" while poland and the baltic states , with some support by the scandinavian countries , are tough on russia , hungary and slovakia tend more towards the more lenient german position on russia . " and cicinskas points out that , economically , the differences between the new countries are growing as well .
he predicts that in the future , sub-regional factors will play a more important role than when a country joined the eu .
eu should remain open for new members as for the never-ending debate about further enlargement , drulak and cicinskas , not surprisingly , are clearly in favor of other nations joining the eu .
" ideally , every european country should be a member of the eu , " says cicinskas .
" but we need to calculate more carefully if we can afford new members financially and we have to reconsider the current regional and structural funds of the eu . "
on a global scale , the eu is still a small player when compared to the us or future powers , such as china and india , argues drulak .
" its openness for new members will make it stronger in the long term .
if a country has the commitment to get through the very difficult and long accession process , then it should be able to become a member of the eu . "

five years later , many europeans do n't feel much like commemorating the historic occasion , even though there are still plenty of reasons to celebrate . the economic data are convincing .
according to figures just released by the german statistical bureau -lrb- destatis -rrb- , the economic output of the ten new member states has grown drastically since they joined the eu five years ago .
the inflation-adjusted gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- of the new members increased by 23 percent until 2008 when compared to 2004 , the year they entered the eu .
slovakia , whose gdp grew by 36 percent topped the list , followed by lithuania and latvia whose output rose by more than 30 percent respectively .
even hungary 's economy , which experienced the weakest increase of all new member states with only ten percent , grew significantly faster than the economies of the 15 older member states which registered eight percent .
the strong economic performance by the new members is not the sole consequence of eu membership .
most eastern european countries had begun to drastically reform and remodel their economies after the collapse of the berlin wall and had recorded strong gdp growth long before joining the eu .
so while eu membership was n't the decisive factor , becoming part of the large european market was a definite boost for the new members .
it not only enabled the new countries to sell their products across europe without any hurdles .
it also forced them to adapt their production and quality standards to compete on the international market .

in the latest eurobarometer poll , a regular europe-wide survey measuring public opinion toward the eu , less than half -lrb- 48 percent -rrb- of the participants felt that the expansion made the eu stronger .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 01.05.2009 germany reports first case of swine flu transmission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts fear the h1n1 virus could mutate into a more lethal strain the swine flu crisis is taken to a new level as german authorities confirm the first transmission of the h1n1 virus within germany . german authorities said on friday that a nurse who has not been in mexico but who has treated a patient with swine flu , had contracted the virus but had since recovered .
it is is the first time that the h1n1 virus has been contracted within germany , the bavarian health ministry said in a statement .
the other three confirmed infections in germany are in people who had recently been to mexico , the suspected epicenter of the disease .
eu rejects travel ban to mexico at an emergency meeting in luxembourg on thursday , eu health ministers rejected a french proposal to suspend all air travel to mexico .
" in the current state of the situation , we are not yet taking this decision , " french health minister roselyne bachelot said , adding that the plan may be revisited in the future .
previously other countries such as germany and spain had balked at the flight ban proposal , considering it too drastic and having little value , considering the outbreak had already spread to four continents .
european ministers also shot down an italian proposal that member states should set up a " drug bank " of flu remedies and vaccines , saying that it was up to each member state to decide how best to deal with health problems .
" i am very much in favor of the suggestion that every member state is responsible for having a sufficient supply of drugs , " germany 's health minister ulla schmidt said as she arrived at the meeting .
the question of whether eu member states should share information on their drugs supplies has long been a divisive one , setting eu member states at loggerheads during earlier scares over bird flu and severe acute respiratory syndrome -lrb- sars -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's ulla schmidt -lrb- right -rrb- did not see eye to eye with france 's roselyne bachelot on the issue of travel bans do n't panic the hastily arranged meeting in luxembourg came as a growing number of european countries announced swine flu infections .
dutch officials said a three-year-old child had become the first confirmed case in the netherlands , while irish authorities said they were investigating one likely infection in a young man who recently returned from mexico .
swine flu cases are also being treated in germany , austria , britain and spain .
the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- said that , while it was clear the disease was spreading , it saw no evidence to suggest it should raise its pandemic alert to the highest level .
the who 's six-stage flu alert is currently set at level five .
eu health commissioner androulla vassiliou warned against panicking over the spread of the potentially deadly virus .
" we have to be careful , we have to exercise vigilance , we should not panic , we have to be prepared , " vassiliou said hours after the world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- warned a pandemic was imminent .
her spokeswoman stressed that " we do not have any casualties at the eu level yet " and that all cases so far in europe were " mildly affected and recovering . "
she warned against drawing parallels with the situation in mexico because the state of preparedness was much higher in europe .
vaccine development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fukuda says the who does not need to raise its pandemic alert level " on wednesday , eu health commissioner vassiliou hosted representatives from a number of european pharmaceutical companies in brussels , calling on them to develop a vaccine against the new form of swine flu as fast as possible .
it 's something that we have to coordinate with member states , because the industry has to receive some directions from member states on what they want , " she said as she arrived in luxembourg .
asked how long it could take to develop such a vaccine , she said that it would " most probably take several months . "
diplomats said eu health ministers also debated whether they could speed up their national drug-registration programs in order to approve a vaccine faster , once one is developed .
who flu chief keiji fukuda told reporters that swiss pharmaceuticals giant roche has indicated it was stepping up production of its antiviral tamiflu to deal with the infection .
known generically as oseltamivir , the drug has proven effective against the new strain .
fukuda said the united nations agency has already released some of its own tamiflu stockpiles to the developing countries deemed most in need , including mexico .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the who says the name " swine flu " was hurting pig farmers the world health organization has announced it would stop using the term " swine flu " to avoid confusion over the danger posed by pigs .
who spokesman dick thompson said the name change came after the agriculture industry and the un food agency expressed concerns that the term " swine flu " was misleading consumers and needlessly causing countries to order the slaughter of pigs .

babacan 's switch of portfolio was welcomed by markets as a sign that erdogan finally wants to tackle the economic crisis aggressively .
davutoglu 's appointment marks a rare phenomenon in turkish politics : an official joining the cabinet without being a member of parliament .
davutoglu is credited with being the architect of turkey 's growing role in the middle east .
in another significant change , former parliamentary speaker bulent arinc , who has often angered secularists with comments they regard as targeting turkey 's secular system , becomes the second of three deputy prime ministers .
eight ministers , including those of justice , finance , energy and education , have lost their posts , while 10 - among them the ministers of the interior and defense- remain in offices .
the changes are seen as a move to reinvigorate erdogan 's islamist-roooted akp government which was punished with a reduced share of the vote in local elections in march . gb / sh , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

babacan 's switch of portfolio was welcomed by markets as a sign that erdogan finally wants to tackle the economic crisis aggressively .
davutoglu 's appointment marks a rare phenomenon in turkish politics : an official joining the cabinet without being a member of parliament .
davutoglu is credited with being the architect of turkey 's growing role in the middle east .
in another significant change , former parliamentary speaker bulent arinc , who has often angered secularists with comments they regard as targeting turkey 's secular system , becomes the second of three deputy prime ministers .
eight ministers , including those of justice , finance , energy and education , have lost their posts , while 10 - among them the ministers of the interior and defense- remain in offices .
the changes are seen as a move to reinvigorate erdogan 's islamist-roooted akp government which was punished with a reduced share of the vote in local elections in march . gb / sh , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 01.05.2009 experts call eu expansion historic success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebration in prague five years ago on may 1 , 2004 , europe celebrated the enlargement of the eu .
five years later , many europeans do n't feel much like commemorating the historic occasion , even though there are still plenty of reasons to celebrate . the economic data are convincing .
according to figures just released by the german statistical bureau -lrb- destatis -rrb- , the economic output of the ten new member states has grown drastically since they joined the eu five years ago .
the inflation-adjusted gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- of the new members increased by 23 percent until 2008 when compared to 2004 , the year they entered the eu .
slovakia , whose gdp grew by 36 percent topped the list , followed by lithuania and latvia whose output rose by more than 30 percent respectively .
even hungary 's economy , which experienced the weakest increase of all new member states with only ten percent , grew significantly faster than the economies of the 15 older member states which registered eight percent .
the strong economic performance by the new members is not the sole consequence of eu membership .
most eastern european countries had begun to drastically reform and remodel their economies after the collapse of the berlin wall and had recorded strong gdp growth long before joining the eu .
so while eu membership was n't the decisive factor , becoming part of the large european market was a definite boost for the new members .
it not only enabled the new countries to sell their products across europe without any hurdles .
it also forced them to adapt their production and quality standards to compete on the international market .
obviously , the global economic meltdown has n't spared the new member states .
growth rates have slowed in many countries ; some states , such as hungary , face severe difficulties .
still , when judged by economic standards , the eu expansion is a success .
downbeat perception of enlargement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : symbol of the past : border post between germany and poland then why do the feelings of many europeans towards the expansion range somewhere between lukewarm and negative ?
in the latest eurobarometer poll , a regular europe-wide survey measuring public opinion toward the eu , less than half -lrb- 48 percent -rrb- of the participants felt that the expansion made the eu stronger .
36 percent believe that the expansion weakened the bloc .
in some countries , among them germany and france , a majority of those polled holds the view that enlargement weakened the eu .
" i am quite puzzled by these polls , " admits petr drulak , director of the institute of international relations in prague , " but i think it reflects a general feeling about the eu as a whole .
many people are simply tired of the eu and do n't like any news that comes out of brussels , even if there are no objective and tangible reasons for it . "
drulak argues that the most dominant fear of eu enlargement in germany and other countries simply did n't materialize .
" the flooding of the german labor market with eastern european workers never happened because germany protected its labor market . "
and even a country with an unprotected labor market such as britain , says drulak , managed to integrate the workers from eastern europe quite well until the global economic meltdown started to take effect . jonas cicinskas , head of the european studies department at vilnius university in lithuania , blames the deteriorating economic situation for the negative public opinion toward enlargement .
cicinskas believes that the global economic crisis currently overshadows everything and negatively influences how people judge the eu and enlargement .
" many people in the traditional eu donor countries understandably are not in favor of paying money for poorer countries and supporting sectors such as agriculture . "
proof that eu is a viable project despite the trend towards eu scepticism both drulak and cicinskas consider the enlargement of the eu a tremendous achievement .
" i think it is one of the great successes of the european union , " says drulak .
" if i had to give a grade i would give it not just a ' very good , ' but an ' excellent . '
it proved that the eu can absorb many new members and remain a viable project . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factory in budapest producing eu flags the experts also agree that the division between old and new members becomes increasingly irrelevant .
drulak contends that there is not a single political issue where the alleged old europe-new europe divide is still in place today .
" even on russia , this dividing line does n't work anymore , " he says .
" while poland and the baltic states , with some support by the scandinavian countries , are tough on russia , hungary and slovakia tend more towards the more lenient german position on russia . " and cicinskas points out that , economically , the differences between the new countries are growing as well .
he predicts that in the future , sub-regional factors will play a more important role than when a country joined the eu .
eu should remain open for new members as for the never-ending debate about further enlargement , drulak and cicinskas , not surprisingly , are clearly in favor of other nations joining the eu .
" ideally , every european country should be a member of the eu , " says cicinskas .
" but we need to calculate more carefully if we can afford new members financially and we have to reconsider the current regional and structural funds of the eu . "
on a global scale , the eu is still a small player when compared to the us or future powers , such as china and india , argues drulak .
" its openness for new members will make it stronger in the long term .
if a country has the commitment to get through the very difficult and long accession process , then it should be able to become a member of the eu . "

so while eu membership was n't the decisive factor , becoming part of the large european market was a definite boost for the new members .
it not only enabled the new countries to sell their products across europe without any hurdles .
it also forced them to adapt their production and quality standards to compete on the international market .
obviously , the global economic meltdown has n't spared the new member states .
growth rates have slowed in many countries ; some states , such as hungary , face severe difficulties .
still , when judged by economic standards , the eu expansion is a success .
downbeat perception of enlargement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : symbol of the past : border post between germany and poland then why do the feelings of many europeans towards the expansion range somewhere between lukewarm and negative ?
in the latest eurobarometer poll , a regular europe-wide survey measuring public opinion toward the eu , less than half -lrb- 48 percent -rrb- of the participants felt that the expansion made the eu stronger .
36 percent believe that the expansion weakened the bloc .
in some countries , among them germany and france , a majority of those polled holds the view that enlargement weakened the eu .
" i am quite puzzled by these polls , " admits petr drulak , director of the institute of international relations in prague , " but i think it reflects a general feeling about the eu as a whole .
many people are simply tired of the eu and do n't like any news that comes out of brussels , even if there are no objective and tangible reasons for it . "
drulak argues that the most dominant fear of eu enlargement in germany and other countries simply did n't materialize .
" the flooding of the german labor market with eastern european workers never happened because germany protected its labor market . "
and even a country with an unprotected labor market such as britain , says drulak , managed to integrate the workers from eastern europe quite well until the global economic meltdown started to take effect . jonas cicinskas , head of the european studies department at vilnius university in lithuania , blames the deteriorating economic situation for the negative public opinion toward enlargement .
cicinskas believes that the global economic crisis currently overshadows everything and negatively influences how people judge the eu and enlargement .

police in berlin said that 48 riot police were hurt and 49 people arrested when around 200 protestors chanting anti-capitalist slogans threw bottles and stones at police after a street party in the eastern district of friedrichshain .
several dumpsters were set on fire as the otherwise peaceful gathering of about 2,000 people was ending , police said .
demonstrators also threw bottles and stones at trams and cars .
several glass windows at bus stops were destroyed .
in hamburg , authorities said three riot police were injured in clashes with demonstrators .
police in berlin are bracing for further violence on friday when members of far-right parties , labor unions and leftists march .
the economic crisis , which has sent unemployment soaring and raised public ire over a growing disparity in wages , along with simmering anger over " gentrification " in some low-rent districts have raised police worries about this year 's may day .
germany 's capital has been rocked by violent clashes between police and groups of anti-capitalist and anarchists on may day for years .
since the clashes started in 1987 they have caused extensive damage to parts of the city .
but the violence had been on the wane in the last three years after police shifted tactics from battling rioters to de-escalation .
may day is traditionally marked by union rallies in many european countries and the global economic downturn is expected to swell the crowds this year .
germany is suffering its worst recession since world war two .
in france , the eight main unions have called for massive nationwide protests against president nicolas sarkozy 's handling of the economy and a big union demonstration is also expected in madrid , spain .
meanwhile in istanbul , turkish police sprayed tear gas and used water cannons to prevent hundreds of leftist protestors from marching to an istanbul square to mark may day in defiance of a ban . ml , rm , dpa / reuters / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

babacan 's switch of portfolio was welcomed by markets as a sign that erdogan finally wants to tackle the economic crisis aggressively .
davutoglu 's appointment marks a rare phenomenon in turkish politics : an official joining the cabinet without being a member of parliament .
davutoglu is credited with being the architect of turkey 's growing role in the middle east .
in another significant change , former parliamentary speaker bulent arinc , who has often angered secularists with comments they regard as targeting turkey 's secular system , becomes the second of three deputy prime ministers .
eight ministers , including those of justice , finance , energy and education , have lost their posts , while 10 - among them the ministers of the interior and defense- remain in offices .
the changes are seen as a move to reinvigorate erdogan 's islamist-roooted akp government which was punished with a reduced share of the vote in local elections in march . gb / sh , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

five years later , many europeans do n't feel much like commemorating the historic occasion , even though there are still plenty of reasons to celebrate . the economic data are convincing .
according to figures just released by the german statistical bureau -lrb- destatis -rrb- , the economic output of the ten new member states has grown drastically since they joined the eu five years ago .
the inflation-adjusted gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- of the new members increased by 23 percent until 2008 when compared to 2004 , the year they entered the eu .
slovakia , whose gdp grew by 36 percent topped the list , followed by lithuania and latvia whose output rose by more than 30 percent respectively .
even hungary 's economy , which experienced the weakest increase of all new member states with only ten percent , grew significantly faster than the economies of the 15 older member states which registered eight percent .
the strong economic performance by the new members is not the sole consequence of eu membership .
most eastern european countries had begun to drastically reform and remodel their economies after the collapse of the berlin wall and had recorded strong gdp growth long before joining the eu .
so while eu membership was n't the decisive factor , becoming part of the large european market was a definite boost for the new members .
it not only enabled the new countries to sell their products across europe without any hurdles .
it also forced them to adapt their production and quality standards to compete on the international market .
obviously , the global economic meltdown has n't spared the new member states .
growth rates have slowed in many countries ; some states , such as hungary , face severe difficulties .
still , when judged by economic standards , the eu expansion is a success .
downbeat perception of enlargement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : symbol of the past : border post between germany and poland then why do the feelings of many europeans towards the expansion range somewhere between lukewarm and negative ?
in the latest eurobarometer poll , a regular europe-wide survey measuring public opinion toward the eu , less than half -lrb- 48 percent -rrb- of the participants felt that the expansion made the eu stronger .
36 percent believe that the expansion weakened the bloc .

" the flooding of the german labor market with eastern european workers never happened because germany protected its labor market . "
and even a country with an unprotected labor market such as britain , says drulak , managed to integrate the workers from eastern europe quite well until the global economic meltdown started to take effect . jonas cicinskas , head of the european studies department at vilnius university in lithuania , blames the deteriorating economic situation for the negative public opinion toward enlargement .
cicinskas believes that the global economic crisis currently overshadows everything and negatively influences how people judge the eu and enlargement .
" many people in the traditional eu donor countries understandably are not in favor of paying money for poorer countries and supporting sectors such as agriculture . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factory in budapest producing eu flags the experts also agree that the division between old and new members becomes increasingly irrelevant .
drulak contends that there is not a single political issue where the alleged old europe-new europe divide is still in place today .
" even on russia , this dividing line does n't work anymore , " he says .
" while poland and the baltic states , with some support by the scandinavian countries , are tough on russia , hungary and slovakia tend more towards the more lenient german position on russia . " and cicinskas points out that , economically , the differences between the new countries are growing as well .
he predicts that in the future , sub-regional factors will play a more important role than when a country joined the eu .
eu should remain open for new members as for the never-ending debate about further enlargement , drulak and cicinskas , not surprisingly , are clearly in favor of other nations joining the eu .
" ideally , every european country should be a member of the eu , " says cicinskas .
" but we need to calculate more carefully if we can afford new members financially and we have to reconsider the current regional and structural funds of the eu . "
on a global scale , the eu is still a small player when compared to the us or future powers , such as china and india , argues drulak .
" its openness for new members will make it stronger in the long term .
if a country has the commitment to get through the very difficult and long accession process , then it should be able to become a member of the eu . "

five years later , many europeans do n't feel much like commemorating the historic occasion , even though there are still plenty of reasons to celebrate . the economic data are convincing .
according to figures just released by the german statistical bureau -lrb- destatis -rrb- , the economic output of the ten new member states has grown drastically since they joined the eu five years ago .
the inflation-adjusted gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- of the new members increased by 23 percent until 2008 when compared to 2004 , the year they entered the eu .
slovakia , whose gdp grew by 36 percent topped the list , followed by lithuania and latvia whose output rose by more than 30 percent respectively .
even hungary 's economy , which experienced the weakest increase of all new member states with only ten percent , grew significantly faster than the economies of the 15 older member states which registered eight percent .
the strong economic performance by the new members is not the sole consequence of eu membership .
most eastern european countries had begun to drastically reform and remodel their economies after the collapse of the berlin wall and had recorded strong gdp growth long before joining the eu .
so while eu membership was n't the decisive factor , becoming part of the large european market was a definite boost for the new members .
it not only enabled the new countries to sell their products across europe without any hurdles .
it also forced them to adapt their production and quality standards to compete on the international market .
obviously , the global economic meltdown has n't spared the new member states .
growth rates have slowed in many countries ; some states , such as hungary , face severe difficulties .
still , when judged by economic standards , the eu expansion is a success .
downbeat perception of enlargement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : symbol of the past : border post between germany and poland then why do the feelings of many europeans towards the expansion range somewhere between lukewarm and negative ?
in the latest eurobarometer poll , a regular europe-wide survey measuring public opinion toward the eu , less than half -lrb- 48 percent -rrb- of the participants felt that the expansion made the eu stronger .
36 percent believe that the expansion weakened the bloc .
in some countries , among them germany and france , a majority of those polled holds the view that enlargement weakened the eu .

drulak argues that the most dominant fear of eu enlargement in germany and other countries simply did n't materialize .
" the flooding of the german labor market with eastern european workers never happened because germany protected its labor market . "
and even a country with an unprotected labor market such as britain , says drulak , managed to integrate the workers from eastern europe quite well until the global economic meltdown started to take effect . jonas cicinskas , head of the european studies department at vilnius university in lithuania , blames the deteriorating economic situation for the negative public opinion toward enlargement .

with five games to go , table-toppers wolfsburg are hot favorites for the title , an accolade the 27-year-old won with bayern in 2003 . dw : what qualities does a great playmaker need ?
zvjezdan misimovic : i think a playmaker always has to be available to take passes .
if the team is in possession of the ball , the playmaker has to help his teammates , setting up the strikers , or working in defense to close down the opposition .
you never have time to rest , you always have to work for the team .
it 's often said the playmaker determines the rhythm of the game .
what does that mean ?
for example , if you 're under pressure you can keep the ball or provoke a foul , simply to break your opponent 's rhythm .
there are other situations you have to read , like when you spot a gap .
you have to be quick and be the one who sets the pace of your team .
which players do you look up to ?
zinedine zidane was my role model in his playing days .
watching him play was a feast for the eyes , the way he controlled the ball .
is his style of play comparable with your own ?
it 's always hard to copy other players .
you have to have your own style and play your own game and not try to replicate another player .
i have a couple of dvds of him and i watch them now and again before games , or when i feel like it .
but you could never copy him and should n't even try .
so you watch dvds before games for inspiration ?
yes , sometimes , to see his movement .
but not before every match .
maybe once a month or once every two months , depending on whether i 'm in the mood .
it seems to work .
misimovic has set up 18 goals this season , more than anyone else .
his sumptuous passes have been converted by grafite and edin dzeko .
the two wolfsburg strikers have scored 38 goals between them , another bundesliga best .
the three players are the most formidable attacking force in the league .
how is it playing with those two ?
it 's loads of fun .
they complement each other very well .
both grafite and edin dzeko move well .
they 're always looking for gaps in the defence and sometimes you just have to play the ball into the space and they 're right there .
edin is the more elegant of the two .
he can do more on the ball and has great control over his body .
and he 's made huge improvements in his heading game .
grafite thrives on his athleticism .
if he has space he 's almost impossible to stop .
both of them know exactly where the goal is and harmonize really well .
you 're often praised for your skills but you 're often criticized for being slow .
is that true ?
i 'm certainly not the fastest player .
i 'm aware of that , but i think there are other players who are n't fast and play at european level or at the highest level of the game .
i think you can compensate a lot if you simply think quicker , if you react quicker .
then maybe you can make up a couple of milliseconds .
how difficult is training under felix magath ?
pre-season training is n't much fun , no doubt about it .
there are n't many people who really enjoy running around or carrying medicine balls .
but it 's part of the process .
that 's the way it is .
how does magath make the team strong ?
i think the coach has a big impact .
he has a concept and he looks for players who fit into that concept .
his track record shows he 's right .
wolfsburg almost got relegated twice .
he came to the club last year and took it straight into the uefa cup .
this season we are well on our way to getting a european spot for next season as well .
last year , wolfsburg were resurgent after the winter break .
it 's the same this year .
why ?
because we are physically fitter and that carries us through the whole season .
five teams are in contention for the bundesliga title , who will win it ?
i think if everything goes as normal bayern munich will win it .
they certainly have the best quality squad , and probably the most experienced as well .
they know how to deal with these kinds of situations .
our goal was n't to be german champions and we 're still a long way from that .
but hand on heart , you 're ahead of bayern , you beat them 5:1 and you 're still not talking about winning the bundesliga ?
the league is so even .
every team is capable of beating every other team .
stuttgart were already written off and now they 're back in contention .
hoffenheim were top before the winter break , now they 're eighth .
things can change very quickly , so we have no need to talk about it yet .
i 've always said if we 're still up there shortly before the end we can aim for the title , but not before then .
how do you feel about the euphoria surrounding wolfsburg ?
it 's nice for the supporters .
when you 're up at the top you 're treated very differently , by the media and by people generally .
the most important thing is where we are at the end .
of course it 's nice at the moment but we ca n't let it go to our heads .
we have to keep our feet on the ground and keep working on ourselves .
the difficult thing is to maintain this level and make sure it 's not just a one-off .
i think we have the potential and psychologically are able to cope . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is is the first time that the h1n1 virus has been contracted within germany , the bavarian health ministry said in a statement .
the other three confirmed infections in germany are in people who had recently been to mexico , the suspected epicenter of the disease .
eu rejects travel ban to mexico at an emergency meeting in luxembourg on thursday , eu health ministers rejected a french proposal to suspend all air travel to mexico .
" in the current state of the situation , we are not yet taking this decision , " french health minister roselyne bachelot said , adding that the plan may be revisited in the future .
previously other countries such as germany and spain had balked at the flight ban proposal , considering it too drastic and having little value , considering the outbreak had already spread to four continents .
european ministers also shot down an italian proposal that member states should set up a " drug bank " of flu remedies and vaccines , saying that it was up to each member state to decide how best to deal with health problems .
" i am very much in favor of the suggestion that every member state is responsible for having a sufficient supply of drugs , " germany 's health minister ulla schmidt said as she arrived at the meeting .

" we have to be careful , we have to exercise vigilance , we should not panic , we have to be prepared , " vassiliou said hours after the world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- warned a pandemic was imminent .
her spokeswoman stressed that " we do not have any casualties at the eu level yet " and that all cases so far in europe were " mildly affected and recovering . "
she warned against drawing parallels with the situation in mexico because the state of preparedness was much higher in europe .
vaccine development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fukuda says the who does not need to raise its pandemic alert level " on wednesday , eu health commissioner vassiliou hosted representatives from a number of european pharmaceutical companies in brussels , calling on them to develop a vaccine against the new form of swine flu as fast as possible .
it 's something that we have to coordinate with member states , because the industry has to receive some directions from member states on what they want , " she said as she arrived in luxembourg .

hamburg 's coach says their position is good for the second leg , but bremen is not giving up . hamburg went into the match in bremen 's weser-stadium determined to make up for last week 's disappointment in the german cup semi-final , when bremen beat hamburg on penalties .
and the determination paid off , when , in the 28th minute , hamburg midfielder piotr trochowski headed a guy demel cross into the back of the net – the ball sailing over the outstretched arms of goalkeeper tim wiese .
" even though i am not very tall , i went up wanting to put the ball into the back of the net , " trochowski said afterwards .
hamburg coach martin jol said his team did well in the first half , and said they 're in a good position going into the second leg of the semi-finals .
" we proved that we can overcome a setback like the penalty shoot-out loss … a week ago . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trochowski 's said he 'd been " determined " to make the goal but jol also said his players should have scored again in the second half of thursday 's game .
" bremen are a very dangerous team and they know how to score goals , " he said .
hamburg only has to avoid defeat in next week 's second leg to qualify for the may 20 uefa cup final in istanbul .
bremen still optimistic bremen were certainly more aggressive after half time but – as midfielder torsten frings later lamented – the side just could n't come home with the goods .
" we conceded a stupid goal after a mistake and then failed to make the most of our many chances , " frings said , " but everything is still open for the return leg and nothing is lost . " .
bremen coach thomas schaaf is also still optimistic , despite thursday night 's setback .

now the suspect 's lawyer is pressing charges against the german govenment . the lawyer of the alleged nazi camp guard john demjanjuk has taken legal action against the german government in a bid to prevent the 89-year old 's deportation from the united states , according to spiegel online .
german authorities gave the green light for a munich-based court to issue an arrest warrant for demjanjuk on march 11 .
however , his lawyer argues that german authorities neglected to file an application for demjanjuk 's extradition and also failed to check whether he was fit enough to travel or stand trial .
demjanjuk 's lawyer maintains that his client is too ill to travel , despite a video filed by prosecutors last week which showed the alleged nazi guard walking and talking animatedly .
his lawyer said demjanjuk may be able to walk a few steps unassisted , but that medical evidence showed that arrest , incarceration and a possible trial would cause severe pain .
the us justice department accuses demjanjuk of numerous delaying tactics saying that reasons no longer existed for an emergency stay of deportation .
demjanjuk got an 11th-hour reprieve on april 14 when a federal appeals court in ohio granted the 89-year old 's request for a stay of deportation shortly after he had been carried in a wheelchair out of his home to be taken to a waiting flight .

" in the current state of the situation , we are not yet taking this decision , " french health minister roselyne bachelot said , adding that the plan may be revisited in the future .
previously other countries such as germany and spain had balked at the flight ban proposal , considering it too drastic and having little value , considering the outbreak had already spread to four continents .
european ministers also shot down an italian proposal that member states should set up a " drug bank " of flu remedies and vaccines , saying that it was up to each member state to decide how best to deal with health problems .
" i am very much in favor of the suggestion that every member state is responsible for having a sufficient supply of drugs , " germany 's health minister ulla schmidt said as she arrived at the meeting .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 01.05.2009 experts call eu expansion historic success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebration in prague five years ago on may 1 , 2004 , europe celebrated the enlargement of the eu .
five years later , many europeans do n't feel much like commemorating the historic occasion , even though there are still plenty of reasons to celebrate . the economic data are convincing .
according to figures just released by the german statistical bureau -lrb- destatis -rrb- , the economic output of the ten new member states has grown drastically since they joined the eu five years ago .
the inflation-adjusted gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- of the new members increased by 23 percent until 2008 when compared to 2004 , the year they entered the eu .
slovakia , whose gdp grew by 36 percent topped the list , followed by lithuania and latvia whose output rose by more than 30 percent respectively .
even hungary 's economy , which experienced the weakest increase of all new member states with only ten percent , grew significantly faster than the economies of the 15 older member states which registered eight percent .
the strong economic performance by the new members is not the sole consequence of eu membership .
most eastern european countries had begun to drastically reform and remodel their economies after the collapse of the berlin wall and had recorded strong gdp growth long before joining the eu .
so while eu membership was n't the decisive factor , becoming part of the large european market was a definite boost for the new members .
it not only enabled the new countries to sell their products across europe without any hurdles .
it also forced them to adapt their production and quality standards to compete on the international market .
obviously , the global economic meltdown has n't spared the new member states .
growth rates have slowed in many countries ; some states , such as hungary , face severe difficulties .
still , when judged by economic standards , the eu expansion is a success .
downbeat perception of enlargement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : symbol of the past : border post between germany and poland then why do the feelings of many europeans towards the expansion range somewhere between lukewarm and negative ?
in the latest eurobarometer poll , a regular europe-wide survey measuring public opinion toward the eu , less than half -lrb- 48 percent -rrb- of the participants felt that the expansion made the eu stronger .
36 percent believe that the expansion weakened the bloc .
in some countries , among them germany and france , a majority of those polled holds the view that enlargement weakened the eu .
" i am quite puzzled by these polls , " admits petr drulak , director of the institute of international relations in prague , " but i think it reflects a general feeling about the eu as a whole .
many people are simply tired of the eu and do n't like any news that comes out of brussels , even if there are no objective and tangible reasons for it . "
drulak argues that the most dominant fear of eu enlargement in germany and other countries simply did n't materialize .
" the flooding of the german labor market with eastern european workers never happened because germany protected its labor market . "
and even a country with an unprotected labor market such as britain , says drulak , managed to integrate the workers from eastern europe quite well until the global economic meltdown started to take effect . jonas cicinskas , head of the european studies department at vilnius university in lithuania , blames the deteriorating economic situation for the negative public opinion toward enlargement .
cicinskas believes that the global economic crisis currently overshadows everything and negatively influences how people judge the eu and enlargement .
" many people in the traditional eu donor countries understandably are not in favor of paying money for poorer countries and supporting sectors such as agriculture . "
proof that eu is a viable project despite the trend towards eu scepticism both drulak and cicinskas consider the enlargement of the eu a tremendous achievement .
" i think it is one of the great successes of the european union , " says drulak .
" if i had to give a grade i would give it not just a ' very good , ' but an ' excellent . '
it proved that the eu can absorb many new members and remain a viable project . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factory in budapest producing eu flags the experts also agree that the division between old and new members becomes increasingly irrelevant .
drulak contends that there is not a single political issue where the alleged old europe-new europe divide is still in place today .
" even on russia , this dividing line does n't work anymore , " he says .
" while poland and the baltic states , with some support by the scandinavian countries , are tough on russia , hungary and slovakia tend more towards the more lenient german position on russia . " and cicinskas points out that , economically , the differences between the new countries are growing as well .
he predicts that in the future , sub-regional factors will play a more important role than when a country joined the eu .
eu should remain open for new members as for the never-ending debate about further enlargement , drulak and cicinskas , not surprisingly , are clearly in favor of other nations joining the eu .
" ideally , every european country should be a member of the eu , " says cicinskas .
" but we need to calculate more carefully if we can afford new members financially and we have to reconsider the current regional and structural funds of the eu . "
on a global scale , the eu is still a small player when compared to the us or future powers , such as china and india , argues drulak .
" its openness for new members will make it stronger in the long term .
if a country has the commitment to get through the very difficult and long accession process , then it should be able to become a member of the eu . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 01.05.2009 experts call eu expansion historic success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebration in prague five years ago on may 1 , 2004 , europe celebrated the enlargement of the eu .
five years later , many europeans do n't feel much like commemorating the historic occasion , even though there are still plenty of reasons to celebrate . the economic data are convincing .
according to figures just released by the german statistical bureau -lrb- destatis -rrb- , the economic output of the ten new member states has grown drastically since they joined the eu five years ago .
the inflation-adjusted gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- of the new members increased by 23 percent until 2008 when compared to 2004 , the year they entered the eu .
slovakia , whose gdp grew by 36 percent topped the list , followed by lithuania and latvia whose output rose by more than 30 percent respectively .
even hungary 's economy , which experienced the weakest increase of all new member states with only ten percent , grew significantly faster than the economies of the 15 older member states which registered eight percent .
the strong economic performance by the new members is not the sole consequence of eu membership .
most eastern european countries had begun to drastically reform and remodel their economies after the collapse of the berlin wall and had recorded strong gdp growth long before joining the eu .
so while eu membership was n't the decisive factor , becoming part of the large european market was a definite boost for the new members .
it not only enabled the new countries to sell their products across europe without any hurdles .
it also forced them to adapt their production and quality standards to compete on the international market .
obviously , the global economic meltdown has n't spared the new member states .
growth rates have slowed in many countries ; some states , such as hungary , face severe difficulties .
still , when judged by economic standards , the eu expansion is a success .
downbeat perception of enlargement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : symbol of the past : border post between germany and poland then why do the feelings of many europeans towards the expansion range somewhere between lukewarm and negative ?
in the latest eurobarometer poll , a regular europe-wide survey measuring public opinion toward the eu , less than half -lrb- 48 percent -rrb- of the participants felt that the expansion made the eu stronger .
36 percent believe that the expansion weakened the bloc .
in some countries , among them germany and france , a majority of those polled holds the view that enlargement weakened the eu .
" i am quite puzzled by these polls , " admits petr drulak , director of the institute of international relations in prague , " but i think it reflects a general feeling about the eu as a whole .

drulak argues that the most dominant fear of eu enlargement in germany and other countries simply did n't materialize .
" the flooding of the german labor market with eastern european workers never happened because germany protected its labor market . "
and even a country with an unprotected labor market such as britain , says drulak , managed to integrate the workers from eastern europe quite well until the global economic meltdown started to take effect . jonas cicinskas , head of the european studies department at vilnius university in lithuania , blames the deteriorating economic situation for the negative public opinion toward enlargement .
cicinskas believes that the global economic crisis currently overshadows everything and negatively influences how people judge the eu and enlargement .
" many people in the traditional eu donor countries understandably are not in favor of paying money for poorer countries and supporting sectors such as agriculture . "
proof that eu is a viable project despite the trend towards eu scepticism both drulak and cicinskas consider the enlargement of the eu a tremendous achievement .
" i think it is one of the great successes of the european union , " says drulak .
" if i had to give a grade i would give it not just a ' very good , ' but an ' excellent . '
it proved that the eu can absorb many new members and remain a viable project . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factory in budapest producing eu flags the experts also agree that the division between old and new members becomes increasingly irrelevant .
drulak contends that there is not a single political issue where the alleged old europe-new europe divide is still in place today .

" while poland and the baltic states , with some support by the scandinavian countries , are tough on russia , hungary and slovakia tend more towards the more lenient german position on russia . " and cicinskas points out that , economically , the differences between the new countries are growing as well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home : dw-tv europa on the spot -pipe- 01.05.2009 zvjezdan misimovic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's zvjezdan misimovic has been one of the big revelations of the season .
with five games to go , table-toppers wolfsburg are hot favorites for the title , an accolade the 27-year-old won with bayern in 2003 . dw : what qualities does a great playmaker need ?
zvjezdan misimovic : i think a playmaker always has to be available to take passes .
if the team is in possession of the ball , the playmaker has to help his teammates , setting up the strikers , or working in defense to close down the opposition .
you never have time to rest , you always have to work for the team .
it 's often said the playmaker determines the rhythm of the game .
what does that mean ?
for example , if you 're under pressure you can keep the ball or provoke a foul , simply to break your opponent 's rhythm .
there are other situations you have to read , like when you spot a gap .
you have to be quick and be the one who sets the pace of your team .
which players do you look up to ?
zinedine zidane was my role model in his playing days .
watching him play was a feast for the eyes , the way he controlled the ball .
is his style of play comparable with your own ?
it 's always hard to copy other players .
you have to have your own style and play your own game and not try to replicate another player .
i have a couple of dvds of him and i watch them now and again before games , or when i feel like it .
but you could never copy him and should n't even try .
so you watch dvds before games for inspiration ?
yes , sometimes , to see his movement .
but not before every match .
maybe once a month or once every two months , depending on whether i 'm in the mood .
it seems to work .
misimovic has set up 18 goals this season , more than anyone else .
his sumptuous passes have been converted by grafite and edin dzeko .
the two wolfsburg strikers have scored 38 goals between them , another bundesliga best .
the three players are the most formidable attacking force in the league .
how is it playing with those two ?
it 's loads of fun .
they complement each other very well .
both grafite and edin dzeko move well .
they 're always looking for gaps in the defence and sometimes you just have to play the ball into the space and they 're right there .
edin is the more elegant of the two .
he can do more on the ball and has great control over his body .
and he 's made huge improvements in his heading game .
grafite thrives on his athleticism .
if he has space he 's almost impossible to stop .
both of them know exactly where the goal is and harmonize really well .
you 're often praised for your skills but you 're often criticized for being slow .
is that true ?
i 'm certainly not the fastest player .
i 'm aware of that , but i think there are other players who are n't fast and play at european level or at the highest level of the game .
i think you can compensate a lot if you simply think quicker , if you react quicker .
then maybe you can make up a couple of milliseconds .
how difficult is training under felix magath ?
pre-season training is n't much fun , no doubt about it .
there are n't many people who really enjoy running around or carrying medicine balls .
but it 's part of the process .
that 's the way it is .
how does magath make the team strong ?
i think the coach has a big impact .
he has a concept and he looks for players who fit into that concept .
his track record shows he 's right .
wolfsburg almost got relegated twice .
he came to the club last year and took it straight into the uefa cup .
this season we are well on our way to getting a european spot for next season as well .
last year , wolfsburg were resurgent after the winter break .
it 's the same this year .
why ?
because we are physically fitter and that carries us through the whole season .
five teams are in contention for the bundesliga title , who will win it ?
i think if everything goes as normal bayern munich will win it .
they certainly have the best quality squad , and probably the most experienced as well .
they know how to deal with these kinds of situations .
our goal was n't to be german champions and we 're still a long way from that .
but hand on heart , you 're ahead of bayern , you beat them 5:1 and you 're still not talking about winning the bundesliga ?
the league is so even .
every team is capable of beating every other team .
stuttgart were already written off and now they 're back in contention .
hoffenheim were top before the winter break , now they 're eighth .
things can change very quickly , so we have no need to talk about it yet .
i 've always said if we 're still up there shortly before the end we can aim for the title , but not before then .
how do you feel about the euphoria surrounding wolfsburg ?
it 's nice for the supporters .
when you 're up at the top you 're treated very differently , by the media and by people generally .

with five games to go , table-toppers wolfsburg are hot favorites for the title , an accolade the 27-year-old won with bayern in 2003 . dw : what qualities does a great playmaker need ?
zvjezdan misimovic : i think a playmaker always has to be available to take passes .
if the team is in possession of the ball , the playmaker has to help his teammates , setting up the strikers , or working in defense to close down the opposition .
you never have time to rest , you always have to work for the team .
it 's often said the playmaker determines the rhythm of the game .
what does that mean ?
for example , if you 're under pressure you can keep the ball or provoke a foul , simply to break your opponent 's rhythm .
there are other situations you have to read , like when you spot a gap .
you have to be quick and be the one who sets the pace of your team .
which players do you look up to ?
zinedine zidane was my role model in his playing days .
watching him play was a feast for the eyes , the way he controlled the ball .
is his style of play comparable with your own ?
it 's always hard to copy other players .
you have to have your own style and play your own game and not try to replicate another player .
i have a couple of dvds of him and i watch them now and again before games , or when i feel like it .
but you could never copy him and should n't even try .
so you watch dvds before games for inspiration ?
yes , sometimes , to see his movement .
but not before every match .
maybe once a month or once every two months , depending on whether i 'm in the mood .
it seems to work .
misimovic has set up 18 goals this season , more than anyone else .
his sumptuous passes have been converted by grafite and edin dzeko .
the two wolfsburg strikers have scored 38 goals between them , another bundesliga best .
the three players are the most formidable attacking force in the league .
how is it playing with those two ?
it 's loads of fun .
they complement each other very well .
both grafite and edin dzeko move well .
they 're always looking for gaps in the defence and sometimes you just have to play the ball into the space and they 're right there .
edin is the more elegant of the two .
he can do more on the ball and has great control over his body .
and he 's made huge improvements in his heading game .
grafite thrives on his athleticism .
if he has space he 's almost impossible to stop .
both of them know exactly where the goal is and harmonize really well .
you 're often praised for your skills but you 're often criticized for being slow .
is that true ?
i 'm certainly not the fastest player .
i 'm aware of that , but i think there are other players who are n't fast and play at european level or at the highest level of the game .
i think you can compensate a lot if you simply think quicker , if you react quicker .
then maybe you can make up a couple of milliseconds .
how difficult is training under felix magath ?
pre-season training is n't much fun , no doubt about it .
there are n't many people who really enjoy running around or carrying medicine balls .
but it 's part of the process .
that 's the way it is .
how does magath make the team strong ?
i think the coach has a big impact .
he has a concept and he looks for players who fit into that concept .
his track record shows he 's right .
wolfsburg almost got relegated twice .
he came to the club last year and took it straight into the uefa cup .
this season we are well on our way to getting a european spot for next season as well .
last year , wolfsburg were resurgent after the winter break .
it 's the same this year .
why ?
because we are physically fitter and that carries us through the whole season .
five teams are in contention for the bundesliga title , who will win it ?
i think if everything goes as normal bayern munich will win it .
they certainly have the best quality squad , and probably the most experienced as well .
they know how to deal with these kinds of situations .
our goal was n't to be german champions and we 're still a long way from that .
but hand on heart , you 're ahead of bayern , you beat them 5:1 and you 're still not talking about winning the bundesliga ?
the league is so even .
every team is capable of beating every other team .
stuttgart were already written off and now they 're back in contention .
hoffenheim were top before the winter break , now they 're eighth .
things can change very quickly , so we have no need to talk about it yet .
i 've always said if we 're still up there shortly before the end we can aim for the title , but not before then .
how do you feel about the euphoria surrounding wolfsburg ?
it 's nice for the supporters .
when you 're up at the top you 're treated very differently , by the media and by people generally .
the most important thing is where we are at the end .
of course it 's nice at the moment but we ca n't let it go to our heads .

" the decision overturns an 11th-hour reprieve granted to demjanjuk on april 14 , when a federal appeals court gave the suspect a temporary stay of deportation shortly after immigration officials carried him out of his home in a wheelchair to be taken to a waiting flight . the new decision can , however , be appealed .
spiegel online reports that demjanjuk 's lawyer has already taken legal action against the german government in a bid to prevent his deportation from the united states . german authorities first gave the green light for a munich-based court to issue an arrest warrant for demjanjuk on march 11 . however , his lawyer argues that german officials neglected to file an application for demjanjuk 's extradition and also failed to check whether he was fit enough to travel or stand trial . demjanjuk 's lawyer maintains that his client is too ill to travel , despite a video filed by prosecutors last week which showed the alleged nazi guard walking and talking animatedly . his lawyer said demjanjuk may be able to walk a few steps unassisted , but that medical evidence showed that arrest , incarceration and a possible trial would cause severe pain . the us justice department accuses demjanjuk of numerous delaying tactics , saying that reasons no longer existed for an emergency stay of deportation . demjanjuk is wanted in germany on charges of being an accessory to the deaths of at least 29,000 jews in concentration camps in nazi-occupied poland during world war ii .

babacan 's switch of portfolio was welcomed by markets as a sign that erdogan finally wants to tackle the economic crisis aggressively .

" based on the medical information before the court ... the court can not find that the petitioner 's removal to germany is likely to cause irreparable harm sufficient to warrant a stay of removal , " the judges ruled .
" his motion for a stay of removal pending review is denied . " the decision overturns an 11th-hour reprieve granted to demjanjuk on april 14 , when a federal appeals court gave the suspect a temporary stay of deportation shortly after immigration officials carried him out of his home in a wheelchair to be taken to a waiting flight . the new decision can , however , be appealed .
spiegel online reports that demjanjuk 's lawyer has already taken legal action against the german government in a bid to prevent his deportation from the united states . german authorities first gave the green light for a munich-based court to issue an arrest warrant for demjanjuk on march 11 . however , his lawyer argues that german officials neglected to file an application for demjanjuk 's extradition and also failed to check whether he was fit enough to travel or stand trial . demjanjuk 's lawyer maintains that his client is too ill to travel , despite a video filed by prosecutors last week which showed the alleged nazi guard walking and talking animatedly . his lawyer said demjanjuk may be able to walk a few steps unassisted , but that medical evidence showed that arrest , incarceration and a possible trial would cause severe pain . the us justice department accuses demjanjuk of numerous delaying tactics , saying that reasons no longer existed for an emergency stay of deportation . demjanjuk is wanted in germany on charges of being an accessory to the deaths of at least 29,000 jews in concentration camps in nazi-occupied poland during world war ii .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 01.05.2009 experts call eu expansion historic success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebration in prague five years ago on may 1 , 2004 , europe celebrated the enlargement of the eu .
five years later , many europeans do n't feel much like commemorating the historic occasion , even though there are still plenty of reasons to celebrate . the economic data are convincing .
according to figures just released by the german statistical bureau -lrb- destatis -rrb- , the economic output of the ten new member states has grown drastically since they joined the eu five years ago .
the inflation-adjusted gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- of the new members increased by 23 percent until 2008 when compared to 2004 , the year they entered the eu .
slovakia , whose gdp grew by 36 percent topped the list , followed by lithuania and latvia whose output rose by more than 30 percent respectively .
even hungary 's economy , which experienced the weakest increase of all new member states with only ten percent , grew significantly faster than the economies of the 15 older member states which registered eight percent .
the strong economic performance by the new members is not the sole consequence of eu membership .
most eastern european countries had begun to drastically reform and remodel their economies after the collapse of the berlin wall and had recorded strong gdp growth long before joining the eu .
so while eu membership was n't the decisive factor , becoming part of the large european market was a definite boost for the new members .
it not only enabled the new countries to sell their products across europe without any hurdles .
it also forced them to adapt their production and quality standards to compete on the international market .
obviously , the global economic meltdown has n't spared the new member states .
growth rates have slowed in many countries ; some states , such as hungary , face severe difficulties .
still , when judged by economic standards , the eu expansion is a success .
downbeat perception of enlargement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : symbol of the past : border post between germany and poland then why do the feelings of many europeans towards the expansion range somewhere between lukewarm and negative ?
in the latest eurobarometer poll , a regular europe-wide survey measuring public opinion toward the eu , less than half -lrb- 48 percent -rrb- of the participants felt that the expansion made the eu stronger .
36 percent believe that the expansion weakened the bloc .
in some countries , among them germany and france , a majority of those polled holds the view that enlargement weakened the eu .
" i am quite puzzled by these polls , " admits petr drulak , director of the institute of international relations in prague , " but i think it reflects a general feeling about the eu as a whole .
many people are simply tired of the eu and do n't like any news that comes out of brussels , even if there are no objective and tangible reasons for it . "
drulak argues that the most dominant fear of eu enlargement in germany and other countries simply did n't materialize .
" the flooding of the german labor market with eastern european workers never happened because germany protected its labor market . "
and even a country with an unprotected labor market such as britain , says drulak , managed to integrate the workers from eastern europe quite well until the global economic meltdown started to take effect . jonas cicinskas , head of the european studies department at vilnius university in lithuania , blames the deteriorating economic situation for the negative public opinion toward enlargement .
cicinskas believes that the global economic crisis currently overshadows everything and negatively influences how people judge the eu and enlargement .
" many people in the traditional eu donor countries understandably are not in favor of paying money for poorer countries and supporting sectors such as agriculture . "
proof that eu is a viable project despite the trend towards eu scepticism both drulak and cicinskas consider the enlargement of the eu a tremendous achievement .
" i think it is one of the great successes of the european union , " says drulak .
" if i had to give a grade i would give it not just a ' very good , ' but an ' excellent . '
it proved that the eu can absorb many new members and remain a viable project . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factory in budapest producing eu flags the experts also agree that the division between old and new members becomes increasingly irrelevant .
drulak contends that there is not a single political issue where the alleged old europe-new europe divide is still in place today .
" even on russia , this dividing line does n't work anymore , " he says .
" while poland and the baltic states , with some support by the scandinavian countries , are tough on russia , hungary and slovakia tend more towards the more lenient german position on russia . " and cicinskas points out that , economically , the differences between the new countries are growing as well .
he predicts that in the future , sub-regional factors will play a more important role than when a country joined the eu .
eu should remain open for new members as for the never-ending debate about further enlargement , drulak and cicinskas , not surprisingly , are clearly in favor of other nations joining the eu .
" ideally , every european country should be a member of the eu , " says cicinskas .
" but we need to calculate more carefully if we can afford new members financially and we have to reconsider the current regional and structural funds of the eu . "
on a global scale , the eu is still a small player when compared to the us or future powers , such as china and india , argues drulak .
" its openness for new members will make it stronger in the long term .
if a country has the commitment to get through the very difficult and long accession process , then it should be able to become a member of the eu . "

his lips moved slowly , trying to stretch against his inflexible , badly scarred skin , and bandages covered his eyes .
but the voice that came out of his disfigured face was loud and cheerful and it filled the hospital room .
" i want to go back to iraq , i miss my dad , " hussein said .
six years ago , when hussein was 11 months old , his grandmother took him along to a market near their house in baghdad .
that day the market was ripped apart by a car bomb explosion , hours later hussein was found , badly injured , next to his grandmother 's body .
after several failed operations , his family became certain that he 'd stay disfigured for the rest of his life .
what we do is not available in iraq not because of the lack of skill , but lack of resources and security anonymous , surgeon but a few months ago his mother heard about a free clinic in jordan where doctors could restore the damaged tissue on hussein 's head .
it was only on the operating table in amman , as hussein was put under anaesthetic , that surgeons discovered that something else was wrong - the boy could not close his eyes .
" because his skin is so stretched , he could not shut his eyes .
that is very dangerous and could lead to blindness .
so we operated on his eyes instead , " hussein 's doctor says .
dr nagham hussein , who is iraqi herself , says she is not surprised that despite multiple surgeries no-one in baghdad noticed hussein 's serious chronic condition .
" doctors in iraq are too busy saving lives .
this kind of surgery is a luxury , " she says .
medical exodus tens and possibly hundreds of thousands of people are estimated to have died in iraq in the recent years of war and violence , and many more have been injured .
the operations may not be as dramatic as on tv , but indirectly they save lives those injuries from explosions and car bombs often cause long lasting damage and demand subsequent treatment .
but it 's not available in iraq .
the un estimates that more than 400 specialised doctors have left iraq since hostilities began in 2003 , hundreds of others have been killed .
understaffed hospitals lack staff , basic infrastructure and security .
since 2006 , a team of iraqi surgeons in amman have been trying to finish the work started by their colleagues in iraq .
the reconstructive surgery programme is funded jointly by the non-governmental organisation medecins sans frontieres -lrb- msf -rrb- and the red crescent of jordan .
" what we do is not available in iraq not because of the lack of skill , but lack of resources and security , " says the programme 's head surgeon .
" the doctors in iraq are the real heroes , we are just picking up the pieces , we are completing their work , " he says .
the surgeon does not want to be named , for fear that doing even this kind of work under the umbrella of a western organisation could put his relatives in iraq in danger .
also , as a result of security concerns the programme does not have a representative in iraq .
instead it relies on an undercover network of doctors in iraqi hospitals , who refer patients to amman .
lurking dangers over the last two years , 660 people went through the clinic , currently another 100 are on a waiting list back in iraq .
i want to be a doctor when i grow up so that i can have a lot of money and buy chicken and fruit any time i want hussein " word of mouth has made us relatively well known in iraq .
but there is a great deal of demand , and unfortunately we are probably not reaching people in rural areas who badly need the procedures we offer , " the head surgeon says .
these procedures are sophisticated and surgeries often last many hours .
" these may not be tv-style emergency operations , but indirectly we are saving lives , " says dr annick antierens , msf medical director at the amman project .
" some of our patients can not have a life because they are so handicapped , others can not eat because their face is so disfigured .
and without these surgeries many can and will die . "
in one of the clinic 's two operating theatres , a heart monitor beeps steadily as a surgeon leans over a young man and cuts open his face .
across from him another doctor cuts into the patient 's leg .
" they are taking bone from his hip and using it to reconstruct his face , " the nurse explains in whisper .
downstairs , back in his hospital room , hussein and three other children are recovering from their surgery .
the three girls are too ill and too weak to speak but hussein chats away .
" i want to be a doctor when i grow up so that i can have a lot of money and buy chicken and fruit any time i want , " he says .
hussein still needs another operation - a tissue transplant on his head .
eventually , once his bandages are off , he will be sent home .
but the iraq that he will be going back to is still violent , and dangerous and his hospital bed wo n't stay empty for long .

" i want to go back to iraq , i miss my dad , " hussein said .
six years ago , when hussein was 11 months old , his grandmother took him along to a market near their house in baghdad .
that day the market was ripped apart by a car bomb explosion , hours later hussein was found , badly injured , next to his grandmother 's body .
after several failed operations , his family became certain that he 'd stay disfigured for the rest of his life .
what we do is not available in iraq not because of the lack of skill , but lack of resources and security anonymous , surgeon but a few months ago his mother heard about a free clinic in jordan where doctors could restore the damaged tissue on hussein 's head .
it was only on the operating table in amman , as hussein was put under anaesthetic , that surgeons discovered that something else was wrong - the boy could not close his eyes .
" because his skin is so stretched , he could not shut his eyes .
that is very dangerous and could lead to blindness .
so we operated on his eyes instead , " hussein 's doctor says .
dr nagham hussein , who is iraqi herself , says she is not surprised that despite multiple surgeries no-one in baghdad noticed hussein 's serious chronic condition .
" doctors in iraq are too busy saving lives .
this kind of surgery is a luxury , " she says .
medical exodus tens and possibly hundreds of thousands of people are estimated to have died in iraq in the recent years of war and violence , and many more have been injured .
the operations may not be as dramatic as on tv , but indirectly they save lives those injuries from explosions and car bombs often cause long lasting damage and demand subsequent treatment .
but it 's not available in iraq .
the un estimates that more than 400 specialised doctors have left iraq since hostilities began in 2003 , hundreds of others have been killed .
understaffed hospitals lack staff , basic infrastructure and security .
since 2006 , a team of iraqi surgeons in amman have been trying to finish the work started by their colleagues in iraq .
the reconstructive surgery programme is funded jointly by the non-governmental organisation medecins sans frontieres -lrb- msf -rrb- and the red crescent of jordan .
" what we do is not available in iraq not because of the lack of skill , but lack of resources and security , " says the programme 's head surgeon .
" the doctors in iraq are the real heroes , we are just picking up the pieces , we are completing their work , " he says .
the surgeon does not want to be named , for fear that doing even this kind of work under the umbrella of a western organisation could put his relatives in iraq in danger .
also , as a result of security concerns the programme does not have a representative in iraq .
instead it relies on an undercover network of doctors in iraqi hospitals , who refer patients to amman .
lurking dangers over the last two years , 660 people went through the clinic , currently another 100 are on a waiting list back in iraq .
i want to be a doctor when i grow up so that i can have a lot of money and buy chicken and fruit any time i want hussein " word of mouth has made us relatively well known in iraq .
but there is a great deal of demand , and unfortunately we are probably not reaching people in rural areas who badly need the procedures we offer , " the head surgeon says .
these procedures are sophisticated and surgeries often last many hours .
" these may not be tv-style emergency operations , but indirectly we are saving lives , " says dr annick antierens , msf medical director at the amman project .
" some of our patients can not have a life because they are so handicapped , others can not eat because their face is so disfigured .
and without these surgeries many can and will die . "
in one of the clinic 's two operating theatres , a heart monitor beeps steadily as a surgeon leans over a young man and cuts open his face .
across from him another doctor cuts into the patient 's leg .
" they are taking bone from his hip and using it to reconstruct his face , " the nurse explains in whisper .
downstairs , back in his hospital room , hussein and three other children are recovering from their surgery .
the three girls are too ill and too weak to speak but hussein chats away .
" i want to be a doctor when i grow up so that i can have a lot of money and buy chicken and fruit any time i want , " he says .
hussein still needs another operation - a tissue transplant on his head .
eventually , once his bandages are off , he will be sent home .
but the iraq that he will be going back to is still violent , and dangerous and his hospital bed wo n't stay empty for long .

his lips moved slowly , trying to stretch against his inflexible , badly scarred skin , and bandages covered his eyes .
but the voice that came out of his disfigured face was loud and cheerful and it filled the hospital room .
" i want to go back to iraq , i miss my dad , " hussein said .
six years ago , when hussein was 11 months old , his grandmother took him along to a market near their house in baghdad .
that day the market was ripped apart by a car bomb explosion , hours later hussein was found , badly injured , next to his grandmother 's body .
after several failed operations , his family became certain that he 'd stay disfigured for the rest of his life .
what we do is not available in iraq not because of the lack of skill , but lack of resources and security anonymous , surgeon but a few months ago his mother heard about a free clinic in jordan where doctors could restore the damaged tissue on hussein 's head .
it was only on the operating table in amman , as hussein was put under anaesthetic , that surgeons discovered that something else was wrong - the boy could not close his eyes .
" because his skin is so stretched , he could not shut his eyes .
that is very dangerous and could lead to blindness .
so we operated on his eyes instead , " hussein 's doctor says .
dr nagham hussein , who is iraqi herself , says she is not surprised that despite multiple surgeries no-one in baghdad noticed hussein 's serious chronic condition .
" doctors in iraq are too busy saving lives .
this kind of surgery is a luxury , " she says .
medical exodus tens and possibly hundreds of thousands of people are estimated to have died in iraq in the recent years of war and violence , and many more have been injured .
the operations may not be as dramatic as on tv , but indirectly they save lives those injuries from explosions and car bombs often cause long lasting damage and demand subsequent treatment .
but it 's not available in iraq .
the un estimates that more than 400 specialised doctors have left iraq since hostilities began in 2003 , hundreds of others have been killed .
understaffed hospitals lack staff , basic infrastructure and security .
since 2006 , a team of iraqi surgeons in amman have been trying to finish the work started by their colleagues in iraq .
the reconstructive surgery programme is funded jointly by the non-governmental organisation medecins sans frontieres -lrb- msf -rrb- and the red crescent of jordan .
" what we do is not available in iraq not because of the lack of skill , but lack of resources and security , " says the programme 's head surgeon .
" the doctors in iraq are the real heroes , we are just picking up the pieces , we are completing their work , " he says .
the surgeon does not want to be named , for fear that doing even this kind of work under the umbrella of a western organisation could put his relatives in iraq in danger .
also , as a result of security concerns the programme does not have a representative in iraq .
instead it relies on an undercover network of doctors in iraqi hospitals , who refer patients to amman .
lurking dangers over the last two years , 660 people went through the clinic , currently another 100 are on a waiting list back in iraq .
i want to be a doctor when i grow up so that i can have a lot of money and buy chicken and fruit any time i want hussein " word of mouth has made us relatively well known in iraq .
but there is a great deal of demand , and unfortunately we are probably not reaching people in rural areas who badly need the procedures we offer , " the head surgeon says .
these procedures are sophisticated and surgeries often last many hours .
" these may not be tv-style emergency operations , but indirectly we are saving lives , " says dr annick antierens , msf medical director at the amman project .
" some of our patients can not have a life because they are so handicapped , others can not eat because their face is so disfigured .
and without these surgeries many can and will die . "
in one of the clinic 's two operating theatres , a heart monitor beeps steadily as a surgeon leans over a young man and cuts open his face .
across from him another doctor cuts into the patient 's leg .
" they are taking bone from his hip and using it to reconstruct his face , " the nurse explains in whisper .
downstairs , back in his hospital room , hussein and three other children are recovering from their surgery .
the three girls are too ill and too weak to speak but hussein chats away .
" i want to be a doctor when i grow up so that i can have a lot of money and buy chicken and fruit any time i want , " he says .
hussein still needs another operation - a tissue transplant on his head .
eventually , once his bandages are off , he will be sent home .
but the iraq that he will be going back to is still violent , and dangerous and his hospital bed wo n't stay empty for long .
