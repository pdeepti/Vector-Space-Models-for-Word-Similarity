program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 30.03.2009 germany to increase training role in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will increase its training of afghan police germany says it is ready to meet us president obama 's request for more resources in afghanistan , by stepping up its training of local police and security forces .
but the issue of more troops remains off the table . the concession , which again fell short of fulfilling requests for more troops – and in germany 's case , combat troops , comes ahead of a 60th anniversary nato summit this week where allied contributions to the conflict in afghanistan will once more be a hot topic .
" we want to make this mission a success and that means giving afghanistan the means to take care of its own security , " chancellor angela merkel said in her weekly video podcast .
" in particular , it means that we must do more qualitatively in the training of soldiers and police .
germany is ready to do its duty . "
merkel , who faces an election in six months time , has already told president barack obama - who will attend the nato summit hosted by germany and france - that berlin will not increase the number of combat troops it can send to afghanistan .
germany has also resisted pressure from allies to send its troops to the more dangerous southern areas of the country , where allied forces are battling a taliban insurgency .
germany has 3,800 troops engaged in training and reconstruction programs in the north of the country .
it can push that number as high as 4,500 , based on a parliamentary mandate approved last year and has pledged extra troops ahead of the august elections , as part of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- but stands firm on involving its troops in any military action .
obama not expected to push for troops at summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants more commitment in the fight against the taliban unveiling his new afghanistan strategy last friday , obama said the united states would continue to seek contributions from allies for combat forces , trainers and mentors , strategic lift and equipment , although he is not expected to ask for an increased troop commitment at this week 's nato summit .
deputy foreign minister gernot erler told german radio that germany welcomed obama 's focus on more training and would be ready to step up its efforts in this area .
" i think we will be ready in germany to think about a stronger contribution in the area of training , " he said .
nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer urged european countries to step up their efforts in afghanistan as the defense organization prepared for its landmark summit .
" it 's not acceptable that only the united states strengthens its engagement , " he told the sunday edition of germany 's bild newspaper .
" the europeans must do more too , whether its in the military or civilian area . "
new calls for europeans to pitch in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jones reiterated calls for more european involvement us security advisor james jones reiterated washington 's expectations in a newspaper interview published in the german daily tagesspiegel on sunday , echoing the nato chief 's calls for its european allies in nato to supplement their troop presence in afghanistan , at least during the country 's august election period .
" whether these troops stay longer or head home straight after the elections , is another matter , " jones said in the interview published sunday .
the former general said that even if president obama did not directly call for increased efforts at the nato conference , it did not mean that the us was letting anyone off the hook .
" from the fact that the usa has not made public detailed demands to its allies , one can not deduce that the request does not exist , " jones said .
" every nation is free in its decision . "
the security advisor further emphasized the importance of civil assistance projects provided by allied forces in afghanistan .
" the time has passed , in which the quality of the relationship is measured by the number of soldiers , " jones said , adding that military might alone " does not suffice in the conflicts we are now dealing with . "
in afghanistan , for example , a lot could be learned from the german contribution , he said , adding that germany had done a great deal to train the afghan police forces . nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 encompassed 47 concrete measures that range from a better global financial regulatory body to new rules for executive compensation . the majority of the items agreed on at the historic meeting in the us capital were supposed to be implemented by the end of march .
in the meantime , a proper sideline in " summit tourism " has emerged . whether in the european union , the united nations or the southeast asian association of nations -lrb- asean -rrb- , everyone has been searching for an answer to the question : what should the international financial architecture of the future look like ? german chancellor angela merkel laid out her criteria at a meeting of leading european industrial nations in berlin at the end of february . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has insisted all markets and financial products be regulated " we all accept that all the financial markets , -lrb- financial -rrb- products and -lrb- market -rrb- participants - including hedge funds , including ratings agencies and other private bidders - should be subject to a supervisory and regulatory body , " merkel said .
" the necessary details of this must be worked out and included as part of the action plan . " the head of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet , put it more succinctly . " everything has to change , " he said , adding that the current crisis has shown that the entire system is too vulnerable and not resistant enough . transparency , accountability the core points of the action plan are meant to address this problem with improved transparency and more accountability on the financial markets , as well as better control and regulation of these markets . authorities will , for the first time , be able to impose minimum limits for capital and liquidity on hedge funds in the countries where the funds are active , not where they have their headquarters .
such measures aim to stop these funds from fleeing to unregulated havens such as the cayman islands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regulation or stimulus will be a major issue at the g20 summit these are bitter pills to swallow for british and american fund operators .
in the past , they used to just smile lightly when others warned of the dangers of unbridled capitalism .
but now there 's little doubt that leaders such as new us treasury secretary timothy geithner mean business . " such risks know no national borders , " geithner said .
" we have to keep a much stricter eye on things and pass clear rules of play for the international financial system .
comprehensive changes on both the national and international level will demand it . " germany introduces " risk map " germany has introduced what it calls a " risk map " to the international proceedings .
it is designed to reflect the situation of all market participants and financial products , and if need be , signal an alarm . the map will be complemented by a global credit register of all loans above a certain size .
officials have admitted that it will be a tough task to gather all the data needed , but leaders hope such a measure will bring them further down the road to a new order for the global financial system . merkel has said she is convinced that important steps will be taken at the g20 summit in london .
following bilateral talks with british prime minister gordon brown in mid-march , she said she was optimistic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis has affected the entire world " with the united states , and with emerging economies like china and india -lrb- involved -rrb- , we 'll achieve results that will ensure that , with regulation , with supervision , such a crisis can not repeat itself , " merkel said . the litmus test of such big words , however , will be in the details .
accountability , equity monitoring , the international cooperation of supervisory bodies - to achieve these things , the experts must first do much highly complex detail work that then has to be implemented and coordinated on the national and international level . the heads of state gathering in london will surely not be at a loss for words to describe their common purpose .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 30.03.2009 opel workers welcome gm management shake-up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : changes at gm could have a major impact on opel employees at general motors ' subsidiary opel have welcomed the dismissal of the us company 's chief executive officer rick wagoner as an important step towards securing the troubled german carmaker 's future . klaus franz , the top employee representative at opel , said he was surprised that wagoner was not relieved of his post earlier . " rick wagoner stands for an imploded centralist system , " he said on tuesday , march 30 , calling the former ceo a symbol of grave mismanagement . franz said he looked forward to working with wagoner 's temporary replacement , gm president and chief operating officer fritz henderson , because he had significant experience with gm 's european units . henderson led a restructuring push at opel from mid-2004 through to the end of 2005 , cutting around 10,000 jobs and making the firm profitable for the first time in nearly five years . new strategies ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm ceo rick wagoner is stepping down at washington 's request other labor leaders , however , have said that while the management changeover is long overdue , it does not present a clear solution to the company 's problems since henderson 's plans for the future remain unclear . " we do n't know what concepts general motors ' new management team is likely to pursue , " said rainer einenkel , the head of the works council at opel 's bochum factory .
" what we do know is that if gm ca n't find a reasonable solution , then its regional subsidiaries in europe , including opel , will suffer .
if general motors fails and goes bankrupt , it will drag opel down with it . " for months opel managers have been looking to the german government for assistance aimed at preventing insolvency .
but fears that bail-out funds could be funneled away from opel to gm have left politicians unwilling to give the company , which employs some 26,000 people in germany , the support it provided to the financial industry . german chancellor angela merkel is due to visit opel headquarters in ruesselsheim on tuesday , but analysts have said it is unlikely she will announce any concrete plans for the company as long as the future of its us parent remains unclear . auto task force wagoner 's dismissal was ordered by an auto industry task force appointed by us president barack obama . a report published by the task force on monday rejected general motors ' request for up to $ 16 billion -lrb- 12.2 billion euros -rrb- in loans . it said gm had already received $ 13.5 billion of aid , and that the obama administration would only continue to fund the company for the next 60 days to allow management to develop a recovery plan . obama said if the restructuring efforts do not go far enough , he would have no choice but allow gm to fail and use bankruptcy laws to force the company 's reorganization . " the united states has no interest in running gm , " the president said .
" what we are interested in is giving gm an opportunity to finally make those much-needed changes that will let them emerge from this crisis a much stronger and more competitive company . " chrysler merger obama told the american auto industry 's other problem child , chrysler , that its situation was even worse . he gave its managers emergency funding for just 30 more days , telling them they must finalize a merger deal with italian carmaker fiat , or another suitable partner , or they would be left to fail . obama 's warning may have been harsh , but it appears to have been effective .
chrysler and fiat announced they had agreed on a framework for an alliance within 90 minutes of the president 's speech . sje / sh / sms / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not because of its wide wingspan or its ability to fly for incredible distances without a break but because it may become the aircraft tied around the neck of manufacturer airbus as it sinks towards the murky depths .
the error-ridden and maligned military transporter project has prompted discussion , argument and consternation for some time among potential customers and the manufacturers themselves .
but no comments could prove as damaging as those recently uttered by thomas enders , the boss of airbus .
enders revealed in an interview with der spiegel news magazine that he believed that , under its original conditions and plans , the a400m could not be built and that the seemingly doomed nature of the project had much to do with huge errors within his own company .
the a400m has been plagued by setbacks , with the aircraft 's first flight postponed to a date that has yet to be determined because of engine problems .
a never-ending nightmare ?
" under the previous conditions we can not build the airplane , " admitted enders .
" but , better an end with a fright than a fright with no end . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders hopes that the worst will soon be over while the " end with a fright " may mean that after realizing that the current plans need to be scrapped thus sending the a400m back to the drawing board , the " fright with no end " - a continuing nightmare which ends with the death of the whole project - may not be as unavoidable as some may think .
enders himself admitted that he has considered the ultimate failure of the project and while a new plan is taking shape as to how to progress with the a400m , the prospect of current orders for the problem-plagued plane being cancelled is a real possibility .
german deputy defense minister ruediger wolf said only last week that cancelling orders on the military transport plane was a serious option .
" i have been waiting to hear about the problems with the a400m but until today we have no detailed information about what they are and whether these are solvable , " criticized wolf .
wolf told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that to bring pressure on airbus ' parent company the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- , " cancellation must be a serious option after a delay of three to six months . "
wolf , who was quoted indirectly by sueddeutsche zeitung , said it was more realistic to extend to six months a moratorium accorded to eads to get the program back on track .
customers considering cutting , reducing orders countries that have ordered the plane - belgium , britain , france , germany , luxembourg , spain and turkey - have suggested delaying from april 1 to july 1 the date on which they can begin to cancel contracts .
french defense official laurent collet-billon told reporters last week that paris might reduce the number of planes it has ordered .
france has signed on for 50 aircraft , while germany has ordered 60 .
eads was supposed to get the transport plane in the air for an inaugural flight in january 2008 , and the seven countries await a total of 180 a400ms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a400m is built but can not get off the ground deliveries had originally been scheduled to begin in 2009 , but the first delivery is now planned for 2012 and it is only in 2014 that eads will be able to deliver significant numbers of the aircraft to clients , according to reports .
meanwhile , mtu aero engines , the german engine maker at the centre of the row over the delays said on monday it was confident problems on the a400m would be resolved but declined to say when the plane would fly .

" i have made an offer to terminate my contract with the supervisory board chairman , " mehdorn said monday , march 30 , at a press conference to announce deutsche bahn 's annual financial results .
" i assume that a successor will be appointed before the summer holidays " begin in july . mehdorn , who has run the state-owned firm since 1999 , has been under increasing pressure ever since it was revealed earlier this year that deutsche bahn accessed confidential staff data as far back as 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn has come under heavy criticism for taking a closer look at its employees mehdorn admitted in february that , as part of an anti-corruption campaign , deutsche bahn spied on 173,000 of its 220,000 employees in 2002 and 2003 .
official documents have since shown deutsche bahn screened its entire workforce again in 2005 for corruption . in total , the records show that almost all railway employees would have been checked three times , and around 800 top managers would have been scrutinized twice . the german government said it had " taken note " of mehdorn 's offer to quit and praised his role in turning deutsche bahn into a " world-leading transport and logistics company . " " the financial success of recent years and the securing of 220,000 jobs are clearly linked to the high level of mehdorn 's personal engagement and corporate know-how , " the government said in a statement . as recently as friday it was reported that deutsche bahn had also monitored the e-mails of staff to check whether they had contacted journalists or parliamentarians in a bid to find employees critical of the company 's policies . over the weekend , the company was forced to admit that it deleted a 2007 e-mail calling for strike action that was sent by train drivers union gdl to thousands of employees . in an interview with the german sunday newspaper welt am sonntag , german chancellor angela merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm denied a report that the chancellor was keen to keep mehdorn in his post until an independent report on the snooping scandal was completed in may , adding that the issue could not be allowed to drag on for weeks . this , and a statement from an unnamed source who told reuters that berlin was " putting out feelers " for a potential successor , suggested that mehdorn was living on borrowed time . german politicians call time on mehdorn 's reign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these have been dark days for mehdorn and deutsche bahn a chorus of german politicians joining together to criticize the bahn chief added to the sense that mehdorn 's refusal to resign would become a mute point in the coming days . " i do not believe that hartmut mehdorn can remain on as the boss of deutsche bahn , " said transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , a member of the the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
" my impression is that parliament and the federal government does not take him seriously and is beginning to understand the criticism . " " the man must go , " said berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit , while his social democrat colleague and vice president of the party 's bundestag group klaas huebner told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , " any politician who found themselves in the same position could no longer stay in their post . " merkel " must finally terminate -lrb- mehdorn 's -rrb- untenable position with the bahn , " said dietmar bartsch from the left party while greens party leader claudia roth said " bahn boss mehdorn can not stay a day longer . " others , however , were still loath to pass judgment until the full case against mehdorn is heard .
finance minister peer steinbrueck -lrb- spd -rrb- told german tv that he would " wait to see all the evidence before forming an opinion , let alone issuing a condemnation . " economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said it was n't up to politicians to determine mehdorn 's immediate fate . " it is reasonable to wait for the investigation and then to let those who have to decide make the decision , " said the minister , who is a member of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union .
" that is the job of the supervisory board . " mehdorn clings on to past glories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bidding farewell : mehdorn is stepping down mehdorn 's fall from grace has been spectacular for a man credited with turning deutsche bahn into a profitable global transport leader over the past decade . but he has been dogged by the revelations that his company spied on employees and has recently come under heavy criticism for his perceived arrogance in the affair , resisting calls to step down and maintaining that the company did not break the law . " under my leadership , -lrb- deutsche -rrb- bahn is in good shape despite the serious economic and financial crisis , " mehdorn told the sunday edition of germany 's bild newspaper , when asked why he had not resigned .
" our results are good and we are not laying off any workers in the crisis . " until now , mehdorn has enjoyed the support of the chancellor , who has stood by him in past confrontations and has sided with him on occasional battles with germany 's powerful transport unions . mehdorn 's decision to offer his resignation now relieves merkel of a burden which may have threatened her campaign in parliamentary elections scheduled for september . nda / sms / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in my opinion , it is necessary to stay in afghanistan for the foreseeable future , " de hoop scheffer said , adding that he had so far seen " positive reactions " to a new strategy unveiled by obama last week . the obama plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama will consult with allies about his plan when he comes to europe this week obama 's plan , which has no set timetable for withdrawal , is to send 4,000 us troops to train afghan security forces to fight militants in the country . these forces would be in addition to an earlier announced reinforcement of 17,000 extra us troops to bolster the war effort .
the united states would then have 55,000 troops stationed in afghanistan - 23,000 more than those supplied by the remaining nato members and other countries involved in military operations . obama will be consulting with allies on his plan when heads of state and government of nato members gather in the french city of strasbourg and in the german town of baden-baden on april 3 and 4 to celebrate the alliance 's 60th birthday . financing the war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has almost 3,500 troops stationed in afghanistan de hoop scheffer confirmed that he would call on the international community to contribute $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.5 billion euros -rrb- a year to train afghanistan 's security forces . he acknowledged that this was a lot of money , but said that it should be seen in relation to the informal estimate of roughly $ 42 billion the war is costing nato and its allies . " the allies need to do their part , " he said .
" i would not like to see a mission that is out of balance in this regard . " de hoop scheffer explained that while the obama administration has indicated it wo n't be continuing its predecessor 's policy of pressuring often reluctant allies to supply more troops , european capitals would nonetheless face calls to contribute in other ways , for example with reconstruction or in the civilian training effort . senior officials from around the world , including us secretary of state hillary clinton , un secretary-general ban ki-moon and afghan president hamid karzai , will join de hoop scheffer at the donor conference . additionally , the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , the european union , asian development bank , international monetary fund and world bank are sending delegates . mrm / sh / sms / ap / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the error-ridden and maligned military transporter project has prompted discussion , argument and consternation for some time among potential customers and the manufacturers themselves .
but no comments could prove as damaging as those recently uttered by thomas enders , the boss of airbus .
enders revealed in an interview with der spiegel news magazine that he believed that , under its original conditions and plans , the a400m could not be built and that the seemingly doomed nature of the project had much to do with huge errors within his own company .
the a400m has been plagued by setbacks , with the aircraft 's first flight postponed to a date that has yet to be determined because of engine problems .

" under the previous conditions we can not build the airplane , " admitted enders .

enders himself admitted that he has considered the ultimate failure of the project and while a new plan is taking shape as to how to progress with the a400m , the prospect of current orders for the problem-plagued plane being cancelled is a real possibility .
german deputy defense minister ruediger wolf said only last week that cancelling orders on the military transport plane was a serious option .
" i have been waiting to hear about the problems with the a400m but until today we have no detailed information about what they are and whether these are solvable , " criticized wolf .
wolf told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that to bring pressure on airbus ' parent company the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- , " cancellation must be a serious option after a delay of three to six months . "
wolf , who was quoted indirectly by sueddeutsche zeitung , said it was more realistic to extend to six months a moratorium accorded to eads to get the program back on track .

" i have made an offer to terminate my contract with the supervisory board chairman , " mehdorn said monday , march 30 , at a press conference to announce deutsche bahn 's annual financial results .
" i assume that a successor will be appointed before the summer holidays " begin in july . mehdorn , who has run the state-owned firm since 1999 , has been under increasing pressure ever since it was revealed earlier this year that deutsche bahn accessed confidential staff data as far back as 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn has come under heavy criticism for taking a closer look at its employees mehdorn admitted in february that , as part of an anti-corruption campaign , deutsche bahn spied on 173,000 of its 220,000 employees in 2002 and 2003 .
official documents have since shown deutsche bahn screened its entire workforce again in 2005 for corruption . in total , the records show that almost all railway employees would have been checked three times , and around 800 top managers would have been scrutinized twice . the german government said it had " taken note " of mehdorn 's offer to quit and praised his role in turning deutsche bahn into a " world-leading transport and logistics company . " " the financial success of recent years and the securing of 220,000 jobs are clearly linked to the high level of mehdorn 's personal engagement and corporate know-how , " the government said in a statement . as recently as friday it was reported that deutsche bahn had also monitored the e-mails of staff to check whether they had contacted journalists or parliamentarians in a bid to find employees critical of the company 's policies . over the weekend , the company was forced to admit that it deleted a 2007 e-mail calling for strike action that was sent by train drivers union gdl to thousands of employees . in an interview with the german sunday newspaper welt am sonntag , german chancellor angela merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm denied a report that the chancellor was keen to keep mehdorn in his post until an independent report on the snooping scandal was completed in may , adding that the issue could not be allowed to drag on for weeks . this , and a statement from an unnamed source who told reuters that berlin was " putting out feelers " for a potential successor , suggested that mehdorn was living on borrowed time . german politicians call time on mehdorn 's reign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these have been dark days for mehdorn and deutsche bahn a chorus of german politicians joining together to criticize the bahn chief added to the sense that mehdorn 's refusal to resign would become a mute point in the coming days . " i do not believe that hartmut mehdorn can remain on as the boss of deutsche bahn , " said transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , a member of the the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
" my impression is that parliament and the federal government does not take him seriously and is beginning to understand the criticism . " " the man must go , " said berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit , while his social democrat colleague and vice president of the party 's bundestag group klaas huebner told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , " any politician who found themselves in the same position could no longer stay in their post . " merkel " must finally terminate -lrb- mehdorn 's -rrb- untenable position with the bahn , " said dietmar bartsch from the left party while greens party leader claudia roth said " bahn boss mehdorn can not stay a day longer . " others , however , were still loath to pass judgment until the full case against mehdorn is heard .
finance minister peer steinbrueck -lrb- spd -rrb- told german tv that he would " wait to see all the evidence before forming an opinion , let alone issuing a condemnation . " economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said it was n't up to politicians to determine mehdorn 's immediate fate . " it is reasonable to wait for the investigation and then to let those who have to decide make the decision , " said the minister , who is a member of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union .
" that is the job of the supervisory board . " mehdorn clings on to past glories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bidding farewell : mehdorn is stepping down mehdorn 's fall from grace has been spectacular for a man credited with turning deutsche bahn into a profitable global transport leader over the past decade . but he has been dogged by the revelations that his company spied on employees and has recently come under heavy criticism for his perceived arrogance in the affair , resisting calls to step down and maintaining that the company did not break the law . " under my leadership , -lrb- deutsche -rrb- bahn is in good shape despite the serious economic and financial crisis , " mehdorn told the sunday edition of germany 's bild newspaper , when asked why he had not resigned .
" our results are good and we are not laying off any workers in the crisis . " until now , mehdorn has enjoyed the support of the chancellor , who has stood by him in past confrontations and has sided with him on occasional battles with germany 's powerful transport unions . mehdorn 's decision to offer his resignation now relieves merkel of a burden which may have threatened her campaign in parliamentary elections scheduled for september . nda / sms / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in my opinion , it is necessary to stay in afghanistan for the foreseeable future , " de hoop scheffer said , adding that he had so far seen " positive reactions " to a new strategy unveiled by obama last week . the obama plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama will consult with allies about his plan when he comes to europe this week obama 's plan , which has no set timetable for withdrawal , is to send 4,000 us troops to train afghan security forces to fight militants in the country . these forces would be in addition to an earlier announced reinforcement of 17,000 extra us troops to bolster the war effort .
the united states would then have 55,000 troops stationed in afghanistan - 23,000 more than those supplied by the remaining nato members and other countries involved in military operations . obama will be consulting with allies on his plan when heads of state and government of nato members gather in the french city of strasbourg and in the german town of baden-baden on april 3 and 4 to celebrate the alliance 's 60th birthday . financing the war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has almost 3,500 troops stationed in afghanistan de hoop scheffer confirmed that he would call on the international community to contribute $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.5 billion euros -rrb- a year to train afghanistan 's security forces . he acknowledged that this was a lot of money , but said that it should be seen in relation to the informal estimate of roughly $ 42 billion the war is costing nato and its allies . " the allies need to do their part , " he said .
" i would not like to see a mission that is out of balance in this regard . " de hoop scheffer explained that while the obama administration has indicated it wo n't be continuing its predecessor 's policy of pressuring often reluctant allies to supply more troops , european capitals would nonetheless face calls to contribute in other ways , for example with reconstruction or in the civilian training effort . senior officials from around the world , including us secretary of state hillary clinton , un secretary-general ban ki-moon and afghan president hamid karzai , will join de hoop scheffer at the donor conference . additionally , the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , the european union , asian development bank , international monetary fund and world bank are sending delegates . mrm / sh / sms / ap / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de deutsche bahn -pipe- 30.03.2009 bahn boss mehdorn offers resignation amid data privacy scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the withdrawl of governmental support signaled the end for mehdorn hartmut mehdorn 's days as the boss of german rail operator deutsche bahn look to have come to an end as the embattled executive offers his resignation amid a damaging , ongoing data privacy scandal . mehdorn said he was offering to go because the " destructive debates " over his future were damaging the company . " i have made an offer to terminate my contract with the supervisory board chairman , " mehdorn said monday , march 30 , at a press conference to announce deutsche bahn 's annual financial results .
" i assume that a successor will be appointed before the summer holidays " begin in july . mehdorn , who has run the state-owned firm since 1999 , has been under increasing pressure ever since it was revealed earlier this year that deutsche bahn accessed confidential staff data as far back as 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn has come under heavy criticism for taking a closer look at its employees mehdorn admitted in february that , as part of an anti-corruption campaign , deutsche bahn spied on 173,000 of its 220,000 employees in 2002 and 2003 .
official documents have since shown deutsche bahn screened its entire workforce again in 2005 for corruption . in total , the records show that almost all railway employees would have been checked three times , and around 800 top managers would have been scrutinized twice . the german government said it had " taken note " of mehdorn 's offer to quit and praised his role in turning deutsche bahn into a " world-leading transport and logistics company . " " the financial success of recent years and the securing of 220,000 jobs are clearly linked to the high level of mehdorn 's personal engagement and corporate know-how , " the government said in a statement . as recently as friday it was reported that deutsche bahn had also monitored the e-mails of staff to check whether they had contacted journalists or parliamentarians in a bid to find employees critical of the company 's policies . over the weekend , the company was forced to admit that it deleted a 2007 e-mail calling for strike action that was sent by train drivers union gdl to thousands of employees . in an interview with the german sunday newspaper welt am sonntag , german chancellor angela merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm denied a report that the chancellor was keen to keep mehdorn in his post until an independent report on the snooping scandal was completed in may , adding that the issue could not be allowed to drag on for weeks . this , and a statement from an unnamed source who told reuters that berlin was " putting out feelers " for a potential successor , suggested that mehdorn was living on borrowed time . german politicians call time on mehdorn 's reign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these have been dark days for mehdorn and deutsche bahn a chorus of german politicians joining together to criticize the bahn chief added to the sense that mehdorn 's refusal to resign would become a mute point in the coming days . " i do not believe that hartmut mehdorn can remain on as the boss of deutsche bahn , " said transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , a member of the the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
" my impression is that parliament and the federal government does not take him seriously and is beginning to understand the criticism . " " the man must go , " said berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit , while his social democrat colleague and vice president of the party 's bundestag group klaas huebner told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , " any politician who found themselves in the same position could no longer stay in their post . " merkel " must finally terminate -lrb- mehdorn 's -rrb- untenable position with the bahn , " said dietmar bartsch from the left party while greens party leader claudia roth said " bahn boss mehdorn can not stay a day longer . " others , however , were still loath to pass judgment until the full case against mehdorn is heard .
finance minister peer steinbrueck -lrb- spd -rrb- told german tv that he would " wait to see all the evidence before forming an opinion , let alone issuing a condemnation . " economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said it was n't up to politicians to determine mehdorn 's immediate fate . " it is reasonable to wait for the investigation and then to let those who have to decide make the decision , " said the minister , who is a member of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union .
" that is the job of the supervisory board . " mehdorn clings on to past glories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bidding farewell : mehdorn is stepping down mehdorn 's fall from grace has been spectacular for a man credited with turning deutsche bahn into a profitable global transport leader over the past decade . but he has been dogged by the revelations that his company spied on employees and has recently come under heavy criticism for his perceived arrogance in the affair , resisting calls to step down and maintaining that the company did not break the law . " under my leadership , -lrb- deutsche -rrb- bahn is in good shape despite the serious economic and financial crisis , " mehdorn told the sunday edition of germany 's bild newspaper , when asked why he had not resigned .
" our results are good and we are not laying off any workers in the crisis . " until now , mehdorn has enjoyed the support of the chancellor , who has stood by him in past confrontations and has sided with him on occasional battles with germany 's powerful transport unions . mehdorn 's decision to offer his resignation now relieves merkel of a burden which may have threatened her campaign in parliamentary elections scheduled for september . nda / sms / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in my opinion , it is necessary to stay in afghanistan for the foreseeable future , " de hoop scheffer said , adding that he had so far seen " positive reactions " to a new strategy unveiled by obama last week . the obama plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama will consult with allies about his plan when he comes to europe this week obama 's plan , which has no set timetable for withdrawal , is to send 4,000 us troops to train afghan security forces to fight militants in the country . these forces would be in addition to an earlier announced reinforcement of 17,000 extra us troops to bolster the war effort .
the united states would then have 55,000 troops stationed in afghanistan - 23,000 more than those supplied by the remaining nato members and other countries involved in military operations . obama will be consulting with allies on his plan when heads of state and government of nato members gather in the french city of strasbourg and in the german town of baden-baden on april 3 and 4 to celebrate the alliance 's 60th birthday . financing the war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has almost 3,500 troops stationed in afghanistan de hoop scheffer confirmed that he would call on the international community to contribute $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.5 billion euros -rrb- a year to train afghanistan 's security forces . he acknowledged that this was a lot of money , but said that it should be seen in relation to the informal estimate of roughly $ 42 billion the war is costing nato and its allies . " the allies need to do their part , " he said .
" i would not like to see a mission that is out of balance in this regard . " de hoop scheffer explained that while the obama administration has indicated it wo n't be continuing its predecessor 's policy of pressuring often reluctant allies to supply more troops , european capitals would nonetheless face calls to contribute in other ways , for example with reconstruction or in the civilian training effort . senior officials from around the world , including us secretary of state hillary clinton , un secretary-general ban ki-moon and afghan president hamid karzai , will join de hoop scheffer at the donor conference . additionally , the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , the european union , asian development bank , international monetary fund and world bank are sending delegates . mrm / sh / sms / ap / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the meantime , a proper sideline in " summit tourism " has emerged . whether in the european union , the united nations or the southeast asian association of nations -lrb- asean -rrb- , everyone has been searching for an answer to the question : what should the international financial architecture of the future look like ? german chancellor angela merkel laid out her criteria at a meeting of leading european industrial nations in berlin at the end of february . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has insisted all markets and financial products be regulated " we all accept that all the financial markets , -lrb- financial -rrb- products and -lrb- market -rrb- participants - including hedge funds , including ratings agencies and other private bidders - should be subject to a supervisory and regulatory body , " merkel said .
" the necessary details of this must be worked out and included as part of the action plan . " the head of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet , put it more succinctly . " everything has to change , " he said , adding that the current crisis has shown that the entire system is too vulnerable and not resistant enough . transparency , accountability the core points of the action plan are meant to address this problem with improved transparency and more accountability on the financial markets , as well as better control and regulation of these markets . authorities will , for the first time , be able to impose minimum limits for capital and liquidity on hedge funds in the countries where the funds are active , not where they have their headquarters .
such measures aim to stop these funds from fleeing to unregulated havens such as the cayman islands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regulation or stimulus will be a major issue at the g20 summit these are bitter pills to swallow for british and american fund operators .
in the past , they used to just smile lightly when others warned of the dangers of unbridled capitalism .
but now there 's little doubt that leaders such as new us treasury secretary timothy geithner mean business . " such risks know no national borders , " geithner said .
" we have to keep a much stricter eye on things and pass clear rules of play for the international financial system .
comprehensive changes on both the national and international level will demand it . " germany introduces " risk map " germany has introduced what it calls a " risk map " to the international proceedings .
it is designed to reflect the situation of all market participants and financial products , and if need be , signal an alarm . the map will be complemented by a global credit register of all loans above a certain size .
officials have admitted that it will be a tough task to gather all the data needed , but leaders hope such a measure will bring them further down the road to a new order for the global financial system . merkel has said she is convinced that important steps will be taken at the g20 summit in london .
following bilateral talks with british prime minister gordon brown in mid-march , she said she was optimistic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis has affected the entire world " with the united states , and with emerging economies like china and india -lrb- involved -rrb- , we 'll achieve results that will ensure that , with regulation , with supervision , such a crisis can not repeat itself , " merkel said . the litmus test of such big words , however , will be in the details .
accountability , equity monitoring , the international cooperation of supervisory bodies - to achieve these things , the experts must first do much highly complex detail work that then has to be implemented and coordinated on the national and international level . the heads of state gathering in london will surely not be at a loss for words to describe their common purpose .
grand statements were already being made following the summit in washington by people such as eu commission president jose manuel barroso , who spoke of " laying the foundations for a new global accord .

" i have made an offer to terminate my contract with the supervisory board chairman , " mehdorn said monday , march 30 , at a press conference to announce deutsche bahn 's annual financial results .
" i assume that a successor will be appointed before the summer holidays " begin in july . mehdorn , who has run the state-owned firm since 1999 , has been under increasing pressure ever since it was revealed earlier this year that deutsche bahn accessed confidential staff data as far back as 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn has come under heavy criticism for taking a closer look at its employees mehdorn admitted in february that , as part of an anti-corruption campaign , deutsche bahn spied on 173,000 of its 220,000 employees in 2002 and 2003 .
official documents have since shown deutsche bahn screened its entire workforce again in 2005 for corruption . in total , the records show that almost all railway employees would have been checked three times , and around 800 top managers would have been scrutinized twice . the german government said it had " taken note " of mehdorn 's offer to quit and praised his role in turning deutsche bahn into a " world-leading transport and logistics company . " " the financial success of recent years and the securing of 220,000 jobs are clearly linked to the high level of mehdorn 's personal engagement and corporate know-how , " the government said in a statement . as recently as friday it was reported that deutsche bahn had also monitored the e-mails of staff to check whether they had contacted journalists or parliamentarians in a bid to find employees critical of the company 's policies . over the weekend , the company was forced to admit that it deleted a 2007 e-mail calling for strike action that was sent by train drivers union gdl to thousands of employees . in an interview with the german sunday newspaper welt am sonntag , german chancellor angela merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm denied a report that the chancellor was keen to keep mehdorn in his post until an independent report on the snooping scandal was completed in may , adding that the issue could not be allowed to drag on for weeks . this , and a statement from an unnamed source who told reuters that berlin was " putting out feelers " for a potential successor , suggested that mehdorn was living on borrowed time . german politicians call time on mehdorn 's reign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these have been dark days for mehdorn and deutsche bahn a chorus of german politicians joining together to criticize the bahn chief added to the sense that mehdorn 's refusal to resign would become a mute point in the coming days . " i do not believe that hartmut mehdorn can remain on as the boss of deutsche bahn , " said transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , a member of the the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
" my impression is that parliament and the federal government does not take him seriously and is beginning to understand the criticism . " " the man must go , " said berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit , while his social democrat colleague and vice president of the party 's bundestag group klaas huebner told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , " any politician who found themselves in the same position could no longer stay in their post . " merkel " must finally terminate -lrb- mehdorn 's -rrb- untenable position with the bahn , " said dietmar bartsch from the left party while greens party leader claudia roth said " bahn boss mehdorn can not stay a day longer . " others , however , were still loath to pass judgment until the full case against mehdorn is heard .
finance minister peer steinbrueck -lrb- spd -rrb- told german tv that he would " wait to see all the evidence before forming an opinion , let alone issuing a condemnation . " economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said it was n't up to politicians to determine mehdorn 's immediate fate . " it is reasonable to wait for the investigation and then to let those who have to decide make the decision , " said the minister , who is a member of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union .
" that is the job of the supervisory board . " mehdorn clings on to past glories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bidding farewell : mehdorn is stepping down mehdorn 's fall from grace has been spectacular for a man credited with turning deutsche bahn into a profitable global transport leader over the past decade . but he has been dogged by the revelations that his company spied on employees and has recently come under heavy criticism for his perceived arrogance in the affair , resisting calls to step down and maintaining that the company did not break the law . " under my leadership , -lrb- deutsche -rrb- bahn is in good shape despite the serious economic and financial crisis , " mehdorn told the sunday edition of germany 's bild newspaper , when asked why he had not resigned .
" our results are good and we are not laying off any workers in the crisis . " until now , mehdorn has enjoyed the support of the chancellor , who has stood by him in past confrontations and has sided with him on occasional battles with germany 's powerful transport unions . mehdorn 's decision to offer his resignation now relieves merkel of a burden which may have threatened her campaign in parliamentary elections scheduled for september . nda / sms / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" rick wagoner stands for an imploded centralist system , " he said on tuesday , march 30 , calling the former ceo a symbol of grave mismanagement . franz said he looked forward to working with wagoner 's temporary replacement , gm president and chief operating officer fritz henderson , because he had significant experience with gm 's european units . henderson led a restructuring push at opel from mid-2004 through to the end of 2005 , cutting around 10,000 jobs and making the firm profitable for the first time in nearly five years . new strategies ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm ceo rick wagoner is stepping down at washington 's request other labor leaders , however , have said that while the management changeover is long overdue , it does not present a clear solution to the company 's problems since henderson 's plans for the future remain unclear . " we do n't know what concepts general motors ' new management team is likely to pursue , " said rainer einenkel , the head of the works council at opel 's bochum factory .
" what we do know is that if gm ca n't find a reasonable solution , then its regional subsidiaries in europe , including opel , will suffer .
if general motors fails and goes bankrupt , it will drag opel down with it . " for months opel managers have been looking to the german government for assistance aimed at preventing insolvency .
but fears that bail-out funds could be funneled away from opel to gm have left politicians unwilling to give the company , which employs some 26,000 people in germany , the support it provided to the financial industry . german chancellor angela merkel is due to visit opel headquarters in ruesselsheim on tuesday , but analysts have said it is unlikely she will announce any concrete plans for the company as long as the future of its us parent remains unclear . auto task force wagoner 's dismissal was ordered by an auto industry task force appointed by us president barack obama . a report published by the task force on monday rejected general motors ' request for up to $ 16 billion -lrb- 12.2 billion euros -rrb- in loans . it said gm had already received $ 13.5 billion of aid , and that the obama administration would only continue to fund the company for the next 60 days to allow management to develop a recovery plan . obama said if the restructuring efforts do not go far enough , he would have no choice but allow gm to fail and use bankruptcy laws to force the company 's reorganization . " the united states has no interest in running gm , " the president said .
" what we are interested in is giving gm an opportunity to finally make those much-needed changes that will let them emerge from this crisis a much stronger and more competitive company . " chrysler merger obama told the american auto industry 's other problem child , chrysler , that its situation was even worse . he gave its managers emergency funding for just 30 more days , telling them they must finalize a merger deal with italian carmaker fiat , or another suitable partner , or they would be left to fail . obama 's warning may have been harsh , but it appears to have been effective .

but the issue of more troops remains off the table . the concession , which again fell short of fulfilling requests for more troops – and in germany 's case , combat troops , comes ahead of a 60th anniversary nato summit this week where allied contributions to the conflict in afghanistan will once more be a hot topic .
" we want to make this mission a success and that means giving afghanistan the means to take care of its own security , " chancellor angela merkel said in her weekly video podcast .
" in particular , it means that we must do more qualitatively in the training of soldiers and police .
germany is ready to do its duty . "
merkel , who faces an election in six months time , has already told president barack obama - who will attend the nato summit hosted by germany and france - that berlin will not increase the number of combat troops it can send to afghanistan .
germany has also resisted pressure from allies to send its troops to the more dangerous southern areas of the country , where allied forces are battling a taliban insurgency .
germany has 3,800 troops engaged in training and reconstruction programs in the north of the country .
it can push that number as high as 4,500 , based on a parliamentary mandate approved last year and has pledged extra troops ahead of the august elections , as part of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- but stands firm on involving its troops in any military action .
obama not expected to push for troops at summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants more commitment in the fight against the taliban unveiling his new afghanistan strategy last friday , obama said the united states would continue to seek contributions from allies for combat forces , trainers and mentors , strategic lift and equipment , although he is not expected to ask for an increased troop commitment at this week 's nato summit .
deputy foreign minister gernot erler told german radio that germany welcomed obama 's focus on more training and would be ready to step up its efforts in this area .
" i think we will be ready in germany to think about a stronger contribution in the area of training , " he said .
nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer urged european countries to step up their efforts in afghanistan as the defense organization prepared for its landmark summit .
" it 's not acceptable that only the united states strengthens its engagement , " he told the sunday edition of germany 's bild newspaper .
" the europeans must do more too , whether its in the military or civilian area . "
new calls for europeans to pitch in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jones reiterated calls for more european involvement us security advisor james jones reiterated washington 's expectations in a newspaper interview published in the german daily tagesspiegel on sunday , echoing the nato chief 's calls for its european allies in nato to supplement their troop presence in afghanistan , at least during the country 's august election period .
" whether these troops stay longer or head home straight after the elections , is another matter , " jones said in the interview published sunday .
the former general said that even if president obama did not directly call for increased efforts at the nato conference , it did not mean that the us was letting anyone off the hook .
" from the fact that the usa has not made public detailed demands to its allies , one can not deduce that the request does not exist , " jones said .
" every nation is free in its decision . "
the security advisor further emphasized the importance of civil assistance projects provided by allied forces in afghanistan .
" the time has passed , in which the quality of the relationship is measured by the number of soldiers , " jones said , adding that military might alone " does not suffice in the conflicts we are now dealing with . "

but the issue of more troops remains off the table . the concession , which again fell short of fulfilling requests for more troops – and in germany 's case , combat troops , comes ahead of a 60th anniversary nato summit this week where allied contributions to the conflict in afghanistan will once more be a hot topic .
" we want to make this mission a success and that means giving afghanistan the means to take care of its own security , " chancellor angela merkel said in her weekly video podcast .
" in particular , it means that we must do more qualitatively in the training of soldiers and police .
germany is ready to do its duty . "
merkel , who faces an election in six months time , has already told president barack obama - who will attend the nato summit hosted by germany and france - that berlin will not increase the number of combat troops it can send to afghanistan .
germany has also resisted pressure from allies to send its troops to the more dangerous southern areas of the country , where allied forces are battling a taliban insurgency .
germany has 3,800 troops engaged in training and reconstruction programs in the north of the country .
it can push that number as high as 4,500 , based on a parliamentary mandate approved last year and has pledged extra troops ahead of the august elections , as part of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- but stands firm on involving its troops in any military action .
obama not expected to push for troops at summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants more commitment in the fight against the taliban unveiling his new afghanistan strategy last friday , obama said the united states would continue to seek contributions from allies for combat forces , trainers and mentors , strategic lift and equipment , although he is not expected to ask for an increased troop commitment at this week 's nato summit .
deputy foreign minister gernot erler told german radio that germany welcomed obama 's focus on more training and would be ready to step up its efforts in this area .

" i have made an offer to terminate my contract with the supervisory board chairman , " mehdorn said monday , march 30 , at a press conference to announce deutsche bahn 's annual financial results .
" i assume that a successor will be appointed before the summer holidays " begin in july . mehdorn , who has run the state-owned firm since 1999 , has been under increasing pressure ever since it was revealed earlier this year that deutsche bahn accessed confidential staff data as far back as 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn has come under heavy criticism for taking a closer look at its employees mehdorn admitted in february that , as part of an anti-corruption campaign , deutsche bahn spied on 173,000 of its 220,000 employees in 2002 and 2003 .
official documents have since shown deutsche bahn screened its entire workforce again in 2005 for corruption . in total , the records show that almost all railway employees would have been checked three times , and around 800 top managers would have been scrutinized twice . the german government said it had " taken note " of mehdorn 's offer to quit and praised his role in turning deutsche bahn into a " world-leading transport and logistics company . " " the financial success of recent years and the securing of 220,000 jobs are clearly linked to the high level of mehdorn 's personal engagement and corporate know-how , " the government said in a statement . as recently as friday it was reported that deutsche bahn had also monitored the e-mails of staff to check whether they had contacted journalists or parliamentarians in a bid to find employees critical of the company 's policies . over the weekend , the company was forced to admit that it deleted a 2007 e-mail calling for strike action that was sent by train drivers union gdl to thousands of employees . in an interview with the german sunday newspaper welt am sonntag , german chancellor angela merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm denied a report that the chancellor was keen to keep mehdorn in his post until an independent report on the snooping scandal was completed in may , adding that the issue could not be allowed to drag on for weeks . this , and a statement from an unnamed source who told reuters that berlin was " putting out feelers " for a potential successor , suggested that mehdorn was living on borrowed time . german politicians call time on mehdorn 's reign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these have been dark days for mehdorn and deutsche bahn a chorus of german politicians joining together to criticize the bahn chief added to the sense that mehdorn 's refusal to resign would become a mute point in the coming days . " i do not believe that hartmut mehdorn can remain on as the boss of deutsche bahn , " said transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , a member of the the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
" my impression is that parliament and the federal government does not take him seriously and is beginning to understand the criticism . " " the man must go , " said berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit , while his social democrat colleague and vice president of the party 's bundestag group klaas huebner told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , " any politician who found themselves in the same position could no longer stay in their post . " merkel " must finally terminate -lrb- mehdorn 's -rrb- untenable position with the bahn , " said dietmar bartsch from the left party while greens party leader claudia roth said " bahn boss mehdorn can not stay a day longer . " others , however , were still loath to pass judgment until the full case against mehdorn is heard .
finance minister peer steinbrueck -lrb- spd -rrb- told german tv that he would " wait to see all the evidence before forming an opinion , let alone issuing a condemnation . " economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said it was n't up to politicians to determine mehdorn 's immediate fate . " it is reasonable to wait for the investigation and then to let those who have to decide make the decision , " said the minister , who is a member of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union .
" that is the job of the supervisory board . " mehdorn clings on to past glories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bidding farewell : mehdorn is stepping down mehdorn 's fall from grace has been spectacular for a man credited with turning deutsche bahn into a profitable global transport leader over the past decade . but he has been dogged by the revelations that his company spied on employees and has recently come under heavy criticism for his perceived arrogance in the affair , resisting calls to step down and maintaining that the company did not break the law . " under my leadership , -lrb- deutsche -rrb- bahn is in good shape despite the serious economic and financial crisis , " mehdorn told the sunday edition of germany 's bild newspaper , when asked why he had not resigned .
" our results are good and we are not laying off any workers in the crisis . " until now , mehdorn has enjoyed the support of the chancellor , who has stood by him in past confrontations and has sided with him on occasional battles with germany 's powerful transport unions . mehdorn 's decision to offer his resignation now relieves merkel of a burden which may have threatened her campaign in parliamentary elections scheduled for september . nda / sms / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not because of its wide wingspan or its ability to fly for incredible distances without a break but because it may become the aircraft tied around the neck of manufacturer airbus as it sinks towards the murky depths .
the error-ridden and maligned military transporter project has prompted discussion , argument and consternation for some time among potential customers and the manufacturers themselves .
but no comments could prove as damaging as those recently uttered by thomas enders , the boss of airbus .
enders revealed in an interview with der spiegel news magazine that he believed that , under its original conditions and plans , the a400m could not be built and that the seemingly doomed nature of the project had much to do with huge errors within his own company .
the a400m has been plagued by setbacks , with the aircraft 's first flight postponed to a date that has yet to be determined because of engine problems .
a never-ending nightmare ?
" under the previous conditions we can not build the airplane , " admitted enders .
" but , better an end with a fright than a fright with no end . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders hopes that the worst will soon be over while the " end with a fright " may mean that after realizing that the current plans need to be scrapped thus sending the a400m back to the drawing board , the " fright with no end " - a continuing nightmare which ends with the death of the whole project - may not be as unavoidable as some may think .
enders himself admitted that he has considered the ultimate failure of the project and while a new plan is taking shape as to how to progress with the a400m , the prospect of current orders for the problem-plagued plane being cancelled is a real possibility .
german deputy defense minister ruediger wolf said only last week that cancelling orders on the military transport plane was a serious option .
" i have been waiting to hear about the problems with the a400m but until today we have no detailed information about what they are and whether these are solvable , " criticized wolf .
wolf told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that to bring pressure on airbus ' parent company the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- , " cancellation must be a serious option after a delay of three to six months . "
wolf , who was quoted indirectly by sueddeutsche zeitung , said it was more realistic to extend to six months a moratorium accorded to eads to get the program back on track .
customers considering cutting , reducing orders countries that have ordered the plane - belgium , britain , france , germany , luxembourg , spain and turkey - have suggested delaying from april 1 to july 1 the date on which they can begin to cancel contracts .

france has signed on for 50 aircraft , while germany has ordered 60 .
eads was supposed to get the transport plane in the air for an inaugural flight in january 2008 , and the seven countries await a total of 180 a400ms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a400m is built but can not get off the ground deliveries had originally been scheduled to begin in 2009 , but the first delivery is now planned for 2012 and it is only in 2014 that eads will be able to deliver significant numbers of the aircraft to clients , according to reports .
meanwhile , mtu aero engines , the german engine maker at the centre of the row over the delays said on monday it was confident problems on the a400m would be resolved but declined to say when the plane would fly .
the company is responsible for the software needed to power the military transporter 's engines , and airbus says hitches in its development are largely to blame for delays of 3 to 4 years in the 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 27.29 billion -rrb- project .

" i have made an offer to terminate my contract with the supervisory board chairman , " mehdorn said monday , march 30 , at a press conference to announce deutsche bahn 's annual financial results .
" i assume that a successor will be appointed before the summer holidays " begin in july . mehdorn , who has run the state-owned firm since 1999 , has been under increasing pressure ever since it was revealed earlier this year that deutsche bahn accessed confidential staff data as far back as 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn has come under heavy criticism for taking a closer look at its employees mehdorn admitted in february that , as part of an anti-corruption campaign , deutsche bahn spied on 173,000 of its 220,000 employees in 2002 and 2003 .
official documents have since shown deutsche bahn screened its entire workforce again in 2005 for corruption . in total , the records show that almost all railway employees would have been checked three times , and around 800 top managers would have been scrutinized twice . the german government said it had " taken note " of mehdorn 's offer to quit and praised his role in turning deutsche bahn into a " world-leading transport and logistics company . " " the financial success of recent years and the securing of 220,000 jobs are clearly linked to the high level of mehdorn 's personal engagement and corporate know-how , " the government said in a statement . as recently as friday it was reported that deutsche bahn had also monitored the e-mails of staff to check whether they had contacted journalists or parliamentarians in a bid to find employees critical of the company 's policies . over the weekend , the company was forced to admit that it deleted a 2007 e-mail calling for strike action that was sent by train drivers union gdl to thousands of employees . in an interview with the german sunday newspaper welt am sonntag , german chancellor angela merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm denied a report that the chancellor was keen to keep mehdorn in his post until an independent report on the snooping scandal was completed in may , adding that the issue could not be allowed to drag on for weeks . this , and a statement from an unnamed source who told reuters that berlin was " putting out feelers " for a potential successor , suggested that mehdorn was living on borrowed time . german politicians call time on mehdorn 's reign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these have been dark days for mehdorn and deutsche bahn a chorus of german politicians joining together to criticize the bahn chief added to the sense that mehdorn 's refusal to resign would become a mute point in the coming days . " i do not believe that hartmut mehdorn can remain on as the boss of deutsche bahn , " said transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , a member of the the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
" my impression is that parliament and the federal government does not take him seriously and is beginning to understand the criticism . " " the man must go , " said berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit , while his social democrat colleague and vice president of the party 's bundestag group klaas huebner told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , " any politician who found themselves in the same position could no longer stay in their post . " merkel " must finally terminate -lrb- mehdorn 's -rrb- untenable position with the bahn , " said dietmar bartsch from the left party while greens party leader claudia roth said " bahn boss mehdorn can not stay a day longer . " others , however , were still loath to pass judgment until the full case against mehdorn is heard .
finance minister peer steinbrueck -lrb- spd -rrb- told german tv that he would " wait to see all the evidence before forming an opinion , let alone issuing a condemnation . " economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said it was n't up to politicians to determine mehdorn 's immediate fate . " it is reasonable to wait for the investigation and then to let those who have to decide make the decision , " said the minister , who is a member of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union .
" that is the job of the supervisory board . " mehdorn clings on to past glories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bidding farewell : mehdorn is stepping down mehdorn 's fall from grace has been spectacular for a man credited with turning deutsche bahn into a profitable global transport leader over the past decade . but he has been dogged by the revelations that his company spied on employees and has recently come under heavy criticism for his perceived arrogance in the affair , resisting calls to step down and maintaining that the company did not break the law . " under my leadership , -lrb- deutsche -rrb- bahn is in good shape despite the serious economic and financial crisis , " mehdorn told the sunday edition of germany 's bild newspaper , when asked why he had not resigned .
" our results are good and we are not laying off any workers in the crisis . " until now , mehdorn has enjoyed the support of the chancellor , who has stood by him in past confrontations and has sided with him on occasional battles with germany 's powerful transport unions . mehdorn 's decision to offer his resignation now relieves merkel of a burden which may have threatened her campaign in parliamentary elections scheduled for september . nda / sms / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do n't know what concepts general motors ' new management team is likely to pursue , " said rainer einenkel , the head of the works council at opel 's bochum factory .
" what we do know is that if gm ca n't find a reasonable solution , then its regional subsidiaries in europe , including opel , will suffer .
if general motors fails and goes bankrupt , it will drag opel down with it . " for months opel managers have been looking to the german government for assistance aimed at preventing insolvency .
but fears that bail-out funds could be funneled away from opel to gm have left politicians unwilling to give the company , which employs some 26,000 people in germany , the support it provided to the financial industry . german chancellor angela merkel is due to visit opel headquarters in ruesselsheim on tuesday , but analysts have said it is unlikely she will announce any concrete plans for the company as long as the future of its us parent remains unclear . auto task force wagoner 's dismissal was ordered by an auto industry task force appointed by us president barack obama . a report published by the task force on monday rejected general motors ' request for up to $ 16 billion -lrb- 12.2 billion euros -rrb- in loans . it said gm had already received $ 13.5 billion of aid , and that the obama administration would only continue to fund the company for the next 60 days to allow management to develop a recovery plan . obama said if the restructuring efforts do not go far enough , he would have no choice but allow gm to fail and use bankruptcy laws to force the company 's reorganization . " the united states has no interest in running gm , " the president said .
" what we are interested in is giving gm an opportunity to finally make those much-needed changes that will let them emerge from this crisis a much stronger and more competitive company . " chrysler merger obama told the american auto industry 's other problem child , chrysler , that its situation was even worse . he gave its managers emergency funding for just 30 more days , telling them they must finalize a merger deal with italian carmaker fiat , or another suitable partner , or they would be left to fail . obama 's warning may have been harsh , but it appears to have been effective .
chrysler and fiat announced they had agreed on a framework for an alliance within 90 minutes of the president 's speech . sje / sh / sms / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in my opinion , it is necessary to stay in afghanistan for the foreseeable future , " de hoop scheffer said , adding that he had so far seen " positive reactions " to a new strategy unveiled by obama last week . the obama plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama will consult with allies about his plan when he comes to europe this week obama 's plan , which has no set timetable for withdrawal , is to send 4,000 us troops to train afghan security forces to fight militants in the country . these forces would be in addition to an earlier announced reinforcement of 17,000 extra us troops to bolster the war effort .
the united states would then have 55,000 troops stationed in afghanistan - 23,000 more than those supplied by the remaining nato members and other countries involved in military operations . obama will be consulting with allies on his plan when heads of state and government of nato members gather in the french city of strasbourg and in the german town of baden-baden on april 3 and 4 to celebrate the alliance 's 60th birthday . financing the war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has almost 3,500 troops stationed in afghanistan de hoop scheffer confirmed that he would call on the international community to contribute $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.5 billion euros -rrb- a year to train afghanistan 's security forces . he acknowledged that this was a lot of money , but said that it should be seen in relation to the informal estimate of roughly $ 42 billion the war is costing nato and its allies . " the allies need to do their part , " he said .
" i would not like to see a mission that is out of balance in this regard . " de hoop scheffer explained that while the obama administration has indicated it wo n't be continuing its predecessor 's policy of pressuring often reluctant allies to supply more troops , european capitals would nonetheless face calls to contribute in other ways , for example with reconstruction or in the civilian training effort . senior officials from around the world , including us secretary of state hillary clinton , un secretary-general ban ki-moon and afghan president hamid karzai , will join de hoop scheffer at the donor conference . additionally , the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , the european union , asian development bank , international monetary fund and world bank are sending delegates . mrm / sh / sms / ap / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 30.03.2009 london summit to pick up where washington left off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world leaders will discuss how to avoid a repeat of the ongoing financial crisis months after the first world finance summit in washington , g20 nations are aiming to reach conclusions about how to strengthen the world 's financial system at a summit starting on thursday in london . the g20 negotiators have probably spent the bulk of the last four months sitting in airplanes . the action plan that was agreed on at the first world finance summit in washington on nov .
15 encompassed 47 concrete measures that range from a better global financial regulatory body to new rules for executive compensation . the majority of the items agreed on at the historic meeting in the us capital were supposed to be implemented by the end of march .
in the meantime , a proper sideline in " summit tourism " has emerged . whether in the european union , the united nations or the southeast asian association of nations -lrb- asean -rrb- , everyone has been searching for an answer to the question : what should the international financial architecture of the future look like ? german chancellor angela merkel laid out her criteria at a meeting of leading european industrial nations in berlin at the end of february . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has insisted all markets and financial products be regulated " we all accept that all the financial markets , -lrb- financial -rrb- products and -lrb- market -rrb- participants - including hedge funds , including ratings agencies and other private bidders - should be subject to a supervisory and regulatory body , " merkel said .
" the necessary details of this must be worked out and included as part of the action plan . " the head of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet , put it more succinctly . " everything has to change , " he said , adding that the current crisis has shown that the entire system is too vulnerable and not resistant enough . transparency , accountability the core points of the action plan are meant to address this problem with improved transparency and more accountability on the financial markets , as well as better control and regulation of these markets . authorities will , for the first time , be able to impose minimum limits for capital and liquidity on hedge funds in the countries where the funds are active , not where they have their headquarters .
such measures aim to stop these funds from fleeing to unregulated havens such as the cayman islands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regulation or stimulus will be a major issue at the g20 summit these are bitter pills to swallow for british and american fund operators .
in the past , they used to just smile lightly when others warned of the dangers of unbridled capitalism .
but now there 's little doubt that leaders such as new us treasury secretary timothy geithner mean business . " such risks know no national borders , " geithner said .
" we have to keep a much stricter eye on things and pass clear rules of play for the international financial system .
comprehensive changes on both the national and international level will demand it . " germany introduces " risk map " germany has introduced what it calls a " risk map " to the international proceedings .
it is designed to reflect the situation of all market participants and financial products , and if need be , signal an alarm . the map will be complemented by a global credit register of all loans above a certain size .
officials have admitted that it will be a tough task to gather all the data needed , but leaders hope such a measure will bring them further down the road to a new order for the global financial system . merkel has said she is convinced that important steps will be taken at the g20 summit in london .
following bilateral talks with british prime minister gordon brown in mid-march , she said she was optimistic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis has affected the entire world " with the united states , and with emerging economies like china and india -lrb- involved -rrb- , we 'll achieve results that will ensure that , with regulation , with supervision , such a crisis can not repeat itself , " merkel said . the litmus test of such big words , however , will be in the details .
accountability , equity monitoring , the international cooperation of supervisory bodies - to achieve these things , the experts must first do much highly complex detail work that then has to be implemented and coordinated on the national and international level . the heads of state gathering in london will surely not be at a loss for words to describe their common purpose .
grand statements were already being made following the summit in washington by people such as eu commission president jose manuel barroso , who spoke of " laying the foundations for a new global accord .

" i have made an offer to terminate my contract with the supervisory board chairman , " mehdorn said monday , march 30 , at a press conference to announce deutsche bahn 's annual financial results .
" i assume that a successor will be appointed before the summer holidays " begin in july . mehdorn , who has run the state-owned firm since 1999 , has been under increasing pressure ever since it was revealed earlier this year that deutsche bahn accessed confidential staff data as far back as 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn has come under heavy criticism for taking a closer look at its employees mehdorn admitted in february that , as part of an anti-corruption campaign , deutsche bahn spied on 173,000 of its 220,000 employees in 2002 and 2003 .
official documents have since shown deutsche bahn screened its entire workforce again in 2005 for corruption . in total , the records show that almost all railway employees would have been checked three times , and around 800 top managers would have been scrutinized twice . the german government said it had " taken note " of mehdorn 's offer to quit and praised his role in turning deutsche bahn into a " world-leading transport and logistics company . " " the financial success of recent years and the securing of 220,000 jobs are clearly linked to the high level of mehdorn 's personal engagement and corporate know-how , " the government said in a statement . as recently as friday it was reported that deutsche bahn had also monitored the e-mails of staff to check whether they had contacted journalists or parliamentarians in a bid to find employees critical of the company 's policies . over the weekend , the company was forced to admit that it deleted a 2007 e-mail calling for strike action that was sent by train drivers union gdl to thousands of employees . in an interview with the german sunday newspaper welt am sonntag , german chancellor angela merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm denied a report that the chancellor was keen to keep mehdorn in his post until an independent report on the snooping scandal was completed in may , adding that the issue could not be allowed to drag on for weeks . this , and a statement from an unnamed source who told reuters that berlin was " putting out feelers " for a potential successor , suggested that mehdorn was living on borrowed time . german politicians call time on mehdorn 's reign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these have been dark days for mehdorn and deutsche bahn a chorus of german politicians joining together to criticize the bahn chief added to the sense that mehdorn 's refusal to resign would become a mute point in the coming days . " i do not believe that hartmut mehdorn can remain on as the boss of deutsche bahn , " said transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , a member of the the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
" my impression is that parliament and the federal government does not take him seriously and is beginning to understand the criticism . " " the man must go , " said berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit , while his social democrat colleague and vice president of the party 's bundestag group klaas huebner told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , " any politician who found themselves in the same position could no longer stay in their post . " merkel " must finally terminate -lrb- mehdorn 's -rrb- untenable position with the bahn , " said dietmar bartsch from the left party while greens party leader claudia roth said " bahn boss mehdorn can not stay a day longer . " others , however , were still loath to pass judgment until the full case against mehdorn is heard .
finance minister peer steinbrueck -lrb- spd -rrb- told german tv that he would " wait to see all the evidence before forming an opinion , let alone issuing a condemnation . " economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said it was n't up to politicians to determine mehdorn 's immediate fate . " it is reasonable to wait for the investigation and then to let those who have to decide make the decision , " said the minister , who is a member of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union .
" that is the job of the supervisory board . " mehdorn clings on to past glories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bidding farewell : mehdorn is stepping down mehdorn 's fall from grace has been spectacular for a man credited with turning deutsche bahn into a profitable global transport leader over the past decade . but he has been dogged by the revelations that his company spied on employees and has recently come under heavy criticism for his perceived arrogance in the affair , resisting calls to step down and maintaining that the company did not break the law . " under my leadership , -lrb- deutsche -rrb- bahn is in good shape despite the serious economic and financial crisis , " mehdorn told the sunday edition of germany 's bild newspaper , when asked why he had not resigned .
" our results are good and we are not laying off any workers in the crisis . " until now , mehdorn has enjoyed the support of the chancellor , who has stood by him in past confrontations and has sided with him on occasional battles with germany 's powerful transport unions . mehdorn 's decision to offer his resignation now relieves merkel of a burden which may have threatened her campaign in parliamentary elections scheduled for september . nda / sms / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in my opinion , it is necessary to stay in afghanistan for the foreseeable future , " de hoop scheffer said , adding that he had so far seen " positive reactions " to a new strategy unveiled by obama last week . the obama plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama will consult with allies about his plan when he comes to europe this week obama 's plan , which has no set timetable for withdrawal , is to send 4,000 us troops to train afghan security forces to fight militants in the country . these forces would be in addition to an earlier announced reinforcement of 17,000 extra us troops to bolster the war effort .
the united states would then have 55,000 troops stationed in afghanistan - 23,000 more than those supplied by the remaining nato members and other countries involved in military operations . obama will be consulting with allies on his plan when heads of state and government of nato members gather in the french city of strasbourg and in the german town of baden-baden on april 3 and 4 to celebrate the alliance 's 60th birthday . financing the war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has almost 3,500 troops stationed in afghanistan de hoop scheffer confirmed that he would call on the international community to contribute $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.5 billion euros -rrb- a year to train afghanistan 's security forces . he acknowledged that this was a lot of money , but said that it should be seen in relation to the informal estimate of roughly $ 42 billion the war is costing nato and its allies . " the allies need to do their part , " he said .
" i would not like to see a mission that is out of balance in this regard . " de hoop scheffer explained that while the obama administration has indicated it wo n't be continuing its predecessor 's policy of pressuring often reluctant allies to supply more troops , european capitals would nonetheless face calls to contribute in other ways , for example with reconstruction or in the civilian training effort . senior officials from around the world , including us secretary of state hillary clinton , un secretary-general ban ki-moon and afghan president hamid karzai , will join de hoop scheffer at the donor conference . additionally , the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , the european union , asian development bank , international monetary fund and world bank are sending delegates . mrm / sh / sms / ap / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the issue of more troops remains off the table . the concession , which again fell short of fulfilling requests for more troops – and in germany 's case , combat troops , comes ahead of a 60th anniversary nato summit this week where allied contributions to the conflict in afghanistan will once more be a hot topic .
" we want to make this mission a success and that means giving afghanistan the means to take care of its own security , " chancellor angela merkel said in her weekly video podcast .
" in particular , it means that we must do more qualitatively in the training of soldiers and police .
germany is ready to do its duty . "
merkel , who faces an election in six months time , has already told president barack obama - who will attend the nato summit hosted by germany and france - that berlin will not increase the number of combat troops it can send to afghanistan .
germany has also resisted pressure from allies to send its troops to the more dangerous southern areas of the country , where allied forces are battling a taliban insurgency .
germany has 3,800 troops engaged in training and reconstruction programs in the north of the country .
it can push that number as high as 4,500 , based on a parliamentary mandate approved last year and has pledged extra troops ahead of the august elections , as part of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- but stands firm on involving its troops in any military action .
obama not expected to push for troops at summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants more commitment in the fight against the taliban unveiling his new afghanistan strategy last friday , obama said the united states would continue to seek contributions from allies for combat forces , trainers and mentors , strategic lift and equipment , although he is not expected to ask for an increased troop commitment at this week 's nato summit .
deputy foreign minister gernot erler told german radio that germany welcomed obama 's focus on more training and would be ready to step up its efforts in this area .
" i think we will be ready in germany to think about a stronger contribution in the area of training , " he said .
nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer urged european countries to step up their efforts in afghanistan as the defense organization prepared for its landmark summit .
" it 's not acceptable that only the united states strengthens its engagement , " he told the sunday edition of germany 's bild newspaper .
" the europeans must do more too , whether its in the military or civilian area . "
new calls for europeans to pitch in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jones reiterated calls for more european involvement us security advisor james jones reiterated washington 's expectations in a newspaper interview published in the german daily tagesspiegel on sunday , echoing the nato chief 's calls for its european allies in nato to supplement their troop presence in afghanistan , at least during the country 's august election period .
" whether these troops stay longer or head home straight after the elections , is another matter , " jones said in the interview published sunday .
the former general said that even if president obama did not directly call for increased efforts at the nato conference , it did not mean that the us was letting anyone off the hook .
" from the fact that the usa has not made public detailed demands to its allies , one can not deduce that the request does not exist , " jones said .
" every nation is free in its decision . "
the security advisor further emphasized the importance of civil assistance projects provided by allied forces in afghanistan .
" the time has passed , in which the quality of the relationship is measured by the number of soldiers , " jones said , adding that military might alone " does not suffice in the conflicts we are now dealing with . "
in afghanistan , for example , a lot could be learned from the german contribution , he said , adding that germany had done a great deal to train the afghan police forces . nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in my opinion , it is necessary to stay in afghanistan for the foreseeable future , " de hoop scheffer said , adding that he had so far seen " positive reactions " to a new strategy unveiled by obama last week . the obama plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama will consult with allies about his plan when he comes to europe this week obama 's plan , which has no set timetable for withdrawal , is to send 4,000 us troops to train afghan security forces to fight militants in the country . these forces would be in addition to an earlier announced reinforcement of 17,000 extra us troops to bolster the war effort .
the united states would then have 55,000 troops stationed in afghanistan - 23,000 more than those supplied by the remaining nato members and other countries involved in military operations . obama will be consulting with allies on his plan when heads of state and government of nato members gather in the french city of strasbourg and in the german town of baden-baden on april 3 and 4 to celebrate the alliance 's 60th birthday . financing the war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has almost 3,500 troops stationed in afghanistan de hoop scheffer confirmed that he would call on the international community to contribute $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.5 billion euros -rrb- a year to train afghanistan 's security forces . he acknowledged that this was a lot of money , but said that it should be seen in relation to the informal estimate of roughly $ 42 billion the war is costing nato and its allies . " the allies need to do their part , " he said .
" i would not like to see a mission that is out of balance in this regard . " de hoop scheffer explained that while the obama administration has indicated it wo n't be continuing its predecessor 's policy of pressuring often reluctant allies to supply more troops , european capitals would nonetheless face calls to contribute in other ways , for example with reconstruction or in the civilian training effort . senior officials from around the world , including us secretary of state hillary clinton , un secretary-general ban ki-moon and afghan president hamid karzai , will join de hoop scheffer at the donor conference . additionally , the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , the european union , asian development bank , international monetary fund and world bank are sending delegates . mrm / sh / sms / ap / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" " the financial success of recent years and the securing of 220,000 jobs are clearly linked to the high level of mehdorn 's personal engagement and corporate know-how , " the government said in a statement . as recently as friday it was reported that deutsche bahn had also monitored the e-mails of staff to check whether they had contacted journalists or parliamentarians in a bid to find employees critical of the company 's policies . over the weekend , the company was forced to admit that it deleted a 2007 e-mail calling for strike action that was sent by train drivers union gdl to thousands of employees . in an interview with the german sunday newspaper welt am sonntag , german chancellor angela merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm denied a report that the chancellor was keen to keep mehdorn in his post until an independent report on the snooping scandal was completed in may , adding that the issue could not be allowed to drag on for weeks . this , and a statement from an unnamed source who told reuters that berlin was " putting out feelers " for a potential successor , suggested that mehdorn was living on borrowed time . german politicians call time on mehdorn 's reign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these have been dark days for mehdorn and deutsche bahn a chorus of german politicians joining together to criticize the bahn chief added to the sense that mehdorn 's refusal to resign would become a mute point in the coming days . " i do not believe that hartmut mehdorn can remain on as the boss of deutsche bahn , " said transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , a member of the the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
" my impression is that parliament and the federal government does not take him seriously and is beginning to understand the criticism . " " the man must go , " said berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit , while his social democrat colleague and vice president of the party 's bundestag group klaas huebner told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , " any politician who found themselves in the same position could no longer stay in their post . " merkel " must finally terminate -lrb- mehdorn 's -rrb- untenable position with the bahn , " said dietmar bartsch from the left party while greens party leader claudia roth said " bahn boss mehdorn can not stay a day longer . " others , however , were still loath to pass judgment until the full case against mehdorn is heard .
finance minister peer steinbrueck -lrb- spd -rrb- told german tv that he would " wait to see all the evidence before forming an opinion , let alone issuing a condemnation . " economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said it was n't up to politicians to determine mehdorn 's immediate fate . " it is reasonable to wait for the investigation and then to let those who have to decide make the decision , " said the minister , who is a member of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union .
" that is the job of the supervisory board . " mehdorn clings on to past glories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bidding farewell : mehdorn is stepping down mehdorn 's fall from grace has been spectacular for a man credited with turning deutsche bahn into a profitable global transport leader over the past decade . but he has been dogged by the revelations that his company spied on employees and has recently come under heavy criticism for his perceived arrogance in the affair , resisting calls to step down and maintaining that the company did not break the law . " under my leadership , -lrb- deutsche -rrb- bahn is in good shape despite the serious economic and financial crisis , " mehdorn told the sunday edition of germany 's bild newspaper , when asked why he had not resigned .
" our results are good and we are not laying off any workers in the crisis . " until now , mehdorn has enjoyed the support of the chancellor , who has stood by him in past confrontations and has sided with him on occasional battles with germany 's powerful transport unions . mehdorn 's decision to offer his resignation now relieves merkel of a burden which may have threatened her campaign in parliamentary elections scheduled for september . nda / sms / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not because of its wide wingspan or its ability to fly for incredible distances without a break but because it may become the aircraft tied around the neck of manufacturer airbus as it sinks towards the murky depths .
the error-ridden and maligned military transporter project has prompted discussion , argument and consternation for some time among potential customers and the manufacturers themselves .
but no comments could prove as damaging as those recently uttered by thomas enders , the boss of airbus .
enders revealed in an interview with der spiegel news magazine that he believed that , under its original conditions and plans , the a400m could not be built and that the seemingly doomed nature of the project had much to do with huge errors within his own company .
the a400m has been plagued by setbacks , with the aircraft 's first flight postponed to a date that has yet to be determined because of engine problems .
a never-ending nightmare ?
" under the previous conditions we can not build the airplane , " admitted enders .
" but , better an end with a fright than a fright with no end . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders hopes that the worst will soon be over while the " end with a fright " may mean that after realizing that the current plans need to be scrapped thus sending the a400m back to the drawing board , the " fright with no end " - a continuing nightmare which ends with the death of the whole project - may not be as unavoidable as some may think .
enders himself admitted that he has considered the ultimate failure of the project and while a new plan is taking shape as to how to progress with the a400m , the prospect of current orders for the problem-plagued plane being cancelled is a real possibility .
german deputy defense minister ruediger wolf said only last week that cancelling orders on the military transport plane was a serious option .
" i have been waiting to hear about the problems with the a400m but until today we have no detailed information about what they are and whether these are solvable , " criticized wolf .
wolf told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that to bring pressure on airbus ' parent company the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- , " cancellation must be a serious option after a delay of three to six months . "
wolf , who was quoted indirectly by sueddeutsche zeitung , said it was more realistic to extend to six months a moratorium accorded to eads to get the program back on track .

france has signed on for 50 aircraft , while germany has ordered 60 .
eads was supposed to get the transport plane in the air for an inaugural flight in january 2008 , and the seven countries await a total of 180 a400ms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a400m is built but can not get off the ground deliveries had originally been scheduled to begin in 2009 , but the first delivery is now planned for 2012 and it is only in 2014 that eads will be able to deliver significant numbers of the aircraft to clients , according to reports .
meanwhile , mtu aero engines , the german engine maker at the centre of the row over the delays said on monday it was confident problems on the a400m would be resolved but declined to say when the plane would fly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 30.03.2009 germany to increase training role in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will increase its training of afghan police germany says it is ready to meet us president obama 's request for more resources in afghanistan , by stepping up its training of local police and security forces .
but the issue of more troops remains off the table . the concession , which again fell short of fulfilling requests for more troops – and in germany 's case , combat troops , comes ahead of a 60th anniversary nato summit this week where allied contributions to the conflict in afghanistan will once more be a hot topic .
" we want to make this mission a success and that means giving afghanistan the means to take care of its own security , " chancellor angela merkel said in her weekly video podcast .
" in particular , it means that we must do more qualitatively in the training of soldiers and police .
germany is ready to do its duty . "
merkel , who faces an election in six months time , has already told president barack obama - who will attend the nato summit hosted by germany and france - that berlin will not increase the number of combat troops it can send to afghanistan .
germany has also resisted pressure from allies to send its troops to the more dangerous southern areas of the country , where allied forces are battling a taliban insurgency .
germany has 3,800 troops engaged in training and reconstruction programs in the north of the country .
it can push that number as high as 4,500 , based on a parliamentary mandate approved last year and has pledged extra troops ahead of the august elections , as part of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- but stands firm on involving its troops in any military action .
obama not expected to push for troops at summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants more commitment in the fight against the taliban unveiling his new afghanistan strategy last friday , obama said the united states would continue to seek contributions from allies for combat forces , trainers and mentors , strategic lift and equipment , although he is not expected to ask for an increased troop commitment at this week 's nato summit .
deputy foreign minister gernot erler told german radio that germany welcomed obama 's focus on more training and would be ready to step up its efforts in this area .
" i think we will be ready in germany to think about a stronger contribution in the area of training , " he said .
nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer urged european countries to step up their efforts in afghanistan as the defense organization prepared for its landmark summit .
" it 's not acceptable that only the united states strengthens its engagement , " he told the sunday edition of germany 's bild newspaper .
" the europeans must do more too , whether its in the military or civilian area . "
new calls for europeans to pitch in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jones reiterated calls for more european involvement us security advisor james jones reiterated washington 's expectations in a newspaper interview published in the german daily tagesspiegel on sunday , echoing the nato chief 's calls for its european allies in nato to supplement their troop presence in afghanistan , at least during the country 's august election period .
" whether these troops stay longer or head home straight after the elections , is another matter , " jones said in the interview published sunday .
the former general said that even if president obama did not directly call for increased efforts at the nato conference , it did not mean that the us was letting anyone off the hook .
" from the fact that the usa has not made public detailed demands to its allies , one can not deduce that the request does not exist , " jones said .
" every nation is free in its decision . "
the security advisor further emphasized the importance of civil assistance projects provided by allied forces in afghanistan .
" the time has passed , in which the quality of the relationship is measured by the number of soldiers , " jones said , adding that military might alone " does not suffice in the conflicts we are now dealing with . "
in afghanistan , for example , a lot could be learned from the german contribution , he said , adding that germany had done a great deal to train the afghan police forces . nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 encompassed 47 concrete measures that range from a better global financial regulatory body to new rules for executive compensation . the majority of the items agreed on at the historic meeting in the us capital were supposed to be implemented by the end of march .

" in my opinion , it is necessary to stay in afghanistan for the foreseeable future , " de hoop scheffer said , adding that he had so far seen " positive reactions " to a new strategy unveiled by obama last week . the obama plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama will consult with allies about his plan when he comes to europe this week obama 's plan , which has no set timetable for withdrawal , is to send 4,000 us troops to train afghan security forces to fight militants in the country . these forces would be in addition to an earlier announced reinforcement of 17,000 extra us troops to bolster the war effort .
the united states would then have 55,000 troops stationed in afghanistan - 23,000 more than those supplied by the remaining nato members and other countries involved in military operations . obama will be consulting with allies on his plan when heads of state and government of nato members gather in the french city of strasbourg and in the german town of baden-baden on april 3 and 4 to celebrate the alliance 's 60th birthday . financing the war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has almost 3,500 troops stationed in afghanistan de hoop scheffer confirmed that he would call on the international community to contribute $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.5 billion euros -rrb- a year to train afghanistan 's security forces . he acknowledged that this was a lot of money , but said that it should be seen in relation to the informal estimate of roughly $ 42 billion the war is costing nato and its allies . " the allies need to do their part , " he said .
" i would not like to see a mission that is out of balance in this regard . " de hoop scheffer explained that while the obama administration has indicated it wo n't be continuing its predecessor 's policy of pressuring often reluctant allies to supply more troops , european capitals would nonetheless face calls to contribute in other ways , for example with reconstruction or in the civilian training effort . senior officials from around the world , including us secretary of state hillary clinton , un secretary-general ban ki-moon and afghan president hamid karzai , will join de hoop scheffer at the donor conference . additionally , the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , the european union , asian development bank , international monetary fund and world bank are sending delegates . mrm / sh / sms / ap / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the united states would then have 55,000 troops stationed in afghanistan - 23,000 more than those supplied by the remaining nato members and other countries involved in military operations . obama will be consulting with allies on his plan when heads of state and government of nato members gather in the french city of strasbourg and in the german town of baden-baden on april 3 and 4 to celebrate the alliance 's 60th birthday . financing the war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has almost 3,500 troops stationed in afghanistan de hoop scheffer confirmed that he would call on the international community to contribute $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.5 billion euros -rrb- a year to train afghanistan 's security forces . he acknowledged that this was a lot of money , but said that it should be seen in relation to the informal estimate of roughly $ 42 billion the war is costing nato and its allies . " the allies need to do their part , " he said .
" i would not like to see a mission that is out of balance in this regard . " de hoop scheffer explained that while the obama administration has indicated it wo n't be continuing its predecessor 's policy of pressuring often reluctant allies to supply more troops , european capitals would nonetheless face calls to contribute in other ways , for example with reconstruction or in the civilian training effort . senior officials from around the world , including us secretary of state hillary clinton , un secretary-general ban ki-moon and afghan president hamid karzai , will join de hoop scheffer at the donor conference . additionally , the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , the european union , asian development bank , international monetary fund and world bank are sending delegates . mrm / sh / sms / ap / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 encompassed 47 concrete measures that range from a better global financial regulatory body to new rules for executive compensation . the majority of the items agreed on at the historic meeting in the us capital were supposed to be implemented by the end of march .
in the meantime , a proper sideline in " summit tourism " has emerged . whether in the european union , the united nations or the southeast asian association of nations -lrb- asean -rrb- , everyone has been searching for an answer to the question : what should the international financial architecture of the future look like ? german chancellor angela merkel laid out her criteria at a meeting of leading european industrial nations in berlin at the end of february . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has insisted all markets and financial products be regulated " we all accept that all the financial markets , -lrb- financial -rrb- products and -lrb- market -rrb- participants - including hedge funds , including ratings agencies and other private bidders - should be subject to a supervisory and regulatory body , " merkel said .
" the necessary details of this must be worked out and included as part of the action plan . " the head of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet , put it more succinctly . " everything has to change , " he said , adding that the current crisis has shown that the entire system is too vulnerable and not resistant enough . transparency , accountability the core points of the action plan are meant to address this problem with improved transparency and more accountability on the financial markets , as well as better control and regulation of these markets . authorities will , for the first time , be able to impose minimum limits for capital and liquidity on hedge funds in the countries where the funds are active , not where they have their headquarters .
such measures aim to stop these funds from fleeing to unregulated havens such as the cayman islands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regulation or stimulus will be a major issue at the g20 summit these are bitter pills to swallow for british and american fund operators .
in the past , they used to just smile lightly when others warned of the dangers of unbridled capitalism .
but now there 's little doubt that leaders such as new us treasury secretary timothy geithner mean business . " such risks know no national borders , " geithner said .
" we have to keep a much stricter eye on things and pass clear rules of play for the international financial system .
comprehensive changes on both the national and international level will demand it . " germany introduces " risk map " germany has introduced what it calls a " risk map " to the international proceedings .
it is designed to reflect the situation of all market participants and financial products , and if need be , signal an alarm . the map will be complemented by a global credit register of all loans above a certain size .
officials have admitted that it will be a tough task to gather all the data needed , but leaders hope such a measure will bring them further down the road to a new order for the global financial system . merkel has said she is convinced that important steps will be taken at the g20 summit in london .
following bilateral talks with british prime minister gordon brown in mid-march , she said she was optimistic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis has affected the entire world " with the united states , and with emerging economies like china and india -lrb- involved -rrb- , we 'll achieve results that will ensure that , with regulation , with supervision , such a crisis can not repeat itself , " merkel said . the litmus test of such big words , however , will be in the details .
accountability , equity monitoring , the international cooperation of supervisory bodies - to achieve these things , the experts must first do much highly complex detail work that then has to be implemented and coordinated on the national and international level . the heads of state gathering in london will surely not be at a loss for words to describe their common purpose .
grand statements were already being made following the summit in washington by people such as eu commission president jose manuel barroso , who spoke of " laying the foundations for a new global accord .

but the issue of more troops remains off the table . the concession , which again fell short of fulfilling requests for more troops – and in germany 's case , combat troops , comes ahead of a 60th anniversary nato summit this week where allied contributions to the conflict in afghanistan will once more be a hot topic .
" we want to make this mission a success and that means giving afghanistan the means to take care of its own security , " chancellor angela merkel said in her weekly video podcast .
" in particular , it means that we must do more qualitatively in the training of soldiers and police .
germany is ready to do its duty . "
merkel , who faces an election in six months time , has already told president barack obama - who will attend the nato summit hosted by germany and france - that berlin will not increase the number of combat troops it can send to afghanistan .
germany has also resisted pressure from allies to send its troops to the more dangerous southern areas of the country , where allied forces are battling a taliban insurgency .
germany has 3,800 troops engaged in training and reconstruction programs in the north of the country .
it can push that number as high as 4,500 , based on a parliamentary mandate approved last year and has pledged extra troops ahead of the august elections , as part of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- but stands firm on involving its troops in any military action .
obama not expected to push for troops at summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants more commitment in the fight against the taliban unveiling his new afghanistan strategy last friday , obama said the united states would continue to seek contributions from allies for combat forces , trainers and mentors , strategic lift and equipment , although he is not expected to ask for an increased troop commitment at this week 's nato summit .
deputy foreign minister gernot erler told german radio that germany welcomed obama 's focus on more training and would be ready to step up its efforts in this area .
" i think we will be ready in germany to think about a stronger contribution in the area of training , " he said .
nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer urged european countries to step up their efforts in afghanistan as the defense organization prepared for its landmark summit .
" it 's not acceptable that only the united states strengthens its engagement , " he told the sunday edition of germany 's bild newspaper .
" the europeans must do more too , whether its in the military or civilian area . "

" whether these troops stay longer or head home straight after the elections , is another matter , " jones said in the interview published sunday .
the former general said that even if president obama did not directly call for increased efforts at the nato conference , it did not mean that the us was letting anyone off the hook .
" from the fact that the usa has not made public detailed demands to its allies , one can not deduce that the request does not exist , " jones said .
" every nation is free in its decision . "
the security advisor further emphasized the importance of civil assistance projects provided by allied forces in afghanistan .

but the issue of more troops remains off the table . the concession , which again fell short of fulfilling requests for more troops – and in germany 's case , combat troops , comes ahead of a 60th anniversary nato summit this week where allied contributions to the conflict in afghanistan will once more be a hot topic .
" we want to make this mission a success and that means giving afghanistan the means to take care of its own security , " chancellor angela merkel said in her weekly video podcast .
" in particular , it means that we must do more qualitatively in the training of soldiers and police .
germany is ready to do its duty . "
merkel , who faces an election in six months time , has already told president barack obama - who will attend the nato summit hosted by germany and france - that berlin will not increase the number of combat troops it can send to afghanistan .
germany has also resisted pressure from allies to send its troops to the more dangerous southern areas of the country , where allied forces are battling a taliban insurgency .
germany has 3,800 troops engaged in training and reconstruction programs in the north of the country .
it can push that number as high as 4,500 , based on a parliamentary mandate approved last year and has pledged extra troops ahead of the august elections , as part of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- but stands firm on involving its troops in any military action .
obama not expected to push for troops at summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants more commitment in the fight against the taliban unveiling his new afghanistan strategy last friday , obama said the united states would continue to seek contributions from allies for combat forces , trainers and mentors , strategic lift and equipment , although he is not expected to ask for an increased troop commitment at this week 's nato summit .
deputy foreign minister gernot erler told german radio that germany welcomed obama 's focus on more training and would be ready to step up its efforts in this area .
" i think we will be ready in germany to think about a stronger contribution in the area of training , " he said .
nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer urged european countries to step up their efforts in afghanistan as the defense organization prepared for its landmark summit .
" it 's not acceptable that only the united states strengthens its engagement , " he told the sunday edition of germany 's bild newspaper .
" the europeans must do more too , whether its in the military or civilian area . "
new calls for europeans to pitch in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jones reiterated calls for more european involvement us security advisor james jones reiterated washington 's expectations in a newspaper interview published in the german daily tagesspiegel on sunday , echoing the nato chief 's calls for its european allies in nato to supplement their troop presence in afghanistan , at least during the country 's august election period .
" whether these troops stay longer or head home straight after the elections , is another matter , " jones said in the interview published sunday .
the former general said that even if president obama did not directly call for increased efforts at the nato conference , it did not mean that the us was letting anyone off the hook .
" from the fact that the usa has not made public detailed demands to its allies , one can not deduce that the request does not exist , " jones said .
" every nation is free in its decision . "
the security advisor further emphasized the importance of civil assistance projects provided by allied forces in afghanistan .
" the time has passed , in which the quality of the relationship is measured by the number of soldiers , " jones said , adding that military might alone " does not suffice in the conflicts we are now dealing with . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 30.03.2009 london summit to pick up where washington left off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world leaders will discuss how to avoid a repeat of the ongoing financial crisis months after the first world finance summit in washington , g20 nations are aiming to reach conclusions about how to strengthen the world 's financial system at a summit starting on thursday in london . the g20 negotiators have probably spent the bulk of the last four months sitting in airplanes . the action plan that was agreed on at the first world finance summit in washington on nov .
15 encompassed 47 concrete measures that range from a better global financial regulatory body to new rules for executive compensation . the majority of the items agreed on at the historic meeting in the us capital were supposed to be implemented by the end of march .
in the meantime , a proper sideline in " summit tourism " has emerged . whether in the european union , the united nations or the southeast asian association of nations -lrb- asean -rrb- , everyone has been searching for an answer to the question : what should the international financial architecture of the future look like ? german chancellor angela merkel laid out her criteria at a meeting of leading european industrial nations in berlin at the end of february . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has insisted all markets and financial products be regulated " we all accept that all the financial markets , -lrb- financial -rrb- products and -lrb- market -rrb- participants - including hedge funds , including ratings agencies and other private bidders - should be subject to a supervisory and regulatory body , " merkel said .
" the necessary details of this must be worked out and included as part of the action plan . " the head of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet , put it more succinctly . " everything has to change , " he said , adding that the current crisis has shown that the entire system is too vulnerable and not resistant enough . transparency , accountability the core points of the action plan are meant to address this problem with improved transparency and more accountability on the financial markets , as well as better control and regulation of these markets . authorities will , for the first time , be able to impose minimum limits for capital and liquidity on hedge funds in the countries where the funds are active , not where they have their headquarters .
such measures aim to stop these funds from fleeing to unregulated havens such as the cayman islands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regulation or stimulus will be a major issue at the g20 summit these are bitter pills to swallow for british and american fund operators .
in the past , they used to just smile lightly when others warned of the dangers of unbridled capitalism .
but now there 's little doubt that leaders such as new us treasury secretary timothy geithner mean business . " such risks know no national borders , " geithner said .
" we have to keep a much stricter eye on things and pass clear rules of play for the international financial system .
comprehensive changes on both the national and international level will demand it . " germany introduces " risk map " germany has introduced what it calls a " risk map " to the international proceedings .
it is designed to reflect the situation of all market participants and financial products , and if need be , signal an alarm . the map will be complemented by a global credit register of all loans above a certain size .
officials have admitted that it will be a tough task to gather all the data needed , but leaders hope such a measure will bring them further down the road to a new order for the global financial system . merkel has said she is convinced that important steps will be taken at the g20 summit in london .
following bilateral talks with british prime minister gordon brown in mid-march , she said she was optimistic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis has affected the entire world " with the united states , and with emerging economies like china and india -lrb- involved -rrb- , we 'll achieve results that will ensure that , with regulation , with supervision , such a crisis can not repeat itself , " merkel said . the litmus test of such big words , however , will be in the details .
accountability , equity monitoring , the international cooperation of supervisory bodies - to achieve these things , the experts must first do much highly complex detail work that then has to be implemented and coordinated on the national and international level . the heads of state gathering in london will surely not be at a loss for words to describe their common purpose .
grand statements were already being made following the summit in washington by people such as eu commission president jose manuel barroso , who spoke of " laying the foundations for a new global accord .

" in my opinion , it is necessary to stay in afghanistan for the foreseeable future , " de hoop scheffer said , adding that he had so far seen " positive reactions " to a new strategy unveiled by obama last week . the obama plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama will consult with allies about his plan when he comes to europe this week obama 's plan , which has no set timetable for withdrawal , is to send 4,000 us troops to train afghan security forces to fight militants in the country . these forces would be in addition to an earlier announced reinforcement of 17,000 extra us troops to bolster the war effort .

" the allies need to do their part , " he said .
" i would not like to see a mission that is out of balance in this regard . " de hoop scheffer explained that while the obama administration has indicated it wo n't be continuing its predecessor 's policy of pressuring often reluctant allies to supply more troops , european capitals would nonetheless face calls to contribute in other ways , for example with reconstruction or in the civilian training effort . senior officials from around the world , including us secretary of state hillary clinton , un secretary-general ban ki-moon and afghan president hamid karzai , will join de hoop scheffer at the donor conference . additionally , the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , the european union , asian development bank , international monetary fund and world bank are sending delegates . mrm / sh / sms / ap / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" rick wagoner stands for an imploded centralist system , " he said on tuesday , march 30 , calling the former ceo a symbol of grave mismanagement . franz said he looked forward to working with wagoner 's temporary replacement , gm president and chief operating officer fritz henderson , because he had significant experience with gm 's european units . henderson led a restructuring push at opel from mid-2004 through to the end of 2005 , cutting around 10,000 jobs and making the firm profitable for the first time in nearly five years . new strategies ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm ceo rick wagoner is stepping down at washington 's request other labor leaders , however , have said that while the management changeover is long overdue , it does not present a clear solution to the company 's problems since henderson 's plans for the future remain unclear . " we do n't know what concepts general motors ' new management team is likely to pursue , " said rainer einenkel , the head of the works council at opel 's bochum factory .
" what we do know is that if gm ca n't find a reasonable solution , then its regional subsidiaries in europe , including opel , will suffer .
if general motors fails and goes bankrupt , it will drag opel down with it . " for months opel managers have been looking to the german government for assistance aimed at preventing insolvency .
but fears that bail-out funds could be funneled away from opel to gm have left politicians unwilling to give the company , which employs some 26,000 people in germany , the support it provided to the financial industry . german chancellor angela merkel is due to visit opel headquarters in ruesselsheim on tuesday , but analysts have said it is unlikely she will announce any concrete plans for the company as long as the future of its us parent remains unclear . auto task force wagoner 's dismissal was ordered by an auto industry task force appointed by us president barack obama . a report published by the task force on monday rejected general motors ' request for up to $ 16 billion -lrb- 12.2 billion euros -rrb- in loans . it said gm had already received $ 13.5 billion of aid , and that the obama administration would only continue to fund the company for the next 60 days to allow management to develop a recovery plan . obama said if the restructuring efforts do not go far enough , he would have no choice but allow gm to fail and use bankruptcy laws to force the company 's reorganization . " the united states has no interest in running gm , " the president said .
" what we are interested in is giving gm an opportunity to finally make those much-needed changes that will let them emerge from this crisis a much stronger and more competitive company . " chrysler merger obama told the american auto industry 's other problem child , chrysler , that its situation was even worse . he gave its managers emergency funding for just 30 more days , telling them they must finalize a merger deal with italian carmaker fiat , or another suitable partner , or they would be left to fail . obama 's warning may have been harsh , but it appears to have been effective .
chrysler and fiat announced they had agreed on a framework for an alliance within 90 minutes of the president 's speech . sje / sh / sms / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the issue of more troops remains off the table . the concession , which again fell short of fulfilling requests for more troops – and in germany 's case , combat troops , comes ahead of a 60th anniversary nato summit this week where allied contributions to the conflict in afghanistan will once more be a hot topic .
" we want to make this mission a success and that means giving afghanistan the means to take care of its own security , " chancellor angela merkel said in her weekly video podcast .
" in particular , it means that we must do more qualitatively in the training of soldiers and police .
germany is ready to do its duty . "
merkel , who faces an election in six months time , has already told president barack obama - who will attend the nato summit hosted by germany and france - that berlin will not increase the number of combat troops it can send to afghanistan .
germany has also resisted pressure from allies to send its troops to the more dangerous southern areas of the country , where allied forces are battling a taliban insurgency .
germany has 3,800 troops engaged in training and reconstruction programs in the north of the country .
it can push that number as high as 4,500 , based on a parliamentary mandate approved last year and has pledged extra troops ahead of the august elections , as part of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- but stands firm on involving its troops in any military action .
obama not expected to push for troops at summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants more commitment in the fight against the taliban unveiling his new afghanistan strategy last friday , obama said the united states would continue to seek contributions from allies for combat forces , trainers and mentors , strategic lift and equipment , although he is not expected to ask for an increased troop commitment at this week 's nato summit .
deputy foreign minister gernot erler told german radio that germany welcomed obama 's focus on more training and would be ready to step up its efforts in this area .
" i think we will be ready in germany to think about a stronger contribution in the area of training , " he said .
nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer urged european countries to step up their efforts in afghanistan as the defense organization prepared for its landmark summit .
" it 's not acceptable that only the united states strengthens its engagement , " he told the sunday edition of germany 's bild newspaper .

" whether these troops stay longer or head home straight after the elections , is another matter , " jones said in the interview published sunday .
the former general said that even if president obama did not directly call for increased efforts at the nato conference , it did not mean that the us was letting anyone off the hook .
" from the fact that the usa has not made public detailed demands to its allies , one can not deduce that the request does not exist , " jones said .

but the issue of more troops remains off the table . the concession , which again fell short of fulfilling requests for more troops – and in germany 's case , combat troops , comes ahead of a 60th anniversary nato summit this week where allied contributions to the conflict in afghanistan will once more be a hot topic .
" we want to make this mission a success and that means giving afghanistan the means to take care of its own security , " chancellor angela merkel said in her weekly video podcast .
" in particular , it means that we must do more qualitatively in the training of soldiers and police .
germany is ready to do its duty . "
merkel , who faces an election in six months time , has already told president barack obama - who will attend the nato summit hosted by germany and france - that berlin will not increase the number of combat troops it can send to afghanistan .
germany has also resisted pressure from allies to send its troops to the more dangerous southern areas of the country , where allied forces are battling a taliban insurgency .
germany has 3,800 troops engaged in training and reconstruction programs in the north of the country .
it can push that number as high as 4,500 , based on a parliamentary mandate approved last year and has pledged extra troops ahead of the august elections , as part of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- but stands firm on involving its troops in any military action .
obama not expected to push for troops at summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants more commitment in the fight against the taliban unveiling his new afghanistan strategy last friday , obama said the united states would continue to seek contributions from allies for combat forces , trainers and mentors , strategic lift and equipment , although he is not expected to ask for an increased troop commitment at this week 's nato summit .
deputy foreign minister gernot erler told german radio that germany welcomed obama 's focus on more training and would be ready to step up its efforts in this area .
" i think we will be ready in germany to think about a stronger contribution in the area of training , " he said .
nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer urged european countries to step up their efforts in afghanistan as the defense organization prepared for its landmark summit .
" it 's not acceptable that only the united states strengthens its engagement , " he told the sunday edition of germany 's bild newspaper .
" the europeans must do more too , whether its in the military or civilian area . "
new calls for europeans to pitch in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jones reiterated calls for more european involvement us security advisor james jones reiterated washington 's expectations in a newspaper interview published in the german daily tagesspiegel on sunday , echoing the nato chief 's calls for its european allies in nato to supplement their troop presence in afghanistan , at least during the country 's august election period .
" whether these troops stay longer or head home straight after the elections , is another matter , " jones said in the interview published sunday .
the former general said that even if president obama did not directly call for increased efforts at the nato conference , it did not mean that the us was letting anyone off the hook .
" from the fact that the usa has not made public detailed demands to its allies , one can not deduce that the request does not exist , " jones said .
" every nation is free in its decision . "

merkel , who faces an election in six months time , has already told president barack obama - who will attend the nato summit hosted by germany and france - that berlin will not increase the number of combat troops it can send to afghanistan .
germany has also resisted pressure from allies to send its troops to the more dangerous southern areas of the country , where allied forces are battling a taliban insurgency .
germany has 3,800 troops engaged in training and reconstruction programs in the north of the country .
it can push that number as high as 4,500 , based on a parliamentary mandate approved last year and has pledged extra troops ahead of the august elections , as part of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- but stands firm on involving its troops in any military action .
obama not expected to push for troops at summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants more commitment in the fight against the taliban unveiling his new afghanistan strategy last friday , obama said the united states would continue to seek contributions from allies for combat forces , trainers and mentors , strategic lift and equipment , although he is not expected to ask for an increased troop commitment at this week 's nato summit .
deputy foreign minister gernot erler told german radio that germany welcomed obama 's focus on more training and would be ready to step up its efforts in this area .
" i think we will be ready in germany to think about a stronger contribution in the area of training , " he said .
nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer urged european countries to step up their efforts in afghanistan as the defense organization prepared for its landmark summit .
" it 's not acceptable that only the united states strengthens its engagement , " he told the sunday edition of germany 's bild newspaper .

the former general said that even if president obama did not directly call for increased efforts at the nato conference , it did not mean that the us was letting anyone off the hook .

but the issue of more troops remains off the table . the concession , which again fell short of fulfilling requests for more troops – and in germany 's case , combat troops , comes ahead of a 60th anniversary nato summit this week where allied contributions to the conflict in afghanistan will once more be a hot topic .

not because of its wide wingspan or its ability to fly for incredible distances without a break but because it may become the aircraft tied around the neck of manufacturer airbus as it sinks towards the murky depths .
the error-ridden and maligned military transporter project has prompted discussion , argument and consternation for some time among potential customers and the manufacturers themselves .
but no comments could prove as damaging as those recently uttered by thomas enders , the boss of airbus .
enders revealed in an interview with der spiegel news magazine that he believed that , under its original conditions and plans , the a400m could not be built and that the seemingly doomed nature of the project had much to do with huge errors within his own company .
the a400m has been plagued by setbacks , with the aircraft 's first flight postponed to a date that has yet to be determined because of engine problems .
a never-ending nightmare ?
" under the previous conditions we can not build the airplane , " admitted enders .
" but , better an end with a fright than a fright with no end . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders hopes that the worst will soon be over while the " end with a fright " may mean that after realizing that the current plans need to be scrapped thus sending the a400m back to the drawing board , the " fright with no end " - a continuing nightmare which ends with the death of the whole project - may not be as unavoidable as some may think .
enders himself admitted that he has considered the ultimate failure of the project and while a new plan is taking shape as to how to progress with the a400m , the prospect of current orders for the problem-plagued plane being cancelled is a real possibility .
german deputy defense minister ruediger wolf said only last week that cancelling orders on the military transport plane was a serious option .
" i have been waiting to hear about the problems with the a400m but until today we have no detailed information about what they are and whether these are solvable , " criticized wolf .
wolf told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that to bring pressure on airbus ' parent company the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- , " cancellation must be a serious option after a delay of three to six months . "
wolf , who was quoted indirectly by sueddeutsche zeitung , said it was more realistic to extend to six months a moratorium accorded to eads to get the program back on track .
customers considering cutting , reducing orders countries that have ordered the plane - belgium , britain , france , germany , luxembourg , spain and turkey - have suggested delaying from april 1 to july 1 the date on which they can begin to cancel contracts .
french defense official laurent collet-billon told reporters last week that paris might reduce the number of planes it has ordered .
france has signed on for 50 aircraft , while germany has ordered 60 .
eads was supposed to get the transport plane in the air for an inaugural flight in january 2008 , and the seven countries await a total of 180 a400ms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a400m is built but can not get off the ground deliveries had originally been scheduled to begin in 2009 , but the first delivery is now planned for 2012 and it is only in 2014 that eads will be able to deliver significant numbers of the aircraft to clients , according to reports .
meanwhile , mtu aero engines , the german engine maker at the centre of the row over the delays said on monday it was confident problems on the a400m would be resolved but declined to say when the plane would fly .
the company is responsible for the software needed to power the military transporter 's engines , and airbus says hitches in its development are largely to blame for delays of 3 to 4 years in the 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 27.29 billion -rrb- project .
" airbus has asked everyone involved to stick with the timetable , and they are all working hard on their respective parts of the project , " mtu chief executive egon behle told the company 's annual news conference . a consortium that includes mtu , rolls-royce and france 's safran is building the a400m 's massive turbo-prop engines .

not because of its wide wingspan or its ability to fly for incredible distances without a break but because it may become the aircraft tied around the neck of manufacturer airbus as it sinks towards the murky depths .
the error-ridden and maligned military transporter project has prompted discussion , argument and consternation for some time among potential customers and the manufacturers themselves .
but no comments could prove as damaging as those recently uttered by thomas enders , the boss of airbus .
enders revealed in an interview with der spiegel news magazine that he believed that , under its original conditions and plans , the a400m could not be built and that the seemingly doomed nature of the project had much to do with huge errors within his own company .
the a400m has been plagued by setbacks , with the aircraft 's first flight postponed to a date that has yet to be determined because of engine problems .
a never-ending nightmare ?
" under the previous conditions we can not build the airplane , " admitted enders .
" but , better an end with a fright than a fright with no end . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders hopes that the worst will soon be over while the " end with a fright " may mean that after realizing that the current plans need to be scrapped thus sending the a400m back to the drawing board , the " fright with no end " - a continuing nightmare which ends with the death of the whole project - may not be as unavoidable as some may think .
enders himself admitted that he has considered the ultimate failure of the project and while a new plan is taking shape as to how to progress with the a400m , the prospect of current orders for the problem-plagued plane being cancelled is a real possibility .
german deputy defense minister ruediger wolf said only last week that cancelling orders on the military transport plane was a serious option .
" i have been waiting to hear about the problems with the a400m but until today we have no detailed information about what they are and whether these are solvable , " criticized wolf .
wolf told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that to bring pressure on airbus ' parent company the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- , " cancellation must be a serious option after a delay of three to six months . "
wolf , who was quoted indirectly by sueddeutsche zeitung , said it was more realistic to extend to six months a moratorium accorded to eads to get the program back on track .
customers considering cutting , reducing orders countries that have ordered the plane - belgium , britain , france , germany , luxembourg , spain and turkey - have suggested delaying from april 1 to july 1 the date on which they can begin to cancel contracts .
french defense official laurent collet-billon told reporters last week that paris might reduce the number of planes it has ordered .
france has signed on for 50 aircraft , while germany has ordered 60 .
eads was supposed to get the transport plane in the air for an inaugural flight in january 2008 , and the seven countries await a total of 180 a400ms .

not because of its wide wingspan or its ability to fly for incredible distances without a break but because it may become the aircraft tied around the neck of manufacturer airbus as it sinks towards the murky depths .
the error-ridden and maligned military transporter project has prompted discussion , argument and consternation for some time among potential customers and the manufacturers themselves .
but no comments could prove as damaging as those recently uttered by thomas enders , the boss of airbus .
enders revealed in an interview with der spiegel news magazine that he believed that , under its original conditions and plans , the a400m could not be built and that the seemingly doomed nature of the project had much to do with huge errors within his own company .
the a400m has been plagued by setbacks , with the aircraft 's first flight postponed to a date that has yet to be determined because of engine problems .
a never-ending nightmare ?
" under the previous conditions we can not build the airplane , " admitted enders .
" but , better an end with a fright than a fright with no end . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders hopes that the worst will soon be over while the " end with a fright " may mean that after realizing that the current plans need to be scrapped thus sending the a400m back to the drawing board , the " fright with no end " - a continuing nightmare which ends with the death of the whole project - may not be as unavoidable as some may think .
enders himself admitted that he has considered the ultimate failure of the project and while a new plan is taking shape as to how to progress with the a400m , the prospect of current orders for the problem-plagued plane being cancelled is a real possibility .
german deputy defense minister ruediger wolf said only last week that cancelling orders on the military transport plane was a serious option .
" i have been waiting to hear about the problems with the a400m but until today we have no detailed information about what they are and whether these are solvable , " criticized wolf .
wolf told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that to bring pressure on airbus ' parent company the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- , " cancellation must be a serious option after a delay of three to six months . "
wolf , who was quoted indirectly by sueddeutsche zeitung , said it was more realistic to extend to six months a moratorium accorded to eads to get the program back on track .
customers considering cutting , reducing orders countries that have ordered the plane - belgium , britain , france , germany , luxembourg , spain and turkey - have suggested delaying from april 1 to july 1 the date on which they can begin to cancel contracts .
french defense official laurent collet-billon told reporters last week that paris might reduce the number of planes it has ordered .
france has signed on for 50 aircraft , while germany has ordered 60 .
eads was supposed to get the transport plane in the air for an inaugural flight in january 2008 , and the seven countries await a total of 180 a400ms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a400m is built but can not get off the ground deliveries had originally been scheduled to begin in 2009 , but the first delivery is now planned for 2012 and it is only in 2014 that eads will be able to deliver significant numbers of the aircraft to clients , according to reports .
meanwhile , mtu aero engines , the german engine maker at the centre of the row over the delays said on monday it was confident problems on the a400m would be resolved but declined to say when the plane would fly .

" rick wagoner stands for an imploded centralist system , " he said on tuesday , march 30 , calling the former ceo a symbol of grave mismanagement . franz said he looked forward to working with wagoner 's temporary replacement , gm president and chief operating officer fritz henderson , because he had significant experience with gm 's european units . henderson led a restructuring push at opel from mid-2004 through to the end of 2005 , cutting around 10,000 jobs and making the firm profitable for the first time in nearly five years . new strategies ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm ceo rick wagoner is stepping down at washington 's request other labor leaders , however , have said that while the management changeover is long overdue , it does not present a clear solution to the company 's problems since henderson 's plans for the future remain unclear .

" the united states has no interest in running gm , " the president said .
" what we are interested in is giving gm an opportunity to finally make those much-needed changes that will let them emerge from this crisis a much stronger and more competitive company . " chrysler merger obama told the american auto industry 's other problem child , chrysler , that its situation was even worse . he gave its managers emergency funding for just 30 more days , telling them they must finalize a merger deal with italian carmaker fiat , or another suitable partner , or they would be left to fail . obama 's warning may have been harsh , but it appears to have been effective .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 30.03.2009 germany to increase training role in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will increase its training of afghan police germany says it is ready to meet us president obama 's request for more resources in afghanistan , by stepping up its training of local police and security forces .
but the issue of more troops remains off the table . the concession , which again fell short of fulfilling requests for more troops – and in germany 's case , combat troops , comes ahead of a 60th anniversary nato summit this week where allied contributions to the conflict in afghanistan will once more be a hot topic .
" we want to make this mission a success and that means giving afghanistan the means to take care of its own security , " chancellor angela merkel said in her weekly video podcast .
" in particular , it means that we must do more qualitatively in the training of soldiers and police .
germany is ready to do its duty . "
merkel , who faces an election in six months time , has already told president barack obama - who will attend the nato summit hosted by germany and france - that berlin will not increase the number of combat troops it can send to afghanistan .
germany has also resisted pressure from allies to send its troops to the more dangerous southern areas of the country , where allied forces are battling a taliban insurgency .
germany has 3,800 troops engaged in training and reconstruction programs in the north of the country .
it can push that number as high as 4,500 , based on a parliamentary mandate approved last year and has pledged extra troops ahead of the august elections , as part of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- but stands firm on involving its troops in any military action .
obama not expected to push for troops at summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants more commitment in the fight against the taliban unveiling his new afghanistan strategy last friday , obama said the united states would continue to seek contributions from allies for combat forces , trainers and mentors , strategic lift and equipment , although he is not expected to ask for an increased troop commitment at this week 's nato summit .
deputy foreign minister gernot erler told german radio that germany welcomed obama 's focus on more training and would be ready to step up its efforts in this area .
" i think we will be ready in germany to think about a stronger contribution in the area of training , " he said .
nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer urged european countries to step up their efforts in afghanistan as the defense organization prepared for its landmark summit .
" it 's not acceptable that only the united states strengthens its engagement , " he told the sunday edition of germany 's bild newspaper .
" the europeans must do more too , whether its in the military or civilian area . "
new calls for europeans to pitch in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jones reiterated calls for more european involvement us security advisor james jones reiterated washington 's expectations in a newspaper interview published in the german daily tagesspiegel on sunday , echoing the nato chief 's calls for its european allies in nato to supplement their troop presence in afghanistan , at least during the country 's august election period .
" whether these troops stay longer or head home straight after the elections , is another matter , " jones said in the interview published sunday .
the former general said that even if president obama did not directly call for increased efforts at the nato conference , it did not mean that the us was letting anyone off the hook .
" from the fact that the usa has not made public detailed demands to its allies , one can not deduce that the request does not exist , " jones said .
" every nation is free in its decision . "
the security advisor further emphasized the importance of civil assistance projects provided by allied forces in afghanistan .
" the time has passed , in which the quality of the relationship is measured by the number of soldiers , " jones said , adding that military might alone " does not suffice in the conflicts we are now dealing with . "
in afghanistan , for example , a lot could be learned from the german contribution , he said , adding that germany had done a great deal to train the afghan police forces . nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the issue of more troops remains off the table . the concession , which again fell short of fulfilling requests for more troops – and in germany 's case , combat troops , comes ahead of a 60th anniversary nato summit this week where allied contributions to the conflict in afghanistan will once more be a hot topic .
" we want to make this mission a success and that means giving afghanistan the means to take care of its own security , " chancellor angela merkel said in her weekly video podcast .
" in particular , it means that we must do more qualitatively in the training of soldiers and police .
germany is ready to do its duty . "
merkel , who faces an election in six months time , has already told president barack obama - who will attend the nato summit hosted by germany and france - that berlin will not increase the number of combat troops it can send to afghanistan .
germany has also resisted pressure from allies to send its troops to the more dangerous southern areas of the country , where allied forces are battling a taliban insurgency .
germany has 3,800 troops engaged in training and reconstruction programs in the north of the country .
it can push that number as high as 4,500 , based on a parliamentary mandate approved last year and has pledged extra troops ahead of the august elections , as part of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- but stands firm on involving its troops in any military action .
obama not expected to push for troops at summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants more commitment in the fight against the taliban unveiling his new afghanistan strategy last friday , obama said the united states would continue to seek contributions from allies for combat forces , trainers and mentors , strategic lift and equipment , although he is not expected to ask for an increased troop commitment at this week 's nato summit .
deputy foreign minister gernot erler told german radio that germany welcomed obama 's focus on more training and would be ready to step up its efforts in this area .
" i think we will be ready in germany to think about a stronger contribution in the area of training , " he said .
nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer urged european countries to step up their efforts in afghanistan as the defense organization prepared for its landmark summit .
" it 's not acceptable that only the united states strengthens its engagement , " he told the sunday edition of germany 's bild newspaper .
" the europeans must do more too , whether its in the military or civilian area . "
new calls for europeans to pitch in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jones reiterated calls for more european involvement us security advisor james jones reiterated washington 's expectations in a newspaper interview published in the german daily tagesspiegel on sunday , echoing the nato chief 's calls for its european allies in nato to supplement their troop presence in afghanistan , at least during the country 's august election period .
" whether these troops stay longer or head home straight after the elections , is another matter , " jones said in the interview published sunday .
the former general said that even if president obama did not directly call for increased efforts at the nato conference , it did not mean that the us was letting anyone off the hook .
" from the fact that the usa has not made public detailed demands to its allies , one can not deduce that the request does not exist , " jones said .

" i have made an offer to terminate my contract with the supervisory board chairman , " mehdorn said monday , march 30 , at a press conference to announce deutsche bahn 's annual financial results .
" i assume that a successor will be appointed before the summer holidays " begin in july . mehdorn , who has run the state-owned firm since 1999 , has been under increasing pressure ever since it was revealed earlier this year that deutsche bahn accessed confidential staff data as far back as 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn has come under heavy criticism for taking a closer look at its employees mehdorn admitted in february that , as part of an anti-corruption campaign , deutsche bahn spied on 173,000 of its 220,000 employees in 2002 and 2003 .
official documents have since shown deutsche bahn screened its entire workforce again in 2005 for corruption . in total , the records show that almost all railway employees would have been checked three times , and around 800 top managers would have been scrutinized twice . the german government said it had " taken note " of mehdorn 's offer to quit and praised his role in turning deutsche bahn into a " world-leading transport and logistics company . " " the financial success of recent years and the securing of 220,000 jobs are clearly linked to the high level of mehdorn 's personal engagement and corporate know-how , " the government said in a statement . as recently as friday it was reported that deutsche bahn had also monitored the e-mails of staff to check whether they had contacted journalists or parliamentarians in a bid to find employees critical of the company 's policies . over the weekend , the company was forced to admit that it deleted a 2007 e-mail calling for strike action that was sent by train drivers union gdl to thousands of employees . in an interview with the german sunday newspaper welt am sonntag , german chancellor angela merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm denied a report that the chancellor was keen to keep mehdorn in his post until an independent report on the snooping scandal was completed in may , adding that the issue could not be allowed to drag on for weeks . this , and a statement from an unnamed source who told reuters that berlin was " putting out feelers " for a potential successor , suggested that mehdorn was living on borrowed time . german politicians call time on mehdorn 's reign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these have been dark days for mehdorn and deutsche bahn a chorus of german politicians joining together to criticize the bahn chief added to the sense that mehdorn 's refusal to resign would become a mute point in the coming days . " i do not believe that hartmut mehdorn can remain on as the boss of deutsche bahn , " said transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , a member of the the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
" my impression is that parliament and the federal government does not take him seriously and is beginning to understand the criticism . " " the man must go , " said berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit , while his social democrat colleague and vice president of the party 's bundestag group klaas huebner told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , " any politician who found themselves in the same position could no longer stay in their post . " merkel " must finally terminate -lrb- mehdorn 's -rrb- untenable position with the bahn , " said dietmar bartsch from the left party while greens party leader claudia roth said " bahn boss mehdorn can not stay a day longer . " others , however , were still loath to pass judgment until the full case against mehdorn is heard .
finance minister peer steinbrueck -lrb- spd -rrb- told german tv that he would " wait to see all the evidence before forming an opinion , let alone issuing a condemnation . " economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said it was n't up to politicians to determine mehdorn 's immediate fate . " it is reasonable to wait for the investigation and then to let those who have to decide make the decision , " said the minister , who is a member of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union .
" that is the job of the supervisory board . " mehdorn clings on to past glories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bidding farewell : mehdorn is stepping down mehdorn 's fall from grace has been spectacular for a man credited with turning deutsche bahn into a profitable global transport leader over the past decade . but he has been dogged by the revelations that his company spied on employees and has recently come under heavy criticism for his perceived arrogance in the affair , resisting calls to step down and maintaining that the company did not break the law . " under my leadership , -lrb- deutsche -rrb- bahn is in good shape despite the serious economic and financial crisis , " mehdorn told the sunday edition of germany 's bild newspaper , when asked why he had not resigned .
" our results are good and we are not laying off any workers in the crisis . " until now , mehdorn has enjoyed the support of the chancellor , who has stood by him in past confrontations and has sided with him on occasional battles with germany 's powerful transport unions . mehdorn 's decision to offer his resignation now relieves merkel of a burden which may have threatened her campaign in parliamentary elections scheduled for september . nda / sms / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i have made an offer to terminate my contract with the supervisory board chairman , " mehdorn said monday , march 30 , at a press conference to announce deutsche bahn 's annual financial results .
" i assume that a successor will be appointed before the summer holidays " begin in july . mehdorn , who has run the state-owned firm since 1999 , has been under increasing pressure ever since it was revealed earlier this year that deutsche bahn accessed confidential staff data as far back as 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn has come under heavy criticism for taking a closer look at its employees mehdorn admitted in february that , as part of an anti-corruption campaign , deutsche bahn spied on 173,000 of its 220,000 employees in 2002 and 2003 .
official documents have since shown deutsche bahn screened its entire workforce again in 2005 for corruption . in total , the records show that almost all railway employees would have been checked three times , and around 800 top managers would have been scrutinized twice . the german government said it had " taken note " of mehdorn 's offer to quit and praised his role in turning deutsche bahn into a " world-leading transport and logistics company . " " the financial success of recent years and the securing of 220,000 jobs are clearly linked to the high level of mehdorn 's personal engagement and corporate know-how , " the government said in a statement . as recently as friday it was reported that deutsche bahn had also monitored the e-mails of staff to check whether they had contacted journalists or parliamentarians in a bid to find employees critical of the company 's policies . over the weekend , the company was forced to admit that it deleted a 2007 e-mail calling for strike action that was sent by train drivers union gdl to thousands of employees . in an interview with the german sunday newspaper welt am sonntag , german chancellor angela merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm denied a report that the chancellor was keen to keep mehdorn in his post until an independent report on the snooping scandal was completed in may , adding that the issue could not be allowed to drag on for weeks . this , and a statement from an unnamed source who told reuters that berlin was " putting out feelers " for a potential successor , suggested that mehdorn was living on borrowed time . german politicians call time on mehdorn 's reign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these have been dark days for mehdorn and deutsche bahn a chorus of german politicians joining together to criticize the bahn chief added to the sense that mehdorn 's refusal to resign would become a mute point in the coming days . " i do not believe that hartmut mehdorn can remain on as the boss of deutsche bahn , " said transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , a member of the the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
" my impression is that parliament and the federal government does not take him seriously and is beginning to understand the criticism . " " the man must go , " said berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit , while his social democrat colleague and vice president of the party 's bundestag group klaas huebner told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , " any politician who found themselves in the same position could no longer stay in their post . " merkel " must finally terminate -lrb- mehdorn 's -rrb- untenable position with the bahn , " said dietmar bartsch from the left party while greens party leader claudia roth said " bahn boss mehdorn can not stay a day longer . " others , however , were still loath to pass judgment until the full case against mehdorn is heard .
finance minister peer steinbrueck -lrb- spd -rrb- told german tv that he would " wait to see all the evidence before forming an opinion , let alone issuing a condemnation . " economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said it was n't up to politicians to determine mehdorn 's immediate fate . " it is reasonable to wait for the investigation and then to let those who have to decide make the decision , " said the minister , who is a member of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aerospace -pipe- 30.03.2009 airbus boss admits errors , considers failure as a400m remains grounded großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in reality , the a400m has not even left the ground airbus faces a turbulent time as expectant customers of its much-maligned and error-plagued a400m military transport plane weigh up their options and airbus chief enders considers the consequences of failure . the a400m may in time become known as ' the albatross ' .
not because of its wide wingspan or its ability to fly for incredible distances without a break but because it may become the aircraft tied around the neck of manufacturer airbus as it sinks towards the murky depths .
the error-ridden and maligned military transporter project has prompted discussion , argument and consternation for some time among potential customers and the manufacturers themselves .
but no comments could prove as damaging as those recently uttered by thomas enders , the boss of airbus .
enders revealed in an interview with der spiegel news magazine that he believed that , under its original conditions and plans , the a400m could not be built and that the seemingly doomed nature of the project had much to do with huge errors within his own company .
the a400m has been plagued by setbacks , with the aircraft 's first flight postponed to a date that has yet to be determined because of engine problems .
a never-ending nightmare ?
" under the previous conditions we can not build the airplane , " admitted enders .
" but , better an end with a fright than a fright with no end . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders hopes that the worst will soon be over while the " end with a fright " may mean that after realizing that the current plans need to be scrapped thus sending the a400m back to the drawing board , the " fright with no end " - a continuing nightmare which ends with the death of the whole project - may not be as unavoidable as some may think .
enders himself admitted that he has considered the ultimate failure of the project and while a new plan is taking shape as to how to progress with the a400m , the prospect of current orders for the problem-plagued plane being cancelled is a real possibility .
german deputy defense minister ruediger wolf said only last week that cancelling orders on the military transport plane was a serious option .
" i have been waiting to hear about the problems with the a400m but until today we have no detailed information about what they are and whether these are solvable , " criticized wolf .
wolf told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that to bring pressure on airbus ' parent company the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- , " cancellation must be a serious option after a delay of three to six months . "
wolf , who was quoted indirectly by sueddeutsche zeitung , said it was more realistic to extend to six months a moratorium accorded to eads to get the program back on track .
customers considering cutting , reducing orders countries that have ordered the plane - belgium , britain , france , germany , luxembourg , spain and turkey - have suggested delaying from april 1 to july 1 the date on which they can begin to cancel contracts .
french defense official laurent collet-billon told reporters last week that paris might reduce the number of planes it has ordered .
france has signed on for 50 aircraft , while germany has ordered 60 .
eads was supposed to get the transport plane in the air for an inaugural flight in january 2008 , and the seven countries await a total of 180 a400ms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a400m is built but can not get off the ground deliveries had originally been scheduled to begin in 2009 , but the first delivery is now planned for 2012 and it is only in 2014 that eads will be able to deliver significant numbers of the aircraft to clients , according to reports .
meanwhile , mtu aero engines , the german engine maker at the centre of the row over the delays said on monday it was confident problems on the a400m would be resolved but declined to say when the plane would fly .
the company is responsible for the software needed to power the military transporter 's engines , and airbus says hitches in its development are largely to blame for delays of 3 to 4 years in the 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 27.29 billion -rrb- project .
" airbus has asked everyone involved to stick with the timetable , and they are all working hard on their respective parts of the project , " mtu chief executive egon behle told the company 's annual news conference . a consortium that includes mtu , rolls-royce and france 's safran is building the a400m 's massive turbo-prop engines .
they have said they have delivered a working test engine and deny causing the bulk of the delays . nda / dpa / reuters / spiegel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" rick wagoner stands for an imploded centralist system , " he said on tuesday , march 30 , calling the former ceo a symbol of grave mismanagement . franz said he looked forward to working with wagoner 's temporary replacement , gm president and chief operating officer fritz henderson , because he had significant experience with gm 's european units . henderson led a restructuring push at opel from mid-2004 through to the end of 2005 , cutting around 10,000 jobs and making the firm profitable for the first time in nearly five years . new strategies ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm ceo rick wagoner is stepping down at washington 's request other labor leaders , however , have said that while the management changeover is long overdue , it does not present a clear solution to the company 's problems since henderson 's plans for the future remain unclear .

not because of its wide wingspan or its ability to fly for incredible distances without a break but because it may become the aircraft tied around the neck of manufacturer airbus as it sinks towards the murky depths .
the error-ridden and maligned military transporter project has prompted discussion , argument and consternation for some time among potential customers and the manufacturers themselves .
but no comments could prove as damaging as those recently uttered by thomas enders , the boss of airbus .
enders revealed in an interview with der spiegel news magazine that he believed that , under its original conditions and plans , the a400m could not be built and that the seemingly doomed nature of the project had much to do with huge errors within his own company .
the a400m has been plagued by setbacks , with the aircraft 's first flight postponed to a date that has yet to be determined because of engine problems .
a never-ending nightmare ?
" under the previous conditions we can not build the airplane , " admitted enders .
" but , better an end with a fright than a fright with no end . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders hopes that the worst will soon be over while the " end with a fright " may mean that after realizing that the current plans need to be scrapped thus sending the a400m back to the drawing board , the " fright with no end " - a continuing nightmare which ends with the death of the whole project - may not be as unavoidable as some may think .
enders himself admitted that he has considered the ultimate failure of the project and while a new plan is taking shape as to how to progress with the a400m , the prospect of current orders for the problem-plagued plane being cancelled is a real possibility .
german deputy defense minister ruediger wolf said only last week that cancelling orders on the military transport plane was a serious option .
" i have been waiting to hear about the problems with the a400m but until today we have no detailed information about what they are and whether these are solvable , " criticized wolf .
wolf told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that to bring pressure on airbus ' parent company the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- , " cancellation must be a serious option after a delay of three to six months . "
wolf , who was quoted indirectly by sueddeutsche zeitung , said it was more realistic to extend to six months a moratorium accorded to eads to get the program back on track .
customers considering cutting , reducing orders countries that have ordered the plane - belgium , britain , france , germany , luxembourg , spain and turkey - have suggested delaying from april 1 to july 1 the date on which they can begin to cancel contracts .
french defense official laurent collet-billon told reporters last week that paris might reduce the number of planes it has ordered .
france has signed on for 50 aircraft , while germany has ordered 60 .
eads was supposed to get the transport plane in the air for an inaugural flight in january 2008 , and the seven countries await a total of 180 a400ms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a400m is built but can not get off the ground deliveries had originally been scheduled to begin in 2009 , but the first delivery is now planned for 2012 and it is only in 2014 that eads will be able to deliver significant numbers of the aircraft to clients , according to reports .
meanwhile , mtu aero engines , the german engine maker at the centre of the row over the delays said on monday it was confident problems on the a400m would be resolved but declined to say when the plane would fly .
the company is responsible for the software needed to power the military transporter 's engines , and airbus says hitches in its development are largely to blame for delays of 3 to 4 years in the 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 27.29 billion -rrb- project .
" airbus has asked everyone involved to stick with the timetable , and they are all working hard on their respective parts of the project , " mtu chief executive egon behle told the company 's annual news conference . a consortium that includes mtu , rolls-royce and france 's safran is building the a400m 's massive turbo-prop engines .

not because of its wide wingspan or its ability to fly for incredible distances without a break but because it may become the aircraft tied around the neck of manufacturer airbus as it sinks towards the murky depths .
the error-ridden and maligned military transporter project has prompted discussion , argument and consternation for some time among potential customers and the manufacturers themselves .
but no comments could prove as damaging as those recently uttered by thomas enders , the boss of airbus .
enders revealed in an interview with der spiegel news magazine that he believed that , under its original conditions and plans , the a400m could not be built and that the seemingly doomed nature of the project had much to do with huge errors within his own company .
the a400m has been plagued by setbacks , with the aircraft 's first flight postponed to a date that has yet to be determined because of engine problems .
a never-ending nightmare ?
" under the previous conditions we can not build the airplane , " admitted enders .
" but , better an end with a fright than a fright with no end . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders hopes that the worst will soon be over while the " end with a fright " may mean that after realizing that the current plans need to be scrapped thus sending the a400m back to the drawing board , the " fright with no end " - a continuing nightmare which ends with the death of the whole project - may not be as unavoidable as some may think .
enders himself admitted that he has considered the ultimate failure of the project and while a new plan is taking shape as to how to progress with the a400m , the prospect of current orders for the problem-plagued plane being cancelled is a real possibility .
german deputy defense minister ruediger wolf said only last week that cancelling orders on the military transport plane was a serious option .
" i have been waiting to hear about the problems with the a400m but until today we have no detailed information about what they are and whether these are solvable , " criticized wolf .
wolf told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that to bring pressure on airbus ' parent company the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- , " cancellation must be a serious option after a delay of three to six months . "
wolf , who was quoted indirectly by sueddeutsche zeitung , said it was more realistic to extend to six months a moratorium accorded to eads to get the program back on track .
customers considering cutting , reducing orders countries that have ordered the plane - belgium , britain , france , germany , luxembourg , spain and turkey - have suggested delaying from april 1 to july 1 the date on which they can begin to cancel contracts .
french defense official laurent collet-billon told reporters last week that paris might reduce the number of planes it has ordered .
france has signed on for 50 aircraft , while germany has ordered 60 .
eads was supposed to get the transport plane in the air for an inaugural flight in january 2008 , and the seven countries await a total of 180 a400ms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a400m is built but can not get off the ground deliveries had originally been scheduled to begin in 2009 , but the first delivery is now planned for 2012 and it is only in 2014 that eads will be able to deliver significant numbers of the aircraft to clients , according to reports .
meanwhile , mtu aero engines , the german engine maker at the centre of the row over the delays said on monday it was confident problems on the a400m would be resolved but declined to say when the plane would fly .
the company is responsible for the software needed to power the military transporter 's engines , and airbus says hitches in its development are largely to blame for delays of 3 to 4 years in the 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 27.29 billion -rrb- project .
" airbus has asked everyone involved to stick with the timetable , and they are all working hard on their respective parts of the project , " mtu chief executive egon behle told the company 's annual news conference . a consortium that includes mtu , rolls-royce and france 's safran is building the a400m 's massive turbo-prop engines .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 30.03.2009 opel workers welcome gm management shake-up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : changes at gm could have a major impact on opel employees at general motors ' subsidiary opel have welcomed the dismissal of the us company 's chief executive officer rick wagoner as an important step towards securing the troubled german carmaker 's future . klaus franz , the top employee representative at opel , said he was surprised that wagoner was not relieved of his post earlier . " rick wagoner stands for an imploded centralist system , " he said on tuesday , march 30 , calling the former ceo a symbol of grave mismanagement . franz said he looked forward to working with wagoner 's temporary replacement , gm president and chief operating officer fritz henderson , because he had significant experience with gm 's european units . henderson led a restructuring push at opel from mid-2004 through to the end of 2005 , cutting around 10,000 jobs and making the firm profitable for the first time in nearly five years . new strategies ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm ceo rick wagoner is stepping down at washington 's request other labor leaders , however , have said that while the management changeover is long overdue , it does not present a clear solution to the company 's problems since henderson 's plans for the future remain unclear . " we do n't know what concepts general motors ' new management team is likely to pursue , " said rainer einenkel , the head of the works council at opel 's bochum factory .
" what we do know is that if gm ca n't find a reasonable solution , then its regional subsidiaries in europe , including opel , will suffer .
if general motors fails and goes bankrupt , it will drag opel down with it . " for months opel managers have been looking to the german government for assistance aimed at preventing insolvency .
but fears that bail-out funds could be funneled away from opel to gm have left politicians unwilling to give the company , which employs some 26,000 people in germany , the support it provided to the financial industry . german chancellor angela merkel is due to visit opel headquarters in ruesselsheim on tuesday , but analysts have said it is unlikely she will announce any concrete plans for the company as long as the future of its us parent remains unclear . auto task force wagoner 's dismissal was ordered by an auto industry task force appointed by us president barack obama . a report published by the task force on monday rejected general motors ' request for up to $ 16 billion -lrb- 12.2 billion euros -rrb- in loans . it said gm had already received $ 13.5 billion of aid , and that the obama administration would only continue to fund the company for the next 60 days to allow management to develop a recovery plan . obama said if the restructuring efforts do not go far enough , he would have no choice but allow gm to fail and use bankruptcy laws to force the company 's reorganization . " the united states has no interest in running gm , " the president said .
" what we are interested in is giving gm an opportunity to finally make those much-needed changes that will let them emerge from this crisis a much stronger and more competitive company . " chrysler merger obama told the american auto industry 's other problem child , chrysler , that its situation was even worse . he gave its managers emergency funding for just 30 more days , telling them they must finalize a merger deal with italian carmaker fiat , or another suitable partner , or they would be left to fail . obama 's warning may have been harsh , but it appears to have been effective .
chrysler and fiat announced they had agreed on a framework for an alliance within 90 minutes of the president 's speech . sje / sh / sms / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de direct stake in opel would be bad news for germany , says merkel chancellor angela merkel made resolute use of the word " no " during a closely watched television appearance , stressing that germany will neither buy a direct stake in the failing carmaker opel , nor hold early elections .
-lrb- 23.03.2009 -rrb- no breakthrough for guttenberg on opel 's future with 26,000 german jobs hanging in the balance , all eyes were on new economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg as he visited the us to rescue gm 's opel unit .

" rick wagoner stands for an imploded centralist system , " he said on tuesday , march 30 , calling the former ceo a symbol of grave mismanagement . franz said he looked forward to working with wagoner 's temporary replacement , gm president and chief operating officer fritz henderson , because he had significant experience with gm 's european units . henderson led a restructuring push at opel from mid-2004 through to the end of 2005 , cutting around 10,000 jobs and making the firm profitable for the first time in nearly five years . new strategies ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm ceo rick wagoner is stepping down at washington 's request other labor leaders , however , have said that while the management changeover is long overdue , it does not present a clear solution to the company 's problems since henderson 's plans for the future remain unclear . " we do n't know what concepts general motors ' new management team is likely to pursue , " said rainer einenkel , the head of the works council at opel 's bochum factory .
" what we do know is that if gm ca n't find a reasonable solution , then its regional subsidiaries in europe , including opel , will suffer .
if general motors fails and goes bankrupt , it will drag opel down with it . " for months opel managers have been looking to the german government for assistance aimed at preventing insolvency .
but fears that bail-out funds could be funneled away from opel to gm have left politicians unwilling to give the company , which employs some 26,000 people in germany , the support it provided to the financial industry . german chancellor angela merkel is due to visit opel headquarters in ruesselsheim on tuesday , but analysts have said it is unlikely she will announce any concrete plans for the company as long as the future of its us parent remains unclear . auto task force wagoner 's dismissal was ordered by an auto industry task force appointed by us president barack obama . a report published by the task force on monday rejected general motors ' request for up to $ 16 billion -lrb- 12.2 billion euros -rrb- in loans . it said gm had already received $ 13.5 billion of aid , and that the obama administration would only continue to fund the company for the next 60 days to allow management to develop a recovery plan . obama said if the restructuring efforts do not go far enough , he would have no choice but allow gm to fail and use bankruptcy laws to force the company 's reorganization . " the united states has no interest in running gm , " the president said .
" what we are interested in is giving gm an opportunity to finally make those much-needed changes that will let them emerge from this crisis a much stronger and more competitive company . " chrysler merger obama told the american auto industry 's other problem child , chrysler , that its situation was even worse . he gave its managers emergency funding for just 30 more days , telling them they must finalize a merger deal with italian carmaker fiat , or another suitable partner , or they would be left to fail . obama 's warning may have been harsh , but it appears to have been effective .
chrysler and fiat announced they had agreed on a framework for an alliance within 90 minutes of the president 's speech . sje / sh / sms / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not because of its wide wingspan or its ability to fly for incredible distances without a break but because it may become the aircraft tied around the neck of manufacturer airbus as it sinks towards the murky depths .
the error-ridden and maligned military transporter project has prompted discussion , argument and consternation for some time among potential customers and the manufacturers themselves .
but no comments could prove as damaging as those recently uttered by thomas enders , the boss of airbus .
enders revealed in an interview with der spiegel news magazine that he believed that , under its original conditions and plans , the a400m could not be built and that the seemingly doomed nature of the project had much to do with huge errors within his own company .
the a400m has been plagued by setbacks , with the aircraft 's first flight postponed to a date that has yet to be determined because of engine problems .
a never-ending nightmare ?
" under the previous conditions we can not build the airplane , " admitted enders .
" but , better an end with a fright than a fright with no end . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders hopes that the worst will soon be over while the " end with a fright " may mean that after realizing that the current plans need to be scrapped thus sending the a400m back to the drawing board , the " fright with no end " - a continuing nightmare which ends with the death of the whole project - may not be as unavoidable as some may think .
enders himself admitted that he has considered the ultimate failure of the project and while a new plan is taking shape as to how to progress with the a400m , the prospect of current orders for the problem-plagued plane being cancelled is a real possibility .
german deputy defense minister ruediger wolf said only last week that cancelling orders on the military transport plane was a serious option .
" i have been waiting to hear about the problems with the a400m but until today we have no detailed information about what they are and whether these are solvable , " criticized wolf .
wolf told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that to bring pressure on airbus ' parent company the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- , " cancellation must be a serious option after a delay of three to six months . "
wolf , who was quoted indirectly by sueddeutsche zeitung , said it was more realistic to extend to six months a moratorium accorded to eads to get the program back on track .
customers considering cutting , reducing orders countries that have ordered the plane - belgium , britain , france , germany , luxembourg , spain and turkey - have suggested delaying from april 1 to july 1 the date on which they can begin to cancel contracts .
french defense official laurent collet-billon told reporters last week that paris might reduce the number of planes it has ordered .
france has signed on for 50 aircraft , while germany has ordered 60 .
eads was supposed to get the transport plane in the air for an inaugural flight in january 2008 , and the seven countries await a total of 180 a400ms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a400m is built but can not get off the ground deliveries had originally been scheduled to begin in 2009 , but the first delivery is now planned for 2012 and it is only in 2014 that eads will be able to deliver significant numbers of the aircraft to clients , according to reports .
meanwhile , mtu aero engines , the german engine maker at the centre of the row over the delays said on monday it was confident problems on the a400m would be resolved but declined to say when the plane would fly .
the company is responsible for the software needed to power the military transporter 's engines , and airbus says hitches in its development are largely to blame for delays of 3 to 4 years in the 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 27.29 billion -rrb- project .
" airbus has asked everyone involved to stick with the timetable , and they are all working hard on their respective parts of the project , " mtu chief executive egon behle told the company 's annual news conference . a consortium that includes mtu , rolls-royce and france 's safran is building the a400m 's massive turbo-prop engines .
they have said they have delivered a working test engine and deny causing the bulk of the delays . nda / dpa / reuters / spiegel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 encompassed 47 concrete measures that range from a better global financial regulatory body to new rules for executive compensation . the majority of the items agreed on at the historic meeting in the us capital were supposed to be implemented by the end of march .
in the meantime , a proper sideline in " summit tourism " has emerged . whether in the european union , the united nations or the southeast asian association of nations -lrb- asean -rrb- , everyone has been searching for an answer to the question : what should the international financial architecture of the future look like ? german chancellor angela merkel laid out her criteria at a meeting of leading european industrial nations in berlin at the end of february . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has insisted all markets and financial products be regulated " we all accept that all the financial markets , -lrb- financial -rrb- products and -lrb- market -rrb- participants - including hedge funds , including ratings agencies and other private bidders - should be subject to a supervisory and regulatory body , " merkel said .
" the necessary details of this must be worked out and included as part of the action plan . " the head of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet , put it more succinctly . " everything has to change , " he said , adding that the current crisis has shown that the entire system is too vulnerable and not resistant enough . transparency , accountability the core points of the action plan are meant to address this problem with improved transparency and more accountability on the financial markets , as well as better control and regulation of these markets . authorities will , for the first time , be able to impose minimum limits for capital and liquidity on hedge funds in the countries where the funds are active , not where they have their headquarters .
such measures aim to stop these funds from fleeing to unregulated havens such as the cayman islands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regulation or stimulus will be a major issue at the g20 summit these are bitter pills to swallow for british and american fund operators .
in the past , they used to just smile lightly when others warned of the dangers of unbridled capitalism .
but now there 's little doubt that leaders such as new us treasury secretary timothy geithner mean business . " such risks know no national borders , " geithner said .
" we have to keep a much stricter eye on things and pass clear rules of play for the international financial system .
comprehensive changes on both the national and international level will demand it . " germany introduces " risk map " germany has introduced what it calls a " risk map " to the international proceedings .
it is designed to reflect the situation of all market participants and financial products , and if need be , signal an alarm . the map will be complemented by a global credit register of all loans above a certain size .
officials have admitted that it will be a tough task to gather all the data needed , but leaders hope such a measure will bring them further down the road to a new order for the global financial system . merkel has said she is convinced that important steps will be taken at the g20 summit in london .
following bilateral talks with british prime minister gordon brown in mid-march , she said she was optimistic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis has affected the entire world " with the united states , and with emerging economies like china and india -lrb- involved -rrb- , we 'll achieve results that will ensure that , with regulation , with supervision , such a crisis can not repeat itself , " merkel said . the litmus test of such big words , however , will be in the details .
accountability , equity monitoring , the international cooperation of supervisory bodies - to achieve these things , the experts must first do much highly complex detail work that then has to be implemented and coordinated on the national and international level . the heads of state gathering in london will surely not be at a loss for words to describe their common purpose .

15 encompassed 47 concrete measures that range from a better global financial regulatory body to new rules for executive compensation . the majority of the items agreed on at the historic meeting in the us capital were supposed to be implemented by the end of march .
in the meantime , a proper sideline in " summit tourism " has emerged . whether in the european union , the united nations or the southeast asian association of nations -lrb- asean -rrb- , everyone has been searching for an answer to the question : what should the international financial architecture of the future look like ? german chancellor angela merkel laid out her criteria at a meeting of leading european industrial nations in berlin at the end of february . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has insisted all markets and financial products be regulated " we all accept that all the financial markets , -lrb- financial -rrb- products and -lrb- market -rrb- participants - including hedge funds , including ratings agencies and other private bidders - should be subject to a supervisory and regulatory body , " merkel said .
" the necessary details of this must be worked out and included as part of the action plan . " the head of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet , put it more succinctly . " everything has to change , " he said , adding that the current crisis has shown that the entire system is too vulnerable and not resistant enough . transparency , accountability the core points of the action plan are meant to address this problem with improved transparency and more accountability on the financial markets , as well as better control and regulation of these markets . authorities will , for the first time , be able to impose minimum limits for capital and liquidity on hedge funds in the countries where the funds are active , not where they have their headquarters .
such measures aim to stop these funds from fleeing to unregulated havens such as the cayman islands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regulation or stimulus will be a major issue at the g20 summit these are bitter pills to swallow for british and american fund operators .
in the past , they used to just smile lightly when others warned of the dangers of unbridled capitalism .
but now there 's little doubt that leaders such as new us treasury secretary timothy geithner mean business . " such risks know no national borders , " geithner said .
" we have to keep a much stricter eye on things and pass clear rules of play for the international financial system .
comprehensive changes on both the national and international level will demand it . " germany introduces " risk map " germany has introduced what it calls a " risk map " to the international proceedings .
it is designed to reflect the situation of all market participants and financial products , and if need be , signal an alarm . the map will be complemented by a global credit register of all loans above a certain size .
officials have admitted that it will be a tough task to gather all the data needed , but leaders hope such a measure will bring them further down the road to a new order for the global financial system . merkel has said she is convinced that important steps will be taken at the g20 summit in london .
following bilateral talks with british prime minister gordon brown in mid-march , she said she was optimistic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis has affected the entire world " with the united states , and with emerging economies like china and india -lrb- involved -rrb- , we 'll achieve results that will ensure that , with regulation , with supervision , such a crisis can not repeat itself , " merkel said . the litmus test of such big words , however , will be in the details .
accountability , equity monitoring , the international cooperation of supervisory bodies - to achieve these things , the experts must first do much highly complex detail work that then has to be implemented and coordinated on the national and international level . the heads of state gathering in london will surely not be at a loss for words to describe their common purpose .
grand statements were already being made following the summit in washington by people such as eu commission president jose manuel barroso , who spoke of " laying the foundations for a new global accord .

but the issue of more troops remains off the table . the concession , which again fell short of fulfilling requests for more troops – and in germany 's case , combat troops , comes ahead of a 60th anniversary nato summit this week where allied contributions to the conflict in afghanistan will once more be a hot topic .
" we want to make this mission a success and that means giving afghanistan the means to take care of its own security , " chancellor angela merkel said in her weekly video podcast .
" in particular , it means that we must do more qualitatively in the training of soldiers and police .
germany is ready to do its duty . "
merkel , who faces an election in six months time , has already told president barack obama - who will attend the nato summit hosted by germany and france - that berlin will not increase the number of combat troops it can send to afghanistan .
germany has also resisted pressure from allies to send its troops to the more dangerous southern areas of the country , where allied forces are battling a taliban insurgency .
germany has 3,800 troops engaged in training and reconstruction programs in the north of the country .
it can push that number as high as 4,500 , based on a parliamentary mandate approved last year and has pledged extra troops ahead of the august elections , as part of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- but stands firm on involving its troops in any military action .
obama not expected to push for troops at summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants more commitment in the fight against the taliban unveiling his new afghanistan strategy last friday , obama said the united states would continue to seek contributions from allies for combat forces , trainers and mentors , strategic lift and equipment , although he is not expected to ask for an increased troop commitment at this week 's nato summit .
deputy foreign minister gernot erler told german radio that germany welcomed obama 's focus on more training and would be ready to step up its efforts in this area .
" i think we will be ready in germany to think about a stronger contribution in the area of training , " he said .
nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer urged european countries to step up their efforts in afghanistan as the defense organization prepared for its landmark summit .
" it 's not acceptable that only the united states strengthens its engagement , " he told the sunday edition of germany 's bild newspaper .
" the europeans must do more too , whether its in the military or civilian area . "

" whether these troops stay longer or head home straight after the elections , is another matter , " jones said in the interview published sunday .
the former general said that even if president obama did not directly call for increased efforts at the nato conference , it did not mean that the us was letting anyone off the hook .
" from the fact that the usa has not made public detailed demands to its allies , one can not deduce that the request does not exist , " jones said .

" in my opinion , it is necessary to stay in afghanistan for the foreseeable future , " de hoop scheffer said , adding that he had so far seen " positive reactions " to a new strategy unveiled by obama last week . the obama plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama will consult with allies about his plan when he comes to europe this week obama 's plan , which has no set timetable for withdrawal , is to send 4,000 us troops to train afghan security forces to fight militants in the country . these forces would be in addition to an earlier announced reinforcement of 17,000 extra us troops to bolster the war effort .
the united states would then have 55,000 troops stationed in afghanistan - 23,000 more than those supplied by the remaining nato members and other countries involved in military operations . obama will be consulting with allies on his plan when heads of state and government of nato members gather in the french city of strasbourg and in the german town of baden-baden on april 3 and 4 to celebrate the alliance 's 60th birthday . financing the war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has almost 3,500 troops stationed in afghanistan de hoop scheffer confirmed that he would call on the international community to contribute $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.5 billion euros -rrb- a year to train afghanistan 's security forces . he acknowledged that this was a lot of money , but said that it should be seen in relation to the informal estimate of roughly $ 42 billion the war is costing nato and its allies . " the allies need to do their part , " he said .
" i would not like to see a mission that is out of balance in this regard . " de hoop scheffer explained that while the obama administration has indicated it wo n't be continuing its predecessor 's policy of pressuring often reluctant allies to supply more troops , european capitals would nonetheless face calls to contribute in other ways , for example with reconstruction or in the civilian training effort . senior officials from around the world , including us secretary of state hillary clinton , un secretary-general ban ki-moon and afghan president hamid karzai , will join de hoop scheffer at the donor conference . additionally , the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , the european union , asian development bank , international monetary fund and world bank are sending delegates . mrm / sh / sms / ap / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not because of its wide wingspan or its ability to fly for incredible distances without a break but because it may become the aircraft tied around the neck of manufacturer airbus as it sinks towards the murky depths .
the error-ridden and maligned military transporter project has prompted discussion , argument and consternation for some time among potential customers and the manufacturers themselves .
but no comments could prove as damaging as those recently uttered by thomas enders , the boss of airbus .
enders revealed in an interview with der spiegel news magazine that he believed that , under its original conditions and plans , the a400m could not be built and that the seemingly doomed nature of the project had much to do with huge errors within his own company .
the a400m has been plagued by setbacks , with the aircraft 's first flight postponed to a date that has yet to be determined because of engine problems .
a never-ending nightmare ?
" under the previous conditions we can not build the airplane , " admitted enders .
" but , better an end with a fright than a fright with no end . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders hopes that the worst will soon be over while the " end with a fright " may mean that after realizing that the current plans need to be scrapped thus sending the a400m back to the drawing board , the " fright with no end " - a continuing nightmare which ends with the death of the whole project - may not be as unavoidable as some may think .
enders himself admitted that he has considered the ultimate failure of the project and while a new plan is taking shape as to how to progress with the a400m , the prospect of current orders for the problem-plagued plane being cancelled is a real possibility .
german deputy defense minister ruediger wolf said only last week that cancelling orders on the military transport plane was a serious option .
" i have been waiting to hear about the problems with the a400m but until today we have no detailed information about what they are and whether these are solvable , " criticized wolf .
wolf told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that to bring pressure on airbus ' parent company the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- , " cancellation must be a serious option after a delay of three to six months . "
wolf , who was quoted indirectly by sueddeutsche zeitung , said it was more realistic to extend to six months a moratorium accorded to eads to get the program back on track .
customers considering cutting , reducing orders countries that have ordered the plane - belgium , britain , france , germany , luxembourg , spain and turkey - have suggested delaying from april 1 to july 1 the date on which they can begin to cancel contracts .
french defense official laurent collet-billon told reporters last week that paris might reduce the number of planes it has ordered .
france has signed on for 50 aircraft , while germany has ordered 60 .
eads was supposed to get the transport plane in the air for an inaugural flight in january 2008 , and the seven countries await a total of 180 a400ms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a400m is built but can not get off the ground deliveries had originally been scheduled to begin in 2009 , but the first delivery is now planned for 2012 and it is only in 2014 that eads will be able to deliver significant numbers of the aircraft to clients , according to reports .
meanwhile , mtu aero engines , the german engine maker at the centre of the row over the delays said on monday it was confident problems on the a400m would be resolved but declined to say when the plane would fly .
the company is responsible for the software needed to power the military transporter 's engines , and airbus says hitches in its development are largely to blame for delays of 3 to 4 years in the 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 27.29 billion -rrb- project .
" airbus has asked everyone involved to stick with the timetable , and they are all working hard on their respective parts of the project , " mtu chief executive egon behle told the company 's annual news conference . a consortium that includes mtu , rolls-royce and france 's safran is building the a400m 's massive turbo-prop engines .
they have said they have delivered a working test engine and deny causing the bulk of the delays . nda / dpa / reuters / spiegel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not because of its wide wingspan or its ability to fly for incredible distances without a break but because it may become the aircraft tied around the neck of manufacturer airbus as it sinks towards the murky depths .
the error-ridden and maligned military transporter project has prompted discussion , argument and consternation for some time among potential customers and the manufacturers themselves .
but no comments could prove as damaging as those recently uttered by thomas enders , the boss of airbus .
enders revealed in an interview with der spiegel news magazine that he believed that , under its original conditions and plans , the a400m could not be built and that the seemingly doomed nature of the project had much to do with huge errors within his own company .
the a400m has been plagued by setbacks , with the aircraft 's first flight postponed to a date that has yet to be determined because of engine problems .
a never-ending nightmare ?
" under the previous conditions we can not build the airplane , " admitted enders .
" but , better an end with a fright than a fright with no end . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders hopes that the worst will soon be over while the " end with a fright " may mean that after realizing that the current plans need to be scrapped thus sending the a400m back to the drawing board , the " fright with no end " - a continuing nightmare which ends with the death of the whole project - may not be as unavoidable as some may think .
enders himself admitted that he has considered the ultimate failure of the project and while a new plan is taking shape as to how to progress with the a400m , the prospect of current orders for the problem-plagued plane being cancelled is a real possibility .
german deputy defense minister ruediger wolf said only last week that cancelling orders on the military transport plane was a serious option .
" i have been waiting to hear about the problems with the a400m but until today we have no detailed information about what they are and whether these are solvable , " criticized wolf .
wolf told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that to bring pressure on airbus ' parent company the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- , " cancellation must be a serious option after a delay of three to six months . "
wolf , who was quoted indirectly by sueddeutsche zeitung , said it was more realistic to extend to six months a moratorium accorded to eads to get the program back on track .

" in my opinion , it is necessary to stay in afghanistan for the foreseeable future , " de hoop scheffer said , adding that he had so far seen " positive reactions " to a new strategy unveiled by obama last week . the obama plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama will consult with allies about his plan when he comes to europe this week obama 's plan , which has no set timetable for withdrawal , is to send 4,000 us troops to train afghan security forces to fight militants in the country . these forces would be in addition to an earlier announced reinforcement of 17,000 extra us troops to bolster the war effort .
the united states would then have 55,000 troops stationed in afghanistan - 23,000 more than those supplied by the remaining nato members and other countries involved in military operations . obama will be consulting with allies on his plan when heads of state and government of nato members gather in the french city of strasbourg and in the german town of baden-baden on april 3 and 4 to celebrate the alliance 's 60th birthday . financing the war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has almost 3,500 troops stationed in afghanistan de hoop scheffer confirmed that he would call on the international community to contribute $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.5 billion euros -rrb- a year to train afghanistan 's security forces . he acknowledged that this was a lot of money , but said that it should be seen in relation to the informal estimate of roughly $ 42 billion the war is costing nato and its allies . " the allies need to do their part , " he said .
" i would not like to see a mission that is out of balance in this regard . " de hoop scheffer explained that while the obama administration has indicated it wo n't be continuing its predecessor 's policy of pressuring often reluctant allies to supply more troops , european capitals would nonetheless face calls to contribute in other ways , for example with reconstruction or in the civilian training effort . senior officials from around the world , including us secretary of state hillary clinton , un secretary-general ban ki-moon and afghan president hamid karzai , will join de hoop scheffer at the donor conference . additionally , the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , the european union , asian development bank , international monetary fund and world bank are sending delegates . mrm / sh / sms / ap / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aerospace -pipe- 30.03.2009 airbus boss admits errors , considers failure as a400m remains grounded großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in reality , the a400m has not even left the ground airbus faces a turbulent time as expectant customers of its much-maligned and error-plagued a400m military transport plane weigh up their options and airbus chief enders considers the consequences of failure . the a400m may in time become known as ' the albatross ' .
not because of its wide wingspan or its ability to fly for incredible distances without a break but because it may become the aircraft tied around the neck of manufacturer airbus as it sinks towards the murky depths .
the error-ridden and maligned military transporter project has prompted discussion , argument and consternation for some time among potential customers and the manufacturers themselves .
but no comments could prove as damaging as those recently uttered by thomas enders , the boss of airbus .
enders revealed in an interview with der spiegel news magazine that he believed that , under its original conditions and plans , the a400m could not be built and that the seemingly doomed nature of the project had much to do with huge errors within his own company .
the a400m has been plagued by setbacks , with the aircraft 's first flight postponed to a date that has yet to be determined because of engine problems .
a never-ending nightmare ?
" under the previous conditions we can not build the airplane , " admitted enders .
" but , better an end with a fright than a fright with no end . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders hopes that the worst will soon be over while the " end with a fright " may mean that after realizing that the current plans need to be scrapped thus sending the a400m back to the drawing board , the " fright with no end " - a continuing nightmare which ends with the death of the whole project - may not be as unavoidable as some may think .
enders himself admitted that he has considered the ultimate failure of the project and while a new plan is taking shape as to how to progress with the a400m , the prospect of current orders for the problem-plagued plane being cancelled is a real possibility .
german deputy defense minister ruediger wolf said only last week that cancelling orders on the military transport plane was a serious option .
" i have been waiting to hear about the problems with the a400m but until today we have no detailed information about what they are and whether these are solvable , " criticized wolf .
wolf told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that to bring pressure on airbus ' parent company the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- , " cancellation must be a serious option after a delay of three to six months . "
wolf , who was quoted indirectly by sueddeutsche zeitung , said it was more realistic to extend to six months a moratorium accorded to eads to get the program back on track .
customers considering cutting , reducing orders countries that have ordered the plane - belgium , britain , france , germany , luxembourg , spain and turkey - have suggested delaying from april 1 to july 1 the date on which they can begin to cancel contracts .
french defense official laurent collet-billon told reporters last week that paris might reduce the number of planes it has ordered .
france has signed on for 50 aircraft , while germany has ordered 60 .
eads was supposed to get the transport plane in the air for an inaugural flight in january 2008 , and the seven countries await a total of 180 a400ms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a400m is built but can not get off the ground deliveries had originally been scheduled to begin in 2009 , but the first delivery is now planned for 2012 and it is only in 2014 that eads will be able to deliver significant numbers of the aircraft to clients , according to reports .
meanwhile , mtu aero engines , the german engine maker at the centre of the row over the delays said on monday it was confident problems on the a400m would be resolved but declined to say when the plane would fly .
the company is responsible for the software needed to power the military transporter 's engines , and airbus says hitches in its development are largely to blame for delays of 3 to 4 years in the 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 27.29 billion -rrb- project .
" airbus has asked everyone involved to stick with the timetable , and they are all working hard on their respective parts of the project , " mtu chief executive egon behle told the company 's annual news conference . a consortium that includes mtu , rolls-royce and france 's safran is building the a400m 's massive turbo-prop engines .
they have said they have delivered a working test engine and deny causing the bulk of the delays . nda / dpa / reuters / spiegel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" rick wagoner stands for an imploded centralist system , " he said on tuesday , march 30 , calling the former ceo a symbol of grave mismanagement . franz said he looked forward to working with wagoner 's temporary replacement , gm president and chief operating officer fritz henderson , because he had significant experience with gm 's european units . henderson led a restructuring push at opel from mid-2004 through to the end of 2005 , cutting around 10,000 jobs and making the firm profitable for the first time in nearly five years . new strategies ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm ceo rick wagoner is stepping down at washington 's request other labor leaders , however , have said that while the management changeover is long overdue , it does not present a clear solution to the company 's problems since henderson 's plans for the future remain unclear . " we do n't know what concepts general motors ' new management team is likely to pursue , " said rainer einenkel , the head of the works council at opel 's bochum factory .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 30.03.2009 germany to increase training role in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will increase its training of afghan police germany says it is ready to meet us president obama 's request for more resources in afghanistan , by stepping up its training of local police and security forces .
but the issue of more troops remains off the table . the concession , which again fell short of fulfilling requests for more troops – and in germany 's case , combat troops , comes ahead of a 60th anniversary nato summit this week where allied contributions to the conflict in afghanistan will once more be a hot topic .
" we want to make this mission a success and that means giving afghanistan the means to take care of its own security , " chancellor angela merkel said in her weekly video podcast .
" in particular , it means that we must do more qualitatively in the training of soldiers and police .
germany is ready to do its duty . "
merkel , who faces an election in six months time , has already told president barack obama - who will attend the nato summit hosted by germany and france - that berlin will not increase the number of combat troops it can send to afghanistan .
germany has also resisted pressure from allies to send its troops to the more dangerous southern areas of the country , where allied forces are battling a taliban insurgency .
germany has 3,800 troops engaged in training and reconstruction programs in the north of the country .
it can push that number as high as 4,500 , based on a parliamentary mandate approved last year and has pledged extra troops ahead of the august elections , as part of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- but stands firm on involving its troops in any military action .
obama not expected to push for troops at summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants more commitment in the fight against the taliban unveiling his new afghanistan strategy last friday , obama said the united states would continue to seek contributions from allies for combat forces , trainers and mentors , strategic lift and equipment , although he is not expected to ask for an increased troop commitment at this week 's nato summit .
deputy foreign minister gernot erler told german radio that germany welcomed obama 's focus on more training and would be ready to step up its efforts in this area .
" i think we will be ready in germany to think about a stronger contribution in the area of training , " he said .
nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer urged european countries to step up their efforts in afghanistan as the defense organization prepared for its landmark summit .
" it 's not acceptable that only the united states strengthens its engagement , " he told the sunday edition of germany 's bild newspaper .
" the europeans must do more too , whether its in the military or civilian area . "
new calls for europeans to pitch in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jones reiterated calls for more european involvement us security advisor james jones reiterated washington 's expectations in a newspaper interview published in the german daily tagesspiegel on sunday , echoing the nato chief 's calls for its european allies in nato to supplement their troop presence in afghanistan , at least during the country 's august election period .
" whether these troops stay longer or head home straight after the elections , is another matter , " jones said in the interview published sunday .
the former general said that even if president obama did not directly call for increased efforts at the nato conference , it did not mean that the us was letting anyone off the hook .
" from the fact that the usa has not made public detailed demands to its allies , one can not deduce that the request does not exist , " jones said .
" every nation is free in its decision . "
the security advisor further emphasized the importance of civil assistance projects provided by allied forces in afghanistan .
" the time has passed , in which the quality of the relationship is measured by the number of soldiers , " jones said , adding that military might alone " does not suffice in the conflicts we are now dealing with . "
in afghanistan , for example , a lot could be learned from the german contribution , he said , adding that germany had done a great deal to train the afghan police forces . nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the issue of more troops remains off the table . the concession , which again fell short of fulfilling requests for more troops – and in germany 's case , combat troops , comes ahead of a 60th anniversary nato summit this week where allied contributions to the conflict in afghanistan will once more be a hot topic .
" we want to make this mission a success and that means giving afghanistan the means to take care of its own security , " chancellor angela merkel said in her weekly video podcast .
" in particular , it means that we must do more qualitatively in the training of soldiers and police .
germany is ready to do its duty . "
merkel , who faces an election in six months time , has already told president barack obama - who will attend the nato summit hosted by germany and france - that berlin will not increase the number of combat troops it can send to afghanistan .
germany has also resisted pressure from allies to send its troops to the more dangerous southern areas of the country , where allied forces are battling a taliban insurgency .
germany has 3,800 troops engaged in training and reconstruction programs in the north of the country .
it can push that number as high as 4,500 , based on a parliamentary mandate approved last year and has pledged extra troops ahead of the august elections , as part of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- but stands firm on involving its troops in any military action .
obama not expected to push for troops at summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants more commitment in the fight against the taliban unveiling his new afghanistan strategy last friday , obama said the united states would continue to seek contributions from allies for combat forces , trainers and mentors , strategic lift and equipment , although he is not expected to ask for an increased troop commitment at this week 's nato summit .
deputy foreign minister gernot erler told german radio that germany welcomed obama 's focus on more training and would be ready to step up its efforts in this area .
" i think we will be ready in germany to think about a stronger contribution in the area of training , " he said .
nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer urged european countries to step up their efforts in afghanistan as the defense organization prepared for its landmark summit .
" it 's not acceptable that only the united states strengthens its engagement , " he told the sunday edition of germany 's bild newspaper .
" the europeans must do more too , whether its in the military or civilian area . "
new calls for europeans to pitch in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jones reiterated calls for more european involvement us security advisor james jones reiterated washington 's expectations in a newspaper interview published in the german daily tagesspiegel on sunday , echoing the nato chief 's calls for its european allies in nato to supplement their troop presence in afghanistan , at least during the country 's august election period .
" whether these troops stay longer or head home straight after the elections , is another matter , " jones said in the interview published sunday .
the former general said that even if president obama did not directly call for increased efforts at the nato conference , it did not mean that the us was letting anyone off the hook .
" from the fact that the usa has not made public detailed demands to its allies , one can not deduce that the request does not exist , " jones said .
" every nation is free in its decision . "
the security advisor further emphasized the importance of civil assistance projects provided by allied forces in afghanistan .
" the time has passed , in which the quality of the relationship is measured by the number of soldiers , " jones said , adding that military might alone " does not suffice in the conflicts we are now dealing with . "

nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer urged european countries to step up their efforts in afghanistan as the defense organization prepared for its landmark summit .
" it 's not acceptable that only the united states strengthens its engagement , " he told the sunday edition of germany 's bild newspaper .
" the europeans must do more too , whether its in the military or civilian area . "
new calls for europeans to pitch in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jones reiterated calls for more european involvement us security advisor james jones reiterated washington 's expectations in a newspaper interview published in the german daily tagesspiegel on sunday , echoing the nato chief 's calls for its european allies in nato to supplement their troop presence in afghanistan , at least during the country 's august election period .
" whether these troops stay longer or head home straight after the elections , is another matter , " jones said in the interview published sunday .
the former general said that even if president obama did not directly call for increased efforts at the nato conference , it did not mean that the us was letting anyone off the hook .
" from the fact that the usa has not made public detailed demands to its allies , one can not deduce that the request does not exist , " jones said .
" every nation is free in its decision . "
the security advisor further emphasized the importance of civil assistance projects provided by allied forces in afghanistan .
" the time has passed , in which the quality of the relationship is measured by the number of soldiers , " jones said , adding that military might alone " does not suffice in the conflicts we are now dealing with . "
in afghanistan , for example , a lot could be learned from the german contribution , he said , adding that germany had done a great deal to train the afghan police forces . nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" rick wagoner stands for an imploded centralist system , " he said on tuesday , march 30 , calling the former ceo a symbol of grave mismanagement . franz said he looked forward to working with wagoner 's temporary replacement , gm president and chief operating officer fritz henderson , because he had significant experience with gm 's european units . henderson led a restructuring push at opel from mid-2004 through to the end of 2005 , cutting around 10,000 jobs and making the firm profitable for the first time in nearly five years . new strategies ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm ceo rick wagoner is stepping down at washington 's request other labor leaders , however , have said that while the management changeover is long overdue , it does not present a clear solution to the company 's problems since henderson 's plans for the future remain unclear . " we do n't know what concepts general motors ' new management team is likely to pursue , " said rainer einenkel , the head of the works council at opel 's bochum factory .
" what we do know is that if gm ca n't find a reasonable solution , then its regional subsidiaries in europe , including opel , will suffer .
if general motors fails and goes bankrupt , it will drag opel down with it . " for months opel managers have been looking to the german government for assistance aimed at preventing insolvency .
but fears that bail-out funds could be funneled away from opel to gm have left politicians unwilling to give the company , which employs some 26,000 people in germany , the support it provided to the financial industry . german chancellor angela merkel is due to visit opel headquarters in ruesselsheim on tuesday , but analysts have said it is unlikely she will announce any concrete plans for the company as long as the future of its us parent remains unclear . auto task force wagoner 's dismissal was ordered by an auto industry task force appointed by us president barack obama . a report published by the task force on monday rejected general motors ' request for up to $ 16 billion -lrb- 12.2 billion euros -rrb- in loans . it said gm had already received $ 13.5 billion of aid , and that the obama administration would only continue to fund the company for the next 60 days to allow management to develop a recovery plan . obama said if the restructuring efforts do not go far enough , he would have no choice but allow gm to fail and use bankruptcy laws to force the company 's reorganization . " the united states has no interest in running gm , " the president said .
" what we are interested in is giving gm an opportunity to finally make those much-needed changes that will let them emerge from this crisis a much stronger and more competitive company . " chrysler merger obama told the american auto industry 's other problem child , chrysler , that its situation was even worse . he gave its managers emergency funding for just 30 more days , telling them they must finalize a merger deal with italian carmaker fiat , or another suitable partner , or they would be left to fail . obama 's warning may have been harsh , but it appears to have been effective .

not because of its wide wingspan or its ability to fly for incredible distances without a break but because it may become the aircraft tied around the neck of manufacturer airbus as it sinks towards the murky depths .
the error-ridden and maligned military transporter project has prompted discussion , argument and consternation for some time among potential customers and the manufacturers themselves .
but no comments could prove as damaging as those recently uttered by thomas enders , the boss of airbus .
enders revealed in an interview with der spiegel news magazine that he believed that , under its original conditions and plans , the a400m could not be built and that the seemingly doomed nature of the project had much to do with huge errors within his own company .
the a400m has been plagued by setbacks , with the aircraft 's first flight postponed to a date that has yet to be determined because of engine problems .
a never-ending nightmare ?
" under the previous conditions we can not build the airplane , " admitted enders .
" but , better an end with a fright than a fright with no end . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders hopes that the worst will soon be over while the " end with a fright " may mean that after realizing that the current plans need to be scrapped thus sending the a400m back to the drawing board , the " fright with no end " - a continuing nightmare which ends with the death of the whole project - may not be as unavoidable as some may think .
enders himself admitted that he has considered the ultimate failure of the project and while a new plan is taking shape as to how to progress with the a400m , the prospect of current orders for the problem-plagued plane being cancelled is a real possibility .
german deputy defense minister ruediger wolf said only last week that cancelling orders on the military transport plane was a serious option .
" i have been waiting to hear about the problems with the a400m but until today we have no detailed information about what they are and whether these are solvable , " criticized wolf .
wolf told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that to bring pressure on airbus ' parent company the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- , " cancellation must be a serious option after a delay of three to six months . "
wolf , who was quoted indirectly by sueddeutsche zeitung , said it was more realistic to extend to six months a moratorium accorded to eads to get the program back on track .
customers considering cutting , reducing orders countries that have ordered the plane - belgium , britain , france , germany , luxembourg , spain and turkey - have suggested delaying from april 1 to july 1 the date on which they can begin to cancel contracts .
french defense official laurent collet-billon told reporters last week that paris might reduce the number of planes it has ordered .
france has signed on for 50 aircraft , while germany has ordered 60 .
eads was supposed to get the transport plane in the air for an inaugural flight in january 2008 , and the seven countries await a total of 180 a400ms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a400m is built but can not get off the ground deliveries had originally been scheduled to begin in 2009 , but the first delivery is now planned for 2012 and it is only in 2014 that eads will be able to deliver significant numbers of the aircraft to clients , according to reports .
meanwhile , mtu aero engines , the german engine maker at the centre of the row over the delays said on monday it was confident problems on the a400m would be resolved but declined to say when the plane would fly .
the company is responsible for the software needed to power the military transporter 's engines , and airbus says hitches in its development are largely to blame for delays of 3 to 4 years in the 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 27.29 billion -rrb- project .
" airbus has asked everyone involved to stick with the timetable , and they are all working hard on their respective parts of the project , " mtu chief executive egon behle told the company 's annual news conference . a consortium that includes mtu , rolls-royce and france 's safran is building the a400m 's massive turbo-prop engines .
they have said they have delivered a working test engine and deny causing the bulk of the delays . nda / dpa / reuters / spiegel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in my opinion , it is necessary to stay in afghanistan for the foreseeable future , " de hoop scheffer said , adding that he had so far seen " positive reactions " to a new strategy unveiled by obama last week . the obama plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama will consult with allies about his plan when he comes to europe this week obama 's plan , which has no set timetable for withdrawal , is to send 4,000 us troops to train afghan security forces to fight militants in the country . these forces would be in addition to an earlier announced reinforcement of 17,000 extra us troops to bolster the war effort .
the united states would then have 55,000 troops stationed in afghanistan - 23,000 more than those supplied by the remaining nato members and other countries involved in military operations . obama will be consulting with allies on his plan when heads of state and government of nato members gather in the french city of strasbourg and in the german town of baden-baden on april 3 and 4 to celebrate the alliance 's 60th birthday . financing the war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has almost 3,500 troops stationed in afghanistan de hoop scheffer confirmed that he would call on the international community to contribute $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.5 billion euros -rrb- a year to train afghanistan 's security forces . he acknowledged that this was a lot of money , but said that it should be seen in relation to the informal estimate of roughly $ 42 billion the war is costing nato and its allies . " the allies need to do their part , " he said .
" i would not like to see a mission that is out of balance in this regard . " de hoop scheffer explained that while the obama administration has indicated it wo n't be continuing its predecessor 's policy of pressuring often reluctant allies to supply more troops , european capitals would nonetheless face calls to contribute in other ways , for example with reconstruction or in the civilian training effort . senior officials from around the world , including us secretary of state hillary clinton , un secretary-general ban ki-moon and afghan president hamid karzai , will join de hoop scheffer at the donor conference . additionally , the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , the european union , asian development bank , international monetary fund and world bank are sending delegates . mrm / sh / sms / ap / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i have made an offer to terminate my contract with the supervisory board chairman , " mehdorn said monday , march 30 , at a press conference to announce deutsche bahn 's annual financial results .
" i assume that a successor will be appointed before the summer holidays " begin in july . mehdorn , who has run the state-owned firm since 1999 , has been under increasing pressure ever since it was revealed earlier this year that deutsche bahn accessed confidential staff data as far back as 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn has come under heavy criticism for taking a closer look at its employees mehdorn admitted in february that , as part of an anti-corruption campaign , deutsche bahn spied on 173,000 of its 220,000 employees in 2002 and 2003 .
official documents have since shown deutsche bahn screened its entire workforce again in 2005 for corruption . in total , the records show that almost all railway employees would have been checked three times , and around 800 top managers would have been scrutinized twice . the german government said it had " taken note " of mehdorn 's offer to quit and praised his role in turning deutsche bahn into a " world-leading transport and logistics company . " " the financial success of recent years and the securing of 220,000 jobs are clearly linked to the high level of mehdorn 's personal engagement and corporate know-how , " the government said in a statement . as recently as friday it was reported that deutsche bahn had also monitored the e-mails of staff to check whether they had contacted journalists or parliamentarians in a bid to find employees critical of the company 's policies . over the weekend , the company was forced to admit that it deleted a 2007 e-mail calling for strike action that was sent by train drivers union gdl to thousands of employees . in an interview with the german sunday newspaper welt am sonntag , german chancellor angela merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm denied a report that the chancellor was keen to keep mehdorn in his post until an independent report on the snooping scandal was completed in may , adding that the issue could not be allowed to drag on for weeks . this , and a statement from an unnamed source who told reuters that berlin was " putting out feelers " for a potential successor , suggested that mehdorn was living on borrowed time . german politicians call time on mehdorn 's reign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these have been dark days for mehdorn and deutsche bahn a chorus of german politicians joining together to criticize the bahn chief added to the sense that mehdorn 's refusal to resign would become a mute point in the coming days . " i do not believe that hartmut mehdorn can remain on as the boss of deutsche bahn , " said transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , a member of the the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
" my impression is that parliament and the federal government does not take him seriously and is beginning to understand the criticism . " " the man must go , " said berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit , while his social democrat colleague and vice president of the party 's bundestag group klaas huebner told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , " any politician who found themselves in the same position could no longer stay in their post . " merkel " must finally terminate -lrb- mehdorn 's -rrb- untenable position with the bahn , " said dietmar bartsch from the left party while greens party leader claudia roth said " bahn boss mehdorn can not stay a day longer . " others , however , were still loath to pass judgment until the full case against mehdorn is heard .
finance minister peer steinbrueck -lrb- spd -rrb- told german tv that he would " wait to see all the evidence before forming an opinion , let alone issuing a condemnation . " economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said it was n't up to politicians to determine mehdorn 's immediate fate . " it is reasonable to wait for the investigation and then to let those who have to decide make the decision , " said the minister , who is a member of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union .
" that is the job of the supervisory board . " mehdorn clings on to past glories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bidding farewell : mehdorn is stepping down mehdorn 's fall from grace has been spectacular for a man credited with turning deutsche bahn into a profitable global transport leader over the past decade . but he has been dogged by the revelations that his company spied on employees and has recently come under heavy criticism for his perceived arrogance in the affair , resisting calls to step down and maintaining that the company did not break the law . " under my leadership , -lrb- deutsche -rrb- bahn is in good shape despite the serious economic and financial crisis , " mehdorn told the sunday edition of germany 's bild newspaper , when asked why he had not resigned .
" our results are good and we are not laying off any workers in the crisis . " until now , mehdorn has enjoyed the support of the chancellor , who has stood by him in past confrontations and has sided with him on occasional battles with germany 's powerful transport unions . mehdorn 's decision to offer his resignation now relieves merkel of a burden which may have threatened her campaign in parliamentary elections scheduled for september . nda / sms / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i have made an offer to terminate my contract with the supervisory board chairman , " mehdorn said monday , march 30 , at a press conference to announce deutsche bahn 's annual financial results .
" i assume that a successor will be appointed before the summer holidays " begin in july . mehdorn , who has run the state-owned firm since 1999 , has been under increasing pressure ever since it was revealed earlier this year that deutsche bahn accessed confidential staff data as far back as 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn has come under heavy criticism for taking a closer look at its employees mehdorn admitted in february that , as part of an anti-corruption campaign , deutsche bahn spied on 173,000 of its 220,000 employees in 2002 and 2003 .
official documents have since shown deutsche bahn screened its entire workforce again in 2005 for corruption . in total , the records show that almost all railway employees would have been checked three times , and around 800 top managers would have been scrutinized twice . the german government said it had " taken note " of mehdorn 's offer to quit and praised his role in turning deutsche bahn into a " world-leading transport and logistics company . " " the financial success of recent years and the securing of 220,000 jobs are clearly linked to the high level of mehdorn 's personal engagement and corporate know-how , " the government said in a statement . as recently as friday it was reported that deutsche bahn had also monitored the e-mails of staff to check whether they had contacted journalists or parliamentarians in a bid to find employees critical of the company 's policies . over the weekend , the company was forced to admit that it deleted a 2007 e-mail calling for strike action that was sent by train drivers union gdl to thousands of employees . in an interview with the german sunday newspaper welt am sonntag , german chancellor angela merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm denied a report that the chancellor was keen to keep mehdorn in his post until an independent report on the snooping scandal was completed in may , adding that the issue could not be allowed to drag on for weeks . this , and a statement from an unnamed source who told reuters that berlin was " putting out feelers " for a potential successor , suggested that mehdorn was living on borrowed time . german politicians call time on mehdorn 's reign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these have been dark days for mehdorn and deutsche bahn a chorus of german politicians joining together to criticize the bahn chief added to the sense that mehdorn 's refusal to resign would become a mute point in the coming days . " i do not believe that hartmut mehdorn can remain on as the boss of deutsche bahn , " said transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , a member of the the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
" my impression is that parliament and the federal government does not take him seriously and is beginning to understand the criticism . " " the man must go , " said berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit , while his social democrat colleague and vice president of the party 's bundestag group klaas huebner told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , " any politician who found themselves in the same position could no longer stay in their post . " merkel " must finally terminate -lrb- mehdorn 's -rrb- untenable position with the bahn , " said dietmar bartsch from the left party while greens party leader claudia roth said " bahn boss mehdorn can not stay a day longer . " others , however , were still loath to pass judgment until the full case against mehdorn is heard .
finance minister peer steinbrueck -lrb- spd -rrb- told german tv that he would " wait to see all the evidence before forming an opinion , let alone issuing a condemnation . " economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said it was n't up to politicians to determine mehdorn 's immediate fate . " it is reasonable to wait for the investigation and then to let those who have to decide make the decision , " said the minister , who is a member of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union .
" that is the job of the supervisory board . " mehdorn clings on to past glories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bidding farewell : mehdorn is stepping down mehdorn 's fall from grace has been spectacular for a man credited with turning deutsche bahn into a profitable global transport leader over the past decade . but he has been dogged by the revelations that his company spied on employees and has recently come under heavy criticism for his perceived arrogance in the affair , resisting calls to step down and maintaining that the company did not break the law . " under my leadership , -lrb- deutsche -rrb- bahn is in good shape despite the serious economic and financial crisis , " mehdorn told the sunday edition of germany 's bild newspaper , when asked why he had not resigned .
" our results are good and we are not laying off any workers in the crisis . " until now , mehdorn has enjoyed the support of the chancellor , who has stood by him in past confrontations and has sided with him on occasional battles with germany 's powerful transport unions . mehdorn 's decision to offer his resignation now relieves merkel of a burden which may have threatened her campaign in parliamentary elections scheduled for september . nda / sms / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not because of its wide wingspan or its ability to fly for incredible distances without a break but because it may become the aircraft tied around the neck of manufacturer airbus as it sinks towards the murky depths .
the error-ridden and maligned military transporter project has prompted discussion , argument and consternation for some time among potential customers and the manufacturers themselves .
but no comments could prove as damaging as those recently uttered by thomas enders , the boss of airbus .
enders revealed in an interview with der spiegel news magazine that he believed that , under its original conditions and plans , the a400m could not be built and that the seemingly doomed nature of the project had much to do with huge errors within his own company .
the a400m has been plagued by setbacks , with the aircraft 's first flight postponed to a date that has yet to be determined because of engine problems .
a never-ending nightmare ?
" under the previous conditions we can not build the airplane , " admitted enders .
" but , better an end with a fright than a fright with no end . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders hopes that the worst will soon be over while the " end with a fright " may mean that after realizing that the current plans need to be scrapped thus sending the a400m back to the drawing board , the " fright with no end " - a continuing nightmare which ends with the death of the whole project - may not be as unavoidable as some may think .
enders himself admitted that he has considered the ultimate failure of the project and while a new plan is taking shape as to how to progress with the a400m , the prospect of current orders for the problem-plagued plane being cancelled is a real possibility .
german deputy defense minister ruediger wolf said only last week that cancelling orders on the military transport plane was a serious option .
" i have been waiting to hear about the problems with the a400m but until today we have no detailed information about what they are and whether these are solvable , " criticized wolf .
wolf told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that to bring pressure on airbus ' parent company the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- , " cancellation must be a serious option after a delay of three to six months . "
wolf , who was quoted indirectly by sueddeutsche zeitung , said it was more realistic to extend to six months a moratorium accorded to eads to get the program back on track .

france has signed on for 50 aircraft , while germany has ordered 60 .
eads was supposed to get the transport plane in the air for an inaugural flight in january 2008 , and the seven countries await a total of 180 a400ms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a400m is built but can not get off the ground deliveries had originally been scheduled to begin in 2009 , but the first delivery is now planned for 2012 and it is only in 2014 that eads will be able to deliver significant numbers of the aircraft to clients , according to reports .
meanwhile , mtu aero engines , the german engine maker at the centre of the row over the delays said on monday it was confident problems on the a400m would be resolved but declined to say when the plane would fly .
the company is responsible for the software needed to power the military transporter 's engines , and airbus says hitches in its development are largely to blame for delays of 3 to 4 years in the 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 27.29 billion -rrb- project .

not because of its wide wingspan or its ability to fly for incredible distances without a break but because it may become the aircraft tied around the neck of manufacturer airbus as it sinks towards the murky depths .
the error-ridden and maligned military transporter project has prompted discussion , argument and consternation for some time among potential customers and the manufacturers themselves .
but no comments could prove as damaging as those recently uttered by thomas enders , the boss of airbus .
enders revealed in an interview with der spiegel news magazine that he believed that , under its original conditions and plans , the a400m could not be built and that the seemingly doomed nature of the project had much to do with huge errors within his own company .
the a400m has been plagued by setbacks , with the aircraft 's first flight postponed to a date that has yet to be determined because of engine problems .
a never-ending nightmare ?
" under the previous conditions we can not build the airplane , " admitted enders .
" but , better an end with a fright than a fright with no end . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders hopes that the worst will soon be over while the " end with a fright " may mean that after realizing that the current plans need to be scrapped thus sending the a400m back to the drawing board , the " fright with no end " - a continuing nightmare which ends with the death of the whole project - may not be as unavoidable as some may think .
enders himself admitted that he has considered the ultimate failure of the project and while a new plan is taking shape as to how to progress with the a400m , the prospect of current orders for the problem-plagued plane being cancelled is a real possibility .
german deputy defense minister ruediger wolf said only last week that cancelling orders on the military transport plane was a serious option .
" i have been waiting to hear about the problems with the a400m but until today we have no detailed information about what they are and whether these are solvable , " criticized wolf .
wolf told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that to bring pressure on airbus ' parent company the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- , " cancellation must be a serious option after a delay of three to six months . "
wolf , who was quoted indirectly by sueddeutsche zeitung , said it was more realistic to extend to six months a moratorium accorded to eads to get the program back on track .

" i have made an offer to terminate my contract with the supervisory board chairman , " mehdorn said monday , march 30 , at a press conference to announce deutsche bahn 's annual financial results .
" i assume that a successor will be appointed before the summer holidays " begin in july . mehdorn , who has run the state-owned firm since 1999 , has been under increasing pressure ever since it was revealed earlier this year that deutsche bahn accessed confidential staff data as far back as 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn has come under heavy criticism for taking a closer look at its employees mehdorn admitted in february that , as part of an anti-corruption campaign , deutsche bahn spied on 173,000 of its 220,000 employees in 2002 and 2003 .
official documents have since shown deutsche bahn screened its entire workforce again in 2005 for corruption . in total , the records show that almost all railway employees would have been checked three times , and around 800 top managers would have been scrutinized twice . the german government said it had " taken note " of mehdorn 's offer to quit and praised his role in turning deutsche bahn into a " world-leading transport and logistics company . " " the financial success of recent years and the securing of 220,000 jobs are clearly linked to the high level of mehdorn 's personal engagement and corporate know-how , " the government said in a statement . as recently as friday it was reported that deutsche bahn had also monitored the e-mails of staff to check whether they had contacted journalists or parliamentarians in a bid to find employees critical of the company 's policies . over the weekend , the company was forced to admit that it deleted a 2007 e-mail calling for strike action that was sent by train drivers union gdl to thousands of employees . in an interview with the german sunday newspaper welt am sonntag , german chancellor angela merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm denied a report that the chancellor was keen to keep mehdorn in his post until an independent report on the snooping scandal was completed in may , adding that the issue could not be allowed to drag on for weeks . this , and a statement from an unnamed source who told reuters that berlin was " putting out feelers " for a potential successor , suggested that mehdorn was living on borrowed time . german politicians call time on mehdorn 's reign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these have been dark days for mehdorn and deutsche bahn a chorus of german politicians joining together to criticize the bahn chief added to the sense that mehdorn 's refusal to resign would become a mute point in the coming days . " i do not believe that hartmut mehdorn can remain on as the boss of deutsche bahn , " said transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , a member of the the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
" my impression is that parliament and the federal government does not take him seriously and is beginning to understand the criticism . " " the man must go , " said berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit , while his social democrat colleague and vice president of the party 's bundestag group klaas huebner told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , " any politician who found themselves in the same position could no longer stay in their post . " merkel " must finally terminate -lrb- mehdorn 's -rrb- untenable position with the bahn , " said dietmar bartsch from the left party while greens party leader claudia roth said " bahn boss mehdorn can not stay a day longer . " others , however , were still loath to pass judgment until the full case against mehdorn is heard .
finance minister peer steinbrueck -lrb- spd -rrb- told german tv that he would " wait to see all the evidence before forming an opinion , let alone issuing a condemnation . " economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said it was n't up to politicians to determine mehdorn 's immediate fate . " it is reasonable to wait for the investigation and then to let those who have to decide make the decision , " said the minister , who is a member of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union .
" that is the job of the supervisory board . " mehdorn clings on to past glories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bidding farewell : mehdorn is stepping down mehdorn 's fall from grace has been spectacular for a man credited with turning deutsche bahn into a profitable global transport leader over the past decade . but he has been dogged by the revelations that his company spied on employees and has recently come under heavy criticism for his perceived arrogance in the affair , resisting calls to step down and maintaining that the company did not break the law . " under my leadership , -lrb- deutsche -rrb- bahn is in good shape despite the serious economic and financial crisis , " mehdorn told the sunday edition of germany 's bild newspaper , when asked why he had not resigned .
" our results are good and we are not laying off any workers in the crisis . " until now , mehdorn has enjoyed the support of the chancellor , who has stood by him in past confrontations and has sided with him on occasional battles with germany 's powerful transport unions . mehdorn 's decision to offer his resignation now relieves merkel of a burden which may have threatened her campaign in parliamentary elections scheduled for september . nda / sms / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the issue of more troops remains off the table . the concession , which again fell short of fulfilling requests for more troops – and in germany 's case , combat troops , comes ahead of a 60th anniversary nato summit this week where allied contributions to the conflict in afghanistan will once more be a hot topic .
" we want to make this mission a success and that means giving afghanistan the means to take care of its own security , " chancellor angela merkel said in her weekly video podcast .
" in particular , it means that we must do more qualitatively in the training of soldiers and police .
germany is ready to do its duty . "
merkel , who faces an election in six months time , has already told president barack obama - who will attend the nato summit hosted by germany and france - that berlin will not increase the number of combat troops it can send to afghanistan .
germany has also resisted pressure from allies to send its troops to the more dangerous southern areas of the country , where allied forces are battling a taliban insurgency .
germany has 3,800 troops engaged in training and reconstruction programs in the north of the country .
it can push that number as high as 4,500 , based on a parliamentary mandate approved last year and has pledged extra troops ahead of the august elections , as part of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- but stands firm on involving its troops in any military action .
obama not expected to push for troops at summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants more commitment in the fight against the taliban unveiling his new afghanistan strategy last friday , obama said the united states would continue to seek contributions from allies for combat forces , trainers and mentors , strategic lift and equipment , although he is not expected to ask for an increased troop commitment at this week 's nato summit .
deputy foreign minister gernot erler told german radio that germany welcomed obama 's focus on more training and would be ready to step up its efforts in this area .
" i think we will be ready in germany to think about a stronger contribution in the area of training , " he said .
nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer urged european countries to step up their efforts in afghanistan as the defense organization prepared for its landmark summit .
" it 's not acceptable that only the united states strengthens its engagement , " he told the sunday edition of germany 's bild newspaper .
" the europeans must do more too , whether its in the military or civilian area . "
new calls for europeans to pitch in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jones reiterated calls for more european involvement us security advisor james jones reiterated washington 's expectations in a newspaper interview published in the german daily tagesspiegel on sunday , echoing the nato chief 's calls for its european allies in nato to supplement their troop presence in afghanistan , at least during the country 's august election period .
" whether these troops stay longer or head home straight after the elections , is another matter , " jones said in the interview published sunday .
the former general said that even if president obama did not directly call for increased efforts at the nato conference , it did not mean that the us was letting anyone off the hook .
" from the fact that the usa has not made public detailed demands to its allies , one can not deduce that the request does not exist , " jones said .
" every nation is free in its decision . "
the security advisor further emphasized the importance of civil assistance projects provided by allied forces in afghanistan .
" the time has passed , in which the quality of the relationship is measured by the number of soldiers , " jones said , adding that military might alone " does not suffice in the conflicts we are now dealing with . "
in afghanistan , for example , a lot could be learned from the german contribution , he said , adding that germany had done a great deal to train the afghan police forces . nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

obama not expected to push for troops at summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants more commitment in the fight against the taliban unveiling his new afghanistan strategy last friday , obama said the united states would continue to seek contributions from allies for combat forces , trainers and mentors , strategic lift and equipment , although he is not expected to ask for an increased troop commitment at this week 's nato summit .
deputy foreign minister gernot erler told german radio that germany welcomed obama 's focus on more training and would be ready to step up its efforts in this area .
" i think we will be ready in germany to think about a stronger contribution in the area of training , " he said .
nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer urged european countries to step up their efforts in afghanistan as the defense organization prepared for its landmark summit .

the former general said that even if president obama did not directly call for increased efforts at the nato conference , it did not mean that the us was letting anyone off the hook .

the security advisor further emphasized the importance of civil assistance projects provided by allied forces in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aerospace -pipe- 30.03.2009 airbus boss admits errors , considers failure as a400m remains grounded großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in reality , the a400m has not even left the ground airbus faces a turbulent time as expectant customers of its much-maligned and error-plagued a400m military transport plane weigh up their options and airbus chief enders considers the consequences of failure . the a400m may in time become known as ' the albatross ' .
not because of its wide wingspan or its ability to fly for incredible distances without a break but because it may become the aircraft tied around the neck of manufacturer airbus as it sinks towards the murky depths .
the error-ridden and maligned military transporter project has prompted discussion , argument and consternation for some time among potential customers and the manufacturers themselves .
but no comments could prove as damaging as those recently uttered by thomas enders , the boss of airbus .
enders revealed in an interview with der spiegel news magazine that he believed that , under its original conditions and plans , the a400m could not be built and that the seemingly doomed nature of the project had much to do with huge errors within his own company .
the a400m has been plagued by setbacks , with the aircraft 's first flight postponed to a date that has yet to be determined because of engine problems .
a never-ending nightmare ?
" under the previous conditions we can not build the airplane , " admitted enders .
" but , better an end with a fright than a fright with no end . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders hopes that the worst will soon be over while the " end with a fright " may mean that after realizing that the current plans need to be scrapped thus sending the a400m back to the drawing board , the " fright with no end " - a continuing nightmare which ends with the death of the whole project - may not be as unavoidable as some may think .
enders himself admitted that he has considered the ultimate failure of the project and while a new plan is taking shape as to how to progress with the a400m , the prospect of current orders for the problem-plagued plane being cancelled is a real possibility .
german deputy defense minister ruediger wolf said only last week that cancelling orders on the military transport plane was a serious option .
" i have been waiting to hear about the problems with the a400m but until today we have no detailed information about what they are and whether these are solvable , " criticized wolf .
wolf told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that to bring pressure on airbus ' parent company the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- , " cancellation must be a serious option after a delay of three to six months . "
wolf , who was quoted indirectly by sueddeutsche zeitung , said it was more realistic to extend to six months a moratorium accorded to eads to get the program back on track .
customers considering cutting , reducing orders countries that have ordered the plane - belgium , britain , france , germany , luxembourg , spain and turkey - have suggested delaying from april 1 to july 1 the date on which they can begin to cancel contracts .
french defense official laurent collet-billon told reporters last week that paris might reduce the number of planes it has ordered .
france has signed on for 50 aircraft , while germany has ordered 60 .
eads was supposed to get the transport plane in the air for an inaugural flight in january 2008 , and the seven countries await a total of 180 a400ms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a400m is built but can not get off the ground deliveries had originally been scheduled to begin in 2009 , but the first delivery is now planned for 2012 and it is only in 2014 that eads will be able to deliver significant numbers of the aircraft to clients , according to reports .
meanwhile , mtu aero engines , the german engine maker at the centre of the row over the delays said on monday it was confident problems on the a400m would be resolved but declined to say when the plane would fly .
the company is responsible for the software needed to power the military transporter 's engines , and airbus says hitches in its development are largely to blame for delays of 3 to 4 years in the 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 27.29 billion -rrb- project .
" airbus has asked everyone involved to stick with the timetable , and they are all working hard on their respective parts of the project , " mtu chief executive egon behle told the company 's annual news conference . a consortium that includes mtu , rolls-royce and france 's safran is building the a400m 's massive turbo-prop engines .
they have said they have delivered a working test engine and deny causing the bulk of the delays . nda / dpa / reuters / spiegel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de dw-world : eads posts strong profit despite downturn eads , the parent company of planemaker airbus , said its fourth-quarter net profit jumped 89 percent on higher deliveries of helicopters and airplanes despite the global economic downturn .

bbc news -pipe- middle east -pipe- regional rifts stymie arab summit bbc news / middle east graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- 04:39 gmt , monday , 30 march 2009 05:39 uk regional rifts stymie arab summit arab league members meeting in qatar this week are united in condemning the international arrest warrant for sudanese president omar al-bashir .
but the bbc 's jim muir , in beirut , says they seem to agree on little else .
the qatar gathering appears doomed to fall far short of what some had hoped it would be - the crowning moment for inter-arab reconciliations that would see a closing of ranks in the face of major regional challenges .
a rift has grown in recent weeks , symbolised by the glaring absence of president hosni mubarak of egypt , the most populous and arguably most politically weighty arab state , one which ironically normally aspires to the role of chief regional broker and conciliator .
a bonding strategic understanding between the arab nations is seen as particularly important at the moment , in the face of at least two significant issues .
one is the expected emergence of a new , largely right-wing government in israel , whose commitment to the widely-accepted premise for peace with the palestinians - two states living side by side - is in some doubt .
the other is the role of iran , which saudi arabia and some other conservative arab states fear could be bolstered by the dialogue which us president barack obama says he wants to open with tehran .
the weeks preceding the summit have seen a series of moves aimed at bringing about a healing of long-standing rifts .
some progress was made .
but the absence of such a key player as mr mubarak - whose place was taken by a low-ranking minister - made it clear that there is still a long way to go .
the basic divide is between those countries seen by their adversaries as being in thrall to the us , such as egypt , saudi arabia , jordan and other conservative states ; and those seen by the latter as being in league with iran , such as syria , qatar and others .
syria , which makes no secret of its strategic alliance with non-arab iran , has seen a perceptible warming of its relations with saudi arabia recently , and to a lesser extent with egypt .
but it has refused to break with tehran , and the basic rift remains .
palestinian problems the same issue largely underlies egypt 's unseemly row with qatar and mr mubarak 's boycott of the doha summit .
qatar and its international satellite channel al-jazeera deeply offended cairo by their criticism of egypt 's role during the israeli onslaught on gaza earlier this year , and their support for hamas in its negotiations over inter-palestinian reconciliation .
qatar has also implicitly challenged egyptian political and diplomatic clout by sponsoring settlement moves in yemen , lebanon and darfur , with considerable success .
a doha summit which managed to heal inter-arab rifts would have a sharp and immediate beneficial impact in several important arenas .
one of the factors impeding progress on peace between israel and the palestinians is the bitter split between the pro-western , fatah-dominated palestinian administration headed by mahmoud abbas , and the militant hamas movement , which controls gaza .
egypt 's strenuous efforts to sponsor a reconciliation and produce a palestinian national unity government have foundered , amidst accusations that iran and its regional allies have been running interference and encouraging hamas to be obdurate .
if all the main regional players were working in harmony , it is believed that palestinian reconciliation would be easier to achieve .
it would also be expected to ease tensions in lebanon , for decades a cockpit for regional struggles .
the country faces general elections in june in which the opposition , backed by iran and syria , will be trying to wrest power from the current pro-western majority .
sovereignty issue the recent signs of a thaw between saudi arabia and syria have already gone some way towards assuaging fears of serious trouble over the lebanese elections , but nothing is sure .
issues such as iran 's role are so sensitive that they are not even on the doha summit agenda . "
real arab unity of purpose may well be doomed to await the emergence of a concerted us middle east policy " despite the rifts , there will be some issues on which the arabs can agree .
they have already taken a strong position rejecting the arrest warrant issued on 4 march by the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- against president bashir , a stand that is expected to be endorsed by the summit .
the sudanese leader defied the warrant by flying to doha for the summit , having already visited eritrea , egypt and libya after the icc decision was announced .
the arab states see it as an issue of sovereignty .
only three arab league members - jordan , the comoros islands , and djibouti - are signatories to the agreements underpinning the icc .
the summit is also expected to see broad agreement that the arab peace initiative , announced in beirut in 2002 , should remain on the table but with a warning that its shelf-life would not be indefinite .
the initiative , sponsored in particular by saudi arabia , offers israel comprehensive peace with the arabs in exchange for giving up lands seized in the 1967 war .
however , consensus on that issue will remain merely ink on paper - like the initiative itself - if strategic inter-arab differences continue to block the modalities for moving forward towards peace .
like many previous top-level pan-arab gatherings , the doha summit is likely to be fundamentally inconclusive , despite carefully-tuned political declarations .
real arab unity of purpose may well be doomed to await the emergence of a concerted us middle east policy bent on resolving the region 's contradictions rather than exacerbating them , as the previous administration 's policies succeeded in doing .
much will depend too , on the outcome of washington 's overtures towards tehran .

but the bbc 's jim muir , in beirut , says they seem to agree on little else .
the qatar gathering appears doomed to fall far short of what some had hoped it would be - the crowning moment for inter-arab reconciliations that would see a closing of ranks in the face of major regional challenges .
a rift has grown in recent weeks , symbolised by the glaring absence of president hosni mubarak of egypt , the most populous and arguably most politically weighty arab state , one which ironically normally aspires to the role of chief regional broker and conciliator .
a bonding strategic understanding between the arab nations is seen as particularly important at the moment , in the face of at least two significant issues .
hosni mubarak 's absence is a serious blow to hopes of arab unity one is the expected emergence of a new , largely right-wing government in israel , whose commitment to the widely-accepted premise for peace with the palestinians - two states living side by side - is in some doubt .
the other is the role of iran , which saudi arabia and some other conservative arab states fear could be bolstered by the dialogue which us president barack obama says he wants to open with tehran .
the weeks preceding the summit have seen a series of moves aimed at bringing about a healing of long-standing rifts .
some progress was made .
but the absence of such a key player as mr mubarak - whose place was taken by a low-ranking minister - made it clear that there is still a long way to go .
the basic divide is between those countries seen by their adversaries as being in thrall to the us , such as egypt , saudi arabia , jordan and other conservative states ; and those seen by the latter as being in league with iran , such as syria , qatar and others .
syria , which makes no secret of its strategic alliance with non-arab iran , has seen a perceptible warming of its relations with saudi arabia recently , and to a lesser extent with egypt .
but it has refused to break with tehran , and the basic rift remains .
palestinian problems the same issue largely underlies egypt 's unseemly row with qatar and mr mubarak 's boycott of the doha summit .
qatar and its international satellite channel al-jazeera deeply offended cairo by their criticism of egypt 's role during the israeli onslaught on gaza earlier this year , and their support for hamas in its negotiations over inter-palestinian reconciliation .
many in the west want mr bashir tried for atrocities in darfur qatar has also implicitly challenged egyptian political and diplomatic clout by sponsoring settlement moves in yemen , lebanon and darfur , with considerable success .
a doha summit which managed to heal inter-arab rifts would have a sharp and immediate beneficial impact in several important arenas .
one of the factors impeding progress on peace between israel and the palestinians is the bitter split between the pro-western , fatah-dominated palestinian administration headed by mahmoud abbas , and the militant hamas movement , which controls gaza .
egypt 's strenuous efforts to sponsor a reconciliation and produce a palestinian national unity government have foundered , amidst accusations that iran and its regional allies have been running interference and encouraging hamas to be obdurate .
if all the main regional players were working in harmony , it is believed that palestinian reconciliation would be easier to achieve .
it would also be expected to ease tensions in lebanon , for decades a cockpit for regional struggles .
the country faces general elections in june in which the opposition , backed by iran and syria , will be trying to wrest power from the current pro-western majority .
sovereignty issue the recent signs of a thaw between saudi arabia and syria have already gone some way towards assuaging fears of serious trouble over the lebanese elections , but nothing is sure .
issues such as iran 's role are so sensitive that they are not even on the doha summit agenda .
real arab unity of purpose may well be doomed to await the emergence of a concerted us middle east policy despite the rifts , there will be some issues on which the arabs can agree .
they have already taken a strong position rejecting the arrest warrant issued on 4 march by the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- against president bashir , a stand that is expected to be endorsed by the summit .
the sudanese leader defied the warrant by flying to doha for the summit , having already visited eritrea , egypt and libya after the icc decision was announced .
the arab states see it as an issue of sovereignty .
only three arab league members - jordan , the comoros islands , and djibouti - are signatories to the agreements underpinning the icc .
the summit is also expected to see broad agreement that the arab peace initiative , announced in beirut in 2002 , should remain on the table but with a warning that its shelf-life would not be indefinite .
the initiative , sponsored in particular by saudi arabia , offers israel comprehensive peace with the arabs in exchange for giving up lands seized in the 1967 war .
however , consensus on that issue will remain merely ink on paper - like the initiative itself - if strategic inter-arab differences continue to block the modalities for moving forward towards peace .
like many previous top-level pan-arab gatherings , the doha summit is likely to be fundamentally inconclusive , despite carefully-tuned political declarations .
real arab unity of purpose may well be doomed to await the emergence of a concerted us middle east policy bent on resolving the region 's contradictions rather than exacerbating them , as the previous administration 's policies succeeded in doing .
much will depend too , on the outcome of washington 's overtures towards tehran .

but the bbc 's jim muir , in beirut , says they seem to agree on little else .
the qatar gathering appears doomed to fall far short of what some had hoped it would be - the crowning moment for inter-arab reconciliations that would see a closing of ranks in the face of major regional challenges .
a rift has grown in recent weeks , symbolised by the glaring absence of president hosni mubarak of egypt , the most populous and arguably most politically weighty arab state , one which ironically normally aspires to the role of chief regional broker and conciliator .
a bonding strategic understanding between the arab nations is seen as particularly important at the moment , in the face of at least two significant issues .
hosni mubarak 's absence is a serious blow to hopes of arab unity one is the expected emergence of a new , largely right-wing government in israel , whose commitment to the widely-accepted premise for peace with the palestinians - two states living side by side - is in some doubt .
the other is the role of iran , which saudi arabia and some other conservative arab states fear could be bolstered by the dialogue which us president barack obama says he wants to open with tehran .
the weeks preceding the summit have seen a series of moves aimed at bringing about a healing of long-standing rifts .
some progress was made .
but the absence of such a key player as mr mubarak - whose place was taken by a low-ranking minister - made it clear that there is still a long way to go .
the basic divide is between those countries seen by their adversaries as being in thrall to the us , such as egypt , saudi arabia , jordan and other conservative states ; and those seen by the latter as being in league with iran , such as syria , qatar and others .
syria , which makes no secret of its strategic alliance with non-arab iran , has seen a perceptible warming of its relations with saudi arabia recently , and to a lesser extent with egypt .
but it has refused to break with tehran , and the basic rift remains .
palestinian problems the same issue largely underlies egypt 's unseemly row with qatar and mr mubarak 's boycott of the doha summit .
qatar and its international satellite channel al-jazeera deeply offended cairo by their criticism of egypt 's role during the israeli onslaught on gaza earlier this year , and their support for hamas in its negotiations over inter-palestinian reconciliation .
many in the west want mr bashir tried for atrocities in darfur qatar has also implicitly challenged egyptian political and diplomatic clout by sponsoring settlement moves in yemen , lebanon and darfur , with considerable success .
a doha summit which managed to heal inter-arab rifts would have a sharp and immediate beneficial impact in several important arenas .
one of the factors impeding progress on peace between israel and the palestinians is the bitter split between the pro-western , fatah-dominated palestinian administration headed by mahmoud abbas , and the militant hamas movement , which controls gaza .
egypt 's strenuous efforts to sponsor a reconciliation and produce a palestinian national unity government have foundered , amidst accusations that iran and its regional allies have been running interference and encouraging hamas to be obdurate .
if all the main regional players were working in harmony , it is believed that palestinian reconciliation would be easier to achieve .
it would also be expected to ease tensions in lebanon , for decades a cockpit for regional struggles .
the country faces general elections in june in which the opposition , backed by iran and syria , will be trying to wrest power from the current pro-western majority .
sovereignty issue the recent signs of a thaw between saudi arabia and syria have already gone some way towards assuaging fears of serious trouble over the lebanese elections , but nothing is sure .
issues such as iran 's role are so sensitive that they are not even on the doha summit agenda .
real arab unity of purpose may well be doomed to await the emergence of a concerted us middle east policy despite the rifts , there will be some issues on which the arabs can agree .
they have already taken a strong position rejecting the arrest warrant issued on 4 march by the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- against president bashir , a stand that is expected to be endorsed by the summit .
the sudanese leader defied the warrant by flying to doha for the summit , having already visited eritrea , egypt and libya after the icc decision was announced .
the arab states see it as an issue of sovereignty .
only three arab league members - jordan , the comoros islands , and djibouti - are signatories to the agreements underpinning the icc .
the summit is also expected to see broad agreement that the arab peace initiative , announced in beirut in 2002 , should remain on the table but with a warning that its shelf-life would not be indefinite .
the initiative , sponsored in particular by saudi arabia , offers israel comprehensive peace with the arabs in exchange for giving up lands seized in the 1967 war .
however , consensus on that issue will remain merely ink on paper - like the initiative itself - if strategic inter-arab differences continue to block the modalities for moving forward towards peace .
like many previous top-level pan-arab gatherings , the doha summit is likely to be fundamentally inconclusive , despite carefully-tuned political declarations .
real arab unity of purpose may well be doomed to await the emergence of a concerted us middle east policy bent on resolving the region 's contradictions rather than exacerbating them , as the previous administration 's policies succeeded in doing .
much will depend too , on the outcome of washington 's overtures towards tehran .

qatar and its international satellite channel al-jazeera deeply offended cairo by their criticism of egypt 's role during the israeli onslaught on gaza earlier this year , and their support for hamas in its negotiations over inter-palestinian reconciliation .
many in the west want mr bashir tried for atrocities in darfur qatar has also implicitly challenged egyptian political and diplomatic clout by sponsoring settlement moves in yemen , lebanon and darfur , with considerable success .
a doha summit which managed to heal inter-arab rifts would have a sharp and immediate beneficial impact in several important arenas .
one of the factors impeding progress on peace between israel and the palestinians is the bitter split between the pro-western , fatah-dominated palestinian administration headed by mahmoud abbas , and the militant hamas movement , which controls gaza .
egypt 's strenuous efforts to sponsor a reconciliation and produce a palestinian national unity government have foundered , amidst accusations that iran and its regional allies have been running interference and encouraging hamas to be obdurate .
if all the main regional players were working in harmony , it is believed that palestinian reconciliation would be easier to achieve .
it would also be expected to ease tensions in lebanon , for decades a cockpit for regional struggles .
the country faces general elections in june in which the opposition , backed by iran and syria , will be trying to wrest power from the current pro-western majority .
sovereignty issue the recent signs of a thaw between saudi arabia and syria have already gone some way towards assuaging fears of serious trouble over the lebanese elections , but nothing is sure .
issues such as iran 's role are so sensitive that they are not even on the doha summit agenda .
real arab unity of purpose may well be doomed to await the emergence of a concerted us middle east policy despite the rifts , there will be some issues on which the arabs can agree .
they have already taken a strong position rejecting the arrest warrant issued on 4 march by the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- against president bashir , a stand that is expected to be endorsed by the summit .
the sudanese leader defied the warrant by flying to doha for the summit , having already visited eritrea , egypt and libya after the icc decision was announced .
the arab states see it as an issue of sovereignty .
only three arab league members - jordan , the comoros islands , and djibouti - are signatories to the agreements underpinning the icc .
the summit is also expected to see broad agreement that the arab peace initiative , announced in beirut in 2002 , should remain on the table but with a warning that its shelf-life would not be indefinite .
the initiative , sponsored in particular by saudi arabia , offers israel comprehensive peace with the arabs in exchange for giving up lands seized in the 1967 war .
however , consensus on that issue will remain merely ink on paper - like the initiative itself - if strategic inter-arab differences continue to block the modalities for moving forward towards peace .
like many previous top-level pan-arab gatherings , the doha summit is likely to be fundamentally inconclusive , despite carefully-tuned political declarations .
real arab unity of purpose may well be doomed to await the emergence of a concerted us middle east policy bent on resolving the region 's contradictions rather than exacerbating them , as the previous administration 's policies succeeded in doing .
much will depend too , on the outcome of washington 's overtures towards tehran .

the campaign to protect rural england -lrb- cpre -rrb- said top priority should be given to beautiful landscapes .
the south downs area , covering parts of sussex and hampshire , is the only one of 12 national parks proposed in 1947 which has not since been created .
legislation to create national parks went before parliament in 1949 .
a decision on the planned national park , which was the subject of a public inquiry after changes to the boundaries were proposed , could be made this week .
' unprecedented pressure ' tom oliver , head of rural policy for the cpre , said the creation of national parks came at a time of huge challenges to society following world war ii .
he said : " as we face future challenges of a similar scale and unprecedented pressures on our land and natural resources , government should again give top priority to beautiful landscapes and the qualities and opportunities they offer us all . "
the cpre wants further protection for vulnerable areas such as the forest of dean and the english border with wales .
the campaign group has also called for extensions to existing national parks such as the lake district and yorkshire dales .
it has raised concerns that england 's best landscapes are threatened by developments such as wind tubrines , electricity pylons and a lack of investment in hill farming which helps preserve the countryside .

the campaign to protect rural england -lrb- cpre -rrb- said top priority should be given to beautiful landscapes .
the south downs area , covering parts of sussex and hampshire , is the only one of 12 national parks proposed in 1947 which has not since been created .
legislation to create national parks went before parliament in 1949 .
a decision on the planned national park , which was the subject of a public inquiry after changes to the boundaries were proposed , could be made this week .
' unprecedented pressure ' tom oliver , head of rural policy for the cpre , said the creation of national parks came at a time of huge challenges to society following world war ii .
he said : " as we face future challenges of a similar scale and unprecedented pressures on our land and natural resources , government should again give top priority to beautiful landscapes and the qualities and opportunities they offer us all . "
the cpre wants further protection for vulnerable areas such as the forest of dean and the english border with wales .
the campaign group has also called for extensions to existing national parks such as the lake district and yorkshire dales .
it has raised concerns that england 's best landscapes are threatened by developments such as wind tubrines , electricity pylons and a lack of investment in hill farming which helps preserve the countryside .
