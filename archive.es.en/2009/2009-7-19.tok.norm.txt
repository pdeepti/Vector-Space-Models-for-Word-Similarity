right now , all bets are on current chancellor angela merkel keeping her job . as germany gears up for nationwide elections on september 27 , the latest poll released by emnid reveals that 80 percent of german citizens expect conservative chancellor angela merkel of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- to remain in office for a second term .
" we have not measured such a high approval rating for an incumbent chancellor in decades , " the head of emnid , klaus-peter schoeppner told the bild newspaper 's sunday edition .
" especially unheard of is the high expectation of losing among spd supporters . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grand coalition gets the thumbs down in the polls those surveyed give social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate frank-walter steinmeier only a 13 percent chance of beating merkel and becoming chancellor .
and among spd supporters , 53 percent do not want to see the party work with the cdu and the csu coalition .
the poll also demonstrated that 56 percent of germans would like to see an end to the grand coalition , where merkel 's center-right cdu party works together with the social democrats .
the spd has watched its popularity slide in recent years , in part because of merkel 's popularity and its status as a junior coalition member .
with such low poll numbers , frank-walter steinmeier and the other top members of the spd will have to seriously examine their future strategy when they meet in potsdam at the end of july .
csu confident of future as german conservatives gear up for the elections in the fall , chancellor merkel 's sister party , the bavarian csu with horst seehofer at the helm , has pledged to support merkels cdu .
on july 18 , seehofer was re-elected head of the csu with an almost 90 percent majority .
the csu however , is pursuing an election campaign that diverges from merkel 's cdu on key issues .
the central element of the csu campaign is income tax cuts , which it has said it will not back down on .
despite the ongoing crisis and the flurry of negative economic prognoses , the csu maintains that tax cuts are necessary and feasible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer re-elected head of csu the tax cuts , said seehofer , would take effect by 2011 .
merkel 's cdu , meanwhile , has rejected such ambitious plans .
another controversial issue seehofer addressed on saturday was the csu stance on the ratification of the european union 's lisbon treaty .
the csu has called for the german parliament , the bundestag , to have more of a say in european affairs .
seehofer says the csu is not against ratifying the treaty , but rather for strengthening the national parliament on the european level .
" we 're not about destruction ; we do n't want to blockade the treaty .
we want to give germany 's houses of parliament a stronger presence .
we want europe to recognize what it is made of - and we want that our national parliament to have responsibility and be taken seriously . "

" german media has said porsche and vw are close to a deal that would eventually give vw control of porsche .
this comes amid reports that porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking would be stepping down , which porsche has rejected . there are no official details on the talks or the deal itself , with neither company yet to release a statement .
according to germany 's der spiegel magazine , the deal would eventually give vw control of porsche .
initially , it had been porsche that wanted to swallow vw , but the luxury carmaker ran into serious financial troubles as a result of the takeover effort . porsche ceo rejects rumors of resignation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports say wiedeking -lrb- left -rrb- will be replaced by macht -lrb- right -rrb- the news of an eventual merger comes amid a report in der spiegel this week that wiedeking would be removed from the top job at porsche , to be replaced by michael macht , the company 's current production chief .
but porsche has denied the reports , saying that wiedeking will remain as the company 's ceo .
that was despite a report in weekly publication bild am sonntag that wiedeking stood to receive a 100-million-euro -lrb- $ 140 million -rrb- " golden parachute " for stepping aside following a takeover by vw .
that would be the largest severance package in german corporate history .
uwe hueck , the works council head , went so far as to say that the information was part of an attempt to " destroy a man . "
wiedeking himself has also said he plans to complete his contract , which expires in 2012 .
porsche 's repeated denial that wiedeking is for the chop is unlikely to stop the speculation. dfm / glb / ca / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as americans on monday mark the 40th anniversary of the first moon landing , europeans are gearing up for their own moon walk . forty years after man first walked on the moon , european astronauts have that great , glowing sphere in the sky back in sight .
with several successes under its belt , europe 's dream of its own expedition to the moon is looking more realistic than ever .
europe 's most ambitious spacecraft to date is the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- , which can deliver up to ten tons of material to the international space station .
but the atv can only carry material into space – and not the other way around , from space to earth .
evert dudok , the president of eads astrium , a subsidiary of the european aeronautic defence and space company , says that transporting material to earth could be made possible .
he says that the current atv , which is relatively cylindrical , would be replaced with a capsule structure , which would then return to earth , just like with the apollo missions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on july 20 , 1969 , neil armstrong became the first man on the moon " the speed would be slowed with parachutes and then it would land in the ocean , " he says .
the biggest technical hurdle facing the europeans is the development of a heat shield to keep the capsule from burning up as it re-enters the atmosphere .
however , there are already draft designs , and there are plans to transport people in the capsules too .
independent european expeditions the transport of people could open the way for europeans to launch their own missions , and avoid having to depend on the united states or russia to send astronauts into space .
jan woerner , the head of the german aerospace center , says it would only require a little more effort for europe to close the gap with the us and russia .
" a further development on this level would of course mean that we clearly position ourselves as a partner for future space travel missions , " he says .
" in this respect , i think it 's very important that we can tackle this step now . "

former german astronaut ernst messerschmid says there are still many unanswered questions about the moon , even after the apollo missions .
" apollo was almost too fast and too successful and kept all other initiatives to go back to the moon at bay , " he says .
" basically the next logical step after the space station is , of course , a trip back to the moon , " he says .
and when that next trip to the moon takes place , europeans hope they will go along for the ride .

the 37-year-old armstrong , who finished ninth , 1 minute 35 seconds behind his 11-year-junior astana teammate , said the result meant he had little chance of winning an eighth tour title .
" -lrb- contador -rrb- showed he 's the best rider in the race , " armstrong told france 2 television after the stage , and said he would now work to help his teammate win the tour .
armstrong now lies second in the overall standings , 1 minute 37 seconds behind contador , with the surprising briton bradley wiggins in third , 1 minute 46 seconds adrift .
german andreas kloeden , also of astana , is fourth at 2 minutes 17 seconds .
" i 'm happy to be second , " armstrong said .
" i definitely suffered .
i was already a little at my limit at the bottom -lrb- of the climb -rrb- .
i was hurting . "
contador 's time for the 207.5km course from the french city of pontarlier was 5 hours 3 minutes 58 seconds , an impressive average speed of 40.96 kph for a course that featured six climbs .
luxembourg 's andy schleck finished second , 43 seconds behind the winner , while italian vincenzo nibali came in third , 1 minute 3 seconds behind .

many choose to come to paris in the summer when most parisians are not there ! this year , thanks to the recession , more parisians are going to be staying at home … and finding out what they 've been missing .
our correspondent john laurenson sent us this postcard from paris in the summertime .
i 'm writing this inside a left bank café called the rouquet , a place that has n't changed since the 1950s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john laurenson sent his " postcard from europe " from paris motorists honk unhappily along the boulevard saint germain , but the plane trees form a green roof over the street , filtering the sun and giving the place a relaxing air .
a sparrow hops in , grabs an abandoned chip off the floor and flies towards the door , lop-sided because of the weight of the thing .
the patronne sidles up and tells me she 's been here for 55 years .
she remembers jean-paul sartre and simone de beauvoir coming here every morning .
they 'd hide away in the little room at the back .
get a bit of peace and quiet before exposing themselves to the rubber-necking crowds at the swankier cafés – the flore and the deux magots down the road .
paris in summer ?
i and -lrb- presumably -rrb- the few million others who visit at this time of year think it 's a great idea .
but for real parisians , it 's very different .
it is , in fact , one of those signs of failure .
like being seen on a bus over the age of 30 .
it means you have n't got any friends - either to go on holiday with or to invite you to their lovely beach-side summer home at arcachon .
or else you just ca n't afford it .
there are rather more french people in this category all of a sudden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in summer , paris even has a beach at the seine river in march , when french pessimism was just at its natural level for early spring , 74 percent reckoned they 'd be going on holiday .
by may , that number had dropped to 56 percent , while in other european countries it had stayed stable at around 64 percent .
which means there will be very many more parisians , or at least parisian ‘ losers ' as they call them here , for the tourists to see .
and a few more places are staying open .
in the old days , paris closed down in august .
with an admirable disregard for financial gain , restaurants and cafés would shut for the height of the tourist season .
many still do .
the rouquet , for example , will be closed for the whole month .
but it 's worth coming .
definitely .
to walk around the parks , peering at the games of chess and boules … to admire the buildings which look bright in summer , grey the rest of the year .
and if you meet a parisian , be friendly and offer to buy him a drink perhaps .
he probably needs it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : election 2009 economic , environmental issues top election agenda german conservatives gear up for fall elections steinmeier defends plan to create 4 million jobs by 2020 merkel calls for unity ahead of national elections elections -pipe- 19.07.2009 poll : most germans expect angela merkel will continue as chancellor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's latest poll numbers are worth smiling about with 10 weeks to go until the german elections , a new poll give a glimpse as to what germans may decide on election day .
right now , all bets are on current chancellor angela merkel keeping her job . as germany gears up for nationwide elections on september 27 , the latest poll released by emnid reveals that 80 percent of german citizens expect conservative chancellor angela merkel of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- to remain in office for a second term .
" we have not measured such a high approval rating for an incumbent chancellor in decades , " the head of emnid , klaus-peter schoeppner told the bild newspaper 's sunday edition .
" especially unheard of is the high expectation of losing among spd supporters . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grand coalition gets the thumbs down in the polls those surveyed give social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate frank-walter steinmeier only a 13 percent chance of beating merkel and becoming chancellor .
and among spd supporters , 53 percent do not want to see the party work with the cdu and the csu coalition .
the poll also demonstrated that 56 percent of germans would like to see an end to the grand coalition , where merkel 's center-right cdu party works together with the social democrats .
the spd has watched its popularity slide in recent years , in part because of merkel 's popularity and its status as a junior coalition member .
with such low poll numbers , frank-walter steinmeier and the other top members of the spd will have to seriously examine their future strategy when they meet in potsdam at the end of july .
csu confident of future as german conservatives gear up for the elections in the fall , chancellor merkel 's sister party , the bavarian csu with horst seehofer at the helm , has pledged to support merkels cdu .
on july 18 , seehofer was re-elected head of the csu with an almost 90 percent majority .
the csu however , is pursuing an election campaign that diverges from merkel 's cdu on key issues .
the central element of the csu campaign is income tax cuts , which it has said it will not back down on .
despite the ongoing crisis and the flurry of negative economic prognoses , the csu maintains that tax cuts are necessary and feasible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer re-elected head of csu the tax cuts , said seehofer , would take effect by 2011 .
merkel 's cdu , meanwhile , has rejected such ambitious plans .
another controversial issue seehofer addressed on saturday was the csu stance on the ratification of the european union 's lisbon treaty .
the csu has called for the german parliament , the bundestag , to have more of a say in european affairs .
seehofer says the csu is not against ratifying the treaty , but rather for strengthening the national parliament on the european level .
" we 're not about destruction ; we do n't want to blockade the treaty .
we want to give germany 's houses of parliament a stronger presence .
we want europe to recognize what it is made of - and we want that our national parliament to have responsibility and be taken seriously . "
time will tell whether or not this will be a workable arrangement. av / glb / reuters / dpa / ap / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

right now , all bets are on current chancellor angela merkel keeping her job . as germany gears up for nationwide elections on september 27 , the latest poll released by emnid reveals that 80 percent of german citizens expect conservative chancellor angela merkel of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- to remain in office for a second term .
" we have not measured such a high approval rating for an incumbent chancellor in decades , " the head of emnid , klaus-peter schoeppner told the bild newspaper 's sunday edition .
" especially unheard of is the high expectation of losing among spd supporters . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grand coalition gets the thumbs down in the polls those surveyed give social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate frank-walter steinmeier only a 13 percent chance of beating merkel and becoming chancellor .
and among spd supporters , 53 percent do not want to see the party work with the cdu and the csu coalition .
the poll also demonstrated that 56 percent of germans would like to see an end to the grand coalition , where merkel 's center-right cdu party works together with the social democrats .
the spd has watched its popularity slide in recent years , in part because of merkel 's popularity and its status as a junior coalition member .
with such low poll numbers , frank-walter steinmeier and the other top members of the spd will have to seriously examine their future strategy when they meet in potsdam at the end of july .
csu confident of future as german conservatives gear up for the elections in the fall , chancellor merkel 's sister party , the bavarian csu with horst seehofer at the helm , has pledged to support merkels cdu .
on july 18 , seehofer was re-elected head of the csu with an almost 90 percent majority .
the csu however , is pursuing an election campaign that diverges from merkel 's cdu on key issues .
the central element of the csu campaign is income tax cuts , which it has said it will not back down on .
despite the ongoing crisis and the flurry of negative economic prognoses , the csu maintains that tax cuts are necessary and feasible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer re-elected head of csu the tax cuts , said seehofer , would take effect by 2011 .
merkel 's cdu , meanwhile , has rejected such ambitious plans .
another controversial issue seehofer addressed on saturday was the csu stance on the ratification of the european union 's lisbon treaty .
the csu has called for the german parliament , the bundestag , to have more of a say in european affairs .
seehofer says the csu is not against ratifying the treaty , but rather for strengthening the national parliament on the european level .
" we 're not about destruction ; we do n't want to blockade the treaty .
we want to give germany 's houses of parliament a stronger presence .
we want europe to recognize what it is made of - and we want that our national parliament to have responsibility and be taken seriously . "

rescue teams have n't been able to conduct a proper search as more shoreline could slip . a stretch of the shoreline on a lake in the village of nachterstedt , located in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt , simply gave way early on saturday , causing one home and part of an adjacent apartment building to collapse and fall into the water . three people are missing , including a married couple and another man , who are thought to have been buried by the slide in their sleep . the premier of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang boehmer declared the incident a disaster area and said the military would help with the rescue efforts . about 40 people have been evacuated . fear of further landslides hampering rescue dangerous conditions , including the threat of further landslides , kept rescue workers from conducting a proper search . " the entire situation is very unstable and further collapses are possible at any time , " police spokeswoman bettina moosbauer said sunday .
the three missing people lived in a semi-detached duplex house , which was situated over 100 meters from the shoreline .
after the collapse , the house disappeared completely under the surface of the lake . bildunterschrift : half of an adjacent apartment building also collapsed , but reports say nobody was inside at the time . heat detectors on helicopters have not located any bodies . cause for slip unknown officials said the area had received some rain , but added that this could not have caused such a violent landslide . they said it was more likely that past mining had made the land unstable .
an opencast coalmine , which had been in operation during communist times , was closed in 1991 . the former mine was subsequently turned into lake concordia , a 350-hectare recreation area that had become a popular spot for swimming , diving and boating . after saturday 's incident , the lake was closed to the public .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 19.07.2009 european astronauts dream of their own moon landing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people , including astronauts , remain fascinated by the moon europe is seeing more success in the field of space flight than ever before .
as americans on monday mark the 40th anniversary of the first moon landing , europeans are gearing up for their own moon walk . forty years after man first walked on the moon , european astronauts have that great , glowing sphere in the sky back in sight .
with several successes under its belt , europe 's dream of its own expedition to the moon is looking more realistic than ever .
europe 's most ambitious spacecraft to date is the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- , which can deliver up to ten tons of material to the international space station .
but the atv can only carry material into space – and not the other way around , from space to earth .
evert dudok , the president of eads astrium , a subsidiary of the european aeronautic defence and space company , says that transporting material to earth could be made possible .
he says that the current atv , which is relatively cylindrical , would be replaced with a capsule structure , which would then return to earth , just like with the apollo missions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on july 20 , 1969 , neil armstrong became the first man on the moon " the speed would be slowed with parachutes and then it would land in the ocean , " he says .
the biggest technical hurdle facing the europeans is the development of a heat shield to keep the capsule from burning up as it re-enters the atmosphere .
however , there are already draft designs , and there are plans to transport people in the capsules too .
independent european expeditions the transport of people could open the way for europeans to launch their own missions , and avoid having to depend on the united states or russia to send astronauts into space .
jan woerner , the head of the german aerospace center , says it would only require a little more effort for europe to close the gap with the us and russia .
" a further development on this level would of course mean that we clearly position ourselves as a partner for future space travel missions , " he says .
" in this respect , i think it 's very important that we can tackle this step now . "
germans on the moon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst messerschmid -lrb- bottom , left -rrb- was part of the last successful challenger mission germany has put its planned moon mission on hold due to budget constraints , but interest from researchers has certainly not gone away .
former german astronaut ernst messerschmid says there are still many unanswered questions about the moon , even after the apollo missions .
" apollo was almost too fast and too successful and kept all other initiatives to go back to the moon at bay , " he says .
" basically the next logical step after the space station is , of course , a trip back to the moon , " he says .
and when that next trip to the moon takes place , europeans hope they will go along for the ride .

the 37-year-old armstrong , who finished ninth , 1 minute 35 seconds behind his 11-year-junior astana teammate , said the result meant he had little chance of winning an eighth tour title .
" -lrb- contador -rrb- showed he 's the best rider in the race , " armstrong told france 2 television after the stage , and said he would now work to help his teammate win the tour .
armstrong now lies second in the overall standings , 1 minute 37 seconds behind contador , with the surprising briton bradley wiggins in third , 1 minute 46 seconds adrift .
german andreas kloeden , also of astana , is fourth at 2 minutes 17 seconds .
" i 'm happy to be second , " armstrong said .
" i definitely suffered .

anyone caught puffing away in a non-smoking area faces an on-the-spot 45-euro fine , while cafe owners face penalties of up to 2,500 euros .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , an avid anti-smoker , has instructed the country 's governors to rigorously enforce the ban .
he has even called for officials who fail to do so to be punished .
the new law is being seen as the final nail in the coffin for one of the country 's most ancient traditions .
turkey has one of the highest rates of smoking in the world , and the legislation is expected to cause troubles for cafes , bars and restaurants in cities like istanbul , where the hospitality industry is bracing for a hit to profits .
cafe owner suleymain aktas told deutsche welle his business was already suffering due to the economic crisis , and that the smoking ban would add salt to the wound .
" sure , this ban will affect us both work-wise and in our lifestyle .
we wo n't be able to live the way we did before .
as for our cafe , we will have to find new ways to take some economic measures like sacking workers , " he said .
history up in smoke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan is a staunch anti-smoking advocate turkish cafes are well known for the clouds of flavored smoke wafting through the air from water pipes , or nargile in turkish .
it is a tradition that goes back centuries , but as of sunday this could become a thing of the past .
though despite criticism of the new legislation by industry groups and smokers , there are many turks who see this as a chance to turn a new , healthier corner .
according to opinion polls an overwhelming majority of turks are in favor of tougher anti-smoking laws .
" i think it is good for me because i do n't smoke , because when i sit here and drink i do n't like this smoke .
so it is going to be a good thing , " said volcan , a regular at the keyif cafe in istanbul .
but another cafe patron , oguz , said as he savored what he admits could be one of his last nargile at keyif that he was angered by the smoking ban .
" i like smoking the nargile .
i like the feeling of friendship that goes with it , " he said .
" perhaps nargile is more harmful but it has an ambience and you smoke while chatting .
i do n't find it logical that they ban smoking in nargile cafes , because people come here by choice . "
widespread support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the days of smoky turkish cafes are numbered in nearby taksim square , in the heart of istanbul , there is support to be found for the ban and little sympathy for nargile smokers .
" nargile , it might be part of the tradition , but it has become hyped in the last five or six years ; as though there was no nargile culture before it was created , " said one local .
" it has attracted many , many people to smoke even more .
so i am perfectly happy that nargile cafes will close . "
another passerby said : " i think it is good .
in many places people smoke too many cigarettes to our bad health .
i have waited a long time for this law . "
for centuries , turkey - which is also a major tobacco producer - has prided itself on its smoking traditions .
but here tradition can pass with remarkable speed .
earlier restrictions on smoking on coaches and in shopping malls met with little resistance , and even though there have been a few small protests against the new restrictions , mainly by cafe owners , the government remains determined to enforce them .
it seems the days of smoky turkish cafes are numbered .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de france -pipe- 19.07.2009 locals discover the joys of paris in the summer as the recession bites großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more parisians are holidaying at home france is the world 's biggest tourist destination with some 72 million people visiting the country last year .
many choose to come to paris in the summer when most parisians are not there ! this year , thanks to the recession , more parisians are going to be staying at home … and finding out what they 've been missing .
our correspondent john laurenson sent us this postcard from paris in the summertime .
i 'm writing this inside a left bank café called the rouquet , a place that has n't changed since the 1950s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john laurenson sent his " postcard from europe " from paris motorists honk unhappily along the boulevard saint germain , but the plane trees form a green roof over the street , filtering the sun and giving the place a relaxing air .
a sparrow hops in , grabs an abandoned chip off the floor and flies towards the door , lop-sided because of the weight of the thing .
the patronne sidles up and tells me she 's been here for 55 years .
she remembers jean-paul sartre and simone de beauvoir coming here every morning .
they 'd hide away in the little room at the back .
get a bit of peace and quiet before exposing themselves to the rubber-necking crowds at the swankier cafés – the flore and the deux magots down the road .
paris in summer ?
i and -lrb- presumably -rrb- the few million others who visit at this time of year think it 's a great idea .
but for real parisians , it 's very different .
it is , in fact , one of those signs of failure .
like being seen on a bus over the age of 30 .
it means you have n't got any friends - either to go on holiday with or to invite you to their lovely beach-side summer home at arcachon .
or else you just ca n't afford it .
there are rather more french people in this category all of a sudden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in summer , paris even has a beach at the seine river in march , when french pessimism was just at its natural level for early spring , 74 percent reckoned they 'd be going on holiday .
by may , that number had dropped to 56 percent , while in other european countries it had stayed stable at around 64 percent .
which means there will be very many more parisians , or at least parisian ‘ losers ' as they call them here , for the tourists to see .
and a few more places are staying open .
in the old days , paris closed down in august .
with an admirable disregard for financial gain , restaurants and cafés would shut for the height of the tourist season .
many still do .
the rouquet , for example , will be closed for the whole month .
but it 's worth coming .
definitely .
to walk around the parks , peering at the games of chess and boules … to admire the buildings which look bright in summer , grey the rest of the year .
and if you meet a parisian , be friendly and offer to buy him a drink perhaps .
he probably needs it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 19.07.2009 european astronauts dream of their own moon landing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people , including astronauts , remain fascinated by the moon europe is seeing more success in the field of space flight than ever before .
as americans on monday mark the 40th anniversary of the first moon landing , europeans are gearing up for their own moon walk . forty years after man first walked on the moon , european astronauts have that great , glowing sphere in the sky back in sight .
with several successes under its belt , europe 's dream of its own expedition to the moon is looking more realistic than ever .
europe 's most ambitious spacecraft to date is the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- , which can deliver up to ten tons of material to the international space station .
but the atv can only carry material into space – and not the other way around , from space to earth .
evert dudok , the president of eads astrium , a subsidiary of the european aeronautic defence and space company , says that transporting material to earth could be made possible .
he says that the current atv , which is relatively cylindrical , would be replaced with a capsule structure , which would then return to earth , just like with the apollo missions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on july 20 , 1969 , neil armstrong became the first man on the moon " the speed would be slowed with parachutes and then it would land in the ocean , " he says .
the biggest technical hurdle facing the europeans is the development of a heat shield to keep the capsule from burning up as it re-enters the atmosphere .
however , there are already draft designs , and there are plans to transport people in the capsules too .
independent european expeditions the transport of people could open the way for europeans to launch their own missions , and avoid having to depend on the united states or russia to send astronauts into space .
jan woerner , the head of the german aerospace center , says it would only require a little more effort for europe to close the gap with the us and russia .
" a further development on this level would of course mean that we clearly position ourselves as a partner for future space travel missions , " he says .
" in this respect , i think it 's very important that we can tackle this step now . "
germans on the moon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst messerschmid -lrb- bottom , left -rrb- was part of the last successful challenger mission germany has put its planned moon mission on hold due to budget constraints , but interest from researchers has certainly not gone away .
former german astronaut ernst messerschmid says there are still many unanswered questions about the moon , even after the apollo missions .
" apollo was almost too fast and too successful and kept all other initiatives to go back to the moon at bay , " he says .
" basically the next logical step after the space station is , of course , a trip back to the moon , " he says .
and when that next trip to the moon takes place , europeans hope they will go along for the ride .

" german media has said porsche and vw are close to a deal that would eventually give vw control of porsche .
this comes amid reports that porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking would be stepping down , which porsche has rejected . there are no official details on the talks or the deal itself , with neither company yet to release a statement .
according to germany 's der spiegel magazine , the deal would eventually give vw control of porsche .
initially , it had been porsche that wanted to swallow vw , but the luxury carmaker ran into serious financial troubles as a result of the takeover effort . porsche ceo rejects rumors of resignation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports say wiedeking -lrb- left -rrb- will be replaced by macht -lrb- right -rrb- the news of an eventual merger comes amid a report in der spiegel this week that wiedeking would be removed from the top job at porsche , to be replaced by michael macht , the company 's current production chief .
but porsche has denied the reports , saying that wiedeking will remain as the company 's ceo .
that was despite a report in weekly publication bild am sonntag that wiedeking stood to receive a 100-million-euro -lrb- $ 140 million -rrb- " golden parachute " for stepping aside following a takeover by vw .
that would be the largest severance package in german corporate history .
uwe hueck , the works council head , went so far as to say that the information was part of an attempt to " destroy a man . "
wiedeking himself has also said he plans to complete his contract , which expires in 2012 .
porsche 's repeated denial that wiedeking is for the chop is unlikely to stop the speculation. dfm / glb / ca / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 19.07.2009 history up in smoke as turkey extends smoking restrictions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social nargile smokers will find it hard to enjoy a puff in cafes the expression " smoke like a turk " seems destined for the rubbish bin of history after turkey introduced sunday some of the toughest anti-smoking legislation in europe . smoking has been banned from all closed public areas , bars , cafes and restaurants , and even extends to patrons sitting outside cafes .
anyone caught puffing away in a non-smoking area faces an on-the-spot 45-euro fine , while cafe owners face penalties of up to 2,500 euros .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , an avid anti-smoker , has instructed the country 's governors to rigorously enforce the ban .
he has even called for officials who fail to do so to be punished .
the new law is being seen as the final nail in the coffin for one of the country 's most ancient traditions .
turkey has one of the highest rates of smoking in the world , and the legislation is expected to cause troubles for cafes , bars and restaurants in cities like istanbul , where the hospitality industry is bracing for a hit to profits .
cafe owner suleymain aktas told deutsche welle his business was already suffering due to the economic crisis , and that the smoking ban would add salt to the wound .
" sure , this ban will affect us both work-wise and in our lifestyle .
we wo n't be able to live the way we did before .
as for our cafe , we will have to find new ways to take some economic measures like sacking workers , " he said .
history up in smoke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan is a staunch anti-smoking advocate turkish cafes are well known for the clouds of flavored smoke wafting through the air from water pipes , or nargile in turkish .
it is a tradition that goes back centuries , but as of sunday this could become a thing of the past .
though despite criticism of the new legislation by industry groups and smokers , there are many turks who see this as a chance to turn a new , healthier corner .
according to opinion polls an overwhelming majority of turks are in favor of tougher anti-smoking laws .
" i think it is good for me because i do n't smoke , because when i sit here and drink i do n't like this smoke .
so it is going to be a good thing , " said volcan , a regular at the keyif cafe in istanbul .
but another cafe patron , oguz , said as he savored what he admits could be one of his last nargile at keyif that he was angered by the smoking ban .
" i like smoking the nargile .
i like the feeling of friendship that goes with it , " he said .
" perhaps nargile is more harmful but it has an ambience and you smoke while chatting .
i do n't find it logical that they ban smoking in nargile cafes , because people come here by choice . "
widespread support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the days of smoky turkish cafes are numbered in nearby taksim square , in the heart of istanbul , there is support to be found for the ban and little sympathy for nargile smokers .
" nargile , it might be part of the tradition , but it has become hyped in the last five or six years ; as though there was no nargile culture before it was created , " said one local .
" it has attracted many , many people to smoke even more .
so i am perfectly happy that nargile cafes will close . "
another passerby said : " i think it is good .
in many places people smoke too many cigarettes to our bad health .
i have waited a long time for this law . "
for centuries , turkey - which is also a major tobacco producer - has prided itself on its smoking traditions .
but here tradition can pass with remarkable speed .
earlier restrictions on smoking on coaches and in shopping malls met with little resistance , and even though there have been a few small protests against the new restrictions , mainly by cafe owners , the government remains determined to enforce them .
it seems the days of smoky turkish cafes are numbered .

our correspondent john laurenson sent us this postcard from paris in the summertime .
i 'm writing this inside a left bank café called the rouquet , a place that has n't changed since the 1950s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john laurenson sent his " postcard from europe " from paris motorists honk unhappily along the boulevard saint germain , but the plane trees form a green roof over the street , filtering the sun and giving the place a relaxing air .

she remembers jean-paul sartre and simone de beauvoir coming here every morning .
they 'd hide away in the little room at the back .
get a bit of peace and quiet before exposing themselves to the rubber-necking crowds at the swankier cafés – the flore and the deux magots down the road .
paris in summer ?
i and -lrb- presumably -rrb- the few million others who visit at this time of year think it 's a great idea .
but for real parisians , it 's very different .
it is , in fact , one of those signs of failure .
like being seen on a bus over the age of 30 .
it means you have n't got any friends - either to go on holiday with or to invite you to their lovely beach-side summer home at arcachon .
or else you just ca n't afford it .
there are rather more french people in this category all of a sudden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in summer , paris even has a beach at the seine river in march , when french pessimism was just at its natural level for early spring , 74 percent reckoned they 'd be going on holiday .
by may , that number had dropped to 56 percent , while in other european countries it had stayed stable at around 64 percent .
which means there will be very many more parisians , or at least parisian ‘ losers ' as they call them here , for the tourists to see .
and a few more places are staying open .
in the old days , paris closed down in august .
with an admirable disregard for financial gain , restaurants and cafés would shut for the height of the tourist season .
many still do .
the rouquet , for example , will be closed for the whole month .
but it 's worth coming .
definitely .
to walk around the parks , peering at the games of chess and boules … to admire the buildings which look bright in summer , grey the rest of the year .
and if you meet a parisian , be friendly and offer to buy him a drink perhaps .
he probably needs it .

" german media has said porsche and vw are close to a deal that would eventually give vw control of porsche .
this comes amid reports that porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking would be stepping down , which porsche has rejected . there are no official details on the talks or the deal itself , with neither company yet to release a statement .
according to germany 's der spiegel magazine , the deal would eventually give vw control of porsche .
initially , it had been porsche that wanted to swallow vw , but the luxury carmaker ran into serious financial troubles as a result of the takeover effort . porsche ceo rejects rumors of resignation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports say wiedeking -lrb- left -rrb- will be replaced by macht -lrb- right -rrb- the news of an eventual merger comes amid a report in der spiegel this week that wiedeking would be removed from the top job at porsche , to be replaced by michael macht , the company 's current production chief .
but porsche has denied the reports , saying that wiedeking will remain as the company 's ceo .
that was despite a report in weekly publication bild am sonntag that wiedeking stood to receive a 100-million-euro -lrb- $ 140 million -rrb- " golden parachute " for stepping aside following a takeover by vw .
that would be the largest severance package in german corporate history .
uwe hueck , the works council head , went so far as to say that the information was part of an attempt to " destroy a man . "
wiedeking himself has also said he plans to complete his contract , which expires in 2012 .
porsche 's repeated denial that wiedeking is for the chop is unlikely to stop the speculation. dfm / glb / ca / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

get a bit of peace and quiet before exposing themselves to the rubber-necking crowds at the swankier cafés – the flore and the deux magots down the road .
paris in summer ?
i and -lrb- presumably -rrb- the few million others who visit at this time of year think it 's a great idea .
but for real parisians , it 's very different .
it is , in fact , one of those signs of failure .
like being seen on a bus over the age of 30 .
it means you have n't got any friends - either to go on holiday with or to invite you to their lovely beach-side summer home at arcachon .
or else you just ca n't afford it .
there are rather more french people in this category all of a sudden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in summer , paris even has a beach at the seine river in march , when french pessimism was just at its natural level for early spring , 74 percent reckoned they 'd be going on holiday .
by may , that number had dropped to 56 percent , while in other european countries it had stayed stable at around 64 percent .
which means there will be very many more parisians , or at least parisian ‘ losers ' as they call them here , for the tourists to see .
and a few more places are staying open .
in the old days , paris closed down in august .
with an admirable disregard for financial gain , restaurants and cafés would shut for the height of the tourist season .
many still do .
the rouquet , for example , will be closed for the whole month .
but it 's worth coming .
definitely .
to walk around the parks , peering at the games of chess and boules … to admire the buildings which look bright in summer , grey the rest of the year .
and if you meet a parisian , be friendly and offer to buy him a drink perhaps .
he probably needs it .

" german media has said porsche and vw are close to a deal that would eventually give vw control of porsche .
this comes amid reports that porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking would be stepping down , which porsche has rejected . there are no official details on the talks or the deal itself , with neither company yet to release a statement .
according to germany 's der spiegel magazine , the deal would eventually give vw control of porsche .
initially , it had been porsche that wanted to swallow vw , but the luxury carmaker ran into serious financial troubles as a result of the takeover effort . porsche ceo rejects rumors of resignation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports say wiedeking -lrb- left -rrb- will be replaced by macht -lrb- right -rrb- the news of an eventual merger comes amid a report in der spiegel this week that wiedeking would be removed from the top job at porsche , to be replaced by michael macht , the company 's current production chief .
but porsche has denied the reports , saying that wiedeking will remain as the company 's ceo .
that was despite a report in weekly publication bild am sonntag that wiedeking stood to receive a 100-million-euro -lrb- $ 140 million -rrb- " golden parachute " for stepping aside following a takeover by vw .
that would be the largest severance package in german corporate history .
uwe hueck , the works council head , went so far as to say that the information was part of an attempt to " destroy a man . "
wiedeking himself has also said he plans to complete his contract , which expires in 2012 .
porsche 's repeated denial that wiedeking is for the chop is unlikely to stop the speculation. dfm / glb / ca / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

anyone caught puffing away in a non-smoking area faces an on-the-spot 45-euro fine , while cafe owners face penalties of up to 2,500 euros .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , an avid anti-smoker , has instructed the country 's governors to rigorously enforce the ban .
he has even called for officials who fail to do so to be punished .
the new law is being seen as the final nail in the coffin for one of the country 's most ancient traditions .
turkey has one of the highest rates of smoking in the world , and the legislation is expected to cause troubles for cafes , bars and restaurants in cities like istanbul , where the hospitality industry is bracing for a hit to profits .
cafe owner suleymain aktas told deutsche welle his business was already suffering due to the economic crisis , and that the smoking ban would add salt to the wound .
" sure , this ban will affect us both work-wise and in our lifestyle .
we wo n't be able to live the way we did before .
as for our cafe , we will have to find new ways to take some economic measures like sacking workers , " he said .
history up in smoke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan is a staunch anti-smoking advocate turkish cafes are well known for the clouds of flavored smoke wafting through the air from water pipes , or nargile in turkish .
it is a tradition that goes back centuries , but as of sunday this could become a thing of the past .
though despite criticism of the new legislation by industry groups and smokers , there are many turks who see this as a chance to turn a new , healthier corner .
according to opinion polls an overwhelming majority of turks are in favor of tougher anti-smoking laws .
" i think it is good for me because i do n't smoke , because when i sit here and drink i do n't like this smoke .
so it is going to be a good thing , " said volcan , a regular at the keyif cafe in istanbul .
but another cafe patron , oguz , said as he savored what he admits could be one of his last nargile at keyif that he was angered by the smoking ban .
" i like smoking the nargile .
i like the feeling of friendship that goes with it , " he said .
" perhaps nargile is more harmful but it has an ambience and you smoke while chatting .
i do n't find it logical that they ban smoking in nargile cafes , because people come here by choice . "
widespread support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the days of smoky turkish cafes are numbered in nearby taksim square , in the heart of istanbul , there is support to be found for the ban and little sympathy for nargile smokers .
" nargile , it might be part of the tradition , but it has become hyped in the last five or six years ; as though there was no nargile culture before it was created , " said one local .
" it has attracted many , many people to smoke even more .
so i am perfectly happy that nargile cafes will close . "
another passerby said : " i think it is good .
in many places people smoke too many cigarettes to our bad health .
i have waited a long time for this law . "
for centuries , turkey - which is also a major tobacco producer - has prided itself on its smoking traditions .
but here tradition can pass with remarkable speed .
earlier restrictions on smoking on coaches and in shopping malls met with little resistance , and even though there have been a few small protests against the new restrictions , mainly by cafe owners , the government remains determined to enforce them .
it seems the days of smoky turkish cafes are numbered .

" german media has said porsche and vw are close to a deal that would eventually give vw control of porsche .
this comes amid reports that porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking would be stepping down , which porsche has rejected . there are no official details on the talks or the deal itself , with neither company yet to release a statement .
according to germany 's der spiegel magazine , the deal would eventually give vw control of porsche .
initially , it had been porsche that wanted to swallow vw , but the luxury carmaker ran into serious financial troubles as a result of the takeover effort . porsche ceo rejects rumors of resignation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports say wiedeking -lrb- left -rrb- will be replaced by macht -lrb- right -rrb- the news of an eventual merger comes amid a report in der spiegel this week that wiedeking would be removed from the top job at porsche , to be replaced by michael macht , the company 's current production chief .
but porsche has denied the reports , saying that wiedeking will remain as the company 's ceo .
that was despite a report in weekly publication bild am sonntag that wiedeking stood to receive a 100-million-euro -lrb- $ 140 million -rrb- " golden parachute " for stepping aside following a takeover by vw .
that would be the largest severance package in german corporate history .
uwe hueck , the works council head , went so far as to say that the information was part of an attempt to " destroy a man . "
wiedeking himself has also said he plans to complete his contract , which expires in 2012 .
porsche 's repeated denial that wiedeking is for the chop is unlikely to stop the speculation. dfm / glb / ca / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many choose to come to paris in the summer when most parisians are not there ! this year , thanks to the recession , more parisians are going to be staying at home … and finding out what they 've been missing .
our correspondent john laurenson sent us this postcard from paris in the summertime .
i 'm writing this inside a left bank café called the rouquet , a place that has n't changed since the 1950s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john laurenson sent his " postcard from europe " from paris motorists honk unhappily along the boulevard saint germain , but the plane trees form a green roof over the street , filtering the sun and giving the place a relaxing air .
a sparrow hops in , grabs an abandoned chip off the floor and flies towards the door , lop-sided because of the weight of the thing .
the patronne sidles up and tells me she 's been here for 55 years .
she remembers jean-paul sartre and simone de beauvoir coming here every morning .
they 'd hide away in the little room at the back .
get a bit of peace and quiet before exposing themselves to the rubber-necking crowds at the swankier cafés – the flore and the deux magots down the road .
paris in summer ?
i and -lrb- presumably -rrb- the few million others who visit at this time of year think it 's a great idea .
but for real parisians , it 's very different .
it is , in fact , one of those signs of failure .
like being seen on a bus over the age of 30 .
it means you have n't got any friends - either to go on holiday with or to invite you to their lovely beach-side summer home at arcachon .
or else you just ca n't afford it .
there are rather more french people in this category all of a sudden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in summer , paris even has a beach at the seine river in march , when french pessimism was just at its natural level for early spring , 74 percent reckoned they 'd be going on holiday .
by may , that number had dropped to 56 percent , while in other european countries it had stayed stable at around 64 percent .
which means there will be very many more parisians , or at least parisian ‘ losers ' as they call them here , for the tourists to see .
and a few more places are staying open .
in the old days , paris closed down in august .
with an admirable disregard for financial gain , restaurants and cafés would shut for the height of the tourist season .
many still do .
the rouquet , for example , will be closed for the whole month .
but it 's worth coming .
definitely .
to walk around the parks , peering at the games of chess and boules … to admire the buildings which look bright in summer , grey the rest of the year .
and if you meet a parisian , be friendly and offer to buy him a drink perhaps .
he probably needs it .

anyone caught puffing away in a non-smoking area faces an on-the-spot 45-euro fine , while cafe owners face penalties of up to 2,500 euros .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , an avid anti-smoker , has instructed the country 's governors to rigorously enforce the ban .

history up in smoke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan is a staunch anti-smoking advocate turkish cafes are well known for the clouds of flavored smoke wafting through the air from water pipes , or nargile in turkish .
it is a tradition that goes back centuries , but as of sunday this could become a thing of the past .

" i think it is good for me because i do n't smoke , because when i sit here and drink i do n't like this smoke .
so it is going to be a good thing , " said volcan , a regular at the keyif cafe in istanbul .
but another cafe patron , oguz , said as he savored what he admits could be one of his last nargile at keyif that he was angered by the smoking ban .
" i like smoking the nargile .
i like the feeling of friendship that goes with it , " he said .
" perhaps nargile is more harmful but it has an ambience and you smoke while chatting .
i do n't find it logical that they ban smoking in nargile cafes , because people come here by choice . "
widespread support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the days of smoky turkish cafes are numbered in nearby taksim square , in the heart of istanbul , there is support to be found for the ban and little sympathy for nargile smokers .
" nargile , it might be part of the tradition , but it has become hyped in the last five or six years ; as though there was no nargile culture before it was created , " said one local .
" it has attracted many , many people to smoke even more .
so i am perfectly happy that nargile cafes will close . "
another passerby said : " i think it is good .
in many places people smoke too many cigarettes to our bad health .
i have waited a long time for this law . "
for centuries , turkey - which is also a major tobacco producer - has prided itself on its smoking traditions .
but here tradition can pass with remarkable speed .
earlier restrictions on smoking on coaches and in shopping malls met with little resistance , and even though there have been a few small protests against the new restrictions , mainly by cafe owners , the government remains determined to enforce them .
it seems the days of smoky turkish cafes are numbered .

as americans on monday mark the 40th anniversary of the first moon landing , europeans are gearing up for their own moon walk . forty years after man first walked on the moon , european astronauts have that great , glowing sphere in the sky back in sight .
with several successes under its belt , europe 's dream of its own expedition to the moon is looking more realistic than ever .
europe 's most ambitious spacecraft to date is the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- , which can deliver up to ten tons of material to the international space station .
but the atv can only carry material into space – and not the other way around , from space to earth .
evert dudok , the president of eads astrium , a subsidiary of the european aeronautic defence and space company , says that transporting material to earth could be made possible .
he says that the current atv , which is relatively cylindrical , would be replaced with a capsule structure , which would then return to earth , just like with the apollo missions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on july 20 , 1969 , neil armstrong became the first man on the moon " the speed would be slowed with parachutes and then it would land in the ocean , " he says .
the biggest technical hurdle facing the europeans is the development of a heat shield to keep the capsule from burning up as it re-enters the atmosphere .
however , there are already draft designs , and there are plans to transport people in the capsules too .
independent european expeditions the transport of people could open the way for europeans to launch their own missions , and avoid having to depend on the united states or russia to send astronauts into space .
jan woerner , the head of the german aerospace center , says it would only require a little more effort for europe to close the gap with the us and russia .
" a further development on this level would of course mean that we clearly position ourselves as a partner for future space travel missions , " he says .
" in this respect , i think it 's very important that we can tackle this step now . "

former german astronaut ernst messerschmid says there are still many unanswered questions about the moon , even after the apollo missions .

" basically the next logical step after the space station is , of course , a trip back to the moon , " he says .

rescue teams have n't been able to conduct a proper search as more shoreline could slip . a stretch of the shoreline on a lake in the village of nachterstedt , located in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt , simply gave way early on saturday , causing one home and part of an adjacent apartment building to collapse and fall into the water . three people are missing , including a married couple and another man , who are thought to have been buried by the slide in their sleep . the premier of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang boehmer declared the incident a disaster area and said the military would help with the rescue efforts . about 40 people have been evacuated . fear of further landslides hampering rescue dangerous conditions , including the threat of further landslides , kept rescue workers from conducting a proper search . " the entire situation is very unstable and further collapses are possible at any time , " police spokeswoman bettina moosbauer said sunday .
the three missing people lived in a semi-detached duplex house , which was situated over 100 meters from the shoreline .
after the collapse , the house disappeared completely under the surface of the lake . bildunterschrift : half of an adjacent apartment building also collapsed , but reports say nobody was inside at the time . heat detectors on helicopters have not located any bodies . cause for slip unknown officials said the area had received some rain , but added that this could not have caused such a violent landslide . they said it was more likely that past mining had made the land unstable .
an opencast coalmine , which had been in operation during communist times , was closed in 1991 . the former mine was subsequently turned into lake concordia , a 350-hectare recreation area that had become a popular spot for swimming , diving and boating . after saturday 's incident , the lake was closed to the public .

and among spd supporters , 53 percent do not want to see the party work with the cdu and the csu coalition .
the poll also demonstrated that 56 percent of germans would like to see an end to the grand coalition , where merkel 's center-right cdu party works together with the social democrats .
the spd has watched its popularity slide in recent years , in part because of merkel 's popularity and its status as a junior coalition member .
with such low poll numbers , frank-walter steinmeier and the other top members of the spd will have to seriously examine their future strategy when they meet in potsdam at the end of july .
csu confident of future as german conservatives gear up for the elections in the fall , chancellor merkel 's sister party , the bavarian csu with horst seehofer at the helm , has pledged to support merkels cdu .
on july 18 , seehofer was re-elected head of the csu with an almost 90 percent majority .
the csu however , is pursuing an election campaign that diverges from merkel 's cdu on key issues .
the central element of the csu campaign is income tax cuts , which it has said it will not back down on .
despite the ongoing crisis and the flurry of negative economic prognoses , the csu maintains that tax cuts are necessary and feasible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer re-elected head of csu the tax cuts , said seehofer , would take effect by 2011 .
merkel 's cdu , meanwhile , has rejected such ambitious plans .
another controversial issue seehofer addressed on saturday was the csu stance on the ratification of the european union 's lisbon treaty .
the csu has called for the german parliament , the bundestag , to have more of a say in european affairs .
seehofer says the csu is not against ratifying the treaty , but rather for strengthening the national parliament on the european level .
" we 're not about destruction ; we do n't want to blockade the treaty .
we want to give germany 's houses of parliament a stronger presence .
we want europe to recognize what it is made of - and we want that our national parliament to have responsibility and be taken seriously . "
time will tell whether or not this will be a workable arrangement. av / glb / reuters / dpa / ap / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" german media has said porsche and vw are close to a deal that would eventually give vw control of porsche .
this comes amid reports that porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking would be stepping down , which porsche has rejected . there are no official details on the talks or the deal itself , with neither company yet to release a statement .
according to germany 's der spiegel magazine , the deal would eventually give vw control of porsche .
initially , it had been porsche that wanted to swallow vw , but the luxury carmaker ran into serious financial troubles as a result of the takeover effort . porsche ceo rejects rumors of resignation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports say wiedeking -lrb- left -rrb- will be replaced by macht -lrb- right -rrb- the news of an eventual merger comes amid a report in der spiegel this week that wiedeking would be removed from the top job at porsche , to be replaced by michael macht , the company 's current production chief .
but porsche has denied the reports , saying that wiedeking will remain as the company 's ceo .
that was despite a report in weekly publication bild am sonntag that wiedeking stood to receive a 100-million-euro -lrb- $ 140 million -rrb- " golden parachute " for stepping aside following a takeover by vw .
that would be the largest severance package in german corporate history .
uwe hueck , the works council head , went so far as to say that the information was part of an attempt to " destroy a man . "
wiedeking himself has also said he plans to complete his contract , which expires in 2012 .
porsche 's repeated denial that wiedeking is for the chop is unlikely to stop the speculation. dfm / glb / ca / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is , in fact , one of those signs of failure .

it means you have n't got any friends - either to go on holiday with or to invite you to their lovely beach-side summer home at arcachon .

which means there will be very many more parisians , or at least parisian ‘ losers ' as they call them here , for the tourists to see .
and a few more places are staying open .
in the old days , paris closed down in august .
with an admirable disregard for financial gain , restaurants and cafés would shut for the height of the tourist season .
many still do .
the rouquet , for example , will be closed for the whole month .
but it 's worth coming .
definitely .
to walk around the parks , peering at the games of chess and boules … to admire the buildings which look bright in summer , grey the rest of the year .
and if you meet a parisian , be friendly and offer to buy him a drink perhaps .
he probably needs it .

there are rather more french people in this category all of a sudden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in summer , paris even has a beach at the seine river in march , when french pessimism was just at its natural level for early spring , 74 percent reckoned they 'd be going on holiday .
by may , that number had dropped to 56 percent , while in other european countries it had stayed stable at around 64 percent .
which means there will be very many more parisians , or at least parisian ‘ losers ' as they call them here , for the tourists to see .
and a few more places are staying open .
in the old days , paris closed down in august .
with an admirable disregard for financial gain , restaurants and cafés would shut for the height of the tourist season .
many still do .
the rouquet , for example , will be closed for the whole month .
but it 's worth coming .
definitely .
to walk around the parks , peering at the games of chess and boules … to admire the buildings which look bright in summer , grey the rest of the year .
and if you meet a parisian , be friendly and offer to buy him a drink perhaps .
he probably needs it .

right now , all bets are on current chancellor angela merkel keeping her job . as germany gears up for nationwide elections on september 27 , the latest poll released by emnid reveals that 80 percent of german citizens expect conservative chancellor angela merkel of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- to remain in office for a second term .
" we have not measured such a high approval rating for an incumbent chancellor in decades , " the head of emnid , klaus-peter schoeppner told the bild newspaper 's sunday edition .
" especially unheard of is the high expectation of losing among spd supporters . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grand coalition gets the thumbs down in the polls those surveyed give social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate frank-walter steinmeier only a 13 percent chance of beating merkel and becoming chancellor .
and among spd supporters , 53 percent do not want to see the party work with the cdu and the csu coalition .
the poll also demonstrated that 56 percent of germans would like to see an end to the grand coalition , where merkel 's center-right cdu party works together with the social democrats .
the spd has watched its popularity slide in recent years , in part because of merkel 's popularity and its status as a junior coalition member .
with such low poll numbers , frank-walter steinmeier and the other top members of the spd will have to seriously examine their future strategy when they meet in potsdam at the end of july .
csu confident of future as german conservatives gear up for the elections in the fall , chancellor merkel 's sister party , the bavarian csu with horst seehofer at the helm , has pledged to support merkels cdu .
on july 18 , seehofer was re-elected head of the csu with an almost 90 percent majority .
the csu however , is pursuing an election campaign that diverges from merkel 's cdu on key issues .
the central element of the csu campaign is income tax cuts , which it has said it will not back down on .
despite the ongoing crisis and the flurry of negative economic prognoses , the csu maintains that tax cuts are necessary and feasible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer re-elected head of csu the tax cuts , said seehofer , would take effect by 2011 .
merkel 's cdu , meanwhile , has rejected such ambitious plans .
another controversial issue seehofer addressed on saturday was the csu stance on the ratification of the european union 's lisbon treaty .
the csu has called for the german parliament , the bundestag , to have more of a say in european affairs .
seehofer says the csu is not against ratifying the treaty , but rather for strengthening the national parliament on the european level .
" we 're not about destruction ; we do n't want to blockade the treaty .
we want to give germany 's houses of parliament a stronger presence .
we want europe to recognize what it is made of - and we want that our national parliament to have responsibility and be taken seriously . "

" especially unheard of is the high expectation of losing among spd supporters . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grand coalition gets the thumbs down in the polls those surveyed give social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate frank-walter steinmeier only a 13 percent chance of beating merkel and becoming chancellor .
and among spd supporters , 53 percent do not want to see the party work with the cdu and the csu coalition .
the poll also demonstrated that 56 percent of germans would like to see an end to the grand coalition , where merkel 's center-right cdu party works together with the social democrats .
the spd has watched its popularity slide in recent years , in part because of merkel 's popularity and its status as a junior coalition member .
with such low poll numbers , frank-walter steinmeier and the other top members of the spd will have to seriously examine their future strategy when they meet in potsdam at the end of july .
csu confident of future as german conservatives gear up for the elections in the fall , chancellor merkel 's sister party , the bavarian csu with horst seehofer at the helm , has pledged to support merkels cdu .
on july 18 , seehofer was re-elected head of the csu with an almost 90 percent majority .
the csu however , is pursuing an election campaign that diverges from merkel 's cdu on key issues .
the central element of the csu campaign is income tax cuts , which it has said it will not back down on .
despite the ongoing crisis and the flurry of negative economic prognoses , the csu maintains that tax cuts are necessary and feasible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer re-elected head of csu the tax cuts , said seehofer , would take effect by 2011 .
merkel 's cdu , meanwhile , has rejected such ambitious plans .
another controversial issue seehofer addressed on saturday was the csu stance on the ratification of the european union 's lisbon treaty .
the csu has called for the german parliament , the bundestag , to have more of a say in european affairs .
seehofer says the csu is not against ratifying the treaty , but rather for strengthening the national parliament on the european level .
" we 're not about destruction ; we do n't want to blockade the treaty .
we want to give germany 's houses of parliament a stronger presence .
we want europe to recognize what it is made of - and we want that our national parliament to have responsibility and be taken seriously . "
time will tell whether or not this will be a workable arrangement. av / glb / reuters / dpa / ap / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" german media has said porsche and vw are close to a deal that would eventually give vw control of porsche .
this comes amid reports that porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking would be stepping down , which porsche has rejected . there are no official details on the talks or the deal itself , with neither company yet to release a statement .
according to germany 's der spiegel magazine , the deal would eventually give vw control of porsche .
initially , it had been porsche that wanted to swallow vw , but the luxury carmaker ran into serious financial troubles as a result of the takeover effort . porsche ceo rejects rumors of resignation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports say wiedeking -lrb- left -rrb- will be replaced by macht -lrb- right -rrb- the news of an eventual merger comes amid a report in der spiegel this week that wiedeking would be removed from the top job at porsche , to be replaced by michael macht , the company 's current production chief .
but porsche has denied the reports , saying that wiedeking will remain as the company 's ceo .
that was despite a report in weekly publication bild am sonntag that wiedeking stood to receive a 100-million-euro -lrb- $ 140 million -rrb- " golden parachute " for stepping aside following a takeover by vw .
that would be the largest severance package in german corporate history .
uwe hueck , the works council head , went so far as to say that the information was part of an attempt to " destroy a man . "
wiedeking himself has also said he plans to complete his contract , which expires in 2012 .
porsche 's repeated denial that wiedeking is for the chop is unlikely to stop the speculation. dfm / glb / ca / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 37-year-old armstrong , who finished ninth , 1 minute 35 seconds behind his 11-year-junior astana teammate , said the result meant he had little chance of winning an eighth tour title .
" -lrb- contador -rrb- showed he 's the best rider in the race , " armstrong told france 2 television after the stage , and said he would now work to help his teammate win the tour .
armstrong now lies second in the overall standings , 1 minute 37 seconds behind contador , with the surprising briton bradley wiggins in third , 1 minute 46 seconds adrift .
german andreas kloeden , also of astana , is fourth at 2 minutes 17 seconds .
" i 'm happy to be second , " armstrong said .
" i definitely suffered .
i was already a little at my limit at the bottom -lrb- of the climb -rrb- .
i was hurting . "
contador 's time for the 207.5km course from the french city of pontarlier was 5 hours 3 minutes 58 seconds , an impressive average speed of 40.96 kph for a course that featured six climbs .
luxembourg 's andy schleck finished second , 43 seconds behind the winner , while italian vincenzo nibali came in third , 1 minute 3 seconds behind .
" i 'm very happy , " contador said .
" it was a hard climb .
my legs hurt , they hurt a lot . "

anyone caught puffing away in a non-smoking area faces an on-the-spot 45-euro fine , while cafe owners face penalties of up to 2,500 euros .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , an avid anti-smoker , has instructed the country 's governors to rigorously enforce the ban .
he has even called for officials who fail to do so to be punished .
the new law is being seen as the final nail in the coffin for one of the country 's most ancient traditions .
turkey has one of the highest rates of smoking in the world , and the legislation is expected to cause troubles for cafes , bars and restaurants in cities like istanbul , where the hospitality industry is bracing for a hit to profits .
cafe owner suleymain aktas told deutsche welle his business was already suffering due to the economic crisis , and that the smoking ban would add salt to the wound .
" sure , this ban will affect us both work-wise and in our lifestyle .
we wo n't be able to live the way we did before .
as for our cafe , we will have to find new ways to take some economic measures like sacking workers , " he said .
history up in smoke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan is a staunch anti-smoking advocate turkish cafes are well known for the clouds of flavored smoke wafting through the air from water pipes , or nargile in turkish .
it is a tradition that goes back centuries , but as of sunday this could become a thing of the past .
though despite criticism of the new legislation by industry groups and smokers , there are many turks who see this as a chance to turn a new , healthier corner .
according to opinion polls an overwhelming majority of turks are in favor of tougher anti-smoking laws .
" i think it is good for me because i do n't smoke , because when i sit here and drink i do n't like this smoke .
so it is going to be a good thing , " said volcan , a regular at the keyif cafe in istanbul .
but another cafe patron , oguz , said as he savored what he admits could be one of his last nargile at keyif that he was angered by the smoking ban .
" i like smoking the nargile .
i like the feeling of friendship that goes with it , " he said .
" perhaps nargile is more harmful but it has an ambience and you smoke while chatting .
i do n't find it logical that they ban smoking in nargile cafes , because people come here by choice . "
widespread support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the days of smoky turkish cafes are numbered in nearby taksim square , in the heart of istanbul , there is support to be found for the ban and little sympathy for nargile smokers .
" nargile , it might be part of the tradition , but it has become hyped in the last five or six years ; as though there was no nargile culture before it was created , " said one local .
" it has attracted many , many people to smoke even more .
so i am perfectly happy that nargile cafes will close . "
another passerby said : " i think it is good .
in many places people smoke too many cigarettes to our bad health .
i have waited a long time for this law . "
for centuries , turkey - which is also a major tobacco producer - has prided itself on its smoking traditions .
but here tradition can pass with remarkable speed .
earlier restrictions on smoking on coaches and in shopping malls met with little resistance , and even though there have been a few small protests against the new restrictions , mainly by cafe owners , the government remains determined to enforce them .
it seems the days of smoky turkish cafes are numbered .

anyone caught puffing away in a non-smoking area faces an on-the-spot 45-euro fine , while cafe owners face penalties of up to 2,500 euros .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , an avid anti-smoker , has instructed the country 's governors to rigorously enforce the ban .
he has even called for officials who fail to do so to be punished .
the new law is being seen as the final nail in the coffin for one of the country 's most ancient traditions .
turkey has one of the highest rates of smoking in the world , and the legislation is expected to cause troubles for cafes , bars and restaurants in cities like istanbul , where the hospitality industry is bracing for a hit to profits .
cafe owner suleymain aktas told deutsche welle his business was already suffering due to the economic crisis , and that the smoking ban would add salt to the wound .
" sure , this ban will affect us both work-wise and in our lifestyle .
we wo n't be able to live the way we did before .
as for our cafe , we will have to find new ways to take some economic measures like sacking workers , " he said .
history up in smoke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan is a staunch anti-smoking advocate turkish cafes are well known for the clouds of flavored smoke wafting through the air from water pipes , or nargile in turkish .
it is a tradition that goes back centuries , but as of sunday this could become a thing of the past .
though despite criticism of the new legislation by industry groups and smokers , there are many turks who see this as a chance to turn a new , healthier corner .
according to opinion polls an overwhelming majority of turks are in favor of tougher anti-smoking laws .
" i think it is good for me because i do n't smoke , because when i sit here and drink i do n't like this smoke .
so it is going to be a good thing , " said volcan , a regular at the keyif cafe in istanbul .
but another cafe patron , oguz , said as he savored what he admits could be one of his last nargile at keyif that he was angered by the smoking ban .
" i like smoking the nargile .
i like the feeling of friendship that goes with it , " he said .
" perhaps nargile is more harmful but it has an ambience and you smoke while chatting .
i do n't find it logical that they ban smoking in nargile cafes , because people come here by choice . "
widespread support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the days of smoky turkish cafes are numbered in nearby taksim square , in the heart of istanbul , there is support to be found for the ban and little sympathy for nargile smokers .
" nargile , it might be part of the tradition , but it has become hyped in the last five or six years ; as though there was no nargile culture before it was created , " said one local .
" it has attracted many , many people to smoke even more .
so i am perfectly happy that nargile cafes will close . "
another passerby said : " i think it is good .
in many places people smoke too many cigarettes to our bad health .
i have waited a long time for this law . "
for centuries , turkey - which is also a major tobacco producer - has prided itself on its smoking traditions .
but here tradition can pass with remarkable speed .
earlier restrictions on smoking on coaches and in shopping malls met with little resistance , and even though there have been a few small protests against the new restrictions , mainly by cafe owners , the government remains determined to enforce them .
it seems the days of smoky turkish cafes are numbered .

as americans on monday mark the 40th anniversary of the first moon landing , europeans are gearing up for their own moon walk . forty years after man first walked on the moon , european astronauts have that great , glowing sphere in the sky back in sight .
with several successes under its belt , europe 's dream of its own expedition to the moon is looking more realistic than ever .
europe 's most ambitious spacecraft to date is the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- , which can deliver up to ten tons of material to the international space station .
but the atv can only carry material into space – and not the other way around , from space to earth .
evert dudok , the president of eads astrium , a subsidiary of the european aeronautic defence and space company , says that transporting material to earth could be made possible .
he says that the current atv , which is relatively cylindrical , would be replaced with a capsule structure , which would then return to earth , just like with the apollo missions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on july 20 , 1969 , neil armstrong became the first man on the moon " the speed would be slowed with parachutes and then it would land in the ocean , " he says .
the biggest technical hurdle facing the europeans is the development of a heat shield to keep the capsule from burning up as it re-enters the atmosphere .
however , there are already draft designs , and there are plans to transport people in the capsules too .
independent european expeditions the transport of people could open the way for europeans to launch their own missions , and avoid having to depend on the united states or russia to send astronauts into space .
jan woerner , the head of the german aerospace center , says it would only require a little more effort for europe to close the gap with the us and russia .
" a further development on this level would of course mean that we clearly position ourselves as a partner for future space travel missions , " he says .
" in this respect , i think it 's very important that we can tackle this step now . "

former german astronaut ernst messerschmid says there are still many unanswered questions about the moon , even after the apollo missions .

" basically the next logical step after the space station is , of course , a trip back to the moon , " he says .

as americans on monday mark the 40th anniversary of the first moon landing , europeans are gearing up for their own moon walk . forty years after man first walked on the moon , european astronauts have that great , glowing sphere in the sky back in sight .
with several successes under its belt , europe 's dream of its own expedition to the moon is looking more realistic than ever .
europe 's most ambitious spacecraft to date is the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- , which can deliver up to ten tons of material to the international space station .
but the atv can only carry material into space – and not the other way around , from space to earth .
evert dudok , the president of eads astrium , a subsidiary of the european aeronautic defence and space company , says that transporting material to earth could be made possible .
he says that the current atv , which is relatively cylindrical , would be replaced with a capsule structure , which would then return to earth , just like with the apollo missions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on july 20 , 1969 , neil armstrong became the first man on the moon " the speed would be slowed with parachutes and then it would land in the ocean , " he says .
the biggest technical hurdle facing the europeans is the development of a heat shield to keep the capsule from burning up as it re-enters the atmosphere .
however , there are already draft designs , and there are plans to transport people in the capsules too .
independent european expeditions the transport of people could open the way for europeans to launch their own missions , and avoid having to depend on the united states or russia to send astronauts into space .
jan woerner , the head of the german aerospace center , says it would only require a little more effort for europe to close the gap with the us and russia .
" a further development on this level would of course mean that we clearly position ourselves as a partner for future space travel missions , " he says .

right now , all bets are on current chancellor angela merkel keeping her job . as germany gears up for nationwide elections on september 27 , the latest poll released by emnid reveals that 80 percent of german citizens expect conservative chancellor angela merkel of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- to remain in office for a second term .
" we have not measured such a high approval rating for an incumbent chancellor in decades , " the head of emnid , klaus-peter schoeppner told the bild newspaper 's sunday edition .
" especially unheard of is the high expectation of losing among spd supporters . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grand coalition gets the thumbs down in the polls those surveyed give social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate frank-walter steinmeier only a 13 percent chance of beating merkel and becoming chancellor .
and among spd supporters , 53 percent do not want to see the party work with the cdu and the csu coalition .
the poll also demonstrated that 56 percent of germans would like to see an end to the grand coalition , where merkel 's center-right cdu party works together with the social democrats .
the spd has watched its popularity slide in recent years , in part because of merkel 's popularity and its status as a junior coalition member .
with such low poll numbers , frank-walter steinmeier and the other top members of the spd will have to seriously examine their future strategy when they meet in potsdam at the end of july .
csu confident of future as german conservatives gear up for the elections in the fall , chancellor merkel 's sister party , the bavarian csu with horst seehofer at the helm , has pledged to support merkels cdu .
on july 18 , seehofer was re-elected head of the csu with an almost 90 percent majority .
the csu however , is pursuing an election campaign that diverges from merkel 's cdu on key issues .
the central element of the csu campaign is income tax cuts , which it has said it will not back down on .
despite the ongoing crisis and the flurry of negative economic prognoses , the csu maintains that tax cuts are necessary and feasible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer re-elected head of csu the tax cuts , said seehofer , would take effect by 2011 .
merkel 's cdu , meanwhile , has rejected such ambitious plans .
another controversial issue seehofer addressed on saturday was the csu stance on the ratification of the european union 's lisbon treaty .
the csu has called for the german parliament , the bundestag , to have more of a say in european affairs .
seehofer says the csu is not against ratifying the treaty , but rather for strengthening the national parliament on the european level .
" we 're not about destruction ; we do n't want to blockade the treaty .
we want to give germany 's houses of parliament a stronger presence .
we want europe to recognize what it is made of - and we want that our national parliament to have responsibility and be taken seriously . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 19.07.2009 european astronauts dream of their own moon landing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people , including astronauts , remain fascinated by the moon europe is seeing more success in the field of space flight than ever before .
as americans on monday mark the 40th anniversary of the first moon landing , europeans are gearing up for their own moon walk . forty years after man first walked on the moon , european astronauts have that great , glowing sphere in the sky back in sight .
with several successes under its belt , europe 's dream of its own expedition to the moon is looking more realistic than ever .
europe 's most ambitious spacecraft to date is the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- , which can deliver up to ten tons of material to the international space station .
but the atv can only carry material into space – and not the other way around , from space to earth .
evert dudok , the president of eads astrium , a subsidiary of the european aeronautic defence and space company , says that transporting material to earth could be made possible .
he says that the current atv , which is relatively cylindrical , would be replaced with a capsule structure , which would then return to earth , just like with the apollo missions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on july 20 , 1969 , neil armstrong became the first man on the moon " the speed would be slowed with parachutes and then it would land in the ocean , " he says .
the biggest technical hurdle facing the europeans is the development of a heat shield to keep the capsule from burning up as it re-enters the atmosphere .
however , there are already draft designs , and there are plans to transport people in the capsules too .
independent european expeditions the transport of people could open the way for europeans to launch their own missions , and avoid having to depend on the united states or russia to send astronauts into space .
jan woerner , the head of the german aerospace center , says it would only require a little more effort for europe to close the gap with the us and russia .
" a further development on this level would of course mean that we clearly position ourselves as a partner for future space travel missions , " he says .
" in this respect , i think it 's very important that we can tackle this step now . "
germans on the moon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst messerschmid -lrb- bottom , left -rrb- was part of the last successful challenger mission germany has put its planned moon mission on hold due to budget constraints , but interest from researchers has certainly not gone away .
former german astronaut ernst messerschmid says there are still many unanswered questions about the moon , even after the apollo missions .
" apollo was almost too fast and too successful and kept all other initiatives to go back to the moon at bay , " he says .
" basically the next logical step after the space station is , of course , a trip back to the moon , " he says .
and when that next trip to the moon takes place , europeans hope they will go along for the ride .

" we have not measured such a high approval rating for an incumbent chancellor in decades , " the head of emnid , klaus-peter schoeppner told the bild newspaper 's sunday edition .
" especially unheard of is the high expectation of losing among spd supporters . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grand coalition gets the thumbs down in the polls those surveyed give social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate frank-walter steinmeier only a 13 percent chance of beating merkel and becoming chancellor .
and among spd supporters , 53 percent do not want to see the party work with the cdu and the csu coalition .
the poll also demonstrated that 56 percent of germans would like to see an end to the grand coalition , where merkel 's center-right cdu party works together with the social democrats .
the spd has watched its popularity slide in recent years , in part because of merkel 's popularity and its status as a junior coalition member .
with such low poll numbers , frank-walter steinmeier and the other top members of the spd will have to seriously examine their future strategy when they meet in potsdam at the end of july .
csu confident of future as german conservatives gear up for the elections in the fall , chancellor merkel 's sister party , the bavarian csu with horst seehofer at the helm , has pledged to support merkels cdu .
on july 18 , seehofer was re-elected head of the csu with an almost 90 percent majority .
the csu however , is pursuing an election campaign that diverges from merkel 's cdu on key issues .
the central element of the csu campaign is income tax cuts , which it has said it will not back down on .
despite the ongoing crisis and the flurry of negative economic prognoses , the csu maintains that tax cuts are necessary and feasible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer re-elected head of csu the tax cuts , said seehofer , would take effect by 2011 .
merkel 's cdu , meanwhile , has rejected such ambitious plans .
another controversial issue seehofer addressed on saturday was the csu stance on the ratification of the european union 's lisbon treaty .
the csu has called for the german parliament , the bundestag , to have more of a say in european affairs .
seehofer says the csu is not against ratifying the treaty , but rather for strengthening the national parliament on the european level .
" we 're not about destruction ; we do n't want to blockade the treaty .
we want to give germany 's houses of parliament a stronger presence .
we want europe to recognize what it is made of - and we want that our national parliament to have responsibility and be taken seriously . "
time will tell whether or not this will be a workable arrangement. av / glb / reuters / dpa / ap / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" german media has said porsche and vw are close to a deal that would eventually give vw control of porsche .
this comes amid reports that porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking would be stepping down , which porsche has rejected . there are no official details on the talks or the deal itself , with neither company yet to release a statement .
according to germany 's der spiegel magazine , the deal would eventually give vw control of porsche .
initially , it had been porsche that wanted to swallow vw , but the luxury carmaker ran into serious financial troubles as a result of the takeover effort . porsche ceo rejects rumors of resignation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports say wiedeking -lrb- left -rrb- will be replaced by macht -lrb- right -rrb- the news of an eventual merger comes amid a report in der spiegel this week that wiedeking would be removed from the top job at porsche , to be replaced by michael macht , the company 's current production chief .
but porsche has denied the reports , saying that wiedeking will remain as the company 's ceo .
that was despite a report in weekly publication bild am sonntag that wiedeking stood to receive a 100-million-euro -lrb- $ 140 million -rrb- " golden parachute " for stepping aside following a takeover by vw .
that would be the largest severance package in german corporate history .
uwe hueck , the works council head , went so far as to say that the information was part of an attempt to " destroy a man . "
wiedeking himself has also said he plans to complete his contract , which expires in 2012 .
porsche 's repeated denial that wiedeking is for the chop is unlikely to stop the speculation. dfm / glb / ca / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he probably needs it .

as americans on monday mark the 40th anniversary of the first moon landing , europeans are gearing up for their own moon walk . forty years after man first walked on the moon , european astronauts have that great , glowing sphere in the sky back in sight .
with several successes under its belt , europe 's dream of its own expedition to the moon is looking more realistic than ever .
europe 's most ambitious spacecraft to date is the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- , which can deliver up to ten tons of material to the international space station .
but the atv can only carry material into space – and not the other way around , from space to earth .
evert dudok , the president of eads astrium , a subsidiary of the european aeronautic defence and space company , says that transporting material to earth could be made possible .
he says that the current atv , which is relatively cylindrical , would be replaced with a capsule structure , which would then return to earth , just like with the apollo missions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on july 20 , 1969 , neil armstrong became the first man on the moon " the speed would be slowed with parachutes and then it would land in the ocean , " he says .
the biggest technical hurdle facing the europeans is the development of a heat shield to keep the capsule from burning up as it re-enters the atmosphere .
however , there are already draft designs , and there are plans to transport people in the capsules too .
independent european expeditions the transport of people could open the way for europeans to launch their own missions , and avoid having to depend on the united states or russia to send astronauts into space .
jan woerner , the head of the german aerospace center , says it would only require a little more effort for europe to close the gap with the us and russia .
" a further development on this level would of course mean that we clearly position ourselves as a partner for future space travel missions , " he says .
" in this respect , i think it 's very important that we can tackle this step now . "
germans on the moon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst messerschmid -lrb- bottom , left -rrb- was part of the last successful challenger mission germany has put its planned moon mission on hold due to budget constraints , but interest from researchers has certainly not gone away .
former german astronaut ernst messerschmid says there are still many unanswered questions about the moon , even after the apollo missions .
" apollo was almost too fast and too successful and kept all other initiatives to go back to the moon at bay , " he says .
" basically the next logical step after the space station is , of course , a trip back to the moon , " he says .
and when that next trip to the moon takes place , europeans hope they will go along for the ride .

as americans on monday mark the 40th anniversary of the first moon landing , europeans are gearing up for their own moon walk . forty years after man first walked on the moon , european astronauts have that great , glowing sphere in the sky back in sight .
with several successes under its belt , europe 's dream of its own expedition to the moon is looking more realistic than ever .
europe 's most ambitious spacecraft to date is the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- , which can deliver up to ten tons of material to the international space station .
but the atv can only carry material into space – and not the other way around , from space to earth .
evert dudok , the president of eads astrium , a subsidiary of the european aeronautic defence and space company , says that transporting material to earth could be made possible .
he says that the current atv , which is relatively cylindrical , would be replaced with a capsule structure , which would then return to earth , just like with the apollo missions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on july 20 , 1969 , neil armstrong became the first man on the moon " the speed would be slowed with parachutes and then it would land in the ocean , " he says .
the biggest technical hurdle facing the europeans is the development of a heat shield to keep the capsule from burning up as it re-enters the atmosphere .
however , there are already draft designs , and there are plans to transport people in the capsules too .
independent european expeditions the transport of people could open the way for europeans to launch their own missions , and avoid having to depend on the united states or russia to send astronauts into space .
jan woerner , the head of the german aerospace center , says it would only require a little more effort for europe to close the gap with the us and russia .
" a further development on this level would of course mean that we clearly position ourselves as a partner for future space travel missions , " he says .
" in this respect , i think it 's very important that we can tackle this step now . "

former german astronaut ernst messerschmid says there are still many unanswered questions about the moon , even after the apollo missions .
" apollo was almost too fast and too successful and kept all other initiatives to go back to the moon at bay , " he says .
" basically the next logical step after the space station is , of course , a trip back to the moon , " he says .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : election 2009 economic , environmental issues top election agenda german conservatives gear up for fall elections steinmeier defends plan to create 4 million jobs by 2020 merkel calls for unity ahead of national elections elections -pipe- 19.07.2009 poll : most germans expect angela merkel will continue as chancellor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's latest poll numbers are worth smiling about with 10 weeks to go until the german elections , a new poll give a glimpse as to what germans may decide on election day .
right now , all bets are on current chancellor angela merkel keeping her job . as germany gears up for nationwide elections on september 27 , the latest poll released by emnid reveals that 80 percent of german citizens expect conservative chancellor angela merkel of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- to remain in office for a second term .
" we have not measured such a high approval rating for an incumbent chancellor in decades , " the head of emnid , klaus-peter schoeppner told the bild newspaper 's sunday edition .
" especially unheard of is the high expectation of losing among spd supporters . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grand coalition gets the thumbs down in the polls those surveyed give social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate frank-walter steinmeier only a 13 percent chance of beating merkel and becoming chancellor .
and among spd supporters , 53 percent do not want to see the party work with the cdu and the csu coalition .
the poll also demonstrated that 56 percent of germans would like to see an end to the grand coalition , where merkel 's center-right cdu party works together with the social democrats .
the spd has watched its popularity slide in recent years , in part because of merkel 's popularity and its status as a junior coalition member .
with such low poll numbers , frank-walter steinmeier and the other top members of the spd will have to seriously examine their future strategy when they meet in potsdam at the end of july .
csu confident of future as german conservatives gear up for the elections in the fall , chancellor merkel 's sister party , the bavarian csu with horst seehofer at the helm , has pledged to support merkels cdu .
on july 18 , seehofer was re-elected head of the csu with an almost 90 percent majority .

anyone caught puffing away in a non-smoking area faces an on-the-spot 45-euro fine , while cafe owners face penalties of up to 2,500 euros .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , an avid anti-smoker , has instructed the country 's governors to rigorously enforce the ban .
he has even called for officials who fail to do so to be punished .
the new law is being seen as the final nail in the coffin for one of the country 's most ancient traditions .
turkey has one of the highest rates of smoking in the world , and the legislation is expected to cause troubles for cafes , bars and restaurants in cities like istanbul , where the hospitality industry is bracing for a hit to profits .
cafe owner suleymain aktas told deutsche welle his business was already suffering due to the economic crisis , and that the smoking ban would add salt to the wound .
" sure , this ban will affect us both work-wise and in our lifestyle .
we wo n't be able to live the way we did before .
as for our cafe , we will have to find new ways to take some economic measures like sacking workers , " he said .
history up in smoke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan is a staunch anti-smoking advocate turkish cafes are well known for the clouds of flavored smoke wafting through the air from water pipes , or nargile in turkish .
it is a tradition that goes back centuries , but as of sunday this could become a thing of the past .
though despite criticism of the new legislation by industry groups and smokers , there are many turks who see this as a chance to turn a new , healthier corner .
according to opinion polls an overwhelming majority of turks are in favor of tougher anti-smoking laws .
" i think it is good for me because i do n't smoke , because when i sit here and drink i do n't like this smoke .
so it is going to be a good thing , " said volcan , a regular at the keyif cafe in istanbul .
but another cafe patron , oguz , said as he savored what he admits could be one of his last nargile at keyif that he was angered by the smoking ban .
" i like smoking the nargile .
i like the feeling of friendship that goes with it , " he said .
" perhaps nargile is more harmful but it has an ambience and you smoke while chatting .
i do n't find it logical that they ban smoking in nargile cafes , because people come here by choice . "
widespread support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the days of smoky turkish cafes are numbered in nearby taksim square , in the heart of istanbul , there is support to be found for the ban and little sympathy for nargile smokers .
" nargile , it might be part of the tradition , but it has become hyped in the last five or six years ; as though there was no nargile culture before it was created , " said one local .
" it has attracted many , many people to smoke even more .
so i am perfectly happy that nargile cafes will close . "
another passerby said : " i think it is good .
in many places people smoke too many cigarettes to our bad health .
i have waited a long time for this law . "
for centuries , turkey - which is also a major tobacco producer - has prided itself on its smoking traditions .
but here tradition can pass with remarkable speed .
earlier restrictions on smoking on coaches and in shopping malls met with little resistance , and even though there have been a few small protests against the new restrictions , mainly by cafe owners , the government remains determined to enforce them .
it seems the days of smoky turkish cafes are numbered .

many choose to come to paris in the summer when most parisians are not there ! this year , thanks to the recession , more parisians are going to be staying at home … and finding out what they 've been missing .
our correspondent john laurenson sent us this postcard from paris in the summertime .
i 'm writing this inside a left bank café called the rouquet , a place that has n't changed since the 1950s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john laurenson sent his " postcard from europe " from paris motorists honk unhappily along the boulevard saint germain , but the plane trees form a green roof over the street , filtering the sun and giving the place a relaxing air .

they 'd hide away in the little room at the back .
get a bit of peace and quiet before exposing themselves to the rubber-necking crowds at the swankier cafés – the flore and the deux magots down the road .
paris in summer ?
i and -lrb- presumably -rrb- the few million others who visit at this time of year think it 's a great idea .
but for real parisians , it 's very different .
it is , in fact , one of those signs of failure .
like being seen on a bus over the age of 30 .
it means you have n't got any friends - either to go on holiday with or to invite you to their lovely beach-side summer home at arcachon .
or else you just ca n't afford it .
there are rather more french people in this category all of a sudden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in summer , paris even has a beach at the seine river in march , when french pessimism was just at its natural level for early spring , 74 percent reckoned they 'd be going on holiday .
by may , that number had dropped to 56 percent , while in other european countries it had stayed stable at around 64 percent .
which means there will be very many more parisians , or at least parisian ‘ losers ' as they call them here , for the tourists to see .
and a few more places are staying open .
in the old days , paris closed down in august .
with an admirable disregard for financial gain , restaurants and cafés would shut for the height of the tourist season .
many still do .
the rouquet , for example , will be closed for the whole month .
but it 's worth coming .
definitely .
to walk around the parks , peering at the games of chess and boules … to admire the buildings which look bright in summer , grey the rest of the year .
and if you meet a parisian , be friendly and offer to buy him a drink perhaps .
he probably needs it .

many choose to come to paris in the summer when most parisians are not there ! this year , thanks to the recession , more parisians are going to be staying at home … and finding out what they 've been missing .
our correspondent john laurenson sent us this postcard from paris in the summertime .
i 'm writing this inside a left bank café called the rouquet , a place that has n't changed since the 1950s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john laurenson sent his " postcard from europe " from paris motorists honk unhappily along the boulevard saint germain , but the plane trees form a green roof over the street , filtering the sun and giving the place a relaxing air .

they 'd hide away in the little room at the back .
get a bit of peace and quiet before exposing themselves to the rubber-necking crowds at the swankier cafés – the flore and the deux magots down the road .
paris in summer ?
i and -lrb- presumably -rrb- the few million others who visit at this time of year think it 's a great idea .
but for real parisians , it 's very different .
it is , in fact , one of those signs of failure .
like being seen on a bus over the age of 30 .
it means you have n't got any friends - either to go on holiday with or to invite you to their lovely beach-side summer home at arcachon .
or else you just ca n't afford it .
there are rather more french people in this category all of a sudden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in summer , paris even has a beach at the seine river in march , when french pessimism was just at its natural level for early spring , 74 percent reckoned they 'd be going on holiday .
by may , that number had dropped to 56 percent , while in other european countries it had stayed stable at around 64 percent .
which means there will be very many more parisians , or at least parisian ‘ losers ' as they call them here , for the tourists to see .
and a few more places are staying open .
in the old days , paris closed down in august .
with an admirable disregard for financial gain , restaurants and cafés would shut for the height of the tourist season .
many still do .
the rouquet , for example , will be closed for the whole month .
but it 's worth coming .
definitely .

the 37-year-old armstrong , who finished ninth , 1 minute 35 seconds behind his 11-year-junior astana teammate , said the result meant he had little chance of winning an eighth tour title .
" -lrb- contador -rrb- showed he 's the best rider in the race , " armstrong told france 2 television after the stage , and said he would now work to help his teammate win the tour .
armstrong now lies second in the overall standings , 1 minute 37 seconds behind contador , with the surprising briton bradley wiggins in third , 1 minute 46 seconds adrift .
german andreas kloeden , also of astana , is fourth at 2 minutes 17 seconds .
" i 'm happy to be second , " armstrong said .
" i definitely suffered .
i was already a little at my limit at the bottom -lrb- of the climb -rrb- .
i was hurting . "
contador 's time for the 207.5km course from the french city of pontarlier was 5 hours 3 minutes 58 seconds , an impressive average speed of 40.96 kph for a course that featured six climbs .
luxembourg 's andy schleck finished second , 43 seconds behind the winner , while italian vincenzo nibali came in third , 1 minute 3 seconds behind .
" i 'm very happy , " contador said .
" it was a hard climb .
my legs hurt , they hurt a lot . "

anyone caught puffing away in a non-smoking area faces an on-the-spot 45-euro fine , while cafe owners face penalties of up to 2,500 euros .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , an avid anti-smoker , has instructed the country 's governors to rigorously enforce the ban .
he has even called for officials who fail to do so to be punished .
the new law is being seen as the final nail in the coffin for one of the country 's most ancient traditions .
turkey has one of the highest rates of smoking in the world , and the legislation is expected to cause troubles for cafes , bars and restaurants in cities like istanbul , where the hospitality industry is bracing for a hit to profits .
cafe owner suleymain aktas told deutsche welle his business was already suffering due to the economic crisis , and that the smoking ban would add salt to the wound .
" sure , this ban will affect us both work-wise and in our lifestyle .
we wo n't be able to live the way we did before .
as for our cafe , we will have to find new ways to take some economic measures like sacking workers , " he said .
history up in smoke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan is a staunch anti-smoking advocate turkish cafes are well known for the clouds of flavored smoke wafting through the air from water pipes , or nargile in turkish .
it is a tradition that goes back centuries , but as of sunday this could become a thing of the past .
though despite criticism of the new legislation by industry groups and smokers , there are many turks who see this as a chance to turn a new , healthier corner .
according to opinion polls an overwhelming majority of turks are in favor of tougher anti-smoking laws .
" i think it is good for me because i do n't smoke , because when i sit here and drink i do n't like this smoke .
so it is going to be a good thing , " said volcan , a regular at the keyif cafe in istanbul .
but another cafe patron , oguz , said as he savored what he admits could be one of his last nargile at keyif that he was angered by the smoking ban .
" i like smoking the nargile .
i like the feeling of friendship that goes with it , " he said .
" perhaps nargile is more harmful but it has an ambience and you smoke while chatting .
i do n't find it logical that they ban smoking in nargile cafes , because people come here by choice . "
widespread support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the days of smoky turkish cafes are numbered in nearby taksim square , in the heart of istanbul , there is support to be found for the ban and little sympathy for nargile smokers .
" nargile , it might be part of the tradition , but it has become hyped in the last five or six years ; as though there was no nargile culture before it was created , " said one local .
" it has attracted many , many people to smoke even more .
so i am perfectly happy that nargile cafes will close . "
another passerby said : " i think it is good .
in many places people smoke too many cigarettes to our bad health .
i have waited a long time for this law . "
for centuries , turkey - which is also a major tobacco producer - has prided itself on its smoking traditions .
but here tradition can pass with remarkable speed .
earlier restrictions on smoking on coaches and in shopping malls met with little resistance , and even though there have been a few small protests against the new restrictions , mainly by cafe owners , the government remains determined to enforce them .
it seems the days of smoky turkish cafes are numbered .

anyone caught puffing away in a non-smoking area faces an on-the-spot 45-euro fine , while cafe owners face penalties of up to 2,500 euros .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , an avid anti-smoker , has instructed the country 's governors to rigorously enforce the ban .
he has even called for officials who fail to do so to be punished .
the new law is being seen as the final nail in the coffin for one of the country 's most ancient traditions .
turkey has one of the highest rates of smoking in the world , and the legislation is expected to cause troubles for cafes , bars and restaurants in cities like istanbul , where the hospitality industry is bracing for a hit to profits .
cafe owner suleymain aktas told deutsche welle his business was already suffering due to the economic crisis , and that the smoking ban would add salt to the wound .

" i like smoking the nargile .

" perhaps nargile is more harmful but it has an ambience and you smoke while chatting .
i do n't find it logical that they ban smoking in nargile cafes , because people come here by choice . "

" german media has said porsche and vw are close to a deal that would eventually give vw control of porsche .
this comes amid reports that porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking would be stepping down , which porsche has rejected . there are no official details on the talks or the deal itself , with neither company yet to release a statement .
according to germany 's der spiegel magazine , the deal would eventually give vw control of porsche .
initially , it had been porsche that wanted to swallow vw , but the luxury carmaker ran into serious financial troubles as a result of the takeover effort . porsche ceo rejects rumors of resignation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports say wiedeking -lrb- left -rrb- will be replaced by macht -lrb- right -rrb- the news of an eventual merger comes amid a report in der spiegel this week that wiedeking would be removed from the top job at porsche , to be replaced by michael macht , the company 's current production chief .
but porsche has denied the reports , saying that wiedeking will remain as the company 's ceo .
that was despite a report in weekly publication bild am sonntag that wiedeking stood to receive a 100-million-euro -lrb- $ 140 million -rrb- " golden parachute " for stepping aside following a takeover by vw .
that would be the largest severance package in german corporate history .
uwe hueck , the works council head , went so far as to say that the information was part of an attempt to " destroy a man . "
wiedeking himself has also said he plans to complete his contract , which expires in 2012 .
porsche 's repeated denial that wiedeking is for the chop is unlikely to stop the speculation. dfm / glb / ca / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as americans on monday mark the 40th anniversary of the first moon landing , europeans are gearing up for their own moon walk . forty years after man first walked on the moon , european astronauts have that great , glowing sphere in the sky back in sight .
with several successes under its belt , europe 's dream of its own expedition to the moon is looking more realistic than ever .
europe 's most ambitious spacecraft to date is the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- , which can deliver up to ten tons of material to the international space station .
but the atv can only carry material into space – and not the other way around , from space to earth .
evert dudok , the president of eads astrium , a subsidiary of the european aeronautic defence and space company , says that transporting material to earth could be made possible .
he says that the current atv , which is relatively cylindrical , would be replaced with a capsule structure , which would then return to earth , just like with the apollo missions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on july 20 , 1969 , neil armstrong became the first man on the moon " the speed would be slowed with parachutes and then it would land in the ocean , " he says .
the biggest technical hurdle facing the europeans is the development of a heat shield to keep the capsule from burning up as it re-enters the atmosphere .
however , there are already draft designs , and there are plans to transport people in the capsules too .
independent european expeditions the transport of people could open the way for europeans to launch their own missions , and avoid having to depend on the united states or russia to send astronauts into space .
jan woerner , the head of the german aerospace center , says it would only require a little more effort for europe to close the gap with the us and russia .
" a further development on this level would of course mean that we clearly position ourselves as a partner for future space travel missions , " he says .
" in this respect , i think it 's very important that we can tackle this step now . "

former german astronaut ernst messerschmid says there are still many unanswered questions about the moon , even after the apollo missions .
" apollo was almost too fast and too successful and kept all other initiatives to go back to the moon at bay , " he says .
" basically the next logical step after the space station is , of course , a trip back to the moon , " he says .
and when that next trip to the moon takes place , europeans hope they will go along for the ride .

many choose to come to paris in the summer when most parisians are not there ! this year , thanks to the recession , more parisians are going to be staying at home … and finding out what they 've been missing .
our correspondent john laurenson sent us this postcard from paris in the summertime .
i 'm writing this inside a left bank café called the rouquet , a place that has n't changed since the 1950s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john laurenson sent his " postcard from europe " from paris motorists honk unhappily along the boulevard saint germain , but the plane trees form a green roof over the street , filtering the sun and giving the place a relaxing air .
a sparrow hops in , grabs an abandoned chip off the floor and flies towards the door , lop-sided because of the weight of the thing .
the patronne sidles up and tells me she 's been here for 55 years .
she remembers jean-paul sartre and simone de beauvoir coming here every morning .
they 'd hide away in the little room at the back .
get a bit of peace and quiet before exposing themselves to the rubber-necking crowds at the swankier cafés – the flore and the deux magots down the road .
paris in summer ?
i and -lrb- presumably -rrb- the few million others who visit at this time of year think it 's a great idea .
but for real parisians , it 's very different .
it is , in fact , one of those signs of failure .
like being seen on a bus over the age of 30 .
it means you have n't got any friends - either to go on holiday with or to invite you to their lovely beach-side summer home at arcachon .
or else you just ca n't afford it .
there are rather more french people in this category all of a sudden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in summer , paris even has a beach at the seine river in march , when french pessimism was just at its natural level for early spring , 74 percent reckoned they 'd be going on holiday .
by may , that number had dropped to 56 percent , while in other european countries it had stayed stable at around 64 percent .
which means there will be very many more parisians , or at least parisian ‘ losers ' as they call them here , for the tourists to see .
and a few more places are staying open .
in the old days , paris closed down in august .
with an admirable disregard for financial gain , restaurants and cafés would shut for the height of the tourist season .
many still do .
the rouquet , for example , will be closed for the whole month .
but it 's worth coming .
definitely .
to walk around the parks , peering at the games of chess and boules … to admire the buildings which look bright in summer , grey the rest of the year .
and if you meet a parisian , be friendly and offer to buy him a drink perhaps .
he probably needs it .

many choose to come to paris in the summer when most parisians are not there ! this year , thanks to the recession , more parisians are going to be staying at home … and finding out what they 've been missing .
our correspondent john laurenson sent us this postcard from paris in the summertime .
i 'm writing this inside a left bank café called the rouquet , a place that has n't changed since the 1950s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john laurenson sent his " postcard from europe " from paris motorists honk unhappily along the boulevard saint germain , but the plane trees form a green roof over the street , filtering the sun and giving the place a relaxing air .
a sparrow hops in , grabs an abandoned chip off the floor and flies towards the door , lop-sided because of the weight of the thing .
the patronne sidles up and tells me she 's been here for 55 years .
she remembers jean-paul sartre and simone de beauvoir coming here every morning .
they 'd hide away in the little room at the back .
get a bit of peace and quiet before exposing themselves to the rubber-necking crowds at the swankier cafés – the flore and the deux magots down the road .
paris in summer ?
i and -lrb- presumably -rrb- the few million others who visit at this time of year think it 's a great idea .
but for real parisians , it 's very different .
it is , in fact , one of those signs of failure .
like being seen on a bus over the age of 30 .
it means you have n't got any friends - either to go on holiday with or to invite you to their lovely beach-side summer home at arcachon .
or else you just ca n't afford it .
there are rather more french people in this category all of a sudden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in summer , paris even has a beach at the seine river in march , when french pessimism was just at its natural level for early spring , 74 percent reckoned they 'd be going on holiday .
by may , that number had dropped to 56 percent , while in other european countries it had stayed stable at around 64 percent .
which means there will be very many more parisians , or at least parisian ‘ losers ' as they call them here , for the tourists to see .
and a few more places are staying open .
in the old days , paris closed down in august .
with an admirable disregard for financial gain , restaurants and cafés would shut for the height of the tourist season .
many still do .
the rouquet , for example , will be closed for the whole month .
but it 's worth coming .
definitely .
to walk around the parks , peering at the games of chess and boules … to admire the buildings which look bright in summer , grey the rest of the year .
and if you meet a parisian , be friendly and offer to buy him a drink perhaps .
he probably needs it .

right now , all bets are on current chancellor angela merkel keeping her job . as germany gears up for nationwide elections on september 27 , the latest poll released by emnid reveals that 80 percent of german citizens expect conservative chancellor angela merkel of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- to remain in office for a second term .
" we have not measured such a high approval rating for an incumbent chancellor in decades , " the head of emnid , klaus-peter schoeppner told the bild newspaper 's sunday edition .
" especially unheard of is the high expectation of losing among spd supporters . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grand coalition gets the thumbs down in the polls those surveyed give social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate frank-walter steinmeier only a 13 percent chance of beating merkel and becoming chancellor .
and among spd supporters , 53 percent do not want to see the party work with the cdu and the csu coalition .
the poll also demonstrated that 56 percent of germans would like to see an end to the grand coalition , where merkel 's center-right cdu party works together with the social democrats .
the spd has watched its popularity slide in recent years , in part because of merkel 's popularity and its status as a junior coalition member .
with such low poll numbers , frank-walter steinmeier and the other top members of the spd will have to seriously examine their future strategy when they meet in potsdam at the end of july .
csu confident of future as german conservatives gear up for the elections in the fall , chancellor merkel 's sister party , the bavarian csu with horst seehofer at the helm , has pledged to support merkels cdu .
on july 18 , seehofer was re-elected head of the csu with an almost 90 percent majority .
the csu however , is pursuing an election campaign that diverges from merkel 's cdu on key issues .
the central element of the csu campaign is income tax cuts , which it has said it will not back down on .
despite the ongoing crisis and the flurry of negative economic prognoses , the csu maintains that tax cuts are necessary and feasible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer re-elected head of csu the tax cuts , said seehofer , would take effect by 2011 .
merkel 's cdu , meanwhile , has rejected such ambitious plans .
another controversial issue seehofer addressed on saturday was the csu stance on the ratification of the european union 's lisbon treaty .
the csu has called for the german parliament , the bundestag , to have more of a say in european affairs .
seehofer says the csu is not against ratifying the treaty , but rather for strengthening the national parliament on the european level .
" we 're not about destruction ; we do n't want to blockade the treaty .
we want to give germany 's houses of parliament a stronger presence .
we want europe to recognize what it is made of - and we want that our national parliament to have responsibility and be taken seriously . "

right now , all bets are on current chancellor angela merkel keeping her job . as germany gears up for nationwide elections on september 27 , the latest poll released by emnid reveals that 80 percent of german citizens expect conservative chancellor angela merkel of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- to remain in office for a second term .
" we have not measured such a high approval rating for an incumbent chancellor in decades , " the head of emnid , klaus-peter schoeppner told the bild newspaper 's sunday edition .
" especially unheard of is the high expectation of losing among spd supporters . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grand coalition gets the thumbs down in the polls those surveyed give social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate frank-walter steinmeier only a 13 percent chance of beating merkel and becoming chancellor .
and among spd supporters , 53 percent do not want to see the party work with the cdu and the csu coalition .
the poll also demonstrated that 56 percent of germans would like to see an end to the grand coalition , where merkel 's center-right cdu party works together with the social democrats .
the spd has watched its popularity slide in recent years , in part because of merkel 's popularity and its status as a junior coalition member .
with such low poll numbers , frank-walter steinmeier and the other top members of the spd will have to seriously examine their future strategy when they meet in potsdam at the end of july .
csu confident of future as german conservatives gear up for the elections in the fall , chancellor merkel 's sister party , the bavarian csu with horst seehofer at the helm , has pledged to support merkels cdu .
on july 18 , seehofer was re-elected head of the csu with an almost 90 percent majority .
the csu however , is pursuing an election campaign that diverges from merkel 's cdu on key issues .
the central element of the csu campaign is income tax cuts , which it has said it will not back down on .
despite the ongoing crisis and the flurry of negative economic prognoses , the csu maintains that tax cuts are necessary and feasible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer re-elected head of csu the tax cuts , said seehofer , would take effect by 2011 .
merkel 's cdu , meanwhile , has rejected such ambitious plans .
another controversial issue seehofer addressed on saturday was the csu stance on the ratification of the european union 's lisbon treaty .
the csu has called for the german parliament , the bundestag , to have more of a say in european affairs .
seehofer says the csu is not against ratifying the treaty , but rather for strengthening the national parliament on the european level .

the 37-year-old armstrong , who finished ninth , 1 minute 35 seconds behind his 11-year-junior astana teammate , said the result meant he had little chance of winning an eighth tour title .
" -lrb- contador -rrb- showed he 's the best rider in the race , " armstrong told france 2 television after the stage , and said he would now work to help his teammate win the tour .
armstrong now lies second in the overall standings , 1 minute 37 seconds behind contador , with the surprising briton bradley wiggins in third , 1 minute 46 seconds adrift .
german andreas kloeden , also of astana , is fourth at 2 minutes 17 seconds .
" i 'm happy to be second , " armstrong said .
" i definitely suffered .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 19.07.2009 history up in smoke as turkey extends smoking restrictions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social nargile smokers will find it hard to enjoy a puff in cafes the expression " smoke like a turk " seems destined for the rubbish bin of history after turkey introduced sunday some of the toughest anti-smoking legislation in europe . smoking has been banned from all closed public areas , bars , cafes and restaurants , and even extends to patrons sitting outside cafes .
anyone caught puffing away in a non-smoking area faces an on-the-spot 45-euro fine , while cafe owners face penalties of up to 2,500 euros .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , an avid anti-smoker , has instructed the country 's governors to rigorously enforce the ban .
he has even called for officials who fail to do so to be punished .
the new law is being seen as the final nail in the coffin for one of the country 's most ancient traditions .
turkey has one of the highest rates of smoking in the world , and the legislation is expected to cause troubles for cafes , bars and restaurants in cities like istanbul , where the hospitality industry is bracing for a hit to profits .
cafe owner suleymain aktas told deutsche welle his business was already suffering due to the economic crisis , and that the smoking ban would add salt to the wound .
" sure , this ban will affect us both work-wise and in our lifestyle .
we wo n't be able to live the way we did before .
as for our cafe , we will have to find new ways to take some economic measures like sacking workers , " he said .
history up in smoke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan is a staunch anti-smoking advocate turkish cafes are well known for the clouds of flavored smoke wafting through the air from water pipes , or nargile in turkish .
it is a tradition that goes back centuries , but as of sunday this could become a thing of the past .
though despite criticism of the new legislation by industry groups and smokers , there are many turks who see this as a chance to turn a new , healthier corner .
according to opinion polls an overwhelming majority of turks are in favor of tougher anti-smoking laws .
" i think it is good for me because i do n't smoke , because when i sit here and drink i do n't like this smoke .
so it is going to be a good thing , " said volcan , a regular at the keyif cafe in istanbul .
but another cafe patron , oguz , said as he savored what he admits could be one of his last nargile at keyif that he was angered by the smoking ban .
" i like smoking the nargile .
i like the feeling of friendship that goes with it , " he said .
" perhaps nargile is more harmful but it has an ambience and you smoke while chatting .
i do n't find it logical that they ban smoking in nargile cafes , because people come here by choice . "
widespread support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the days of smoky turkish cafes are numbered in nearby taksim square , in the heart of istanbul , there is support to be found for the ban and little sympathy for nargile smokers .
" nargile , it might be part of the tradition , but it has become hyped in the last five or six years ; as though there was no nargile culture before it was created , " said one local .
" it has attracted many , many people to smoke even more .
so i am perfectly happy that nargile cafes will close . "
another passerby said : " i think it is good .
in many places people smoke too many cigarettes to our bad health .
i have waited a long time for this law . "
for centuries , turkey - which is also a major tobacco producer - has prided itself on its smoking traditions .
but here tradition can pass with remarkable speed .
earlier restrictions on smoking on coaches and in shopping malls met with little resistance , and even though there have been a few small protests against the new restrictions , mainly by cafe owners , the government remains determined to enforce them .
it seems the days of smoky turkish cafes are numbered .

anyone caught puffing away in a non-smoking area faces an on-the-spot 45-euro fine , while cafe owners face penalties of up to 2,500 euros .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , an avid anti-smoker , has instructed the country 's governors to rigorously enforce the ban .
he has even called for officials who fail to do so to be punished .
the new law is being seen as the final nail in the coffin for one of the country 's most ancient traditions .
turkey has one of the highest rates of smoking in the world , and the legislation is expected to cause troubles for cafes , bars and restaurants in cities like istanbul , where the hospitality industry is bracing for a hit to profits .
cafe owner suleymain aktas told deutsche welle his business was already suffering due to the economic crisis , and that the smoking ban would add salt to the wound .
" sure , this ban will affect us both work-wise and in our lifestyle .
we wo n't be able to live the way we did before .
as for our cafe , we will have to find new ways to take some economic measures like sacking workers , " he said .
history up in smoke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan is a staunch anti-smoking advocate turkish cafes are well known for the clouds of flavored smoke wafting through the air from water pipes , or nargile in turkish .
it is a tradition that goes back centuries , but as of sunday this could become a thing of the past .
though despite criticism of the new legislation by industry groups and smokers , there are many turks who see this as a chance to turn a new , healthier corner .
according to opinion polls an overwhelming majority of turks are in favor of tougher anti-smoking laws .
" i think it is good for me because i do n't smoke , because when i sit here and drink i do n't like this smoke .
so it is going to be a good thing , " said volcan , a regular at the keyif cafe in istanbul .
but another cafe patron , oguz , said as he savored what he admits could be one of his last nargile at keyif that he was angered by the smoking ban .
" i like smoking the nargile .
i like the feeling of friendship that goes with it , " he said .
" perhaps nargile is more harmful but it has an ambience and you smoke while chatting .
i do n't find it logical that they ban smoking in nargile cafes , because people come here by choice . "
widespread support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the days of smoky turkish cafes are numbered in nearby taksim square , in the heart of istanbul , there is support to be found for the ban and little sympathy for nargile smokers .
" nargile , it might be part of the tradition , but it has become hyped in the last five or six years ; as though there was no nargile culture before it was created , " said one local .
" it has attracted many , many people to smoke even more .
so i am perfectly happy that nargile cafes will close . "
another passerby said : " i think it is good .
in many places people smoke too many cigarettes to our bad health .
i have waited a long time for this law . "
for centuries , turkey - which is also a major tobacco producer - has prided itself on its smoking traditions .
but here tradition can pass with remarkable speed .
earlier restrictions on smoking on coaches and in shopping malls met with little resistance , and even though there have been a few small protests against the new restrictions , mainly by cafe owners , the government remains determined to enforce them .
it seems the days of smoky turkish cafes are numbered .

for centuries , turkey - which is also a major tobacco producer - has prided itself on its smoking traditions .

anyone caught puffing away in a non-smoking area faces an on-the-spot 45-euro fine , while cafe owners face penalties of up to 2,500 euros .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , an avid anti-smoker , has instructed the country 's governors to rigorously enforce the ban .
he has even called for officials who fail to do so to be punished .
the new law is being seen as the final nail in the coffin for one of the country 's most ancient traditions .
turkey has one of the highest rates of smoking in the world , and the legislation is expected to cause troubles for cafes , bars and restaurants in cities like istanbul , where the hospitality industry is bracing for a hit to profits .
cafe owner suleymain aktas told deutsche welle his business was already suffering due to the economic crisis , and that the smoking ban would add salt to the wound .
" sure , this ban will affect us both work-wise and in our lifestyle .
we wo n't be able to live the way we did before .
as for our cafe , we will have to find new ways to take some economic measures like sacking workers , " he said .
history up in smoke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan is a staunch anti-smoking advocate turkish cafes are well known for the clouds of flavored smoke wafting through the air from water pipes , or nargile in turkish .
it is a tradition that goes back centuries , but as of sunday this could become a thing of the past .
though despite criticism of the new legislation by industry groups and smokers , there are many turks who see this as a chance to turn a new , healthier corner .
according to opinion polls an overwhelming majority of turks are in favor of tougher anti-smoking laws .
" i think it is good for me because i do n't smoke , because when i sit here and drink i do n't like this smoke .
so it is going to be a good thing , " said volcan , a regular at the keyif cafe in istanbul .
but another cafe patron , oguz , said as he savored what he admits could be one of his last nargile at keyif that he was angered by the smoking ban .
" i like smoking the nargile .
i like the feeling of friendship that goes with it , " he said .
" perhaps nargile is more harmful but it has an ambience and you smoke while chatting .
i do n't find it logical that they ban smoking in nargile cafes , because people come here by choice . "
widespread support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the days of smoky turkish cafes are numbered in nearby taksim square , in the heart of istanbul , there is support to be found for the ban and little sympathy for nargile smokers .

as americans on monday mark the 40th anniversary of the first moon landing , europeans are gearing up for their own moon walk . forty years after man first walked on the moon , european astronauts have that great , glowing sphere in the sky back in sight .
with several successes under its belt , europe 's dream of its own expedition to the moon is looking more realistic than ever .
europe 's most ambitious spacecraft to date is the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- , which can deliver up to ten tons of material to the international space station .
but the atv can only carry material into space – and not the other way around , from space to earth .
evert dudok , the president of eads astrium , a subsidiary of the european aeronautic defence and space company , says that transporting material to earth could be made possible .
he says that the current atv , which is relatively cylindrical , would be replaced with a capsule structure , which would then return to earth , just like with the apollo missions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on july 20 , 1969 , neil armstrong became the first man on the moon " the speed would be slowed with parachutes and then it would land in the ocean , " he says .
the biggest technical hurdle facing the europeans is the development of a heat shield to keep the capsule from burning up as it re-enters the atmosphere .
however , there are already draft designs , and there are plans to transport people in the capsules too .
independent european expeditions the transport of people could open the way for europeans to launch their own missions , and avoid having to depend on the united states or russia to send astronauts into space .
jan woerner , the head of the german aerospace center , says it would only require a little more effort for europe to close the gap with the us and russia .
" a further development on this level would of course mean that we clearly position ourselves as a partner for future space travel missions , " he says .
" in this respect , i think it 's very important that we can tackle this step now . "
germans on the moon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst messerschmid -lrb- bottom , left -rrb- was part of the last successful challenger mission germany has put its planned moon mission on hold due to budget constraints , but interest from researchers has certainly not gone away .
former german astronaut ernst messerschmid says there are still many unanswered questions about the moon , even after the apollo missions .
" apollo was almost too fast and too successful and kept all other initiatives to go back to the moon at bay , " he says .
" basically the next logical step after the space station is , of course , a trip back to the moon , " he says .
and when that next trip to the moon takes place , europeans hope they will go along for the ride .

as americans on monday mark the 40th anniversary of the first moon landing , europeans are gearing up for their own moon walk . forty years after man first walked on the moon , european astronauts have that great , glowing sphere in the sky back in sight .
with several successes under its belt , europe 's dream of its own expedition to the moon is looking more realistic than ever .
europe 's most ambitious spacecraft to date is the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- , which can deliver up to ten tons of material to the international space station .
but the atv can only carry material into space – and not the other way around , from space to earth .
evert dudok , the president of eads astrium , a subsidiary of the european aeronautic defence and space company , says that transporting material to earth could be made possible .
he says that the current atv , which is relatively cylindrical , would be replaced with a capsule structure , which would then return to earth , just like with the apollo missions .

however , there are already draft designs , and there are plans to transport people in the capsules too .
independent european expeditions the transport of people could open the way for europeans to launch their own missions , and avoid having to depend on the united states or russia to send astronauts into space .

right now , all bets are on current chancellor angela merkel keeping her job . as germany gears up for nationwide elections on september 27 , the latest poll released by emnid reveals that 80 percent of german citizens expect conservative chancellor angela merkel of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- to remain in office for a second term .
" we have not measured such a high approval rating for an incumbent chancellor in decades , " the head of emnid , klaus-peter schoeppner told the bild newspaper 's sunday edition .
" especially unheard of is the high expectation of losing among spd supporters . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grand coalition gets the thumbs down in the polls those surveyed give social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate frank-walter steinmeier only a 13 percent chance of beating merkel and becoming chancellor .
and among spd supporters , 53 percent do not want to see the party work with the cdu and the csu coalition .
the poll also demonstrated that 56 percent of germans would like to see an end to the grand coalition , where merkel 's center-right cdu party works together with the social democrats .
the spd has watched its popularity slide in recent years , in part because of merkel 's popularity and its status as a junior coalition member .
with such low poll numbers , frank-walter steinmeier and the other top members of the spd will have to seriously examine their future strategy when they meet in potsdam at the end of july .
csu confident of future as german conservatives gear up for the elections in the fall , chancellor merkel 's sister party , the bavarian csu with horst seehofer at the helm , has pledged to support merkels cdu .
on july 18 , seehofer was re-elected head of the csu with an almost 90 percent majority .
the csu however , is pursuing an election campaign that diverges from merkel 's cdu on key issues .
the central element of the csu campaign is income tax cuts , which it has said it will not back down on .
despite the ongoing crisis and the flurry of negative economic prognoses , the csu maintains that tax cuts are necessary and feasible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer re-elected head of csu the tax cuts , said seehofer , would take effect by 2011 .
merkel 's cdu , meanwhile , has rejected such ambitious plans .
another controversial issue seehofer addressed on saturday was the csu stance on the ratification of the european union 's lisbon treaty .
the csu has called for the german parliament , the bundestag , to have more of a say in european affairs .
seehofer says the csu is not against ratifying the treaty , but rather for strengthening the national parliament on the european level .
" we 're not about destruction ; we do n't want to blockade the treaty .
we want to give germany 's houses of parliament a stronger presence .
we want europe to recognize what it is made of - and we want that our national parliament to have responsibility and be taken seriously . "

right now , all bets are on current chancellor angela merkel keeping her job . as germany gears up for nationwide elections on september 27 , the latest poll released by emnid reveals that 80 percent of german citizens expect conservative chancellor angela merkel of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- to remain in office for a second term .
" we have not measured such a high approval rating for an incumbent chancellor in decades , " the head of emnid , klaus-peter schoeppner told the bild newspaper 's sunday edition .
" especially unheard of is the high expectation of losing among spd supporters . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grand coalition gets the thumbs down in the polls those surveyed give social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate frank-walter steinmeier only a 13 percent chance of beating merkel and becoming chancellor .
and among spd supporters , 53 percent do not want to see the party work with the cdu and the csu coalition .
the poll also demonstrated that 56 percent of germans would like to see an end to the grand coalition , where merkel 's center-right cdu party works together with the social democrats .
the spd has watched its popularity slide in recent years , in part because of merkel 's popularity and its status as a junior coalition member .
with such low poll numbers , frank-walter steinmeier and the other top members of the spd will have to seriously examine their future strategy when they meet in potsdam at the end of july .
csu confident of future as german conservatives gear up for the elections in the fall , chancellor merkel 's sister party , the bavarian csu with horst seehofer at the helm , has pledged to support merkels cdu .
on july 18 , seehofer was re-elected head of the csu with an almost 90 percent majority .
the csu however , is pursuing an election campaign that diverges from merkel 's cdu on key issues .
the central element of the csu campaign is income tax cuts , which it has said it will not back down on .
despite the ongoing crisis and the flurry of negative economic prognoses , the csu maintains that tax cuts are necessary and feasible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer re-elected head of csu the tax cuts , said seehofer , would take effect by 2011 .
merkel 's cdu , meanwhile , has rejected such ambitious plans .
another controversial issue seehofer addressed on saturday was the csu stance on the ratification of the european union 's lisbon treaty .
the csu has called for the german parliament , the bundestag , to have more of a say in european affairs .
seehofer says the csu is not against ratifying the treaty , but rather for strengthening the national parliament on the european level .
" we 're not about destruction ; we do n't want to blockade the treaty .
we want to give germany 's houses of parliament a stronger presence .
we want europe to recognize what it is made of - and we want that our national parliament to have responsibility and be taken seriously . "

the 37-year-old armstrong , who finished ninth , 1 minute 35 seconds behind his 11-year-junior astana teammate , said the result meant he had little chance of winning an eighth tour title .
" -lrb- contador -rrb- showed he 's the best rider in the race , " armstrong told france 2 television after the stage , and said he would now work to help his teammate win the tour .
armstrong now lies second in the overall standings , 1 minute 37 seconds behind contador , with the surprising briton bradley wiggins in third , 1 minute 46 seconds adrift .
german andreas kloeden , also of astana , is fourth at 2 minutes 17 seconds .
" i 'm happy to be second , " armstrong said .
" i definitely suffered .
i was already a little at my limit at the bottom -lrb- of the climb -rrb- .
i was hurting . "
contador 's time for the 207.5km course from the french city of pontarlier was 5 hours 3 minutes 58 seconds , an impressive average speed of 40.96 kph for a course that featured six climbs .
luxembourg 's andy schleck finished second , 43 seconds behind the winner , while italian vincenzo nibali came in third , 1 minute 3 seconds behind .
" i 'm very happy , " contador said .
" it was a hard climb .

the 37-year-old armstrong , who finished ninth , 1 minute 35 seconds behind his 11-year-junior astana teammate , said the result meant he had little chance of winning an eighth tour title .
" -lrb- contador -rrb- showed he 's the best rider in the race , " armstrong told france 2 television after the stage , and said he would now work to help his teammate win the tour .
armstrong now lies second in the overall standings , 1 minute 37 seconds behind contador , with the surprising briton bradley wiggins in third , 1 minute 46 seconds adrift .
german andreas kloeden , also of astana , is fourth at 2 minutes 17 seconds .

right now , all bets are on current chancellor angela merkel keeping her job . as germany gears up for nationwide elections on september 27 , the latest poll released by emnid reveals that 80 percent of german citizens expect conservative chancellor angela merkel of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- to remain in office for a second term .
" we have not measured such a high approval rating for an incumbent chancellor in decades , " the head of emnid , klaus-peter schoeppner told the bild newspaper 's sunday edition .
" especially unheard of is the high expectation of losing among spd supporters . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grand coalition gets the thumbs down in the polls those surveyed give social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate frank-walter steinmeier only a 13 percent chance of beating merkel and becoming chancellor .
and among spd supporters , 53 percent do not want to see the party work with the cdu and the csu coalition .
the poll also demonstrated that 56 percent of germans would like to see an end to the grand coalition , where merkel 's center-right cdu party works together with the social democrats .
the spd has watched its popularity slide in recent years , in part because of merkel 's popularity and its status as a junior coalition member .
with such low poll numbers , frank-walter steinmeier and the other top members of the spd will have to seriously examine their future strategy when they meet in potsdam at the end of july .
csu confident of future as german conservatives gear up for the elections in the fall , chancellor merkel 's sister party , the bavarian csu with horst seehofer at the helm , has pledged to support merkels cdu .
on july 18 , seehofer was re-elected head of the csu with an almost 90 percent majority .
the csu however , is pursuing an election campaign that diverges from merkel 's cdu on key issues .
the central element of the csu campaign is income tax cuts , which it has said it will not back down on .
despite the ongoing crisis and the flurry of negative economic prognoses , the csu maintains that tax cuts are necessary and feasible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer re-elected head of csu the tax cuts , said seehofer , would take effect by 2011 .
merkel 's cdu , meanwhile , has rejected such ambitious plans .
another controversial issue seehofer addressed on saturday was the csu stance on the ratification of the european union 's lisbon treaty .
the csu has called for the german parliament , the bundestag , to have more of a say in european affairs .
seehofer says the csu is not against ratifying the treaty , but rather for strengthening the national parliament on the european level .
" we 're not about destruction ; we do n't want to blockade the treaty .
we want to give germany 's houses of parliament a stronger presence .
we want europe to recognize what it is made of - and we want that our national parliament to have responsibility and be taken seriously . "

the poll also demonstrated that 56 percent of germans would like to see an end to the grand coalition , where merkel 's center-right cdu party works together with the social democrats .
the spd has watched its popularity slide in recent years , in part because of merkel 's popularity and its status as a junior coalition member .
with such low poll numbers , frank-walter steinmeier and the other top members of the spd will have to seriously examine their future strategy when they meet in potsdam at the end of july .
csu confident of future as german conservatives gear up for the elections in the fall , chancellor merkel 's sister party , the bavarian csu with horst seehofer at the helm , has pledged to support merkels cdu .
on july 18 , seehofer was re-elected head of the csu with an almost 90 percent majority .
the csu however , is pursuing an election campaign that diverges from merkel 's cdu on key issues .
the central element of the csu campaign is income tax cuts , which it has said it will not back down on .
despite the ongoing crisis and the flurry of negative economic prognoses , the csu maintains that tax cuts are necessary and feasible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer re-elected head of csu the tax cuts , said seehofer , would take effect by 2011 .
merkel 's cdu , meanwhile , has rejected such ambitious plans .
another controversial issue seehofer addressed on saturday was the csu stance on the ratification of the european union 's lisbon treaty .
the csu has called for the german parliament , the bundestag , to have more of a say in european affairs .
seehofer says the csu is not against ratifying the treaty , but rather for strengthening the national parliament on the european level .
" we 're not about destruction ; we do n't want to blockade the treaty .
we want to give germany 's houses of parliament a stronger presence .
we want europe to recognize what it is made of - and we want that our national parliament to have responsibility and be taken seriously . "

as americans on monday mark the 40th anniversary of the first moon landing , europeans are gearing up for their own moon walk . forty years after man first walked on the moon , european astronauts have that great , glowing sphere in the sky back in sight .
with several successes under its belt , europe 's dream of its own expedition to the moon is looking more realistic than ever .
europe 's most ambitious spacecraft to date is the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- , which can deliver up to ten tons of material to the international space station .
but the atv can only carry material into space – and not the other way around , from space to earth .
evert dudok , the president of eads astrium , a subsidiary of the european aeronautic defence and space company , says that transporting material to earth could be made possible .
he says that the current atv , which is relatively cylindrical , would be replaced with a capsule structure , which would then return to earth , just like with the apollo missions .

the biggest technical hurdle facing the europeans is the development of a heat shield to keep the capsule from burning up as it re-enters the atmosphere .
however , there are already draft designs , and there are plans to transport people in the capsules too .
independent european expeditions the transport of people could open the way for europeans to launch their own missions , and avoid having to depend on the united states or russia to send astronauts into space .
jan woerner , the head of the german aerospace center , says it would only require a little more effort for europe to close the gap with the us and russia .
" a further development on this level would of course mean that we clearly position ourselves as a partner for future space travel missions , " he says .

" basically the next logical step after the space station is , of course , a trip back to the moon , " he says .

as americans on monday mark the 40th anniversary of the first moon landing , europeans are gearing up for their own moon walk . forty years after man first walked on the moon , european astronauts have that great , glowing sphere in the sky back in sight .
with several successes under its belt , europe 's dream of its own expedition to the moon is looking more realistic than ever .
europe 's most ambitious spacecraft to date is the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- , which can deliver up to ten tons of material to the international space station .
but the atv can only carry material into space – and not the other way around , from space to earth .
evert dudok , the president of eads astrium , a subsidiary of the european aeronautic defence and space company , says that transporting material to earth could be made possible .
he says that the current atv , which is relatively cylindrical , would be replaced with a capsule structure , which would then return to earth , just like with the apollo missions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on july 20 , 1969 , neil armstrong became the first man on the moon " the speed would be slowed with parachutes and then it would land in the ocean , " he says .
the biggest technical hurdle facing the europeans is the development of a heat shield to keep the capsule from burning up as it re-enters the atmosphere .
however , there are already draft designs , and there are plans to transport people in the capsules too .
independent european expeditions the transport of people could open the way for europeans to launch their own missions , and avoid having to depend on the united states or russia to send astronauts into space .
jan woerner , the head of the german aerospace center , says it would only require a little more effort for europe to close the gap with the us and russia .
" a further development on this level would of course mean that we clearly position ourselves as a partner for future space travel missions , " he says .
" in this respect , i think it 's very important that we can tackle this step now . "

former german astronaut ernst messerschmid says there are still many unanswered questions about the moon , even after the apollo missions .
" apollo was almost too fast and too successful and kept all other initiatives to go back to the moon at bay , " he says .
" basically the next logical step after the space station is , of course , a trip back to the moon , " he says .

the 37-year-old armstrong , who finished ninth , 1 minute 35 seconds behind his 11-year-junior astana teammate , said the result meant he had little chance of winning an eighth tour title .
" -lrb- contador -rrb- showed he 's the best rider in the race , " armstrong told france 2 television after the stage , and said he would now work to help his teammate win the tour .
armstrong now lies second in the overall standings , 1 minute 37 seconds behind contador , with the surprising briton bradley wiggins in third , 1 minute 46 seconds adrift .
german andreas kloeden , also of astana , is fourth at 2 minutes 17 seconds .
" i 'm happy to be second , " armstrong said .
" i definitely suffered .
i was already a little at my limit at the bottom -lrb- of the climb -rrb- .
i was hurting . "
contador 's time for the 207.5km course from the french city of pontarlier was 5 hours 3 minutes 58 seconds , an impressive average speed of 40.96 kph for a course that featured six climbs .
luxembourg 's andy schleck finished second , 43 seconds behind the winner , while italian vincenzo nibali came in third , 1 minute 3 seconds behind .
" i 'm very happy , " contador said .
" it was a hard climb .
my legs hurt , they hurt a lot . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de france -pipe- 19.07.2009 locals discover the joys of paris in the summer as the recession bites großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more parisians are holidaying at home france is the world 's biggest tourist destination with some 72 million people visiting the country last year .
many choose to come to paris in the summer when most parisians are not there ! this year , thanks to the recession , more parisians are going to be staying at home … and finding out what they 've been missing .
our correspondent john laurenson sent us this postcard from paris in the summertime .
i 'm writing this inside a left bank café called the rouquet , a place that has n't changed since the 1950s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john laurenson sent his " postcard from europe " from paris motorists honk unhappily along the boulevard saint germain , but the plane trees form a green roof over the street , filtering the sun and giving the place a relaxing air .
a sparrow hops in , grabs an abandoned chip off the floor and flies towards the door , lop-sided because of the weight of the thing .
the patronne sidles up and tells me she 's been here for 55 years .
she remembers jean-paul sartre and simone de beauvoir coming here every morning .
they 'd hide away in the little room at the back .
get a bit of peace and quiet before exposing themselves to the rubber-necking crowds at the swankier cafés – the flore and the deux magots down the road .
paris in summer ?
i and -lrb- presumably -rrb- the few million others who visit at this time of year think it 's a great idea .
but for real parisians , it 's very different .
it is , in fact , one of those signs of failure .
like being seen on a bus over the age of 30 .
it means you have n't got any friends - either to go on holiday with or to invite you to their lovely beach-side summer home at arcachon .
or else you just ca n't afford it .
there are rather more french people in this category all of a sudden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in summer , paris even has a beach at the seine river in march , when french pessimism was just at its natural level for early spring , 74 percent reckoned they 'd be going on holiday .
by may , that number had dropped to 56 percent , while in other european countries it had stayed stable at around 64 percent .
which means there will be very many more parisians , or at least parisian ‘ losers ' as they call them here , for the tourists to see .
and a few more places are staying open .
in the old days , paris closed down in august .
with an admirable disregard for financial gain , restaurants and cafés would shut for the height of the tourist season .
many still do .
the rouquet , for example , will be closed for the whole month .
but it 's worth coming .
definitely .
to walk around the parks , peering at the games of chess and boules … to admire the buildings which look bright in summer , grey the rest of the year .
and if you meet a parisian , be friendly and offer to buy him a drink perhaps .
he probably needs it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de france -pipe- 19.07.2009 locals discover the joys of paris in the summer as the recession bites großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more parisians are holidaying at home france is the world 's biggest tourist destination with some 72 million people visiting the country last year .
many choose to come to paris in the summer when most parisians are not there ! this year , thanks to the recession , more parisians are going to be staying at home … and finding out what they 've been missing .
our correspondent john laurenson sent us this postcard from paris in the summertime .
i 'm writing this inside a left bank café called the rouquet , a place that has n't changed since the 1950s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john laurenson sent his " postcard from europe " from paris motorists honk unhappily along the boulevard saint germain , but the plane trees form a green roof over the street , filtering the sun and giving the place a relaxing air .
a sparrow hops in , grabs an abandoned chip off the floor and flies towards the door , lop-sided because of the weight of the thing .
the patronne sidles up and tells me she 's been here for 55 years .
she remembers jean-paul sartre and simone de beauvoir coming here every morning .
they 'd hide away in the little room at the back .
get a bit of peace and quiet before exposing themselves to the rubber-necking crowds at the swankier cafés – the flore and the deux magots down the road .
paris in summer ?
i and -lrb- presumably -rrb- the few million others who visit at this time of year think it 's a great idea .
but for real parisians , it 's very different .
it is , in fact , one of those signs of failure .
like being seen on a bus over the age of 30 .
it means you have n't got any friends - either to go on holiday with or to invite you to their lovely beach-side summer home at arcachon .
or else you just ca n't afford it .
there are rather more french people in this category all of a sudden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in summer , paris even has a beach at the seine river in march , when french pessimism was just at its natural level for early spring , 74 percent reckoned they 'd be going on holiday .
by may , that number had dropped to 56 percent , while in other european countries it had stayed stable at around 64 percent .
which means there will be very many more parisians , or at least parisian ‘ losers ' as they call them here , for the tourists to see .
and a few more places are staying open .
in the old days , paris closed down in august .
with an admirable disregard for financial gain , restaurants and cafés would shut for the height of the tourist season .
many still do .
the rouquet , for example , will be closed for the whole month .
but it 's worth coming .
definitely .
to walk around the parks , peering at the games of chess and boules … to admire the buildings which look bright in summer , grey the rest of the year .
and if you meet a parisian , be friendly and offer to buy him a drink perhaps .
he probably needs it .

anyone caught puffing away in a non-smoking area faces an on-the-spot 45-euro fine , while cafe owners face penalties of up to 2,500 euros .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , an avid anti-smoker , has instructed the country 's governors to rigorously enforce the ban .
he has even called for officials who fail to do so to be punished .
the new law is being seen as the final nail in the coffin for one of the country 's most ancient traditions .
turkey has one of the highest rates of smoking in the world , and the legislation is expected to cause troubles for cafes , bars and restaurants in cities like istanbul , where the hospitality industry is bracing for a hit to profits .
cafe owner suleymain aktas told deutsche welle his business was already suffering due to the economic crisis , and that the smoking ban would add salt to the wound .
" sure , this ban will affect us both work-wise and in our lifestyle .
we wo n't be able to live the way we did before .
as for our cafe , we will have to find new ways to take some economic measures like sacking workers , " he said .
history up in smoke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan is a staunch anti-smoking advocate turkish cafes are well known for the clouds of flavored smoke wafting through the air from water pipes , or nargile in turkish .
it is a tradition that goes back centuries , but as of sunday this could become a thing of the past .
though despite criticism of the new legislation by industry groups and smokers , there are many turks who see this as a chance to turn a new , healthier corner .
according to opinion polls an overwhelming majority of turks are in favor of tougher anti-smoking laws .
" i think it is good for me because i do n't smoke , because when i sit here and drink i do n't like this smoke .
so it is going to be a good thing , " said volcan , a regular at the keyif cafe in istanbul .
but another cafe patron , oguz , said as he savored what he admits could be one of his last nargile at keyif that he was angered by the smoking ban .
" i like smoking the nargile .
i like the feeling of friendship that goes with it , " he said .
" perhaps nargile is more harmful but it has an ambience and you smoke while chatting .
i do n't find it logical that they ban smoking in nargile cafes , because people come here by choice . "
widespread support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the days of smoky turkish cafes are numbered in nearby taksim square , in the heart of istanbul , there is support to be found for the ban and little sympathy for nargile smokers .
" nargile , it might be part of the tradition , but it has become hyped in the last five or six years ; as though there was no nargile culture before it was created , " said one local .
" it has attracted many , many people to smoke even more .
so i am perfectly happy that nargile cafes will close . "
another passerby said : " i think it is good .
in many places people smoke too many cigarettes to our bad health .
i have waited a long time for this law . "
for centuries , turkey - which is also a major tobacco producer - has prided itself on its smoking traditions .
but here tradition can pass with remarkable speed .
earlier restrictions on smoking on coaches and in shopping malls met with little resistance , and even though there have been a few small protests against the new restrictions , mainly by cafe owners , the government remains determined to enforce them .
it seems the days of smoky turkish cafes are numbered .

anyone caught puffing away in a non-smoking area faces an on-the-spot 45-euro fine , while cafe owners face penalties of up to 2,500 euros .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , an avid anti-smoker , has instructed the country 's governors to rigorously enforce the ban .
he has even called for officials who fail to do so to be punished .
the new law is being seen as the final nail in the coffin for one of the country 's most ancient traditions .
turkey has one of the highest rates of smoking in the world , and the legislation is expected to cause troubles for cafes , bars and restaurants in cities like istanbul , where the hospitality industry is bracing for a hit to profits .
cafe owner suleymain aktas told deutsche welle his business was already suffering due to the economic crisis , and that the smoking ban would add salt to the wound .
" sure , this ban will affect us both work-wise and in our lifestyle .
we wo n't be able to live the way we did before .
as for our cafe , we will have to find new ways to take some economic measures like sacking workers , " he said .
history up in smoke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan is a staunch anti-smoking advocate turkish cafes are well known for the clouds of flavored smoke wafting through the air from water pipes , or nargile in turkish .
it is a tradition that goes back centuries , but as of sunday this could become a thing of the past .
though despite criticism of the new legislation by industry groups and smokers , there are many turks who see this as a chance to turn a new , healthier corner .
according to opinion polls an overwhelming majority of turks are in favor of tougher anti-smoking laws .
" i think it is good for me because i do n't smoke , because when i sit here and drink i do n't like this smoke .
so it is going to be a good thing , " said volcan , a regular at the keyif cafe in istanbul .
but another cafe patron , oguz , said as he savored what he admits could be one of his last nargile at keyif that he was angered by the smoking ban .
" i like smoking the nargile .
i like the feeling of friendship that goes with it , " he said .
" perhaps nargile is more harmful but it has an ambience and you smoke while chatting .
i do n't find it logical that they ban smoking in nargile cafes , because people come here by choice . "
widespread support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the days of smoky turkish cafes are numbered in nearby taksim square , in the heart of istanbul , there is support to be found for the ban and little sympathy for nargile smokers .
" nargile , it might be part of the tradition , but it has become hyped in the last five or six years ; as though there was no nargile culture before it was created , " said one local .
" it has attracted many , many people to smoke even more .
so i am perfectly happy that nargile cafes will close . "
another passerby said : " i think it is good .
in many places people smoke too many cigarettes to our bad health .
i have waited a long time for this law . "
for centuries , turkey - which is also a major tobacco producer - has prided itself on its smoking traditions .
but here tradition can pass with remarkable speed .
earlier restrictions on smoking on coaches and in shopping malls met with little resistance , and even though there have been a few small protests against the new restrictions , mainly by cafe owners , the government remains determined to enforce them .
it seems the days of smoky turkish cafes are numbered .

widespread support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the days of smoky turkish cafes are numbered in nearby taksim square , in the heart of istanbul , there is support to be found for the ban and little sympathy for nargile smokers .
" nargile , it might be part of the tradition , but it has become hyped in the last five or six years ; as though there was no nargile culture before it was created , " said one local .
" it has attracted many , many people to smoke even more .
so i am perfectly happy that nargile cafes will close . "
another passerby said : " i think it is good .
in many places people smoke too many cigarettes to our bad health .
i have waited a long time for this law . "
for centuries , turkey - which is also a major tobacco producer - has prided itself on its smoking traditions .
but here tradition can pass with remarkable speed .
earlier restrictions on smoking on coaches and in shopping malls met with little resistance , and even though there have been a few small protests against the new restrictions , mainly by cafe owners , the government remains determined to enforce them .
it seems the days of smoky turkish cafes are numbered .

many choose to come to paris in the summer when most parisians are not there ! this year , thanks to the recession , more parisians are going to be staying at home … and finding out what they 've been missing .
our correspondent john laurenson sent us this postcard from paris in the summertime .
i 'm writing this inside a left bank café called the rouquet , a place that has n't changed since the 1950s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john laurenson sent his " postcard from europe " from paris motorists honk unhappily along the boulevard saint germain , but the plane trees form a green roof over the street , filtering the sun and giving the place a relaxing air .

they 'd hide away in the little room at the back .
get a bit of peace and quiet before exposing themselves to the rubber-necking crowds at the swankier cafés – the flore and the deux magots down the road .
paris in summer ?
i and -lrb- presumably -rrb- the few million others who visit at this time of year think it 's a great idea .
but for real parisians , it 's very different .
it is , in fact , one of those signs of failure .
like being seen on a bus over the age of 30 .
it means you have n't got any friends - either to go on holiday with or to invite you to their lovely beach-side summer home at arcachon .
or else you just ca n't afford it .
there are rather more french people in this category all of a sudden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in summer , paris even has a beach at the seine river in march , when french pessimism was just at its natural level for early spring , 74 percent reckoned they 'd be going on holiday .
by may , that number had dropped to 56 percent , while in other european countries it had stayed stable at around 64 percent .
which means there will be very many more parisians , or at least parisian ‘ losers ' as they call them here , for the tourists to see .
and a few more places are staying open .
in the old days , paris closed down in august .
with an admirable disregard for financial gain , restaurants and cafés would shut for the height of the tourist season .
many still do .
the rouquet , for example , will be closed for the whole month .
but it 's worth coming .
definitely .
to walk around the parks , peering at the games of chess and boules … to admire the buildings which look bright in summer , grey the rest of the year .
and if you meet a parisian , be friendly and offer to buy him a drink perhaps .
he probably needs it .

paris in summer ?
i and -lrb- presumably -rrb- the few million others who visit at this time of year think it 's a great idea .
but for real parisians , it 's very different .
it is , in fact , one of those signs of failure .
like being seen on a bus over the age of 30 .
it means you have n't got any friends - either to go on holiday with or to invite you to their lovely beach-side summer home at arcachon .
or else you just ca n't afford it .
there are rather more french people in this category all of a sudden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in summer , paris even has a beach at the seine river in march , when french pessimism was just at its natural level for early spring , 74 percent reckoned they 'd be going on holiday .
by may , that number had dropped to 56 percent , while in other european countries it had stayed stable at around 64 percent .
which means there will be very many more parisians , or at least parisian ‘ losers ' as they call them here , for the tourists to see .
and a few more places are staying open .
in the old days , paris closed down in august .
with an admirable disregard for financial gain , restaurants and cafés would shut for the height of the tourist season .
many still do .
the rouquet , for example , will be closed for the whole month .
but it 's worth coming .
definitely .
to walk around the parks , peering at the games of chess and boules … to admire the buildings which look bright in summer , grey the rest of the year .
and if you meet a parisian , be friendly and offer to buy him a drink perhaps .
he probably needs it .

right now , all bets are on current chancellor angela merkel keeping her job . as germany gears up for nationwide elections on september 27 , the latest poll released by emnid reveals that 80 percent of german citizens expect conservative chancellor angela merkel of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- to remain in office for a second term .
" we have not measured such a high approval rating for an incumbent chancellor in decades , " the head of emnid , klaus-peter schoeppner told the bild newspaper 's sunday edition .
" especially unheard of is the high expectation of losing among spd supporters . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grand coalition gets the thumbs down in the polls those surveyed give social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate frank-walter steinmeier only a 13 percent chance of beating merkel and becoming chancellor .
and among spd supporters , 53 percent do not want to see the party work with the cdu and the csu coalition .
the poll also demonstrated that 56 percent of germans would like to see an end to the grand coalition , where merkel 's center-right cdu party works together with the social democrats .
the spd has watched its popularity slide in recent years , in part because of merkel 's popularity and its status as a junior coalition member .
with such low poll numbers , frank-walter steinmeier and the other top members of the spd will have to seriously examine their future strategy when they meet in potsdam at the end of july .
csu confident of future as german conservatives gear up for the elections in the fall , chancellor merkel 's sister party , the bavarian csu with horst seehofer at the helm , has pledged to support merkels cdu .
on july 18 , seehofer was re-elected head of the csu with an almost 90 percent majority .
the csu however , is pursuing an election campaign that diverges from merkel 's cdu on key issues .
the central element of the csu campaign is income tax cuts , which it has said it will not back down on .
despite the ongoing crisis and the flurry of negative economic prognoses , the csu maintains that tax cuts are necessary and feasible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer re-elected head of csu the tax cuts , said seehofer , would take effect by 2011 .
merkel 's cdu , meanwhile , has rejected such ambitious plans .
another controversial issue seehofer addressed on saturday was the csu stance on the ratification of the european union 's lisbon treaty .
the csu has called for the german parliament , the bundestag , to have more of a say in european affairs .
seehofer says the csu is not against ratifying the treaty , but rather for strengthening the national parliament on the european level .
" we 're not about destruction ; we do n't want to blockade the treaty .
we want to give germany 's houses of parliament a stronger presence .
we want europe to recognize what it is made of - and we want that our national parliament to have responsibility and be taken seriously . "

as americans on monday mark the 40th anniversary of the first moon landing , europeans are gearing up for their own moon walk . forty years after man first walked on the moon , european astronauts have that great , glowing sphere in the sky back in sight .
with several successes under its belt , europe 's dream of its own expedition to the moon is looking more realistic than ever .
europe 's most ambitious spacecraft to date is the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- , which can deliver up to ten tons of material to the international space station .
but the atv can only carry material into space – and not the other way around , from space to earth .
evert dudok , the president of eads astrium , a subsidiary of the european aeronautic defence and space company , says that transporting material to earth could be made possible .
he says that the current atv , which is relatively cylindrical , would be replaced with a capsule structure , which would then return to earth , just like with the apollo missions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on july 20 , 1969 , neil armstrong became the first man on the moon " the speed would be slowed with parachutes and then it would land in the ocean , " he says .
the biggest technical hurdle facing the europeans is the development of a heat shield to keep the capsule from burning up as it re-enters the atmosphere .
however , there are already draft designs , and there are plans to transport people in the capsules too .
independent european expeditions the transport of people could open the way for europeans to launch their own missions , and avoid having to depend on the united states or russia to send astronauts into space .
jan woerner , the head of the german aerospace center , says it would only require a little more effort for europe to close the gap with the us and russia .
" a further development on this level would of course mean that we clearly position ourselves as a partner for future space travel missions , " he says .
" in this respect , i think it 's very important that we can tackle this step now . "
germans on the moon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst messerschmid -lrb- bottom , left -rrb- was part of the last successful challenger mission germany has put its planned moon mission on hold due to budget constraints , but interest from researchers has certainly not gone away .
former german astronaut ernst messerschmid says there are still many unanswered questions about the moon , even after the apollo missions .
" apollo was almost too fast and too successful and kept all other initiatives to go back to the moon at bay , " he says .
" basically the next logical step after the space station is , of course , a trip back to the moon , " he says .
and when that next trip to the moon takes place , europeans hope they will go along for the ride .

many choose to come to paris in the summer when most parisians are not there ! this year , thanks to the recession , more parisians are going to be staying at home … and finding out what they 've been missing .
our correspondent john laurenson sent us this postcard from paris in the summertime .
i 'm writing this inside a left bank café called the rouquet , a place that has n't changed since the 1950s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john laurenson sent his " postcard from europe " from paris motorists honk unhappily along the boulevard saint germain , but the plane trees form a green roof over the street , filtering the sun and giving the place a relaxing air .
a sparrow hops in , grabs an abandoned chip off the floor and flies towards the door , lop-sided because of the weight of the thing .
the patronne sidles up and tells me she 's been here for 55 years .
she remembers jean-paul sartre and simone de beauvoir coming here every morning .
they 'd hide away in the little room at the back .
get a bit of peace and quiet before exposing themselves to the rubber-necking crowds at the swankier cafés – the flore and the deux magots down the road .
paris in summer ?
i and -lrb- presumably -rrb- the few million others who visit at this time of year think it 's a great idea .
but for real parisians , it 's very different .
it is , in fact , one of those signs of failure .
like being seen on a bus over the age of 30 .
it means you have n't got any friends - either to go on holiday with or to invite you to their lovely beach-side summer home at arcachon .
or else you just ca n't afford it .
there are rather more french people in this category all of a sudden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in summer , paris even has a beach at the seine river in march , when french pessimism was just at its natural level for early spring , 74 percent reckoned they 'd be going on holiday .
by may , that number had dropped to 56 percent , while in other european countries it had stayed stable at around 64 percent .
which means there will be very many more parisians , or at least parisian ‘ losers ' as they call them here , for the tourists to see .
and a few more places are staying open .
in the old days , paris closed down in august .
with an admirable disregard for financial gain , restaurants and cafés would shut for the height of the tourist season .
many still do .
the rouquet , for example , will be closed for the whole month .
but it 's worth coming .
definitely .
to walk around the parks , peering at the games of chess and boules … to admire the buildings which look bright in summer , grey the rest of the year .
and if you meet a parisian , be friendly and offer to buy him a drink perhaps .
he probably needs it .

anyone caught puffing away in a non-smoking area faces an on-the-spot 45-euro fine , while cafe owners face penalties of up to 2,500 euros .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , an avid anti-smoker , has instructed the country 's governors to rigorously enforce the ban .
he has even called for officials who fail to do so to be punished .
the new law is being seen as the final nail in the coffin for one of the country 's most ancient traditions .
turkey has one of the highest rates of smoking in the world , and the legislation is expected to cause troubles for cafes , bars and restaurants in cities like istanbul , where the hospitality industry is bracing for a hit to profits .
cafe owner suleymain aktas told deutsche welle his business was already suffering due to the economic crisis , and that the smoking ban would add salt to the wound .
" sure , this ban will affect us both work-wise and in our lifestyle .
we wo n't be able to live the way we did before .
as for our cafe , we will have to find new ways to take some economic measures like sacking workers , " he said .
history up in smoke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan is a staunch anti-smoking advocate turkish cafes are well known for the clouds of flavored smoke wafting through the air from water pipes , or nargile in turkish .
it is a tradition that goes back centuries , but as of sunday this could become a thing of the past .
though despite criticism of the new legislation by industry groups and smokers , there are many turks who see this as a chance to turn a new , healthier corner .
according to opinion polls an overwhelming majority of turks are in favor of tougher anti-smoking laws .
" i think it is good for me because i do n't smoke , because when i sit here and drink i do n't like this smoke .
so it is going to be a good thing , " said volcan , a regular at the keyif cafe in istanbul .
but another cafe patron , oguz , said as he savored what he admits could be one of his last nargile at keyif that he was angered by the smoking ban .
" i like smoking the nargile .
i like the feeling of friendship that goes with it , " he said .
" perhaps nargile is more harmful but it has an ambience and you smoke while chatting .
i do n't find it logical that they ban smoking in nargile cafes , because people come here by choice . "
widespread support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the days of smoky turkish cafes are numbered in nearby taksim square , in the heart of istanbul , there is support to be found for the ban and little sympathy for nargile smokers .
" nargile , it might be part of the tradition , but it has become hyped in the last five or six years ; as though there was no nargile culture before it was created , " said one local .
" it has attracted many , many people to smoke even more .
so i am perfectly happy that nargile cafes will close . "
another passerby said : " i think it is good .
in many places people smoke too many cigarettes to our bad health .
i have waited a long time for this law . "
for centuries , turkey - which is also a major tobacco producer - has prided itself on its smoking traditions .
but here tradition can pass with remarkable speed .
earlier restrictions on smoking on coaches and in shopping malls met with little resistance , and even though there have been a few small protests against the new restrictions , mainly by cafe owners , the government remains determined to enforce them .
it seems the days of smoky turkish cafes are numbered .

right now , all bets are on current chancellor angela merkel keeping her job . as germany gears up for nationwide elections on september 27 , the latest poll released by emnid reveals that 80 percent of german citizens expect conservative chancellor angela merkel of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- to remain in office for a second term .
" we have not measured such a high approval rating for an incumbent chancellor in decades , " the head of emnid , klaus-peter schoeppner told the bild newspaper 's sunday edition .
" especially unheard of is the high expectation of losing among spd supporters . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grand coalition gets the thumbs down in the polls those surveyed give social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate frank-walter steinmeier only a 13 percent chance of beating merkel and becoming chancellor .
and among spd supporters , 53 percent do not want to see the party work with the cdu and the csu coalition .
the poll also demonstrated that 56 percent of germans would like to see an end to the grand coalition , where merkel 's center-right cdu party works together with the social democrats .
the spd has watched its popularity slide in recent years , in part because of merkel 's popularity and its status as a junior coalition member .
with such low poll numbers , frank-walter steinmeier and the other top members of the spd will have to seriously examine their future strategy when they meet in potsdam at the end of july .
csu confident of future as german conservatives gear up for the elections in the fall , chancellor merkel 's sister party , the bavarian csu with horst seehofer at the helm , has pledged to support merkels cdu .
on july 18 , seehofer was re-elected head of the csu with an almost 90 percent majority .
the csu however , is pursuing an election campaign that diverges from merkel 's cdu on key issues .
the central element of the csu campaign is income tax cuts , which it has said it will not back down on .
despite the ongoing crisis and the flurry of negative economic prognoses , the csu maintains that tax cuts are necessary and feasible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer re-elected head of csu the tax cuts , said seehofer , would take effect by 2011 .
merkel 's cdu , meanwhile , has rejected such ambitious plans .
another controversial issue seehofer addressed on saturday was the csu stance on the ratification of the european union 's lisbon treaty .
the csu has called for the german parliament , the bundestag , to have more of a say in european affairs .
seehofer says the csu is not against ratifying the treaty , but rather for strengthening the national parliament on the european level .
" we 're not about destruction ; we do n't want to blockade the treaty .
we want to give germany 's houses of parliament a stronger presence .
we want europe to recognize what it is made of - and we want that our national parliament to have responsibility and be taken seriously . "

home secretary : " precautions need to be taken " but the public must n't pay attention to headlines .
andrew marr : " not a poisoned chalice , but a perfectly formed goblet " .
that 's how alan johnson describes his new job as home secretary .
alan johnson and the goblet of fire .
after all , violent crime , anti-social behaviour , the immigration system , the terrorist threat - just a few of the issues bubbling for him each morning .
he 's with me now .
let 's start by looking at the problem of knife crime , in particular , which is something you 've been focusing on .
38,000 serious offences involving knives in the last year for which figures were taken up quite a lot .
this is becoming a really serious problem , is n't it ?
alan johnson : it is a serious problem and my predecessor jacqui smith , together with the prime minister , launched the tackling knives action programme just about a year ago , focusing on the issues where there was the major problem - cities like london , manchester , merseyside - and there 's been encouraging results .
i mean i 've said that statistics on crime is the area where they matter the least and where personal experience matters the most , but those statistics in terms of the provisional figures for the number of people coming into hospital , having been wounded by a sharp object , are down 32 % in those tackling knives action programme areas , those ten areas .
it 's now increased to sixteen , but in the ten original areas the police are stopping more people - 250,000 stop and searches - and finding fewer weapons , and there 's about 5,500 knives have been taken off the streets .
but you know that andrew marr : it 's a real alan johnson : it 's a , it 's a longer problem than just one year , which is why the programme goes on for several years .
but everyone together the police are doing a marvellous job , but also the local agencies and schools and charities in local community groups are really getting to grips with the issue .
andrew marr : can i ask about a longer perspective issue ?
when new labour first came in , there was plenty of money and there appears to have been plenty of will to tackle anti-social behaviour in the wider to make the streets calmer , quieter , less threatening , asbos were brought in , and it has n't really worked .
i mean more than half , 60 % i think , of young , younger people with asbos break the asbos .
there 's a lot of laughter about them , a lot of ignoring of them , and our streets do n't seem to have been cleared and made safer as a result of , as i say , ten years of money and ten years of no doubt serious politicians .
why do you think that is ?
alan johnson : andrew , first of all that 's wrong .
the introduction of anti-social behaviour orders , parenting orders , acceptable behaviour contracts - all of this andrew marr : all of that stuff .
alan johnson : the agencies working together to tackle a problem that was previously ignored - has had an effect .
public confidence in the fact that that 's being tackled has improved .
and my point is not that this has n't worked and we should n't have done that .
my point is that it needs constant leadership and we have to ensure andrew marr : -lrb- over -rrb- well i mean you say that , but i would have thought people like the probation service , people one talks to on the streets , newspaper reporting , a lot of the statistics about crime , social services , would all contest that .
they would say out there it is not greatly improved after , as i say , a lot of money and a lot of political will .
alan johnson : i do n't think they would .
i 'm not suggesting that the problem 's gone away - there are still issues there , of course there are .
that 's why i believe we should give it a higher profile .
not by introducing new measures and new laws .
i think we 've got all the laws in place that we need .
there are some aspects that might need to change , but they 're around the edges .
i mean you quote this point about people keep breaking them .
statistics show very clearly andrew marr : -lrb- over -rrb- 50 50 % of people break asbos ; and under the age of 18 , it 's 62 % or thereabouts .
alan johnson : well , yeah , you have to look at this in the context of anti-social behaviour that was happening day after day after day .
for 66 % when they 've broken it the once , when there 's been one breach of that asbo , they do n't breach again .
and so the statistics are that around 93 % , if they 've breached it a couple of times , they wo n't breach it again .
andrew marr : -lrb- over / inaudible -rrb- alan johnson : you haul them back eventually .
and this is in the context of people 's lives being made a misery .
now i know from my constituency , other mps know from their constituency , that when this kind of thing was happening in 1997 the mp in general had to get the police together with the local community .
they had to do the facilitating .
there was no machinery there .
and when you did it , the police would say , " look , we have n't even got the legal basis to take a truant back to school " .
true , until the anti-social behaviour and disorder act came in .
so things have been transformed .
are they perfect out there andrew marr : -lrb- over -rrb- certainly not .
alan johnson : are there things that still need tackling ?
absolutely .
and i am absolutely clear - and so is the prime minister - this is one of those things that ruins the quality of life of people .
it 's not what we would call high level crime , but to those people it matters more than you know organised crime and bank robberies , etcetera , and we have to tackle it as effectively as we do those more serious crimes .
andrew marr : figures in the newspapers this week talking about the population rising to over 70 million and immigration being a very , very large part of that .
does there come a point - and you 're in charge of immigration policy - does there come a point where you say well actually we have enough people in this country , we do n't want further large-scale immigration or indeed we do n't want further immigration and we have to put a cap on it ?
alan johnson : i do n't think a cap is the answer because the problem with a cap is it 's an arbitrary figure , and what you need to do is to ensure that you make the case - and there is a very strong case - for the importance to our economy of migration .
now the point is this : we have introduced a system where rather than an open door policy , it 's a closed door policy for the unskilled .
the door is closed under our points based system for the unskilled .
the door can only be opened from the inside for those who are skilled - i.e. we determine that we need those jobs and we advertise them first in job centre plus to see if there 's any local people who can take those jobs before we allow them through .
and just to torture this analogy one more step - for students and people coming in on short-term permits , the door has you know got all kinds of alarms and security alarms , which is why we 've closed over 250 bogus colleges .
so the australian points based system that we introduced last year is a really effective way of tackling these issues at the same time as ensuring that we keep a strong economy in this country .
andrew marr : you grew up on a sort of white working class estate .
now on estates around the country , as you know , quite a lot of people have been turning to parties like the bnp on this because they perceive that people from outside are getting a better deal and are taking british jobs for british workers , to use a well-known phrase .
now is that all got up by the bnp or do they have a point ?
alan johnson : i did n't grow up on a council estate .
my mum did n't even qualify to get a council house .
i grew up in the slums of notting hill .
on the corner was oswald mosley - the corner of my street , southam street in notting hill when i was a kid .
it started off the notting hill race riots when i was a 9 year old .
mosley would stand there with the same argument of hate and division and intolerance as we hear from the bnp now .
it 's not new .
it comes around in waves .
he stood as a parliamentary candidate in north kensington .
andrew marr : did n't get very far .
alan johnson : i bought my kids up on a council estate - a very good council estate , the brickwell estate in slough - as a postman , and i know very well how the argument at times when jobs are harder to find , this argument that the racists use can be so destructive .
i have absolute faith in the british people who not just fought a war against fascism , but have seen this come in waves - mosley , national front , now bnp .
andrew marr : okay .
alan johnson : i have absolute faith in their ability to look at these issues , to ens of course politicians have to speak to people in the language they can understand about the problems they are facing andrew marr : okay .
alan johnson : and successive mainstream politicians of all political parties have done that in this country , which is why we do n't have the same problem with a right wing established group as they do in countries like france and italy .
andrew marr : let me ask you about another problem raised in the papers today , which is that there are a group of 20 or so quite hardline islamists who were sent to prison because of what they were doing , and they 're now coming back out again and there are n't really proper controls on what they do once they 're back out .
there 's clearly quite serious alarm about this .
alan johnson : there are proper controls .
the simple fact is anyone who 's been sentenced to longer than 12 months is released on the ba when their sentence is complete .
andrew marr : they 're staying in bail hostels , some of these guys .
alan johnson : but that 's a good place for them because the place where they 're staying , they stay under very strict conditions with very well trained staff .
if they 're foreign nationals , we 'll send them back .
sometimes we ca n't because if we 're sending them back to a country where there could be a death penalty , for instance , but we keep them under ...
andrew marr : -lrb- over -rrb- so they are securely supervised and watched ?
alan johnson : very securely supervised , very closely monitored .
andrew marr : okay .
alan johnson : this is not the same as control orders .
control orders are people who we ca n't charge .
they have n't been through the system .
this is when people have been through the system , been convicted , served their sentence , and are then very strictly and tightly controlled .
andrew marr : right let 's move on , if we may , to yet another of the big issues , which is swine flu .
now you were health secretary .
you were across all of this stuff .
what 's going on inside government as you look at the potential for a very serious epidemic and further waves ?
alan johnson : well i have to say , andrew , what 's going on is what i told you on this programme in the very early days of this when there were some commentators saying that government was overreacting .
we 've been preparing for this for a long time .
it came actually above terrorism as a threat to this country , and so we have the whole cobra machinery , the inter-agency working ; we 'd gone through simulation exercises like winter willow where everyone was involved .
and what we 're seeing is that that is absolutely the right approach .
no country was better prepared than this country .
andrew marr : so when people pick up their papers today and they read that women who want babies should perhaps put that off , that young women with young children are under great threat and all the rest of it , how worried should they be ?
is this alarmism or is this realistic ?
alan johnson : i think it 's an overreaction to say that women should n't have babies during this period .
and so does steve field , who 's the general secretary of the royal college of general practitioners .
i think that 's an overreaction .
you know these debates will go on and what we 've been doing and what liam donaldson andrew marr : -lrb- over -rrb- can i just push you a little bit on that ?
what about , what about young children and mothers with young children ?
should they be taking extra precautions about where they go , whether they go on hol ?
alan johnson : they should be taking precautions that we 've said right from the start .
the thing about this virus , h1n1 , it has n't read our you know we produced a fabulous strategy , but the h1n1 virus has n't read it , so it will obviously be doing things that were unexpected .
what we 're finding - and we 've found this out some time ago - is it 's attacking the young rather than the elderly , which traditional seasonal flu would attack .
but in general , the vast majority of cases , it 's a mild illness .
we 've got stacks of antivirals to cover not just 50 % of the population but above that .
we 've got a vaccine on the way .
the very important public health messages - catch it , bin it , kill it , you know wash your hands , use a handkerchief , etcetera - are the simple messages that are as applicable now as they were at the beginning of this .
and you know parents have commonsense .
and you know where we disagreed was this idea of swine flu parties - i mean that was not a sensible move - but the vast majority of parents are doing what they should be doing and abiding by public sector ad public health advice .
andrew marr : we 've been talking a lot about afghanistan in this programme .
as a member of the cabinet , are you confident that when the military comes to this government and says we need more helicopters , we need more this , we need more that , they will get what they need ?
alan johnson : yes , i do .
and i thought that matthew parris was absolutely wrong and patrick hennessy was absolutely right .
look , this is the defining conflict of our age - recognised as such by barack obama .
andrew marr : but we still need to know how to get out again , do n't we ?
alan johnson : well , no but the point is this .
i mean what worries me is this counsel of despair that you heard from matthew parris .
this is a nato-led operation - 40 countries involved in what was a safe haven for militant international terrorists to carry out their plots around the world .
it is also , of course , very close to pakistan - a secular democracy with a nuclear capability .
if we just pull out and leave that situation as it is when we know 93 % of the afghan public have said they do n't want the taliban back , when we 've got democratic elections virtually for the first time controlled by the afghan afghanistan people themselves , first time in 30 years , i think you know our andrew marr : okay .
alan johnson : the bravery of our soldiers , which is an inspiration every day , in a democracy you 'll get the views of matthew parris but let 's hear the other view much more strongly .
they 're doing a very , very important job .
andrew marr : we heard both today .
very , very quickly , another 19 point tory lead at the moment .
game over pretty much in realistic terms ?
alan johnson : not at all .
look where the tories are , whether it 's the late 30s - one of the polls said 37 , early 40s - 8 months before a general election everything 's to play for .
it is game on .
andrew marr : alright , alright .
alan johnson , for now thank you very much .
