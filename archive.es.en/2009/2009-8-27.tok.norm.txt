according to the latest figures , germany ’ s exports were up by seven percent in june from may , the biggest rise in three years .

china is by far the biggest customer for german products in asia-pacific .
it buys 40 percent of germany ’ s exports to the region .

" at present china still accounts for a relatively small share of german foreign trade with little more than 3 percent of our exports , " says nagel .
" but it ’ s a key market of the future with enormous , two-digit growth rates – which will continue for many more years , we are absolutely convinced .

no longer export champion ?
germany might also lose the title of the world ’ s largest exporter , which it has held since 2003 , to china this year .
according to the latest wto figures , china ’ s exports exceeded germany ’ s in the first half of 2009 .
economist klodt says germany should not be too concerned about this largely symbolic change .
" china is growing rapidly , and germany rather moderately .
so there is no question that at some point china will become more important than germany on world markets , " he argues .
" but this is not a race with a trophy for the winner , leaving the runner-up empty-handed .
it simply is a shift of power towards asia , from the old industrialized countries to the new emerging markets . "
whoever ends up as global export champion at the end of the year , german industry will still be very grateful to china .

the meal was held in chancellor angela merkel 's office . the conservative chancellor 's political opponents have pounced on the news , which comes just one month ahead of national elections .
social democratic budget expert , johannes kahrs , strongly criticized angela merkel , accusing the german chancellor of being " insensitive towards taxpayers " and of engaging in politics similar to those " in a banana republic . "
in tuesday ’ s edition of the daily newspaper passauer neue presse , kahrs said merkel had turned the chancellory into an " event agency . "
he wondered publicly if anyone else had a birthday party paid out of state coffers .
ackermann ’ s " wonderful evening " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank chief , right , has friends in high places in april 2008 , deutsche bank chief josef ackermann invited about 30 guests from home and abroad to the german chancellor ’ s office where he hosted a belated dinner to celebrate his 60th birthday in february .
in a report by the german ard public television on monday , ackermann said merkel had wanted to do him a favor and had asked him to invite some of his friends over to a party at the chancellery .
" i have to say it was a wonderful evening , " the deutsche bank chief said in the report .
but it turns out the event was paid entirely out of the chancellor ’ s budget .
although the full costs of the party have not been disclosed , external catering staff alone is said to have cost about 2,100 euros .
dining and w -lrb- h -rrb- ining on wednesday this week , ackermann ’ s birthday bash will be on the agenda of the german parliament ’ s budget committee .
lawmakers will seek to establish whether the event was of a strictly private nature or part of chancellor merkel ’ s official duties .
the government press office had refused to disclose both details of the event and the names of people who had taken part in it .
" the expenses have been covered by the chancellor ’ s office and out of a budget earmarked for such representative purposes , " the statement says .
little meat to the bone ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scandals have become important weapons in german politics the managing director of the german taxpayers ‘ association , reiner holznagel , believes that allegations of any misappropriation of public funds " are on shaky ground . "
the chancellor ’ s office , he said in a statement on monday , reassured him that there were no private people invited to the party , but solely the official heads of german associations from business and commerce .
" there are dinners taking place at the chancellery every week , " he said " and they are almost always of an official nature . "
martin morlok , a political scientist from dusseldorf , described the incident as yet further evidence of an overly-cozy relationship between german politics and business .
" that ’ s unacceptable , regardless of the question who did actually pay for what , " he told the ap news agency on tuesday .
scandals galore as political race heats up about a month before general elections in germany , scandals about privileges and perks allegedly enjoyed by german politicians abound .
just last week german health minister ulla schmidt -lrb- spd -rrb- had to eat humble pie over using her ministerial car during private holidays in spain .
she brought her chauffer-driven limousine on a 4,000-kilometer round trip , arguing she had needed it for official business at her holiday destination .
and the german economics minister karl theodore zu guttenberg came under fire this month for ordering an external law firm to design an important law .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.08.2009 extremist npd creates right-wing comic books for young people großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd is currently running an aggressive election campaign in saxony the far-right national democratic party has published a political comic book , with allegorical animal characters , aimed at bringing its anti-democratic , anti-immigrant message to a younger audience . " ducks versus chickens " is the title of a new comic book published by the npd , designed to convert disaffected young people to its racist right-wing cause .
the comic , whose first edition runs 30,000 copies , is to be distributed free of charge , and represents " the first in a series of political comics , " an npd statement said .
structured as an allegorical fable with a strong , overarching moral , the story , told in rhyming couplets , revolves around a peaceful community of ducks who live in a colorful , bucolic paradise , " in a free land , far from our times . "
the ducks live there happily , sharing their food in a primitive socialist community .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd is using increasingly revolutionary rhetoric to gain supporters the comic then shows how this harmonious duck-land is invaded by an influx of chicken guests , who complain that an " evil fox " has driven them there .
with their higher fertility rate , the chickens quickly multiply and dominate duck-land .
the chickens also tempt the good , happy ducks into materialism , drug abuse , criminality and homosexuality , causing a general decay in duck society .
borrowing from nazi propaganda in the far-right comic book , the chickens are seen taking over neighboring lands from the native geese and swans and enslaving the inhabitants of these other poultry-based countries , who occasionally die as martyrs if they resist .
the final message is then unequivocally aggressive , exhorting its readers to fight the immigrants , shut borders to newcomers , and " do n't follow foreign birds . "
with its provocative , anti-immigrant message and eye-catching , populist aesthetic , the comic 's style owes much to the nazi propaganda of the late 1920s and early 1930s , which often used animal metaphors to portray foreigners as the root of social ills .
nazi mythology also frequently imagined a pre-capitalist idyll of pure , simple communities .
the book also borrows from the lilting , rhyming style of german children 's storiese , clearly aiming to seduce young readers .
npd strongest in saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd leader udo voigt managed to lead his party into the saxon parliament in 2004 the npd is currently fighting election campaigns in a number of german states .
its best chance of gaining entry to a state parliament is in saxony , where a state election will be held on aug .
30 .
after winning 9.2 percent of the saxon vote in 2004 , the right-wing party has dramatically lost voters , according to a recent poll , and currently stands only slightly above the vital five percent threshold .

the move comes as pressure from brussels increases on germany to approve the bill before the german election on september 27 .
eu officials fear that if germany fails to ratify the lisbon treaty by then , it could bolster opponents of the treaty in the three other nations that have yet to endorse it : ireland , the czech republic and poland .
ministers will debate whether the new proposals – which would give the bundestag access to all relevant eu documents and the option to meet on any subject the government is discussing at eu level – not only satisfies the conditions demanded by the federal constitutional court before allowing ratification , but also satisfies the main political parties .
germany 's top court had ruled in june that the lisbon treaty - aimed at streamlining decision-making in the 27-nation eu - must be put on ice until legislation guarding national parliamentary powers was passed .
the draft law will now fulfill the constitutional court 's requirements .
the new legislation is a watered-down version of a law which the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , demanded .
the csu had insisted that the law include a number of controversial points , including requiring the government to consult the german parliament in eu negotiations , granting the constitutional court the last word on interpreting the lisbon treaty and requiring referendums before the bloc can accept new members .
while wednesday 's reading is a step towards possible ratification of the lisbon treaty , worried eurocrats hope that the germans will finalize the deal before the country goes to the polls , since the deal is not yet final .
the draft law will again go before the bundestag - the country 's lower house of parliament - on september 8 and then the bundesrat upper house on september 18 , nine days before the german general election .
left party opposition could delay vital legislation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party chairman oskar lafontaine opposes the treaty a potential stumbling-block could come from the left party , vehement opponents of the treaty who are attempting to take the issue back to the federal court for another hearing .
the left party 's parliamentary group claims that the new law is unconstitutional and that it does not allow the people to have a say in germany 's involvement in european policies and laws , which it says will ultimately affect them in the same way as if they were domestic laws .
it also argues that the new law does n't give the parliament enough power in dealing with eu foreign and security issues .
as a result , the left party believes the law should go before the high court once more .
all 27 members of the european union have to ratify the treaty for it to take effect and a long delay would be an embarrassment to chancellor merkel , who spearheaded efforts to reach a deal on the treaty in 2007 .
lisbon seen as necessary in eu 's reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all 27 eu states must ratify the treaty for it to become law the lisbon treaty is designed to facilitate decision-making in an eu which has expanded to encompass several former communist countries in eastern europe as well as malta and cyprus .
the bloc has almost doubled in size since the current nice treaty came into force .
if the lisbon treaty replaces it , the eu would do away with the current unwieldy system of the rotating presidency in favor of the selection of a leader for a limited term .
a single powerful foreign policy representative would also be appointed .
the treaty itself is a watered-down version of the european constitution that was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands in 2005. nda / afp / reuters / ap editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this means that when readers open a freshly altered entry they will be given the choice of looking at the old and the new version , but will be made aware that the latter is awaiting review by an official editor . shutting out vandals wikipedia spokesman jay walsh told the afp news agency that the time delay between flagging and editor viewing could itself act as a deterrent to vandals seeking to malign and defame high-profile public figures . bildunterschrift : graffiti is as much an online as a real world problem " basic factors suggest that most people who have ill intent are looking for rapid satisfaction , " walsh said .

this means that when readers open a freshly altered entry they will be given the choice of looking at the old and the new version , but will be made aware that the latter is awaiting review by an official editor . shutting out vandals wikipedia spokesman jay walsh told the afp news agency that the time delay between flagging and editor viewing could itself act as a deterrent to vandals seeking to malign and defame high-profile public figures . bildunterschrift : graffiti is as much an online as a real world problem " basic factors suggest that most people who have ill intent are looking for rapid satisfaction , " walsh said .
" they come in and they want to be jerks ; just like vandalism or graffiti in the real world .
the new feature removes that immediacy . " walsh said volunteers are currently putting the software through its paces before it becomes an official part of the english-language wikipedia profile . yet for all its newness to articles in english , the german language site has been test-driving the software for the past year . raimond spekking , software developer for the online encyclopaedia said wikipedia deutschland introduced the feature to satisfy the demands of the german-language readership . " we did n't want visitors to the site to be reading vandalized articles , " spekking told deutsche welle .
" we wanted to show them they were protected . " keeping it clean bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german language editors have their work cut out for them and the german-speaking wiki community responded to the outcome well .
" we ran a survey after the introduction and more than two thirds of people said they wanted us to continue with it . " so continue they have .
there are currently almost 7,500 editors working on the reviewing process , and although it is voluntary work , becoming a member of the team requires a certain amount of commitment . " users who make at least 300 edits in 60 days automatically qualify to become editors , " spekking explained .
" or if they can not manage that , they can make an application and do just 200 edits in 60 days . " and unlike the proposed changes to articles in english , the german site does not restrict the business of flagging and reviewing to entries about living people , but applies it across the board . the idea there is not only to minimize the risk of potential damage to big names but to lessen the likelihood that obscenities or falsehoods of any description make their way to the public under the wikipedia name . but opponents to the planned new editing feature say that very name has another responsibility , and that is to remain true to its democratic roots . wikipedia still open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barack obama 's wikipedia article is currently " locked " spekking said such criticism was rife among german-speaking users around the time wikipedia deutschland launched its revision software , but he says there really is nothing to get worked up about . " articles can still be edited by anybody , " he said , adding that the practice actually means it is possible to ' unlock ' pages which have been closed to edits from the public on the grounds that they are at particularly high risk of vandalism . and from this point of view , proponents argue , the proposed changes actually open the site further .
" people have a perception that wikipedia is straight forward , it 's open and belongs to everyone , " said jay walsh .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 27.08.2009 nazi " war traitors " set to win general rehabilitation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some nazi " traitors , " like claus von stauffenberg , are now national heroes germans convicted of being traitors to the nazi regime are the only group of war victims that hasn ’ t won full rehabilitation .
now , a draft law on a general rehabilitation is set to receive the support of mps . an estimated 100,000 people were convicted as ” war traitors ” by the nazis .
some 30,000 of them were sentenced to death , and the death penalties were actually carried out in about 20,000 cases .
laws on war traitors originated in 1872 following the franco-german war and were adapted by the nazis in 1934 .
starting then , germans could be convicted of treason for making negative comments about hitler , treating pows too well , helping jews to flee , or possessing a leaflet calling for an end to the nazi dictatorship .
today , although most of the dictatorship 's victims have been fully rehabilitated , the question of how to deal with war traitors has remained a largely unresolved issue .
in 2006 , when germany 's left party began calling for a general rehabilitation of people branded as war traitors by the nazis , conservatives like norbert geis from bavaria 's christian social union were up in arms . ” back then , we did n't support endeavors to rehabilitate war traitors , " geis said .
" we were certain that evidence could be found , proving that at least some of those traitors deliberately jeopardized the lives of their comrades with their actions , and we did n't want to signal approval for such behavior . ”
concerns over actions of deserters military historian ralf-dieter mueller says that , in some cases , rehabilitation of a war traitor would be tricky .
a german soldier who defected and then told the enemy about troop locations , for example , would have deliberately endangered the lives of other soldiers .
" there 's a certain degree of underhandedness involved which would be extremely hard to justify and endorse , ” mueller said .
in the meantime , though , germany 's conservatives have given up their resistance to the idea of general rehabilitation , after extensive archival research failed to unearth evidence suggesting that deserters had ever acted in such a way .
opposition greens mp wolfgang wieland goes one step further , arguing that it 's impossible to separate " good traitors " from the bad ones by considering whether they put other people 's lives at risk .
" colonel claus von stauffenberg killed other officers with his bomb that was meant to kill hitler in his 1944 assassination plot , " wieland said .
" he knew that ' collateral damage ' would be inevitable .
nonetheless , what he did was right . "
from traitor to national hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig baumann while stauffenberg is now hailed as a national hero , many other surviving " war traitors " are still waiting to have their honor and dignity restored .
among them is ludwig baumann , head of the federal union of victims of nazi military justice .
in 2002 , the german parliament decided against granting a general rehabilitation - a decision baumann says lumps him and others like him in together with looters and people who robbed corpses .
" that 's the context we 're placed in , and it 's such a derision of war victims , " said baumann , who deserted hitler 's army in 1942 only to be captured and tortured by the nazis because he refused to reveal the name of the frenchman who helped him to flee .
the 87-year-old was rehabilitated in 2002 , but he continues to campaign for the general rehabilitation of all nazi war traitors .
parliament will vote again on the issue on september 8 , and this time , there 's every reason to assume that , with the conservatives on board , baumann will finally get the general rehabilitation he longs for .

at the center of their campaign is a contentious issue that the candidates themselves know well from their own experience : integration .
and they believe they have something unique to offer if elected to public office .
" on this issue , i think we are very competent , because we have an immigrant background and we are more familiar with the problems of these people , " says asuman bayraci , one of eight women candidates for the muslim alliance .
" we know both cultures very well .
we are german – most of us were born here or at least grew-up here .
but , of course , we also know the culture of our parents . "
not a muslim-only party however , leading candidate and alliance chairman , haluk yildiz , stresses that , unlike some other muslim groups , the alliance for peace and fairness is not out to promote a muslim agenda .
he says their platform is to promote dialogue on important issues for all of bonn 's residents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leading candidate haluk yildiz hopes to win enough votes to join the municipal council " we understand that integration is an issue that effects all of society , and finding a solution should n't be left solely to immigrants .
instead , everyone should get involved , " says yildiz .
the muslim council in bonn , founded three years ago , initiated the muslim voters ' association after members realized that many of the issues they faced were part of broader societal problems , and could not be solved by muslims alone .
they also felt their concerns were not being heard clearly enough by the broader public .
" the main idea here is that we have to create a platform where we can all sit around a table and come up with solutions together .
we do n't want immigrants to be talked about - but , rather to be talked to - so they can participate in discussions about integration , " yildez explained .
integration must be promoted despite being one year too young to vote , 15-year-old matthias kloeckner believes the issue of integration should receive more attention from politicians .
" because our world is becoming more integrated and we have to live together in our globalized world , we can no longer have a " me-first " attitude , " says kloeckner .
" the nationalist mentality does n't work anymore .
it prevents us from finding answers to issues like integration .
i do n't think any of the political parties have really taken this up . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish women , in particular , find it hard to integrate into german society why not join a german party ?
however , some are very skeptical of a muslim political party .
critics argue that since muslims participate in german life and are part of german society , they should be active in existing political parties , not creating their own .
" i think that the alliance for peace and fairness should not be a party primarily for muslims , but for everybody , " says kemal astare while attending a campaign rally .
as part of their campaign manifesto , the muslim alliance says it rejects any form of discrimination , terrorism , racism and anti-semitism .
the alliance , which consists of some 50 members so far , is also calling on city authorities to hire more people with an immigrant background and to include training courses on intercultural communication for the city staff .
though the party is still new , the abolition of the five percent vote threshold means that the alliance for peace and fairness stands a good chance of picking up a number of seats in bonn 's local elections on sunday .

however , some are very skeptical of a muslim political party .
critics argue that since muslims participate in german life and are part of german society , they should be active in existing political parties , not creating their own .
" i think that the alliance for peace and fairness should not be a party primarily for muslims , but for everybody , " says kemal astare while attending a campaign rally .
as part of their campaign manifesto , the muslim alliance says it rejects any form of discrimination , terrorism , racism and anti-semitism .
the alliance , which consists of some 50 members so far , is also calling on city authorities to hire more people with an immigrant background and to include training courses on intercultural communication for the city staff .
though the party is still new , the abolition of the five percent vote threshold means that the alliance for peace and fairness stands a good chance of picking up a number of seats in bonn 's local elections on sunday .

at the center of their campaign is a contentious issue that the candidates themselves know well from their own experience : integration .
and they believe they have something unique to offer if elected to public office .
" on this issue , i think we are very competent , because we have an immigrant background and we are more familiar with the problems of these people , " says asuman bayraci , one of eight women candidates for the muslim alliance .
" we know both cultures very well .
we are german – most of us were born here or at least grew-up here .
but , of course , we also know the culture of our parents . "
not a muslim-only party however , leading candidate and alliance chairman , haluk yildiz , stresses that , unlike some other muslim groups , the alliance for peace and fairness is not out to promote a muslim agenda .
he says their platform is to promote dialogue on important issues for all of bonn 's residents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leading candidate haluk yildiz hopes to win enough votes to join the municipal council " we understand that integration is an issue that effects all of society , and finding a solution should n't be left solely to immigrants .

the muslim council in bonn , founded three years ago , initiated the muslim voters ' association after members realized that many of the issues they faced were part of broader societal problems , and could not be solved by muslims alone .
they also felt their concerns were not being heard clearly enough by the broader public .

but , of course , we also know the culture of our parents . "
not a muslim-only party however , leading candidate and alliance chairman , haluk yildiz , stresses that , unlike some other muslim groups , the alliance for peace and fairness is not out to promote a muslim agenda .
he says their platform is to promote dialogue on important issues for all of bonn 's residents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leading candidate haluk yildiz hopes to win enough votes to join the municipal council " we understand that integration is an issue that effects all of society , and finding a solution should n't be left solely to immigrants .
instead , everyone should get involved , " says yildiz .
the muslim council in bonn , founded three years ago , initiated the muslim voters ' association after members realized that many of the issues they faced were part of broader societal problems , and could not be solved by muslims alone .
they also felt their concerns were not being heard clearly enough by the broader public .
" the main idea here is that we have to create a platform where we can all sit around a table and come up with solutions together .
we do n't want immigrants to be talked about - but , rather to be talked to - so they can participate in discussions about integration , " yildez explained .
integration must be promoted despite being one year too young to vote , 15-year-old matthias kloeckner believes the issue of integration should receive more attention from politicians .
" because our world is becoming more integrated and we have to live together in our globalized world , we can no longer have a " me-first " attitude , " says kloeckner .
" the nationalist mentality does n't work anymore .
it prevents us from finding answers to issues like integration .
i do n't think any of the political parties have really taken this up . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish women , in particular , find it hard to integrate into german society why not join a german party ?
however , some are very skeptical of a muslim political party .
critics argue that since muslims participate in german life and are part of german society , they should be active in existing political parties , not creating their own .
" i think that the alliance for peace and fairness should not be a party primarily for muslims , but for everybody , " says kemal astare while attending a campaign rally .
as part of their campaign manifesto , the muslim alliance says it rejects any form of discrimination , terrorism , racism and anti-semitism .
the alliance , which consists of some 50 members so far , is also calling on city authorities to hire more people with an immigrant background and to include training courses on intercultural communication for the city staff .
though the party is still new , the abolition of the five percent vote threshold means that the alliance for peace and fairness stands a good chance of picking up a number of seats in bonn 's local elections on sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 27.08.2009 nazi " war traitors " set to win general rehabilitation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some nazi " traitors , " like claus von stauffenberg , are now national heroes germans convicted of being traitors to the nazi regime are the only group of war victims that hasn ’ t won full rehabilitation .
now , a draft law on a general rehabilitation is set to receive the support of mps . an estimated 100,000 people were convicted as ” war traitors ” by the nazis .
some 30,000 of them were sentenced to death , and the death penalties were actually carried out in about 20,000 cases .
laws on war traitors originated in 1872 following the franco-german war and were adapted by the nazis in 1934 .
starting then , germans could be convicted of treason for making negative comments about hitler , treating pows too well , helping jews to flee , or possessing a leaflet calling for an end to the nazi dictatorship .
today , although most of the dictatorship 's victims have been fully rehabilitated , the question of how to deal with war traitors has remained a largely unresolved issue .
in 2006 , when germany 's left party began calling for a general rehabilitation of people branded as war traitors by the nazis , conservatives like norbert geis from bavaria 's christian social union were up in arms . ” back then , we did n't support endeavors to rehabilitate war traitors , " geis said .
" we were certain that evidence could be found , proving that at least some of those traitors deliberately jeopardized the lives of their comrades with their actions , and we did n't want to signal approval for such behavior . ”
concerns over actions of deserters military historian ralf-dieter mueller says that , in some cases , rehabilitation of a war traitor would be tricky .
a german soldier who defected and then told the enemy about troop locations , for example , would have deliberately endangered the lives of other soldiers .
" there 's a certain degree of underhandedness involved which would be extremely hard to justify and endorse , ” mueller said .
in the meantime , though , germany 's conservatives have given up their resistance to the idea of general rehabilitation , after extensive archival research failed to unearth evidence suggesting that deserters had ever acted in such a way .
opposition greens mp wolfgang wieland goes one step further , arguing that it 's impossible to separate " good traitors " from the bad ones by considering whether they put other people 's lives at risk .
" colonel claus von stauffenberg killed other officers with his bomb that was meant to kill hitler in his 1944 assassination plot , " wieland said .
" he knew that ' collateral damage ' would be inevitable .
nonetheless , what he did was right . "
from traitor to national hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig baumann while stauffenberg is now hailed as a national hero , many other surviving " war traitors " are still waiting to have their honor and dignity restored .
among them is ludwig baumann , head of the federal union of victims of nazi military justice .
in 2002 , the german parliament decided against granting a general rehabilitation - a decision baumann says lumps him and others like him in together with looters and people who robbed corpses .
" that 's the context we 're placed in , and it 's such a derision of war victims , " said baumann , who deserted hitler 's army in 1942 only to be captured and tortured by the nazis because he refused to reveal the name of the frenchman who helped him to flee .
the 87-year-old was rehabilitated in 2002 , but he continues to campaign for the general rehabilitation of all nazi war traitors .
parliament will vote again on the issue on september 8 , and this time , there 's every reason to assume that , with the conservatives on board , baumann will finally get the general rehabilitation he longs for .

now , a draft law on a general rehabilitation is set to receive the support of mps . an estimated 100,000 people were convicted as ” war traitors ” by the nazis .
some 30,000 of them were sentenced to death , and the death penalties were actually carried out in about 20,000 cases .
laws on war traitors originated in 1872 following the franco-german war and were adapted by the nazis in 1934 .
starting then , germans could be convicted of treason for making negative comments about hitler , treating pows too well , helping jews to flee , or possessing a leaflet calling for an end to the nazi dictatorship .
today , although most of the dictatorship 's victims have been fully rehabilitated , the question of how to deal with war traitors has remained a largely unresolved issue .
in 2006 , when germany 's left party began calling for a general rehabilitation of people branded as war traitors by the nazis , conservatives like norbert geis from bavaria 's christian social union were up in arms . ” back then , we did n't support endeavors to rehabilitate war traitors , " geis said .
" we were certain that evidence could be found , proving that at least some of those traitors deliberately jeopardized the lives of their comrades with their actions , and we did n't want to signal approval for such behavior . ”
concerns over actions of deserters military historian ralf-dieter mueller says that , in some cases , rehabilitation of a war traitor would be tricky .
a german soldier who defected and then told the enemy about troop locations , for example , would have deliberately endangered the lives of other soldiers .
" there 's a certain degree of underhandedness involved which would be extremely hard to justify and endorse , ” mueller said .
in the meantime , though , germany 's conservatives have given up their resistance to the idea of general rehabilitation , after extensive archival research failed to unearth evidence suggesting that deserters had ever acted in such a way .
opposition greens mp wolfgang wieland goes one step further , arguing that it 's impossible to separate " good traitors " from the bad ones by considering whether they put other people 's lives at risk .
" colonel claus von stauffenberg killed other officers with his bomb that was meant to kill hitler in his 1944 assassination plot , " wieland said .
" he knew that ' collateral damage ' would be inevitable .
nonetheless , what he did was right . "
from traitor to national hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig baumann while stauffenberg is now hailed as a national hero , many other surviving " war traitors " are still waiting to have their honor and dignity restored .
among them is ludwig baumann , head of the federal union of victims of nazi military justice .
in 2002 , the german parliament decided against granting a general rehabilitation - a decision baumann says lumps him and others like him in together with looters and people who robbed corpses .
" that 's the context we 're placed in , and it 's such a derision of war victims , " said baumann , who deserted hitler 's army in 1942 only to be captured and tortured by the nazis because he refused to reveal the name of the frenchman who helped him to flee .
the 87-year-old was rehabilitated in 2002 , but he continues to campaign for the general rehabilitation of all nazi war traitors .
parliament will vote again on the issue on september 8 , and this time , there 's every reason to assume that , with the conservatives on board , baumann will finally get the general rehabilitation he longs for .

the move comes as pressure from brussels increases on germany to approve the bill before the german election on september 27 .
eu officials fear that if germany fails to ratify the lisbon treaty by then , it could bolster opponents of the treaty in the three other nations that have yet to endorse it : ireland , the czech republic and poland .
ministers will debate whether the new proposals – which would give the bundestag access to all relevant eu documents and the option to meet on any subject the government is discussing at eu level – not only satisfies the conditions demanded by the federal constitutional court before allowing ratification , but also satisfies the main political parties .
germany 's top court had ruled in june that the lisbon treaty - aimed at streamlining decision-making in the 27-nation eu - must be put on ice until legislation guarding national parliamentary powers was passed .
the draft law will now fulfill the constitutional court 's requirements .
the new legislation is a watered-down version of a law which the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , demanded .
the csu had insisted that the law include a number of controversial points , including requiring the government to consult the german parliament in eu negotiations , granting the constitutional court the last word on interpreting the lisbon treaty and requiring referendums before the bloc can accept new members .
while wednesday 's reading is a step towards possible ratification of the lisbon treaty , worried eurocrats hope that the germans will finalize the deal before the country goes to the polls , since the deal is not yet final .
the draft law will again go before the bundestag - the country 's lower house of parliament - on september 8 and then the bundesrat upper house on september 18 , nine days before the german general election .
left party opposition could delay vital legislation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party chairman oskar lafontaine opposes the treaty a potential stumbling-block could come from the left party , vehement opponents of the treaty who are attempting to take the issue back to the federal court for another hearing .
the left party 's parliamentary group claims that the new law is unconstitutional and that it does not allow the people to have a say in germany 's involvement in european policies and laws , which it says will ultimately affect them in the same way as if they were domestic laws .
it also argues that the new law does n't give the parliament enough power in dealing with eu foreign and security issues .
as a result , the left party believes the law should go before the high court once more .
all 27 members of the european union have to ratify the treaty for it to take effect and a long delay would be an embarrassment to chancellor merkel , who spearheaded efforts to reach a deal on the treaty in 2007 .
lisbon seen as necessary in eu 's reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all 27 eu states must ratify the treaty for it to become law the lisbon treaty is designed to facilitate decision-making in an eu which has expanded to encompass several former communist countries in eastern europe as well as malta and cyprus .
the bloc has almost doubled in size since the current nice treaty came into force .
if the lisbon treaty replaces it , the eu would do away with the current unwieldy system of the rotating presidency in favor of the selection of a leader for a limited term .
a single powerful foreign policy representative would also be appointed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 27.08.2009 germany picks historical film for race to the oscars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a still from the white ribbon an independent film jury has chosen an austere drama to represent germany in the competition for the 2010 best foreign language picture academy award . austrian director michael haneke 's black-and-white film " das weisse band " -lrb- the white ribbon -rrb- captured the imagination of the german films jury and convinced its members " through its narrative and aesthetic quality as well as its extraordinary characterization of a village community in germany at the beginning of the 20th century . "
the film , which is set in rural protestant germany in the years leading up to the world war i , recounts a sequence of disturbing events which topple the pillars of propriety upon which the village stands . speaking after the jury 's announcement , producer stefan arndt , said he had seldom been so pleased about a committee 's decision .
" we will now do everything to convince the americans of our wonderful film . "
in austria , however , the german choice was criticized .
though haneke is austrian , the film was a co-production between both countries .
it was on the austrian jury 's list of films to consider , but they have not yet convened .
austria claims right to nomination " in my opinion , the film can only be submitted by austria , " martin schweighofer , director of the austrian film commission , told apa news agency thursday .
he added , however , that there may have been tactical reason for entering the film from germany , as several austrian films have been nominated for oscars in recent years - including last year 's winner " the counterfeiters . "
" the white band , " which fought off competition from ten other films to become germany 's representative , has already proven its ability to win awards .
it made a deep impression in cannes this year and came away with the prestigious golden palm .
how well haneke 's drama , which has no musical score , will fare further in its bid for an oscar will not be known for some time .
as many as one hundred countries are expected to submit films for the much coveted 2010 trophy , but the academy will not name the five nominees to go forward for the final selection until the start of february next year .
the oscars ceremony will be held in march .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 27.08.2009 german parliament hears new eu treaty law as ratification clock ticks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : treaty supporter merkel faces a tense time as germany decides germany 's bundestag is debating new legislation which would oblige the government to reveal its involvement in european union intergovernmental business , a major hurdle in germany 's ratification of the lisbon treaty . the first reading of the new law , in an unusual step , is taking place during the bundestag 's official summer holiday .
the move comes as pressure from brussels increases on germany to approve the bill before the german election on september 27 .
eu officials fear that if germany fails to ratify the lisbon treaty by then , it could bolster opponents of the treaty in the three other nations that have yet to endorse it : ireland , the czech republic and poland .
ministers will debate whether the new proposals – which would give the bundestag access to all relevant eu documents and the option to meet on any subject the government is discussing at eu level – not only satisfies the conditions demanded by the federal constitutional court before allowing ratification , but also satisfies the main political parties .
germany 's top court had ruled in june that the lisbon treaty - aimed at streamlining decision-making in the 27-nation eu - must be put on ice until legislation guarding national parliamentary powers was passed .
the draft law will now fulfill the constitutional court 's requirements .
the new legislation is a watered-down version of a law which the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , demanded .
the csu had insisted that the law include a number of controversial points , including requiring the government to consult the german parliament in eu negotiations , granting the constitutional court the last word on interpreting the lisbon treaty and requiring referendums before the bloc can accept new members .
while wednesday 's reading is a step towards possible ratification of the lisbon treaty , worried eurocrats hope that the germans will finalize the deal before the country goes to the polls , since the deal is not yet final .
the draft law will again go before the bundestag - the country 's lower house of parliament - on september 8 and then the bundesrat upper house on september 18 , nine days before the german general election .
left party opposition could delay vital legislation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party chairman oskar lafontaine opposes the treaty a potential stumbling-block could come from the left party , vehement opponents of the treaty who are attempting to take the issue back to the federal court for another hearing .
the left party 's parliamentary group claims that the new law is unconstitutional and that it does not allow the people to have a say in germany 's involvement in european policies and laws , which it says will ultimately affect them in the same way as if they were domestic laws .
it also argues that the new law does n't give the parliament enough power in dealing with eu foreign and security issues .
as a result , the left party believes the law should go before the high court once more .
all 27 members of the european union have to ratify the treaty for it to take effect and a long delay would be an embarrassment to chancellor merkel , who spearheaded efforts to reach a deal on the treaty in 2007 .
lisbon seen as necessary in eu 's reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all 27 eu states must ratify the treaty for it to become law the lisbon treaty is designed to facilitate decision-making in an eu which has expanded to encompass several former communist countries in eastern europe as well as malta and cyprus .
the bloc has almost doubled in size since the current nice treaty came into force .
if the lisbon treaty replaces it , the eu would do away with the current unwieldy system of the rotating presidency in favor of the selection of a leader for a limited term .
a single powerful foreign policy representative would also be appointed .
the treaty itself is a watered-down version of the european constitution that was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands in 2005. nda / afp / reuters / ap editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german parties remove hurdle for eu treaty ratification germany 's ruling parties removed a key hurdle blocking the passage of the eu 's lisbon treaty after a deal was struck late tuesday , increasing hopes that the treaty can be ratified in germany before the upcoming election .
-lrb- 19.08.2009 -rrb- lisbon treaty ratification endangered by demands from bavaria 's csu germany ’ s drive towards ratifying the eu ’ s reforming lisbon treaty may have one more obstacle to overcome after chancellor angela merkel ’ s conservative sister party in bavaria demanded more concessions for berlin .

but while german chancellor angela merkel expressed a willingness to consider new sanctions , she also reiterated calls from the palestinians and us president barack obama to halt the construction of israeli settlements in the west bank and east jerusalem .
palestinian president mahmoud abbas has made a stop to the construction a condition for returning to middle east peace negotiations .
at a press conference on thursday after their meeting in berlin , merkel agreed that stopping jewish expansion plans was a key " building block " to resuming peace talks .
but netanyahu told reporters that " no decision has been made . "
merkel was more open to netanyahu 's suggestion to increase pressure on iran if it does not drop its disputed nuclear program .
" if there is no positive answer by september , " she said , echoing obama 's deadline , " we will have to consider further measures . "
a call to " nip evil in the bud " in berlin , netanyahu has made a point of reminding his hosts that iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad has called for the state of israel to be " wiped off the map . "
" we can not allow those who call for the destruction of the jewish state to go unchallenged , " he said .
" we can not allow evil to prepare the mass deaths of innocents .
it should be nipped in the bud . "
these comments came as netanyahu was presented with the blueprints for auschwitz , the nazi concentration camp that was located outside of cracow , poland the blueprints were found in a berlin apartment in 2008 and include detailed plans for a gas chamber and a crematorium .
they were purchased by the germany daily tabloid bild and given to netanyahu to pass on to the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem .
netanyahu is scheduled to wrap up his trip to germany with a visit to the site of the 1942 wannsee conference outside of berlin .
there , senior nazi officials developed plans for the " final solution " – the genocide of the jews. hf / afp / ap / dpa / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move comes as pressure from brussels increases on germany to approve the bill before the german election on september 27 .
eu officials fear that if germany fails to ratify the lisbon treaty by then , it could bolster opponents of the treaty in the three other nations that have yet to endorse it : ireland , the czech republic and poland .
ministers will debate whether the new proposals – which would give the bundestag access to all relevant eu documents and the option to meet on any subject the government is discussing at eu level – not only satisfies the conditions demanded by the federal constitutional court before allowing ratification , but also satisfies the main political parties .
germany 's top court had ruled in june that the lisbon treaty - aimed at streamlining decision-making in the 27-nation eu - must be put on ice until legislation guarding national parliamentary powers was passed .
the draft law will now fulfill the constitutional court 's requirements .
the new legislation is a watered-down version of a law which the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , demanded .
the csu had insisted that the law include a number of controversial points , including requiring the government to consult the german parliament in eu negotiations , granting the constitutional court the last word on interpreting the lisbon treaty and requiring referendums before the bloc can accept new members .
while wednesday 's reading is a step towards possible ratification of the lisbon treaty , worried eurocrats hope that the germans will finalize the deal before the country goes to the polls , since the deal is not yet final .
the draft law will again go before the bundestag - the country 's lower house of parliament - on september 8 and then the bundesrat upper house on september 18 , nine days before the german general election .
left party opposition could delay vital legislation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party chairman oskar lafontaine opposes the treaty a potential stumbling-block could come from the left party , vehement opponents of the treaty who are attempting to take the issue back to the federal court for another hearing .
the left party 's parliamentary group claims that the new law is unconstitutional and that it does not allow the people to have a say in germany 's involvement in european policies and laws , which it says will ultimately affect them in the same way as if they were domestic laws .
it also argues that the new law does n't give the parliament enough power in dealing with eu foreign and security issues .
as a result , the left party believes the law should go before the high court once more .
all 27 members of the european union have to ratify the treaty for it to take effect and a long delay would be an embarrassment to chancellor merkel , who spearheaded efforts to reach a deal on the treaty in 2007 .

the bloc has almost doubled in size since the current nice treaty came into force .
if the lisbon treaty replaces it , the eu would do away with the current unwieldy system of the rotating presidency in favor of the selection of a leader for a limited term .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 27.08.2009 lithuania will probe claims of secret cia prisons großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cia allegedly had secret prisons in lithuania , poland and romania us media has named lithuania as a further european country to have allegedly hosted secret cia prisons .
but clarifying the matter is proving to be challenging , as some officials appear to be stalling investigations . lithuania has promised to investigate the latest allegations of hosting a secret cia prison for al qaeda suspects on the outskirts of the capital vilnius , said its new president dalia grybauskaite .
the parliament of the former soviet country was already putting together a special committee to look into the case , grybauskaite told reporters during an official visit to brussels on tuesday .
however , she said she had no confirmation of the claims .
" it is regretful that my country 's name is on the list , " said grybauskaite .
" it will be for us to prove if it is true or not . "
last week , former cia officials directly involved or briefed on the highly classified program told us television network abc news that lithuania was the third country in europe to provide the cia with such facilities .
sources have previously named poland and romania , as well .
a potential crime dick marty , the rapporteur of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe -lrb- pace -rrb- on secret detentions , said his own sources confirmed the news report .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty has been heading the inquiry into secret cia prisons since 2005 " the time has now come for europe to account in full for its involvement in this shameful episode , " said marty after the latest allegations were disclosed .
however , this is proving to be a difficult task .
romania has repeatedly denied the allegations , while polish prosecutors are still investigating the issue .
lithuanian government officials and grybauskaite 's predecessor , valdas adamkus , have denied the abc report .
" the idea that a country was housing a site where torture was probably committed is obviously very difficult to admit , " said reed brody from the brussels office of human rights watch .
" the fact is that this is embarrassing and , in particular , it is potentially criminal , " brody told deutsche welle .
" it is illegal to torture ; it is illegal to hold people incommunicado without any rights .
this potentially exposes officials , who are involved , to criminal liability . "
though this process of accountability had begun in the us , it had yet to start in europe , he said .
the fact that investigations were dragging on , for example in poland , could have ulterior motives .
" it would appear that the governments are hoping that people will forget about it , " brody said .
" but with each new revelation , with each new batch of evidence of how people were treated and the criminality of this program , it makes it harder to sweep it under the rug . "
getting washington 's ear all three countries named were formerly part of the soviet bloc and are new members of the european union .
lithuania , together with poland , joined the eu in 2004 ; romania in 2007 .
according to brody , this history may have played a role in the matter .
" it 's obvious that the relations of the new european countries with the united states are different , " he said .
a former intelligence official involved in the program told abc that lithuania agreed to host a prison because it wanted better relations with the us .
" these are countries that , to put it bluntly , may have thought it in their interests to suck up to washington and perhaps have less wherewithal to withstand the entreaties of a criminally-minded bush administration , " brody said .
the search for the truth european commission president jose manuel barroso restated that eu member states should investigate such allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a secret facility on the outskirts of vilnius reportedly housed eight men " we have repeatedly stressed the need for member states to start or continue in-depth , independent , impartial investigations to establish the truth of such claims , " barroso said at the press conference with grybauskaite .
according to pace 's marty , it is only a matter of time until the truth surfaces .
europe 's integrity depended on it .
" i have always believed that the ' dynamic of truth ' would prevail in the face of state secrecy , " marty said .
" but european credibility is damaged by these repeated leaks of only partial truths every few weeks or months .
let us draw a line under this , once and for all , and come clean . "
according to human rights expert brody , public pressure could help in clarifying the allegations .
" europeans are shocked by the idea that in the 21st century , there are secret prisons in europe in which people are being tortured , " brody said .
" there has been a lot of outrage and hopefully that outrage will translate into truth . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.08.2009 extremist npd creates right-wing comic books for young people großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd is currently running an aggressive election campaign in saxony the far-right national democratic party has published a political comic book , with allegorical animal characters , aimed at bringing its anti-democratic , anti-immigrant message to a younger audience . " ducks versus chickens " is the title of a new comic book published by the npd , designed to convert disaffected young people to its racist right-wing cause .
the comic , whose first edition runs 30,000 copies , is to be distributed free of charge , and represents " the first in a series of political comics , " an npd statement said .
structured as an allegorical fable with a strong , overarching moral , the story , told in rhyming couplets , revolves around a peaceful community of ducks who live in a colorful , bucolic paradise , " in a free land , far from our times . "
the ducks live there happily , sharing their food in a primitive socialist community .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd is using increasingly revolutionary rhetoric to gain supporters the comic then shows how this harmonious duck-land is invaded by an influx of chicken guests , who complain that an " evil fox " has driven them there .
with their higher fertility rate , the chickens quickly multiply and dominate duck-land .
the chickens also tempt the good , happy ducks into materialism , drug abuse , criminality and homosexuality , causing a general decay in duck society .
borrowing from nazi propaganda in the far-right comic book , the chickens are seen taking over neighboring lands from the native geese and swans and enslaving the inhabitants of these other poultry-based countries , who occasionally die as martyrs if they resist .
the final message is then unequivocally aggressive , exhorting its readers to fight the immigrants , shut borders to newcomers , and " do n't follow foreign birds . "
with its provocative , anti-immigrant message and eye-catching , populist aesthetic , the comic 's style owes much to the nazi propaganda of the late 1920s and early 1930s , which often used animal metaphors to portray foreigners as the root of social ills .
nazi mythology also frequently imagined a pre-capitalist idyll of pure , simple communities .
the book also borrows from the lilting , rhyming style of german children 's storiese , clearly aiming to seduce young readers .
npd strongest in saxony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd leader udo voigt managed to lead his party into the saxon parliament in 2004 the npd is currently fighting election campaigns in a number of german states .
its best chance of gaining entry to a state parliament is in saxony , where a state election will be held on aug .
30 .
after winning 9.2 percent of the saxon vote in 2004 , the right-wing party has dramatically lost voters , according to a recent poll , and currently stands only slightly above the vital five percent threshold .

" ducks versus chickens " is the title of a new comic book published by the npd , designed to convert disaffected young people to its racist right-wing cause .
the comic , whose first edition runs 30,000 copies , is to be distributed free of charge , and represents " the first in a series of political comics , " an npd statement said .
structured as an allegorical fable with a strong , overarching moral , the story , told in rhyming couplets , revolves around a peaceful community of ducks who live in a colorful , bucolic paradise , " in a free land , far from our times . "
the ducks live there happily , sharing their food in a primitive socialist community .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd is using increasingly revolutionary rhetoric to gain supporters the comic then shows how this harmonious duck-land is invaded by an influx of chicken guests , who complain that an " evil fox " has driven them there .
with their higher fertility rate , the chickens quickly multiply and dominate duck-land .
the chickens also tempt the good , happy ducks into materialism , drug abuse , criminality and homosexuality , causing a general decay in duck society .
borrowing from nazi propaganda in the far-right comic book , the chickens are seen taking over neighboring lands from the native geese and swans and enslaving the inhabitants of these other poultry-based countries , who occasionally die as martyrs if they resist .
the final message is then unequivocally aggressive , exhorting its readers to fight the immigrants , shut borders to newcomers , and " do n't follow foreign birds . "
with its provocative , anti-immigrant message and eye-catching , populist aesthetic , the comic 's style owes much to the nazi propaganda of the late 1920s and early 1930s , which often used animal metaphors to portray foreigners as the root of social ills .
nazi mythology also frequently imagined a pre-capitalist idyll of pure , simple communities .
the book also borrows from the lilting , rhyming style of german children 's storiese , clearly aiming to seduce young readers .

the comic , whose first edition runs 30,000 copies , is to be distributed free of charge , and represents " the first in a series of political comics , " an npd statement said .
structured as an allegorical fable with a strong , overarching moral , the story , told in rhyming couplets , revolves around a peaceful community of ducks who live in a colorful , bucolic paradise , " in a free land , far from our times . "

but while german chancellor angela merkel expressed a willingness to consider new sanctions , she also reiterated calls from the palestinians and us president barack obama to halt the construction of israeli settlements in the west bank and east jerusalem .
palestinian president mahmoud abbas has made a stop to the construction a condition for returning to middle east peace negotiations .
at a press conference on thursday after their meeting in berlin , merkel agreed that stopping jewish expansion plans was a key " building block " to resuming peace talks .
but netanyahu told reporters that " no decision has been made . "
merkel was more open to netanyahu 's suggestion to increase pressure on iran if it does not drop its disputed nuclear program .
" if there is no positive answer by september , " she said , echoing obama 's deadline , " we will have to consider further measures . "
a call to " nip evil in the bud " in berlin , netanyahu has made a point of reminding his hosts that iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad has called for the state of israel to be " wiped off the map . "
" we can not allow those who call for the destruction of the jewish state to go unchallenged , " he said .
" we can not allow evil to prepare the mass deaths of innocents .
it should be nipped in the bud . "
these comments came as netanyahu was presented with the blueprints for auschwitz , the nazi concentration camp that was located outside of cracow , poland the blueprints were found in a berlin apartment in 2008 and include detailed plans for a gas chamber and a crematorium .
they were purchased by the germany daily tabloid bild and given to netanyahu to pass on to the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem .
netanyahu is scheduled to wrap up his trip to germany with a visit to the site of the 1942 wannsee conference outside of berlin .
there , senior nazi officials developed plans for the " final solution " – the genocide of the jews. hf / afp / ap / dpa / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 27.08.2009 wikipedia proposes tighter editorial controls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia says a change in its editorial behavior does not mean a change in spirit the online encyclopaedia wikipedia is planning to follow the lead of its german arm and introduce a feature aimed at stamping out virtual vandalism on the english pages of its site . the move , which signifies the biggest change made to the public-participation encyclopaedia since its inception in 2001 , will require all edits to entries on living persons to be approved by authorized editors . when it first launched , wikipedia granted anyone and everyone the same unfettered right to add to or amend an entry on the web-based encyclopaedia , a principle of openness that helped make the site one of the ten most popular on the entire web . but a number of incidences of online vandalism have forced wikipedia to take slightly greater control of the reins . article amendments made by anonymous users with no editing track record will be flagged for revision .
this means that when readers open a freshly altered entry they will be given the choice of looking at the old and the new version , but will be made aware that the latter is awaiting review by an official editor . shutting out vandals wikipedia spokesman jay walsh told the afp news agency that the time delay between flagging and editor viewing could itself act as a deterrent to vandals seeking to malign and defame high-profile public figures . bildunterschrift : graffiti is as much an online as a real world problem " basic factors suggest that most people who have ill intent are looking for rapid satisfaction , " walsh said .
" they come in and they want to be jerks ; just like vandalism or graffiti in the real world .
the new feature removes that immediacy . " walsh said volunteers are currently putting the software through its paces before it becomes an official part of the english-language wikipedia profile . yet for all its newness to articles in english , the german language site has been test-driving the software for the past year . raimond spekking , software developer for the online encyclopaedia said wikipedia deutschland introduced the feature to satisfy the demands of the german-language readership . " we did n't want visitors to the site to be reading vandalized articles , " spekking told deutsche welle .
" we wanted to show them they were protected . " keeping it clean bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german language editors have their work cut out for them and the german-speaking wiki community responded to the outcome well .
" we ran a survey after the introduction and more than two thirds of people said they wanted us to continue with it . " so continue they have .
there are currently almost 7,500 editors working on the reviewing process , and although it is voluntary work , becoming a member of the team requires a certain amount of commitment . " users who make at least 300 edits in 60 days automatically qualify to become editors , " spekking explained .
" or if they can not manage that , they can make an application and do just 200 edits in 60 days . " and unlike the proposed changes to articles in english , the german site does not restrict the business of flagging and reviewing to entries about living people , but applies it across the board . the idea there is not only to minimize the risk of potential damage to big names but to lessen the likelihood that obscenities or falsehoods of any description make their way to the public under the wikipedia name . but opponents to the planned new editing feature say that very name has another responsibility , and that is to remain true to its democratic roots . wikipedia still open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barack obama 's wikipedia article is currently " locked " spekking said such criticism was rife among german-speaking users around the time wikipedia deutschland launched its revision software , but he says there really is nothing to get worked up about . " articles can still be edited by anybody , " he said , adding that the practice actually means it is possible to ' unlock ' pages which have been closed to edits from the public on the grounds that they are at particularly high risk of vandalism . and from this point of view , proponents argue , the proposed changes actually open the site further .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 27.08.2009 afghanistan 's future stands at a crucial crossroad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the counting continues in afghanistan but allegations of fraud are widespread as allegations of massive election fraud mount , afghanistan 's presidential poll is beginning to resemble a train wreck .
a hopeful process , which was marred by irregularities and security concerns , has now been derailed . while us president barack obama was calling the elections " an important step forward " and nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen was describing the process as a " testimony to the determination of the afghan people to build democracy , " the afghan presidential candidates have started trading blows of alleged fraud and vote rigging which suggest quite the contrary .
although the elections were less violent than had been widely anticipated , fear of violent reprisals and disenfranchisement with the political process kept people from the polls , especially in the pashtun-dominated south and east of the country , where the taliban insurgency has its heartland .
as voting ended it became clear that many of the repercussions are still to come .
the question many onlookers ask now is whether the events of the last week will further destabilise the country with what could be devastating consequences , or whether , perhaps , there is still hope for a brighter future ahead .
fighting for political survival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president hamid karzai 's presidency so far has been marred by allegations of corruption and mismanagement for incumbent president hamid karzai the period leading up to and since the election has been a fight for his political survival .
the legitimacy and credibility of karzai 's government has been eroded by corruption , mismanagement of resources and alliances struck with tribal strongmen and notorious warlords . a flourishing narcotics industry and horrific poverty have further tainted his presidency .
just two days after the election , karzai was seen at a dinner hosted by the famous singer farhad daria at the luxurious five-star serena hotel , best known for a deadly multi-pronged attack in january 2008 for which the taliban took responsibility . karzai was in good spirits as he smiled and shook hands with other presidential candidates at the non-political dinner , organised to promote unity and solidarity among the candidates the meeting was presided over by azizullah ludin , the chief of the independent election commission .
during the dinner he addressed the candidates urging them to accept the outcome , whatever it may be .
whilst karzai 's opponents believe that the iec is secretly backing president karzai -lrb- not an inconceivable situation , observers say , given that the iec members were elected by him -rrb- , the iec rejects these claims .
afghanistan 's problems karzai has had a very difficult task over the past five years , and his term in office has been marred by controversy .
the taliban insurgency has reached the highest levels since they were ousted from power in the us-led invasion in 2001 and corruption is endemic .
although he enjoyed a close relationship with former us president george bush , karzai appears to have fallen out of favor with the current us administration for these reasons .
in karzai 's defense he has managed to keep a semblance of order in the face of all these problems and ethnic fault lines that have threatened to tear the country apart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans are not convinced that abdullah is a viable alterntive to hamid karzai president karzai 's main rival , dr abdullah abdullah , has a very different reputation.whilst he has distanced himself from any of the dubious allegations that karzai has had to contend with , abdullah , who is said to lack karzai 's charisma , has not presented any detailed policies on which direction he proposes to take on many important issues , how he would intend to fight corruption and how he would resolve the problem with the taliban .
this lack of clarity has called into doubt his ability to lead the country forward .
furthermore , abdullah 's campaign was allegedly heavily financed by the iranians , raising further questions about whose interests he represents .
born half pashtun and half tajik , he is considered a tajik and therefore it is the vote of the tajik-dominated north that he has been counting on .
abdullah 's campaign posters showed him smiling next to the deceased mujahedeen commander and national hero ahmad shah massoud , who was killed by two al-qaeda suicide bombers just days before the sept .
11 attacks .
a former ally of the lion of panshjir , as massoud was known , abdullah is using his larger than life persona to boost his own lack of personality .
us urges restraint following the elections , richard holbrooke , the us envoy to afghanistan and pakistan , commuted between both camps to persuade both president karzai and abdullah to display patience , not to declare victory before results are in , as both candidates did , and most importantly not to play the ethnic card .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us special representative to pakistan and afghanistan richard holbrooke , left , has urged both sides to show restraint holbrook 's mission had mixed results .
so far none of the candidates have threatened violent protest .
on the contrary , officially abdullah has shown restraint , and has asked his supporters to refrain from taking to the streets , though nobody knows what is being said behind closed doors .
the special envoy 's visit included a stop over in mazaar-i-sharif , the main city in northern afghanistan , where the german bundeswehr is based .
there he met with mohammad atta noor , governor of balkh province , and one of abdullah 's closest allies .
following this meeting , noor was quoted in the british telegraph newspaper as saying that he was under pressure from the international community to accept a karzai victory because of the destabilising effect it would have on the southern provinces should a tajik come to power .
" they have come to the conclusion that if mr karzai does n't win , insecurity will increase in the south .
because of the insecurity situation , they are insisting we should go and work with the government .
it 's very difficult for us .
they are saying we should not accept the will of the people .
this situation would never be accepted by the majority pashtun south , " he reportedly said .
asked whether the international community was putting pressure on his camp to accept a result without a run-off , abdullah denied the rumours .
" no , i am not being pressured .
the only pressure which i will be ready to take will be from the people , not from the international community , " he said .
at a recent press conference held in the garden of his kabul home , abdullah presented material and video evidence he claimed showed karzai tried to steal the vote .
which way forward for afghanistan ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whoever wins the election will have to pull afghanistan out of its spiral of violence in a move that is frustrating international observers and the afghan people alike , the independent election commission is drip-releasing the figures , making it impossible to come to any conclusions as far the outcome of the elections are concerned and thus keeping a lid on any potential unrest .
in view of increasing violence , security is the key word making the rounds in the international community .
but what about democracy ?
if , as is widely believed massive vote rigging took place and karzai wins nonetheless , many afghans might ask whether that is the kind of democracy the west wants to have in afghanistan .
not only would six months of preparations , millions of euros and dozens of lives be wasted , but the confidence of the afghan people in the democratic process could be damaged for a long time to come .
many feel that the international community can not resign itself to the fact that this election may be decided by widespread stealing of the vote .
should the afghan people reject the outcome of the elections , and should this lead to unrest , then onlookers would rightly be worried that iran-style protests and more could follow .
amongst many afghans , president karzai is known as the " wizard " and he is pulling every trick out of his hat to win this election .
will karzai be able to pull of this final act of magic and create the illusion of a democratic process ?
observers say he may well succeed , however they also say it may beyond his power to make abdullah 's anger disappear or to turn the fate of a country that has been plagued by a quagmire of insecurity , corruption and poverty under his rule .

a hopeful process , which was marred by irregularities and security concerns , has now been derailed . while us president barack obama was calling the elections " an important step forward " and nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen was describing the process as a " testimony to the determination of the afghan people to build democracy , " the afghan presidential candidates have started trading blows of alleged fraud and vote rigging which suggest quite the contrary .
although the elections were less violent than had been widely anticipated , fear of violent reprisals and disenfranchisement with the political process kept people from the polls , especially in the pashtun-dominated south and east of the country , where the taliban insurgency has its heartland .
as voting ended it became clear that many of the repercussions are still to come .
the question many onlookers ask now is whether the events of the last week will further destabilise the country with what could be devastating consequences , or whether , perhaps , there is still hope for a brighter future ahead .
fighting for political survival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president hamid karzai 's presidency so far has been marred by allegations of corruption and mismanagement for incumbent president hamid karzai the period leading up to and since the election has been a fight for his political survival .
the legitimacy and credibility of karzai 's government has been eroded by corruption , mismanagement of resources and alliances struck with tribal strongmen and notorious warlords . a flourishing narcotics industry and horrific poverty have further tainted his presidency .
just two days after the election , karzai was seen at a dinner hosted by the famous singer farhad daria at the luxurious five-star serena hotel , best known for a deadly multi-pronged attack in january 2008 for which the taliban took responsibility . karzai was in good spirits as he smiled and shook hands with other presidential candidates at the non-political dinner , organised to promote unity and solidarity among the candidates the meeting was presided over by azizullah ludin , the chief of the independent election commission .
during the dinner he addressed the candidates urging them to accept the outcome , whatever it may be .
whilst karzai 's opponents believe that the iec is secretly backing president karzai -lrb- not an inconceivable situation , observers say , given that the iec members were elected by him -rrb- , the iec rejects these claims .
afghanistan 's problems karzai has had a very difficult task over the past five years , and his term in office has been marred by controversy .
the taliban insurgency has reached the highest levels since they were ousted from power in the us-led invasion in 2001 and corruption is endemic .
although he enjoyed a close relationship with former us president george bush , karzai appears to have fallen out of favor with the current us administration for these reasons .
in karzai 's defense he has managed to keep a semblance of order in the face of all these problems and ethnic fault lines that have threatened to tear the country apart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans are not convinced that abdullah is a viable alterntive to hamid karzai president karzai 's main rival , dr abdullah abdullah , has a very different reputation.whilst he has distanced himself from any of the dubious allegations that karzai has had to contend with , abdullah , who is said to lack karzai 's charisma , has not presented any detailed policies on which direction he proposes to take on many important issues , how he would intend to fight corruption and how he would resolve the problem with the taliban .
this lack of clarity has called into doubt his ability to lead the country forward .
furthermore , abdullah 's campaign was allegedly heavily financed by the iranians , raising further questions about whose interests he represents .
born half pashtun and half tajik , he is considered a tajik and therefore it is the vote of the tajik-dominated north that he has been counting on .
abdullah 's campaign posters showed him smiling next to the deceased mujahedeen commander and national hero ahmad shah massoud , who was killed by two al-qaeda suicide bombers just days before the sept .
11 attacks .
a former ally of the lion of panshjir , as massoud was known , abdullah is using his larger than life persona to boost his own lack of personality .
us urges restraint following the elections , richard holbrooke , the us envoy to afghanistan and pakistan , commuted between both camps to persuade both president karzai and abdullah to display patience , not to declare victory before results are in , as both candidates did , and most importantly not to play the ethnic card .

us urges restraint following the elections , richard holbrooke , the us envoy to afghanistan and pakistan , commuted between both camps to persuade both president karzai and abdullah to display patience , not to declare victory before results are in , as both candidates did , and most importantly not to play the ethnic card .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us special representative to pakistan and afghanistan richard holbrooke , left , has urged both sides to show restraint holbrook 's mission had mixed results .
so far none of the candidates have threatened violent protest .
on the contrary , officially abdullah has shown restraint , and has asked his supporters to refrain from taking to the streets , though nobody knows what is being said behind closed doors .
the special envoy 's visit included a stop over in mazaar-i-sharif , the main city in northern afghanistan , where the german bundeswehr is based .
there he met with mohammad atta noor , governor of balkh province , and one of abdullah 's closest allies .
following this meeting , noor was quoted in the british telegraph newspaper as saying that he was under pressure from the international community to accept a karzai victory because of the destabilising effect it would have on the southern provinces should a tajik come to power .
" they have come to the conclusion that if mr karzai does n't win , insecurity will increase in the south .
because of the insecurity situation , they are insisting we should go and work with the government .
it 's very difficult for us .
they are saying we should not accept the will of the people .
this situation would never be accepted by the majority pashtun south , " he reportedly said .
asked whether the international community was putting pressure on his camp to accept a result without a run-off , abdullah denied the rumours .
" no , i am not being pressured .
the only pressure which i will be ready to take will be from the people , not from the international community , " he said .
at a recent press conference held in the garden of his kabul home , abdullah presented material and video evidence he claimed showed karzai tried to steal the vote .
which way forward for afghanistan ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whoever wins the election will have to pull afghanistan out of its spiral of violence in a move that is frustrating international observers and the afghan people alike , the independent election commission is drip-releasing the figures , making it impossible to come to any conclusions as far the outcome of the elections are concerned and thus keeping a lid on any potential unrest .
in view of increasing violence , security is the key word making the rounds in the international community .
but what about democracy ?
if , as is widely believed massive vote rigging took place and karzai wins nonetheless , many afghans might ask whether that is the kind of democracy the west wants to have in afghanistan .
not only would six months of preparations , millions of euros and dozens of lives be wasted , but the confidence of the afghan people in the democratic process could be damaged for a long time to come .
many feel that the international community can not resign itself to the fact that this election may be decided by widespread stealing of the vote .
should the afghan people reject the outcome of the elections , and should this lead to unrest , then onlookers would rightly be worried that iran-style protests and more could follow .
amongst many afghans , president karzai is known as the " wizard " and he is pulling every trick out of his hat to win this election .
will karzai be able to pull of this final act of magic and create the illusion of a democratic process ?
observers say he may well succeed , however they also say it may beyond his power to make abdullah 's anger disappear or to turn the fate of a country that has been plagued by a quagmire of insecurity , corruption and poverty under his rule .

a hopeful process , which was marred by irregularities and security concerns , has now been derailed . while us president barack obama was calling the elections " an important step forward " and nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen was describing the process as a " testimony to the determination of the afghan people to build democracy , " the afghan presidential candidates have started trading blows of alleged fraud and vote rigging which suggest quite the contrary .
although the elections were less violent than had been widely anticipated , fear of violent reprisals and disenfranchisement with the political process kept people from the polls , especially in the pashtun-dominated south and east of the country , where the taliban insurgency has its heartland .
as voting ended it became clear that many of the repercussions are still to come .
the question many onlookers ask now is whether the events of the last week will further destabilise the country with what could be devastating consequences , or whether , perhaps , there is still hope for a brighter future ahead .
fighting for political survival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president hamid karzai 's presidency so far has been marred by allegations of corruption and mismanagement for incumbent president hamid karzai the period leading up to and since the election has been a fight for his political survival .
the legitimacy and credibility of karzai 's government has been eroded by corruption , mismanagement of resources and alliances struck with tribal strongmen and notorious warlords . a flourishing narcotics industry and horrific poverty have further tainted his presidency .
just two days after the election , karzai was seen at a dinner hosted by the famous singer farhad daria at the luxurious five-star serena hotel , best known for a deadly multi-pronged attack in january 2008 for which the taliban took responsibility . karzai was in good spirits as he smiled and shook hands with other presidential candidates at the non-political dinner , organised to promote unity and solidarity among the candidates the meeting was presided over by azizullah ludin , the chief of the independent election commission .
during the dinner he addressed the candidates urging them to accept the outcome , whatever it may be .
whilst karzai 's opponents believe that the iec is secretly backing president karzai -lrb- not an inconceivable situation , observers say , given that the iec members were elected by him -rrb- , the iec rejects these claims .
afghanistan 's problems karzai has had a very difficult task over the past five years , and his term in office has been marred by controversy .
the taliban insurgency has reached the highest levels since they were ousted from power in the us-led invasion in 2001 and corruption is endemic .
although he enjoyed a close relationship with former us president george bush , karzai appears to have fallen out of favor with the current us administration for these reasons .
in karzai 's defense he has managed to keep a semblance of order in the face of all these problems and ethnic fault lines that have threatened to tear the country apart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans are not convinced that abdullah is a viable alterntive to hamid karzai president karzai 's main rival , dr abdullah abdullah , has a very different reputation.whilst he has distanced himself from any of the dubious allegations that karzai has had to contend with , abdullah , who is said to lack karzai 's charisma , has not presented any detailed policies on which direction he proposes to take on many important issues , how he would intend to fight corruption and how he would resolve the problem with the taliban .
this lack of clarity has called into doubt his ability to lead the country forward .
furthermore , abdullah 's campaign was allegedly heavily financed by the iranians , raising further questions about whose interests he represents .
born half pashtun and half tajik , he is considered a tajik and therefore it is the vote of the tajik-dominated north that he has been counting on .
abdullah 's campaign posters showed him smiling next to the deceased mujahedeen commander and national hero ahmad shah massoud , who was killed by two al-qaeda suicide bombers just days before the sept .

but while german chancellor angela merkel expressed a willingness to consider new sanctions , she also reiterated calls from the palestinians and us president barack obama to halt the construction of israeli settlements in the west bank and east jerusalem .
palestinian president mahmoud abbas has made a stop to the construction a condition for returning to middle east peace negotiations .
at a press conference on thursday after their meeting in berlin , merkel agreed that stopping jewish expansion plans was a key " building block " to resuming peace talks .

merkel was more open to netanyahu 's suggestion to increase pressure on iran if it does not drop its disputed nuclear program .
" if there is no positive answer by september , " she said , echoing obama 's deadline , " we will have to consider further measures . "
a call to " nip evil in the bud " in berlin , netanyahu has made a point of reminding his hosts that iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad has called for the state of israel to be " wiped off the map . "
" we can not allow those who call for the destruction of the jewish state to go unchallenged , " he said .
" we can not allow evil to prepare the mass deaths of innocents .
it should be nipped in the bud . "
these comments came as netanyahu was presented with the blueprints for auschwitz , the nazi concentration camp that was located outside of cracow , poland the blueprints were found in a berlin apartment in 2008 and include detailed plans for a gas chamber and a crematorium .
they were purchased by the germany daily tabloid bild and given to netanyahu to pass on to the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem .
netanyahu is scheduled to wrap up his trip to germany with a visit to the site of the 1942 wannsee conference outside of berlin .
there , senior nazi officials developed plans for the " final solution " – the genocide of the jews. hf / afp / ap / dpa / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

palestinian president mahmoud abbas has made a stop to the construction a condition for returning to middle east peace negotiations .
at a press conference on thursday after their meeting in berlin , merkel agreed that stopping jewish expansion plans was a key " building block " to resuming peace talks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 27.08.2009 afghanistan 's future stands at a crucial crossroad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the counting continues in afghanistan but allegations of fraud are widespread as allegations of massive election fraud mount , afghanistan 's presidential poll is beginning to resemble a train wreck .
a hopeful process , which was marred by irregularities and security concerns , has now been derailed . while us president barack obama was calling the elections " an important step forward " and nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen was describing the process as a " testimony to the determination of the afghan people to build democracy , " the afghan presidential candidates have started trading blows of alleged fraud and vote rigging which suggest quite the contrary .
although the elections were less violent than had been widely anticipated , fear of violent reprisals and disenfranchisement with the political process kept people from the polls , especially in the pashtun-dominated south and east of the country , where the taliban insurgency has its heartland .
as voting ended it became clear that many of the repercussions are still to come .
the question many onlookers ask now is whether the events of the last week will further destabilise the country with what could be devastating consequences , or whether , perhaps , there is still hope for a brighter future ahead .
fighting for political survival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president hamid karzai 's presidency so far has been marred by allegations of corruption and mismanagement for incumbent president hamid karzai the period leading up to and since the election has been a fight for his political survival .
the legitimacy and credibility of karzai 's government has been eroded by corruption , mismanagement of resources and alliances struck with tribal strongmen and notorious warlords . a flourishing narcotics industry and horrific poverty have further tainted his presidency .
just two days after the election , karzai was seen at a dinner hosted by the famous singer farhad daria at the luxurious five-star serena hotel , best known for a deadly multi-pronged attack in january 2008 for which the taliban took responsibility . karzai was in good spirits as he smiled and shook hands with other presidential candidates at the non-political dinner , organised to promote unity and solidarity among the candidates the meeting was presided over by azizullah ludin , the chief of the independent election commission .
during the dinner he addressed the candidates urging them to accept the outcome , whatever it may be .
whilst karzai 's opponents believe that the iec is secretly backing president karzai -lrb- not an inconceivable situation , observers say , given that the iec members were elected by him -rrb- , the iec rejects these claims .
afghanistan 's problems karzai has had a very difficult task over the past five years , and his term in office has been marred by controversy .
the taliban insurgency has reached the highest levels since they were ousted from power in the us-led invasion in 2001 and corruption is endemic .
although he enjoyed a close relationship with former us president george bush , karzai appears to have fallen out of favor with the current us administration for these reasons .
in karzai 's defense he has managed to keep a semblance of order in the face of all these problems and ethnic fault lines that have threatened to tear the country apart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans are not convinced that abdullah is a viable alterntive to hamid karzai president karzai 's main rival , dr abdullah abdullah , has a very different reputation.whilst he has distanced himself from any of the dubious allegations that karzai has had to contend with , abdullah , who is said to lack karzai 's charisma , has not presented any detailed policies on which direction he proposes to take on many important issues , how he would intend to fight corruption and how he would resolve the problem with the taliban .
this lack of clarity has called into doubt his ability to lead the country forward .
furthermore , abdullah 's campaign was allegedly heavily financed by the iranians , raising further questions about whose interests he represents .
born half pashtun and half tajik , he is considered a tajik and therefore it is the vote of the tajik-dominated north that he has been counting on .
abdullah 's campaign posters showed him smiling next to the deceased mujahedeen commander and national hero ahmad shah massoud , who was killed by two al-qaeda suicide bombers just days before the sept .
11 attacks .
a former ally of the lion of panshjir , as massoud was known , abdullah is using his larger than life persona to boost his own lack of personality .
us urges restraint following the elections , richard holbrooke , the us envoy to afghanistan and pakistan , commuted between both camps to persuade both president karzai and abdullah to display patience , not to declare victory before results are in , as both candidates did , and most importantly not to play the ethnic card .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us special representative to pakistan and afghanistan richard holbrooke , left , has urged both sides to show restraint holbrook 's mission had mixed results .
so far none of the candidates have threatened violent protest .
on the contrary , officially abdullah has shown restraint , and has asked his supporters to refrain from taking to the streets , though nobody knows what is being said behind closed doors .
the special envoy 's visit included a stop over in mazaar-i-sharif , the main city in northern afghanistan , where the german bundeswehr is based .
there he met with mohammad atta noor , governor of balkh province , and one of abdullah 's closest allies .
following this meeting , noor was quoted in the british telegraph newspaper as saying that he was under pressure from the international community to accept a karzai victory because of the destabilising effect it would have on the southern provinces should a tajik come to power .
" they have come to the conclusion that if mr karzai does n't win , insecurity will increase in the south .
because of the insecurity situation , they are insisting we should go and work with the government .
it 's very difficult for us .
they are saying we should not accept the will of the people .
this situation would never be accepted by the majority pashtun south , " he reportedly said .
asked whether the international community was putting pressure on his camp to accept a result without a run-off , abdullah denied the rumours .
" no , i am not being pressured .
the only pressure which i will be ready to take will be from the people , not from the international community , " he said .
at a recent press conference held in the garden of his kabul home , abdullah presented material and video evidence he claimed showed karzai tried to steal the vote .
which way forward for afghanistan ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whoever wins the election will have to pull afghanistan out of its spiral of violence in a move that is frustrating international observers and the afghan people alike , the independent election commission is drip-releasing the figures , making it impossible to come to any conclusions as far the outcome of the elections are concerned and thus keeping a lid on any potential unrest .
in view of increasing violence , security is the key word making the rounds in the international community .
but what about democracy ?
if , as is widely believed massive vote rigging took place and karzai wins nonetheless , many afghans might ask whether that is the kind of democracy the west wants to have in afghanistan .
not only would six months of preparations , millions of euros and dozens of lives be wasted , but the confidence of the afghan people in the democratic process could be damaged for a long time to come .
many feel that the international community can not resign itself to the fact that this election may be decided by widespread stealing of the vote .
should the afghan people reject the outcome of the elections , and should this lead to unrest , then onlookers would rightly be worried that iran-style protests and more could follow .
amongst many afghans , president karzai is known as the " wizard " and he is pulling every trick out of his hat to win this election .
will karzai be able to pull of this final act of magic and create the illusion of a democratic process ?
observers say he may well succeed , however they also say it may beyond his power to make abdullah 's anger disappear or to turn the fate of a country that has been plagued by a quagmire of insecurity , corruption and poverty under his rule .

"
the film , which is set in rural protestant germany in the years leading up to the world war i , recounts a sequence of disturbing events which topple the pillars of propriety upon which the village stands . speaking after the jury 's announcement , producer stefan arndt , said he had seldom been so pleased about a committee 's decision .
" we will now do everything to convince the americans of our wonderful film . "
in austria , however , the german choice was criticized .
though haneke is austrian , the film was a co-production between both countries .
it was on the austrian jury 's list of films to consider , but they have not yet convened .
austria claims right to nomination " in my opinion , the film can only be submitted by austria , " martin schweighofer , director of the austrian film commission , told apa news agency thursday .
he added , however , that there may have been tactical reason for entering the film from germany , as several austrian films have been nominated for oscars in recent years - including last year 's winner " the counterfeiters . "
" the white band , " which fought off competition from ten other films to become germany 's representative , has already proven its ability to win awards .
it made a deep impression in cannes this year and came away with the prestigious golden palm .
how well haneke 's drama , which has no musical score , will fare further in its bid for an oscar will not be known for some time .
as many as one hundred countries are expected to submit films for the much coveted 2010 trophy , but the academy will not name the five nominees to go forward for the final selection until the start of february next year .
the oscars ceremony will be held in march .

this is why it was so important at mr. solyom 's visit .
it is a fact that hungarian troops were among the warsaw pact 's troops in 1968 .

if this approach fails then , and only then , will they commit the much greater resources needed to take direct action .
this is what i have observed of the organization when i was a member for about five years in the early 90 's .
in summary , if greenpeace decides that they need to go to all the trouble of hauling huge boulders out to the sea in order to protect a specific environment then i would be fairly confident that the action is not only necessary , but will also in this case enhance the environment that they are trying to protect . - gilbert o 'sughrue , new zealand merkel reiterates support for expellees ' memorial there is no doubt in my mind that a memorial for expellees should exist .

some wonder whether we need another climate conference .
others say you can ’ t have enough of them . the term " world climate conference " causes most people to think of the top-level discussion rounds taking place around the world under the auspices of the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- to try to broker a post-kyoto climate plan .
given all the media hype surrounding " copenhagen 2009 , " the mistake is forgivable . in fact the first two " world climate conferences " organized by the world meteorological organization -lrb- wmo -rrb- , were held in 1979 and 1990 and played an important role in the creation of the un climate secretariat , and in putting the subject of climate change onto the political , scientific and public agenda .
that 's history now , but the conference organizers do not feel their event has become redundant . just three months ahead of the key unfccc conference in copenhagen , world climate conference 3 sees itself not as a rival or duplicate event , but an important complement and a bridge between climate issues at the international politics level and everyday life . while negotiators the meeting in copenhagen will try to haggle out the legal details and binding targets , the organizers of wcc say they want to take a practical approach , getting information on the effects of a changing climate across to the ordinary man or woman on the street - or in the fields , as the case may be . " better climate information for a better future " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adapting agriculture to changing weather will be part of the discussion dr jose romero from the swiss federal office for the environment is chairman of the conference 's high-level subcommittee .
in his view , the conference will help to establish a " global framework for climate services , " practical assistance in adapting to a changing world . water , energy , agriculture , town planning - according to romero , there is virtually no sector that does not stand to benefit from " better climate information for a better future , " the motto of wcc-3 .
the meteorological services and environmental protection agencies around the world already have a wealth of climate data , and the capacity to provide good forecasts on different time scales . the ambition of the conference , he said , " is to put all this knowledge into a global network and provide practical information and tools at a very local level , for the users . " data on current trends and forecasts of likely changes both for a current season and for coming months , years , or decades , are essential to help people affected by changing weather patterns .
agriculture and food security are prime examples on the conference agenda .
preparation for dry periods , the use of different seeds , and the choice of different crops are all classical adaptation methods .
but getting the message across to the farmers who need it at the right time is another matter . the organizers say establishing a global network is one of the main aims of wcc-3 .
this would include the high-tech options available to the industrialized world , but also media such as radio to pass on locally relevant information in the developing world , for instance weather warnings , drought information or news of insect plagues that could endanger the harvest . turning data into action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say more sets of talks are good for the planet it 's easy to be skeptical towards the idea of " yet another climate conference . "
but the one thousand participants heading for geneva this weekend clearly share the organizers ' view that this conference has its place in the mosaic of climate events taking place every day in some part of the world . many organizations involved with climate issues confirm the organizers ' view of the geneva event as an important complement to the unfccc negotiations , including professor gerd tetzlaff , meteorologist at the university of leipzig and the chief scientific advisor to the german disaster prevention agency dkkv . in his view , wcc-3 plays a key role " because it 's virtually the first time the climate experts will be meeting in a framework like this to discuss how you actually reach the relevant responsible parties to draw practical conclusions from the results of climate forecasts . " dr. walter amman is president of the global risk forum , an international organization based in davos in switzerland .
he will be among the participants at what he also sees as a key event in the climate change debate .
in his opinion , you can not have enough discussions on climate issues at the moment - discussions he hopes will result in action . " every effort currently being undertaken is very valuable with a view to turning a global movement into the practical implementation of preventive measures and climate adaptation programs , " he said . author : irene quaile editor : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some wonder whether we need another climate conference .
others say you can ’ t have enough of them . the term " world climate conference " causes most people to think of the top-level discussion rounds taking place around the world under the auspices of the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- to try to broker a post-kyoto climate plan .
given all the media hype surrounding " copenhagen 2009 , " the mistake is forgivable . in fact the first two " world climate conferences " organized by the world meteorological organization -lrb- wmo -rrb- , were held in 1979 and 1990 and played an important role in the creation of the un climate secretariat , and in putting the subject of climate change onto the political , scientific and public agenda .
that 's history now , but the conference organizers do not feel their event has become redundant . just three months ahead of the key unfccc conference in copenhagen , world climate conference 3 sees itself not as a rival or duplicate event , but an important complement and a bridge between climate issues at the international politics level and everyday life . while negotiators the meeting in copenhagen will try to haggle out the legal details and binding targets , the organizers of wcc say they want to take a practical approach , getting information on the effects of a changing climate across to the ordinary man or woman on the street - or in the fields , as the case may be .

the meteorological services and environmental protection agencies around the world already have a wealth of climate data , and the capacity to provide good forecasts on different time scales . the ambition of the conference , he said , " is to put all this knowledge into a global network and provide practical information and tools at a very local level , for the users . " data on current trends and forecasts of likely changes both for a current season and for coming months , years , or decades , are essential to help people affected by changing weather patterns .
agriculture and food security are prime examples on the conference agenda .
preparation for dry periods , the use of different seeds , and the choice of different crops are all classical adaptation methods .
but getting the message across to the farmers who need it at the right time is another matter . the organizers say establishing a global network is one of the main aims of wcc-3 .
this would include the high-tech options available to the industrialized world , but also media such as radio to pass on locally relevant information in the developing world , for instance weather warnings , drought information or news of insect plagues that could endanger the harvest . turning data into action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say more sets of talks are good for the planet it 's easy to be skeptical towards the idea of " yet another climate conference .

but the one thousand participants heading for geneva this weekend clearly share the organizers ' view that this conference has its place in the mosaic of climate events taking place every day in some part of the world . many organizations involved with climate issues confirm the organizers ' view of the geneva event as an important complement to the unfccc negotiations , including professor gerd tetzlaff , meteorologist at the university of leipzig and the chief scientific advisor to the german disaster prevention agency dkkv . in his view , wcc-3 plays a key role " because it 's virtually the first time the climate experts will be meeting in a framework like this to discuss how you actually reach the relevant responsible parties to draw practical conclusions from the results of climate forecasts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 27.08.2009 nazi " war traitors " set to win general rehabilitation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some nazi " traitors , " like claus von stauffenberg , are now national heroes germans convicted of being traitors to the nazi regime are the only group of war victims that hasn ’ t won full rehabilitation .
now , a draft law on a general rehabilitation is set to receive the support of mps . an estimated 100,000 people were convicted as ” war traitors ” by the nazis .
some 30,000 of them were sentenced to death , and the death penalties were actually carried out in about 20,000 cases .
laws on war traitors originated in 1872 following the franco-german war and were adapted by the nazis in 1934 .
starting then , germans could be convicted of treason for making negative comments about hitler , treating pows too well , helping jews to flee , or possessing a leaflet calling for an end to the nazi dictatorship .
today , although most of the dictatorship 's victims have been fully rehabilitated , the question of how to deal with war traitors has remained a largely unresolved issue .
in 2006 , when germany 's left party began calling for a general rehabilitation of people branded as war traitors by the nazis , conservatives like norbert geis from bavaria 's christian social union were up in arms . ” back then , we did n't support endeavors to rehabilitate war traitors , " geis said .
" we were certain that evidence could be found , proving that at least some of those traitors deliberately jeopardized the lives of their comrades with their actions , and we did n't want to signal approval for such behavior . ”
concerns over actions of deserters military historian ralf-dieter mueller says that , in some cases , rehabilitation of a war traitor would be tricky .
a german soldier who defected and then told the enemy about troop locations , for example , would have deliberately endangered the lives of other soldiers .
" there 's a certain degree of underhandedness involved which would be extremely hard to justify and endorse , ” mueller said .
in the meantime , though , germany 's conservatives have given up their resistance to the idea of general rehabilitation , after extensive archival research failed to unearth evidence suggesting that deserters had ever acted in such a way .
opposition greens mp wolfgang wieland goes one step further , arguing that it 's impossible to separate " good traitors " from the bad ones by considering whether they put other people 's lives at risk .
" colonel claus von stauffenberg killed other officers with his bomb that was meant to kill hitler in his 1944 assassination plot , " wieland said .
" he knew that ' collateral damage ' would be inevitable .
nonetheless , what he did was right . "
from traitor to national hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig baumann while stauffenberg is now hailed as a national hero , many other surviving " war traitors " are still waiting to have their honor and dignity restored .
among them is ludwig baumann , head of the federal union of victims of nazi military justice .
in 2002 , the german parliament decided against granting a general rehabilitation - a decision baumann says lumps him and others like him in together with looters and people who robbed corpses .
" that 's the context we 're placed in , and it 's such a derision of war victims , " said baumann , who deserted hitler 's army in 1942 only to be captured and tortured by the nazis because he refused to reveal the name of the frenchman who helped him to flee .
the 87-year-old was rehabilitated in 2002 , but he continues to campaign for the general rehabilitation of all nazi war traitors .
parliament will vote again on the issue on september 8 , and this time , there 's every reason to assume that , with the conservatives on board , baumann will finally get the general rehabilitation he longs for .

" we will now do everything to convince the americans of our wonderful film . "

" the white band , " which fought off competition from ten other films to become germany 's representative , has already proven its ability to win awards .
it made a deep impression in cannes this year and came away with the prestigious golden palm .

as many as one hundred countries are expected to submit films for the much coveted 2010 trophy , but the academy will not name the five nominees to go forward for the final selection until the start of february next year .

the numbers could run into thousands , but the high commission could not be more precise , the statement said . pakistani interior minister rehman malik and his british counterpart , alan johnson , agreed on the details of the deal during talks in london ahead of president asif ali zardari 's visit later this week . " those people who do not have a valid reason to stay in the united kingdom need to return , " johnson was quoted as saying in the statement , pointing to illegal asylum seekers who have been detained in british jails , numbers of which were not immediately available . malik described the agreement as an important achievement . " let me be very clear and inform the pakistanis that they must not think that they can get a permanent status if they stay here illegally for 10 years or more , " he added . a british interior ministry statement added : " we welcome interior minister malik 's commitment to facilitating the return of pakistani nationals who have been found to have no right to stay in the uk . working with foreign governments to establish identity and obtain documentation is a crucial part of enforcing the uk 's immigration laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has traditionally accepted a large number of pakistani immigrants " we also welcome the very close co-operation which we have with the pakistan government in working to tackle international terrorism , " the statement said , adding weight to the belief that while the agreement is expected to target illegal immigrants , it could also be used against suspected terrorists . britain and pakistan pledged closer cooperation on counter-terrorism and economic development to help fight taliban militants during a meeting in london between prime minister gordon brown and zardari in may . terror suspects returned home the deportation agreement came just days after two pakistani students arrested during a series of anti-terrorism raids in britain arrived in back islamabad . abdul wahab khan , 26 , and shoaib khan , 27 , were among 12 men - 11 pakistanis and one briton - arrested in the pre-dawn raids in april but were not subsequently charged with any criminal offences .
their lawyer told reporters that they had not been deported but had returned to pakistan of their own free will . " they are innocent and have not been charged of any crime in uk jurisdiction , " lawyer amjad malik added as they arrived at the airport .
" there were no charges brought at any time on both of them .
they have not been deported and the charges were withdrawn - they came back willingly . " the lawyer criticized british police saying the two men had been held for more than four months under immigration laws when they should have been let go after four weeks . despite the increased cooperation in anti-terror and immigration operations , pakistan has called for britain to apologies to the 11 pakistani men , whom authorities previously said would be deported because they posed a threat to national security. nda / av / reuters / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 27.08.2009 experts see five possible solutions to the opel drama großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel 's future remains unclear now that gm has failed to choose a buyer like a soap opera entering its 15th season , the opel saga took a twist this week when it was revealed that general motors had turned down magna 's offer for the firm .
what could happen to the automaker now ? it was less than ten months ago that chancellor angela merkel stood in the chancellery with advisors and general motors executives and said she had n't yet made up her mind on whether to extend loan guarantees to help prevent the collapse of opel .
now , merkel and her government are knee-deep in opel 's affairs , having given the company a 1.5 billion euro bridging loan in the spring before its parent company , general motors , went into bankruptcy in the us .
merkel and her economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg have been trying to broker a government-financed sale of opel to a buyer that would be willing to guarantee the lion 's share of the 25,000 opel jobs in germany .
merkel put her weight behind a consortium led by canadian auto parts maker magna .
under the deal , magna and its russian partner sberbank would each buy a 27.5-percent stake , opel employees would take 10 percent , and the remainder would be held by gm .
but gm 's board refused to accept magna 's offer last week , citing concerns about intellectual property and conditions berlin had placed on aid , among other issues .
instead , gm hopes to sign a deal with the belgium-based investment fund rhj international , which has offered to take a 50.1 percent stake in opel , leaving 39.9 percent in gm 's hands and 10 percent with opel employees .
media reports suggest that a deal with rhj would allow gm to repurchase a controlling stake in opel at a later date if the company and the auto industry recover from the current economic crisis .
delay seen as inevitable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel wanted the opel sale to be complete before september elections with the magna deal on ice , at least for now , analysts say there are several possible scenarios explaining how the opel saga might end .
most agree that a resolution is unlikely before german national elections scheduled for september 27 - a possibility chancellor merkel has admitted , herself .
" substance has to be put before speed .
and if there are still questions to clear up , then we 'll clear them up , " merkel said wednesday in an interview with n24 television network .
deutsche welle asked industry analysts what they thought about the opel soap opera , and found there are at least five possible ways the story could end .
scenario 1 : magna succeeds despite the gm board 's rejection of magna 's offer for opel , the canadian company has a significant head-start over other bidders , if only because it has been viewed as the most serious contender from the very start and has had months to develop detailed plans for the acquisition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel workers want gm to give up control , arguing it has run the company poorly " magna had done a very in-depth analysis on opel and they came up with a very strong restructuring program , " said ferdidand dudenhoeffer , who runs the center for automotive research at the university of essen .
a combined opel-magna would receive up to 4.5 billion euros worth of state and federal loan guarantees to make the merger work , which is likely to be the most generous financing option available .
german leaders have said they back magna because the company has promised not to close any of opel 's german factories .
a deal between gm and magna is still possible , said ihs global insight auto analyst tim urquhart , but only if magna is prepared to make , " very , very significant concessions " on intellectual property and control of gm brands in russia .
" magna wanted complete control over gm operations in russia , including the ability to sell and produce chevrolets , completely cutting gm out of the russian market , effectively , " urquhart said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" they want to retain full control and full ownership of their technology . "
following the gm board 's decision , urquhart said magna would have to rethink its approach to merging with opel and rated the chances of a deal with magna succeeding at about 50 percent .
scenario 2 : rhj succeeds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel has four factories in germany and the government hopes to keep all of them open as the only other bidder that stayed in the running throughout the bidding process , rhj international , which is affiliated with the ripplewood private equity fund , should be in a strong position .
but german politicians fear the company would eliminate many jobs in germany .
in an interview in july , rhj director leonard fischer said the company would slash 10,000 of opel 's 50,000 european workers in an effort to make the company more competitive .
german politicians regularly compare private equity funds to ' locusts , ' making it difficult for such a bid to receive public backing .
" there is this great enmity that exists towards private equity in germany , but it 's almost gone to the point where it 's completely illogical - any mention of it is completely inconceivable , " said urquhart .
having spurned magna 's advances just weeks before germany 's national election , gm can now strong-arm the german government into financing a deal with rhj , auto expert dudenhoeffer said .
" i think general motors has the best position in the world in the negotiation process , " he told deutsche welle .
after the election , dudenhoeffer said , gm could present the german government with the rhj bid and a warning that it risked defaulting on its1.5 billion euro bridging loan - which could lead to bankruptcy and plant closures - if it does n't receive government financing .
" they will continue to blackmail germany and they will win if the germans do not counteract , " dudenhoeffer , who supports the magna bid , said .
scenario 3 : gm holds onto opel when gm began negotiations to sell opel , the company was hemorrhaging money and seemed just weeks away from collapse .
now that the company has emerged from bankruptcy with the us government holding 60 percent of its shares and domestic sales have jumped thanks to washington 's ' cash for clunkers ' program , analysts say the attitude of gm 's management has changed .
" it 's no longer the unstable mess it once was .
it 's now got a solid footing to move forward and they seem more confident about themselves , " urquhart said .
as a result , gm may now reconsider the wisdom of losing control of a company that has nearly eight percent of the market share in europe - one of the world 's largest car markets .
the challenge for gm will be to raise the three billion euros it says it would need to revamp opel 's product line .
with germany 's contribution up in the air , gm would most likely approach the governments of spain and belgium , which are also home to opel factories , as well as britain , where gm has two vauxhall factories , to obtain funding .
gm 's new ownership status may also make the company more attractive for some private investors who were previously worried about taking on too much risk , urquhart said .
" sources of private financing might begin to open up to them now that they 're underpinned by the us government - that 's not a bad guarantor , " said urquhart , before adding that private investment alone is not likely to be sufficient in itself .
" they really do need that working capital from the germans .
three billion euros is a lot of money and they 're unlikely to get that kind of money just from private sources , " said urquhart .
scenario 4 : the dark horses ride back onto the scene bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian newspapers report that fiat may once again be considering a bid for opel one of the first companies to express interest in opel as the company 's troubles began last year was italy 's fiat , led by ceo sergio marchionne .
the company pulled out of the race to buy opel in may .
its bid was criticized by the german government and labor unions on the grounds that it would cost too many jobs and likely result in the closure of several german factories .
with the failure of magna 's attempt to take over opel , italian newspaper reports this week suggested that marchionne might be preparing another attempt to buy opel .
in doing so , according to researcher dudenheoffer , fiat could gain access to some of opel 's small-car technology , which is better-suited to the american car market than fiat 's current technology .
fiat could then use that know-how in compact models it would sell through the american car company chrysler , of which fiat recently acquired control .
" i do n't believe that is an alternative for general motors because , then , general motors would have a major competitor in its home market , chrysler , competing using gm 's own technology , " dudenhoeffer said .
other bidders could also be lurking in the wings , which could , depending on the desperation of the german government to complete the sale , quickly become serious contenders .
" there 's some talk that beijing will be back at the table , who knows ? "
urquhart said , referring to a failed bid for opel by the state-owned baic carmaker .
" it 's a crazy situation . "
scenario 5 : chaos ?
if no bidder manages to secure control of opel , and if gm fails to find the money it needs to prop up the unit , then opel 's future is hazy .
german officials have said they expect gm to repay the 1.5 billion euro bridge loan , which is expected to run out by november .
" the whole thing is a bit of a catch-22 , " urquhart said , explaining that while governments want to lend money to opel in order to secure domestic jobs , opel needs the funding to revamp its operations - a process that 's likely to shed thousands of jobs .
gm 's decision to avoid choosing a bidder right away is , in urquhart 's eyes , an attempt to wait out the fervor of german electoral politics .
after the september 27 poll , which could lead to the formation of a more business-friendly coalition between merkel 's cdu and the liberal free democrats , gm hopes the situation " calms down and then they can evaluate and there 's less of a febrile atmosphere around the negotiations , " said urquhart .
gm holds a board meeting september 8-9 and merkel said wednesday she hopes the company can finalize its decision about opel 's fate by then .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 27.08.2009 experts see five possible solutions to the opel drama großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel 's future remains unclear now that gm has failed to choose a buyer like a soap opera entering its 15th season , the opel saga took a twist this week when it was revealed that general motors had turned down magna 's offer for the firm .
what could happen to the automaker now ? it was less than ten months ago that chancellor angela merkel stood in the chancellery with advisors and general motors executives and said she had n't yet made up her mind on whether to extend loan guarantees to help prevent the collapse of opel .
now , merkel and her government are knee-deep in opel 's affairs , having given the company a 1.5 billion euro bridging loan in the spring before its parent company , general motors , went into bankruptcy in the us .
merkel and her economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg have been trying to broker a government-financed sale of opel to a buyer that would be willing to guarantee the lion 's share of the 25,000 opel jobs in germany .
merkel put her weight behind a consortium led by canadian auto parts maker magna .
under the deal , magna and its russian partner sberbank would each buy a 27.5-percent stake , opel employees would take 10 percent , and the remainder would be held by gm .
but gm 's board refused to accept magna 's offer last week , citing concerns about intellectual property and conditions berlin had placed on aid , among other issues .
instead , gm hopes to sign a deal with the belgium-based investment fund rhj international , which has offered to take a 50.1 percent stake in opel , leaving 39.9 percent in gm 's hands and 10 percent with opel employees .
media reports suggest that a deal with rhj would allow gm to repurchase a controlling stake in opel at a later date if the company and the auto industry recover from the current economic crisis .
delay seen as inevitable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel wanted the opel sale to be complete before september elections with the magna deal on ice , at least for now , analysts say there are several possible scenarios explaining how the opel saga might end .
most agree that a resolution is unlikely before german national elections scheduled for september 27 - a possibility chancellor merkel has admitted , herself .
" substance has to be put before speed .
and if there are still questions to clear up , then we 'll clear them up , " merkel said wednesday in an interview with n24 television network .
deutsche welle asked industry analysts what they thought about the opel soap opera , and found there are at least five possible ways the story could end .
scenario 1 : magna succeeds despite the gm board 's rejection of magna 's offer for opel , the canadian company has a significant head-start over other bidders , if only because it has been viewed as the most serious contender from the very start and has had months to develop detailed plans for the acquisition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel workers want gm to give up control , arguing it has run the company poorly " magna had done a very in-depth analysis on opel and they came up with a very strong restructuring program , " said ferdidand dudenhoeffer , who runs the center for automotive research at the university of essen .
a combined opel-magna would receive up to 4.5 billion euros worth of state and federal loan guarantees to make the merger work , which is likely to be the most generous financing option available .
german leaders have said they back magna because the company has promised not to close any of opel 's german factories .
a deal between gm and magna is still possible , said ihs global insight auto analyst tim urquhart , but only if magna is prepared to make , " very , very significant concessions " on intellectual property and control of gm brands in russia .
" magna wanted complete control over gm operations in russia , including the ability to sell and produce chevrolets , completely cutting gm out of the russian market , effectively , " urquhart said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" they want to retain full control and full ownership of their technology . "
following the gm board 's decision , urquhart said magna would have to rethink its approach to merging with opel and rated the chances of a deal with magna succeeding at about 50 percent .
scenario 2 : rhj succeeds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel has four factories in germany and the government hopes to keep all of them open as the only other bidder that stayed in the running throughout the bidding process , rhj international , which is affiliated with the ripplewood private equity fund , should be in a strong position .
but german politicians fear the company would eliminate many jobs in germany .
in an interview in july , rhj director leonard fischer said the company would slash 10,000 of opel 's 50,000 european workers in an effort to make the company more competitive .
german politicians regularly compare private equity funds to ' locusts , ' making it difficult for such a bid to receive public backing .
" there is this great enmity that exists towards private equity in germany , but it 's almost gone to the point where it 's completely illogical - any mention of it is completely inconceivable , " said urquhart .
having spurned magna 's advances just weeks before germany 's national election , gm can now strong-arm the german government into financing a deal with rhj , auto expert dudenhoeffer said .
" i think general motors has the best position in the world in the negotiation process , " he told deutsche welle .
after the election , dudenhoeffer said , gm could present the german government with the rhj bid and a warning that it risked defaulting on its1.5 billion euro bridging loan - which could lead to bankruptcy and plant closures - if it does n't receive government financing .
" they will continue to blackmail germany and they will win if the germans do not counteract , " dudenhoeffer , who supports the magna bid , said .
scenario 3 : gm holds onto opel when gm began negotiations to sell opel , the company was hemorrhaging money and seemed just weeks away from collapse .
now that the company has emerged from bankruptcy with the us government holding 60 percent of its shares and domestic sales have jumped thanks to washington 's ' cash for clunkers ' program , analysts say the attitude of gm 's management has changed .
" it 's no longer the unstable mess it once was .
it 's now got a solid footing to move forward and they seem more confident about themselves , " urquhart said .
as a result , gm may now reconsider the wisdom of losing control of a company that has nearly eight percent of the market share in europe - one of the world 's largest car markets .
the challenge for gm will be to raise the three billion euros it says it would need to revamp opel 's product line .
with germany 's contribution up in the air , gm would most likely approach the governments of spain and belgium , which are also home to opel factories , as well as britain , where gm has two vauxhall factories , to obtain funding .
gm 's new ownership status may also make the company more attractive for some private investors who were previously worried about taking on too much risk , urquhart said .
" sources of private financing might begin to open up to them now that they 're underpinned by the us government - that 's not a bad guarantor , " said urquhart , before adding that private investment alone is not likely to be sufficient in itself .
" they really do need that working capital from the germans .
three billion euros is a lot of money and they 're unlikely to get that kind of money just from private sources , " said urquhart .
scenario 4 : the dark horses ride back onto the scene bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian newspapers report that fiat may once again be considering a bid for opel one of the first companies to express interest in opel as the company 's troubles began last year was italy 's fiat , led by ceo sergio marchionne .
the company pulled out of the race to buy opel in may .
its bid was criticized by the german government and labor unions on the grounds that it would cost too many jobs and likely result in the closure of several german factories .
with the failure of magna 's attempt to take over opel , italian newspaper reports this week suggested that marchionne might be preparing another attempt to buy opel .
in doing so , according to researcher dudenheoffer , fiat could gain access to some of opel 's small-car technology , which is better-suited to the american car market than fiat 's current technology .
fiat could then use that know-how in compact models it would sell through the american car company chrysler , of which fiat recently acquired control .
" i do n't believe that is an alternative for general motors because , then , general motors would have a major competitor in its home market , chrysler , competing using gm 's own technology , " dudenhoeffer said .
other bidders could also be lurking in the wings , which could , depending on the desperation of the german government to complete the sale , quickly become serious contenders .
" there 's some talk that beijing will be back at the table , who knows ? "
urquhart said , referring to a failed bid for opel by the state-owned baic carmaker .
" it 's a crazy situation . "
scenario 5 : chaos ?
if no bidder manages to secure control of opel , and if gm fails to find the money it needs to prop up the unit , then opel 's future is hazy .
german officials have said they expect gm to repay the 1.5 billion euro bridge loan , which is expected to run out by november .
" the whole thing is a bit of a catch-22 , " urquhart said , explaining that while governments want to lend money to opel in order to secure domestic jobs , opel needs the funding to revamp its operations - a process that 's likely to shed thousands of jobs .
gm 's decision to avoid choosing a bidder right away is , in urquhart 's eyes , an attempt to wait out the fervor of german electoral politics .
after the september 27 poll , which could lead to the formation of a more business-friendly coalition between merkel 's cdu and the liberal free democrats , gm hopes the situation " calms down and then they can evaluate and there 's less of a febrile atmosphere around the negotiations , " said urquhart .
gm holds a board meeting september 8-9 and merkel said wednesday she hopes the company can finalize its decision about opel 's fate by then .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 27.08.2009 experts see five possible solutions to the opel drama großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel 's future remains unclear now that gm has failed to choose a buyer like a soap opera entering its 15th season , the opel saga took a twist this week when it was revealed that general motors had turned down magna 's offer for the firm .
what could happen to the automaker now ? it was less than ten months ago that chancellor angela merkel stood in the chancellery with advisors and general motors executives and said she had n't yet made up her mind on whether to extend loan guarantees to help prevent the collapse of opel .
now , merkel and her government are knee-deep in opel 's affairs , having given the company a 1.5 billion euro bridging loan in the spring before its parent company , general motors , went into bankruptcy in the us .
merkel and her economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg have been trying to broker a government-financed sale of opel to a buyer that would be willing to guarantee the lion 's share of the 25,000 opel jobs in germany .
merkel put her weight behind a consortium led by canadian auto parts maker magna .
under the deal , magna and its russian partner sberbank would each buy a 27.5-percent stake , opel employees would take 10 percent , and the remainder would be held by gm .
but gm 's board refused to accept magna 's offer last week , citing concerns about intellectual property and conditions berlin had placed on aid , among other issues .
instead , gm hopes to sign a deal with the belgium-based investment fund rhj international , which has offered to take a 50.1 percent stake in opel , leaving 39.9 percent in gm 's hands and 10 percent with opel employees .
media reports suggest that a deal with rhj would allow gm to repurchase a controlling stake in opel at a later date if the company and the auto industry recover from the current economic crisis .
delay seen as inevitable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel wanted the opel sale to be complete before september elections with the magna deal on ice , at least for now , analysts say there are several possible scenarios explaining how the opel saga might end .
most agree that a resolution is unlikely before german national elections scheduled for september 27 - a possibility chancellor merkel has admitted , herself .
" substance has to be put before speed .
and if there are still questions to clear up , then we 'll clear them up , " merkel said wednesday in an interview with n24 television network .
deutsche welle asked industry analysts what they thought about the opel soap opera , and found there are at least five possible ways the story could end .
scenario 1 : magna succeeds despite the gm board 's rejection of magna 's offer for opel , the canadian company has a significant head-start over other bidders , if only because it has been viewed as the most serious contender from the very start and has had months to develop detailed plans for the acquisition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel workers want gm to give up control , arguing it has run the company poorly " magna had done a very in-depth analysis on opel and they came up with a very strong restructuring program , " said ferdidand dudenhoeffer , who runs the center for automotive research at the university of essen .
a combined opel-magna would receive up to 4.5 billion euros worth of state and federal loan guarantees to make the merger work , which is likely to be the most generous financing option available .
german leaders have said they back magna because the company has promised not to close any of opel 's german factories .
a deal between gm and magna is still possible , said ihs global insight auto analyst tim urquhart , but only if magna is prepared to make , " very , very significant concessions " on intellectual property and control of gm brands in russia .
" magna wanted complete control over gm operations in russia , including the ability to sell and produce chevrolets , completely cutting gm out of the russian market , effectively , " urquhart said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" they want to retain full control and full ownership of their technology . "
following the gm board 's decision , urquhart said magna would have to rethink its approach to merging with opel and rated the chances of a deal with magna succeeding at about 50 percent .
scenario 2 : rhj succeeds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel has four factories in germany and the government hopes to keep all of them open as the only other bidder that stayed in the running throughout the bidding process , rhj international , which is affiliated with the ripplewood private equity fund , should be in a strong position .
but german politicians fear the company would eliminate many jobs in germany .
in an interview in july , rhj director leonard fischer said the company would slash 10,000 of opel 's 50,000 european workers in an effort to make the company more competitive .
german politicians regularly compare private equity funds to ' locusts , ' making it difficult for such a bid to receive public backing .
" there is this great enmity that exists towards private equity in germany , but it 's almost gone to the point where it 's completely illogical - any mention of it is completely inconceivable , " said urquhart .
having spurned magna 's advances just weeks before germany 's national election , gm can now strong-arm the german government into financing a deal with rhj , auto expert dudenhoeffer said .
" i think general motors has the best position in the world in the negotiation process , " he told deutsche welle .
after the election , dudenhoeffer said , gm could present the german government with the rhj bid and a warning that it risked defaulting on its1.5 billion euro bridging loan - which could lead to bankruptcy and plant closures - if it does n't receive government financing .
" they will continue to blackmail germany and they will win if the germans do not counteract , " dudenhoeffer , who supports the magna bid , said .
scenario 3 : gm holds onto opel when gm began negotiations to sell opel , the company was hemorrhaging money and seemed just weeks away from collapse .
now that the company has emerged from bankruptcy with the us government holding 60 percent of its shares and domestic sales have jumped thanks to washington 's ' cash for clunkers ' program , analysts say the attitude of gm 's management has changed .
" it 's no longer the unstable mess it once was .
it 's now got a solid footing to move forward and they seem more confident about themselves , " urquhart said .
as a result , gm may now reconsider the wisdom of losing control of a company that has nearly eight percent of the market share in europe - one of the world 's largest car markets .
the challenge for gm will be to raise the three billion euros it says it would need to revamp opel 's product line .
with germany 's contribution up in the air , gm would most likely approach the governments of spain and belgium , which are also home to opel factories , as well as britain , where gm has two vauxhall factories , to obtain funding .
gm 's new ownership status may also make the company more attractive for some private investors who were previously worried about taking on too much risk , urquhart said .
" sources of private financing might begin to open up to them now that they 're underpinned by the us government - that 's not a bad guarantor , " said urquhart , before adding that private investment alone is not likely to be sufficient in itself .
" they really do need that working capital from the germans .
three billion euros is a lot of money and they 're unlikely to get that kind of money just from private sources , " said urquhart .
scenario 4 : the dark horses ride back onto the scene bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian newspapers report that fiat may once again be considering a bid for opel one of the first companies to express interest in opel as the company 's troubles began last year was italy 's fiat , led by ceo sergio marchionne .

other bidders could also be lurking in the wings , which could , depending on the desperation of the german government to complete the sale , quickly become serious contenders .
" there 's some talk that beijing will be back at the table , who knows ? "

now , a draft law on a general rehabilitation is set to receive the support of mps . an estimated 100,000 people were convicted as ” war traitors ” by the nazis .
some 30,000 of them were sentenced to death , and the death penalties were actually carried out in about 20,000 cases .
laws on war traitors originated in 1872 following the franco-german war and were adapted by the nazis in 1934 .
starting then , germans could be convicted of treason for making negative comments about hitler , treating pows too well , helping jews to flee , or possessing a leaflet calling for an end to the nazi dictatorship .
today , although most of the dictatorship 's victims have been fully rehabilitated , the question of how to deal with war traitors has remained a largely unresolved issue .
in 2006 , when germany 's left party began calling for a general rehabilitation of people branded as war traitors by the nazis , conservatives like norbert geis from bavaria 's christian social union were up in arms . ” back then , we did n't support endeavors to rehabilitate war traitors , " geis said .
" we were certain that evidence could be found , proving that at least some of those traitors deliberately jeopardized the lives of their comrades with their actions , and we did n't want to signal approval for such behavior . ”
concerns over actions of deserters military historian ralf-dieter mueller says that , in some cases , rehabilitation of a war traitor would be tricky .
a german soldier who defected and then told the enemy about troop locations , for example , would have deliberately endangered the lives of other soldiers .
" there 's a certain degree of underhandedness involved which would be extremely hard to justify and endorse , ” mueller said .
in the meantime , though , germany 's conservatives have given up their resistance to the idea of general rehabilitation , after extensive archival research failed to unearth evidence suggesting that deserters had ever acted in such a way .
opposition greens mp wolfgang wieland goes one step further , arguing that it 's impossible to separate " good traitors " from the bad ones by considering whether they put other people 's lives at risk .
" colonel claus von stauffenberg killed other officers with his bomb that was meant to kill hitler in his 1944 assassination plot , " wieland said .
" he knew that ' collateral damage ' would be inevitable .
nonetheless , what he did was right . "
from traitor to national hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig baumann while stauffenberg is now hailed as a national hero , many other surviving " war traitors " are still waiting to have their honor and dignity restored .
among them is ludwig baumann , head of the federal union of victims of nazi military justice .
in 2002 , the german parliament decided against granting a general rehabilitation - a decision baumann says lumps him and others like him in together with looters and people who robbed corpses .
" that 's the context we 're placed in , and it 's such a derision of war victims , " said baumann , who deserted hitler 's army in 1942 only to be captured and tortured by the nazis because he refused to reveal the name of the frenchman who helped him to flee .
the 87-year-old was rehabilitated in 2002 , but he continues to campaign for the general rehabilitation of all nazi war traitors .
parliament will vote again on the issue on september 8 , and this time , there 's every reason to assume that , with the conservatives on board , baumann will finally get the general rehabilitation he longs for .

what could happen to the automaker now ? it was less than ten months ago that chancellor angela merkel stood in the chancellery with advisors and general motors executives and said she had n't yet made up her mind on whether to extend loan guarantees to help prevent the collapse of opel .
now , merkel and her government are knee-deep in opel 's affairs , having given the company a 1.5 billion euro bridging loan in the spring before its parent company , general motors , went into bankruptcy in the us .
merkel and her economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg have been trying to broker a government-financed sale of opel to a buyer that would be willing to guarantee the lion 's share of the 25,000 opel jobs in germany .
merkel put her weight behind a consortium led by canadian auto parts maker magna .
under the deal , magna and its russian partner sberbank would each buy a 27.5-percent stake , opel employees would take 10 percent , and the remainder would be held by gm .
but gm 's board refused to accept magna 's offer last week , citing concerns about intellectual property and conditions berlin had placed on aid , among other issues .
instead , gm hopes to sign a deal with the belgium-based investment fund rhj international , which has offered to take a 50.1 percent stake in opel , leaving 39.9 percent in gm 's hands and 10 percent with opel employees .
media reports suggest that a deal with rhj would allow gm to repurchase a controlling stake in opel at a later date if the company and the auto industry recover from the current economic crisis .
delay seen as inevitable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel wanted the opel sale to be complete before september elections with the magna deal on ice , at least for now , analysts say there are several possible scenarios explaining how the opel saga might end .
most agree that a resolution is unlikely before german national elections scheduled for september 27 - a possibility chancellor merkel has admitted , herself .
" substance has to be put before speed .
and if there are still questions to clear up , then we 'll clear them up , " merkel said wednesday in an interview with n24 television network .
deutsche welle asked industry analysts what they thought about the opel soap opera , and found there are at least five possible ways the story could end .
scenario 1 : magna succeeds despite the gm board 's rejection of magna 's offer for opel , the canadian company has a significant head-start over other bidders , if only because it has been viewed as the most serious contender from the very start and has had months to develop detailed plans for the acquisition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel workers want gm to give up control , arguing it has run the company poorly " magna had done a very in-depth analysis on opel and they came up with a very strong restructuring program , " said ferdidand dudenhoeffer , who runs the center for automotive research at the university of essen .
a combined opel-magna would receive up to 4.5 billion euros worth of state and federal loan guarantees to make the merger work , which is likely to be the most generous financing option available .
german leaders have said they back magna because the company has promised not to close any of opel 's german factories .
a deal between gm and magna is still possible , said ihs global insight auto analyst tim urquhart , but only if magna is prepared to make , " very , very significant concessions " on intellectual property and control of gm brands in russia .
" magna wanted complete control over gm operations in russia , including the ability to sell and produce chevrolets , completely cutting gm out of the russian market , effectively , " urquhart said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" they want to retain full control and full ownership of their technology . "
following the gm board 's decision , urquhart said magna would have to rethink its approach to merging with opel and rated the chances of a deal with magna succeeding at about 50 percent .
scenario 2 : rhj succeeds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel has four factories in germany and the government hopes to keep all of them open as the only other bidder that stayed in the running throughout the bidding process , rhj international , which is affiliated with the ripplewood private equity fund , should be in a strong position .
but german politicians fear the company would eliminate many jobs in germany .
in an interview in july , rhj director leonard fischer said the company would slash 10,000 of opel 's 50,000 european workers in an effort to make the company more competitive .
german politicians regularly compare private equity funds to ' locusts , ' making it difficult for such a bid to receive public backing .
" there is this great enmity that exists towards private equity in germany , but it 's almost gone to the point where it 's completely illogical - any mention of it is completely inconceivable , " said urquhart .
having spurned magna 's advances just weeks before germany 's national election , gm can now strong-arm the german government into financing a deal with rhj , auto expert dudenhoeffer said .
" i think general motors has the best position in the world in the negotiation process , " he told deutsche welle .
after the election , dudenhoeffer said , gm could present the german government with the rhj bid and a warning that it risked defaulting on its1.5 billion euro bridging loan - which could lead to bankruptcy and plant closures - if it does n't receive government financing .
" they will continue to blackmail germany and they will win if the germans do not counteract , " dudenhoeffer , who supports the magna bid , said .
scenario 3 : gm holds onto opel when gm began negotiations to sell opel , the company was hemorrhaging money and seemed just weeks away from collapse .
now that the company has emerged from bankruptcy with the us government holding 60 percent of its shares and domestic sales have jumped thanks to washington 's ' cash for clunkers ' program , analysts say the attitude of gm 's management has changed .
" it 's no longer the unstable mess it once was .
it 's now got a solid footing to move forward and they seem more confident about themselves , " urquhart said .
as a result , gm may now reconsider the wisdom of losing control of a company that has nearly eight percent of the market share in europe - one of the world 's largest car markets .
the challenge for gm will be to raise the three billion euros it says it would need to revamp opel 's product line .
with germany 's contribution up in the air , gm would most likely approach the governments of spain and belgium , which are also home to opel factories , as well as britain , where gm has two vauxhall factories , to obtain funding .
gm 's new ownership status may also make the company more attractive for some private investors who were previously worried about taking on too much risk , urquhart said .
" sources of private financing might begin to open up to them now that they 're underpinned by the us government - that 's not a bad guarantor , " said urquhart , before adding that private investment alone is not likely to be sufficient in itself .
" they really do need that working capital from the germans .
three billion euros is a lot of money and they 're unlikely to get that kind of money just from private sources , " said urquhart .
scenario 4 : the dark horses ride back onto the scene bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian newspapers report that fiat may once again be considering a bid for opel one of the first companies to express interest in opel as the company 's troubles began last year was italy 's fiat , led by ceo sergio marchionne .
the company pulled out of the race to buy opel in may .
its bid was criticized by the german government and labor unions on the grounds that it would cost too many jobs and likely result in the closure of several german factories .
with the failure of magna 's attempt to take over opel , italian newspaper reports this week suggested that marchionne might be preparing another attempt to buy opel .
in doing so , according to researcher dudenheoffer , fiat could gain access to some of opel 's small-car technology , which is better-suited to the american car market than fiat 's current technology .
fiat could then use that know-how in compact models it would sell through the american car company chrysler , of which fiat recently acquired control .
" i do n't believe that is an alternative for general motors because , then , general motors would have a major competitor in its home market , chrysler , competing using gm 's own technology , " dudenhoeffer said .
other bidders could also be lurking in the wings , which could , depending on the desperation of the german government to complete the sale , quickly become serious contenders .
" there 's some talk that beijing will be back at the table , who knows ? "
urquhart said , referring to a failed bid for opel by the state-owned baic carmaker .
" it 's a crazy situation . "
scenario 5 : chaos ?
if no bidder manages to secure control of opel , and if gm fails to find the money it needs to prop up the unit , then opel 's future is hazy .
german officials have said they expect gm to repay the 1.5 billion euro bridge loan , which is expected to run out by november .
" the whole thing is a bit of a catch-22 , " urquhart said , explaining that while governments want to lend money to opel in order to secure domestic jobs , opel needs the funding to revamp its operations - a process that 's likely to shed thousands of jobs .
gm 's decision to avoid choosing a bidder right away is , in urquhart 's eyes , an attempt to wait out the fervor of german electoral politics .
after the september 27 poll , which could lead to the formation of a more business-friendly coalition between merkel 's cdu and the liberal free democrats , gm hopes the situation " calms down and then they can evaluate and there 's less of a febrile atmosphere around the negotiations , " said urquhart .
gm holds a board meeting september 8-9 and merkel said wednesday she hopes the company can finalize its decision about opel 's fate by then .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 27.08.2009 experts see five possible solutions to the opel drama großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel 's future remains unclear now that gm has failed to choose a buyer like a soap opera entering its 15th season , the opel saga took a twist this week when it was revealed that general motors had turned down magna 's offer for the firm .
what could happen to the automaker now ? it was less than ten months ago that chancellor angela merkel stood in the chancellery with advisors and general motors executives and said she had n't yet made up her mind on whether to extend loan guarantees to help prevent the collapse of opel .
now , merkel and her government are knee-deep in opel 's affairs , having given the company a 1.5 billion euro bridging loan in the spring before its parent company , general motors , went into bankruptcy in the us .
merkel and her economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg have been trying to broker a government-financed sale of opel to a buyer that would be willing to guarantee the lion 's share of the 25,000 opel jobs in germany .
merkel put her weight behind a consortium led by canadian auto parts maker magna .
under the deal , magna and its russian partner sberbank would each buy a 27.5-percent stake , opel employees would take 10 percent , and the remainder would be held by gm .
but gm 's board refused to accept magna 's offer last week , citing concerns about intellectual property and conditions berlin had placed on aid , among other issues .
instead , gm hopes to sign a deal with the belgium-based investment fund rhj international , which has offered to take a 50.1 percent stake in opel , leaving 39.9 percent in gm 's hands and 10 percent with opel employees .
media reports suggest that a deal with rhj would allow gm to repurchase a controlling stake in opel at a later date if the company and the auto industry recover from the current economic crisis .
delay seen as inevitable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel wanted the opel sale to be complete before september elections with the magna deal on ice , at least for now , analysts say there are several possible scenarios explaining how the opel saga might end .
most agree that a resolution is unlikely before german national elections scheduled for september 27 - a possibility chancellor merkel has admitted , herself .
" substance has to be put before speed .
and if there are still questions to clear up , then we 'll clear them up , " merkel said wednesday in an interview with n24 television network .
deutsche welle asked industry analysts what they thought about the opel soap opera , and found there are at least five possible ways the story could end .
scenario 1 : magna succeeds despite the gm board 's rejection of magna 's offer for opel , the canadian company has a significant head-start over other bidders , if only because it has been viewed as the most serious contender from the very start and has had months to develop detailed plans for the acquisition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel workers want gm to give up control , arguing it has run the company poorly " magna had done a very in-depth analysis on opel and they came up with a very strong restructuring program , " said ferdidand dudenhoeffer , who runs the center for automotive research at the university of essen .
a combined opel-magna would receive up to 4.5 billion euros worth of state and federal loan guarantees to make the merger work , which is likely to be the most generous financing option available .
german leaders have said they back magna because the company has promised not to close any of opel 's german factories .
a deal between gm and magna is still possible , said ihs global insight auto analyst tim urquhart , but only if magna is prepared to make , " very , very significant concessions " on intellectual property and control of gm brands in russia .
" magna wanted complete control over gm operations in russia , including the ability to sell and produce chevrolets , completely cutting gm out of the russian market , effectively , " urquhart said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" they want to retain full control and full ownership of their technology . "
following the gm board 's decision , urquhart said magna would have to rethink its approach to merging with opel and rated the chances of a deal with magna succeeding at about 50 percent .
scenario 2 : rhj succeeds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel has four factories in germany and the government hopes to keep all of them open as the only other bidder that stayed in the running throughout the bidding process , rhj international , which is affiliated with the ripplewood private equity fund , should be in a strong position .
but german politicians fear the company would eliminate many jobs in germany .
in an interview in july , rhj director leonard fischer said the company would slash 10,000 of opel 's 50,000 european workers in an effort to make the company more competitive .
german politicians regularly compare private equity funds to ' locusts , ' making it difficult for such a bid to receive public backing .
" there is this great enmity that exists towards private equity in germany , but it 's almost gone to the point where it 's completely illogical - any mention of it is completely inconceivable , " said urquhart .
having spurned magna 's advances just weeks before germany 's national election , gm can now strong-arm the german government into financing a deal with rhj , auto expert dudenhoeffer said .
" i think general motors has the best position in the world in the negotiation process , " he told deutsche welle .
after the election , dudenhoeffer said , gm could present the german government with the rhj bid and a warning that it risked defaulting on its1.5 billion euro bridging loan - which could lead to bankruptcy and plant closures - if it does n't receive government financing .
" they will continue to blackmail germany and they will win if the germans do not counteract , " dudenhoeffer , who supports the magna bid , said .
scenario 3 : gm holds onto opel when gm began negotiations to sell opel , the company was hemorrhaging money and seemed just weeks away from collapse .
now that the company has emerged from bankruptcy with the us government holding 60 percent of its shares and domestic sales have jumped thanks to washington 's ' cash for clunkers ' program , analysts say the attitude of gm 's management has changed .
" it 's no longer the unstable mess it once was .
it 's now got a solid footing to move forward and they seem more confident about themselves , " urquhart said .
as a result , gm may now reconsider the wisdom of losing control of a company that has nearly eight percent of the market share in europe - one of the world 's largest car markets .
the challenge for gm will be to raise the three billion euros it says it would need to revamp opel 's product line .
with germany 's contribution up in the air , gm would most likely approach the governments of spain and belgium , which are also home to opel factories , as well as britain , where gm has two vauxhall factories , to obtain funding .
gm 's new ownership status may also make the company more attractive for some private investors who were previously worried about taking on too much risk , urquhart said .
" sources of private financing might begin to open up to them now that they 're underpinned by the us government - that 's not a bad guarantor , " said urquhart , before adding that private investment alone is not likely to be sufficient in itself .
" they really do need that working capital from the germans .
three billion euros is a lot of money and they 're unlikely to get that kind of money just from private sources , " said urquhart .
scenario 4 : the dark horses ride back onto the scene bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian newspapers report that fiat may once again be considering a bid for opel one of the first companies to express interest in opel as the company 's troubles began last year was italy 's fiat , led by ceo sergio marchionne .
the company pulled out of the race to buy opel in may .
its bid was criticized by the german government and labor unions on the grounds that it would cost too many jobs and likely result in the closure of several german factories .
with the failure of magna 's attempt to take over opel , italian newspaper reports this week suggested that marchionne might be preparing another attempt to buy opel .
in doing so , according to researcher dudenheoffer , fiat could gain access to some of opel 's small-car technology , which is better-suited to the american car market than fiat 's current technology .
fiat could then use that know-how in compact models it would sell through the american car company chrysler , of which fiat recently acquired control .
" i do n't believe that is an alternative for general motors because , then , general motors would have a major competitor in its home market , chrysler , competing using gm 's own technology , " dudenhoeffer said .
other bidders could also be lurking in the wings , which could , depending on the desperation of the german government to complete the sale , quickly become serious contenders .
" there 's some talk that beijing will be back at the table , who knows ? "
urquhart said , referring to a failed bid for opel by the state-owned baic carmaker .
" it 's a crazy situation . "
scenario 5 : chaos ?
if no bidder manages to secure control of opel , and if gm fails to find the money it needs to prop up the unit , then opel 's future is hazy .

this is why it was so important at mr. solyom 's visit .

find out in this week 's reader responses . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content war of words escalates between eu countries hungary and slovakia king " stephen " is not just a hungarian medieval king .
he was hungary 's first king , the " statemaker . "
he founded hungary and he is also a saint .
so , he is the most important character in hungary , even now .
his feast is also the biggest in hungary -lrb- and in the heart of hungarians -rrb- .
this is why it was so important at mr. solyom 's visit .
it is a fact that hungarian troops were among the warsaw pact 's troops in 1968 .
but it was n't president solyom who dictated the day of the unveiling of a statue of king saint stephen .
it is a fact too , that czechoslovakian -lrb- slovakian -rrb- troops were among the warsaw pact 's troops in 1956 , when hungary was invaded by communist forces , with many hungarian deaths - but hungary never blasted any slovakian politician 's visit to hungary . - attila szalabán , hungary unfortunately your article is extremely one-sided , displaying only the slovak point of view .
the visit was arranged weeks before through diplomatic channels as the hungarian ministry of foreign affairs clearly proved .
the last days ' sudden " anger " from the slovaks is just another typically unfair manuever by them .
most people in both countries simply forgot many years ago what happened in 1968 .
the czechs , for instance , where these things happened just laugh at this slovak sensitivity - péter kuszál , hungary this is a kind of propaganda problem .
a young country , such as slovakia , lacks strong foundations , but they will feel relief for a while if they can find something in common .
they will look for it in the past and , if they can not find it fast enough , they will create illusions .
to accomplish the task , the easy way is to find a common enemy like hungarians .
now , they can feel like a community , they know what it means to be a citizen in slovakia .
to be anti-hungarian in slovakia is a fashionable thing nowdays . - gergely oskolás , hungary green party minister angers german auto industry with car comments i feel honored by the comments by ms. kuenast as a japanese citizen .
it is no wonder she is tough on german car makers because she is a green party member and not always a friend of corporations .
only germany can create green cars that could compete with japan in today 's world .
by the way , the election of the lower house will soon occur in japan .
but there is no green party of japan established yet .
germany should know it has a good chance to be the winner of the green car wars . - snowman , japan greenpeace drops ' granite shield ' off sweden 's coast greenpeace usually puts a lot of effort in determining what cause they will put their energy into before committing to pursue that cause .
this is then followed up by a campaign which can last many years in which they try to improve the situation that they see is flawed by asking the industry in question to become involved in the solution .
if this approach fails then , and only then , will they commit the much greater resources needed to take direct action .
this is what i have observed of the organization when i was a member for about five years in the early 90 's .
in summary , if greenpeace decides that they need to go to all the trouble of hauling huge boulders out to the sea in order to protect a specific environment then i would be fairly confident that the action is not only necessary , but will also in this case enhance the environment that they are trying to protect . - gilbert o 'sughrue , new zealand merkel reiterates support for expellees ' memorial there is no doubt in my mind that a memorial for expellees should exist .
as the son of a silesian mother and english father , perhaps i am one of the best placed persons to give an opinion .
i do not understand why it is so hard for people to divorce the actions of a corrupt government from the populace .
it seems to me that this is only ever applied to germany .
i will never accept that my family , whose history goes back hundreds of years in silesia , should have been the ones who paid for hitler 's aggression .
should i now lose my home in england because the british government attacked iraq ?
collective responsibility was something the americans wanted to place on the german nation , but it seems to be an accepted fact nowadays that peoples are generally not always responsible for the actions of their governments .
i do n't agree with the iraq war , so why should i be punished for it ? - peter , great britain tuscan villager celebrates biggest jackpot in european history national lotteries are an excellent way for governments to raise additional revenue as they function like a tax on stupidity .
why should n't the stupid and innumerate give a little more of their money to the government ?
they probably receive more in government services than the intelligent and better educated and they would n't spend it as wisely if it remained as discretionary spending . - huigh malcolm , australia send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 27.08.2009 lithuania will probe claims of secret cia prisons großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cia allegedly had secret prisons in lithuania , poland and romania us media has named lithuania as a further european country to have allegedly hosted secret cia prisons .
but clarifying the matter is proving to be challenging , as some officials appear to be stalling investigations . lithuania has promised to investigate the latest allegations of hosting a secret cia prison for al qaeda suspects on the outskirts of the capital vilnius , said its new president dalia grybauskaite .
the parliament of the former soviet country was already putting together a special committee to look into the case , grybauskaite told reporters during an official visit to brussels on tuesday .
however , she said she had no confirmation of the claims .
" it is regretful that my country 's name is on the list , " said grybauskaite .
" it will be for us to prove if it is true or not . "
last week , former cia officials directly involved or briefed on the highly classified program told us television network abc news that lithuania was the third country in europe to provide the cia with such facilities .
sources have previously named poland and romania , as well .
a potential crime dick marty , the rapporteur of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe -lrb- pace -rrb- on secret detentions , said his own sources confirmed the news report .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty has been heading the inquiry into secret cia prisons since 2005 " the time has now come for europe to account in full for its involvement in this shameful episode , " said marty after the latest allegations were disclosed .
however , this is proving to be a difficult task .
romania has repeatedly denied the allegations , while polish prosecutors are still investigating the issue .
lithuanian government officials and grybauskaite 's predecessor , valdas adamkus , have denied the abc report .
" the idea that a country was housing a site where torture was probably committed is obviously very difficult to admit , " said reed brody from the brussels office of human rights watch .
" the fact is that this is embarrassing and , in particular , it is potentially criminal , " brody told deutsche welle .
" it is illegal to torture ; it is illegal to hold people incommunicado without any rights .
this potentially exposes officials , who are involved , to criminal liability . "
though this process of accountability had begun in the us , it had yet to start in europe , he said .
the fact that investigations were dragging on , for example in poland , could have ulterior motives .
" it would appear that the governments are hoping that people will forget about it , " brody said .
" but with each new revelation , with each new batch of evidence of how people were treated and the criminality of this program , it makes it harder to sweep it under the rug . "
getting washington 's ear all three countries named were formerly part of the soviet bloc and are new members of the european union .
lithuania , together with poland , joined the eu in 2004 ; romania in 2007 .
according to brody , this history may have played a role in the matter .
" it 's obvious that the relations of the new european countries with the united states are different , " he said .
a former intelligence official involved in the program told abc that lithuania agreed to host a prison because it wanted better relations with the us .
" these are countries that , to put it bluntly , may have thought it in their interests to suck up to washington and perhaps have less wherewithal to withstand the entreaties of a criminally-minded bush administration , " brody said .
the search for the truth european commission president jose manuel barroso restated that eu member states should investigate such allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a secret facility on the outskirts of vilnius reportedly housed eight men " we have repeatedly stressed the need for member states to start or continue in-depth , independent , impartial investigations to establish the truth of such claims , " barroso said at the press conference with grybauskaite .
according to pace 's marty , it is only a matter of time until the truth surfaces .
europe 's integrity depended on it .
" i have always believed that the ' dynamic of truth ' would prevail in the face of state secrecy , " marty said .
" but european credibility is damaged by these repeated leaks of only partial truths every few weeks or months .
let us draw a line under this , once and for all , and come clean . "
according to human rights expert brody , public pressure could help in clarifying the allegations .
" europeans are shocked by the idea that in the 21st century , there are secret prisons in europe in which people are being tortured , " brody said .
" there has been a lot of outrage and hopefully that outrage will translate into truth . "

but clarifying the matter is proving to be challenging , as some officials appear to be stalling investigations . lithuania has promised to investigate the latest allegations of hosting a secret cia prison for al qaeda suspects on the outskirts of the capital vilnius , said its new president dalia grybauskaite .
the parliament of the former soviet country was already putting together a special committee to look into the case , grybauskaite told reporters during an official visit to brussels on tuesday .
however , she said she had no confirmation of the claims .
" it is regretful that my country 's name is on the list , " said grybauskaite .
" it will be for us to prove if it is true or not . "
last week , former cia officials directly involved or briefed on the highly classified program told us television network abc news that lithuania was the third country in europe to provide the cia with such facilities .
sources have previously named poland and romania , as well .
a potential crime dick marty , the rapporteur of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe -lrb- pace -rrb- on secret detentions , said his own sources confirmed the news report .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty has been heading the inquiry into secret cia prisons since 2005 " the time has now come for europe to account in full for its involvement in this shameful episode , " said marty after the latest allegations were disclosed .
however , this is proving to be a difficult task .
romania has repeatedly denied the allegations , while polish prosecutors are still investigating the issue .
lithuanian government officials and grybauskaite 's predecessor , valdas adamkus , have denied the abc report .
" the idea that a country was housing a site where torture was probably committed is obviously very difficult to admit , " said reed brody from the brussels office of human rights watch .
" the fact is that this is embarrassing and , in particular , it is potentially criminal , " brody told deutsche welle .
" it is illegal to torture ; it is illegal to hold people incommunicado without any rights .
this potentially exposes officials , who are involved , to criminal liability . "
though this process of accountability had begun in the us , it had yet to start in europe , he said .
the fact that investigations were dragging on , for example in poland , could have ulterior motives .
" it would appear that the governments are hoping that people will forget about it , " brody said .
" but with each new revelation , with each new batch of evidence of how people were treated and the criminality of this program , it makes it harder to sweep it under the rug . "
getting washington 's ear all three countries named were formerly part of the soviet bloc and are new members of the european union .
lithuania , together with poland , joined the eu in 2004 ; romania in 2007 .
according to brody , this history may have played a role in the matter .
" it 's obvious that the relations of the new european countries with the united states are different , " he said .
a former intelligence official involved in the program told abc that lithuania agreed to host a prison because it wanted better relations with the us .
" these are countries that , to put it bluntly , may have thought it in their interests to suck up to washington and perhaps have less wherewithal to withstand the entreaties of a criminally-minded bush administration , " brody said .
the search for the truth european commission president jose manuel barroso restated that eu member states should investigate such allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a secret facility on the outskirts of vilnius reportedly housed eight men " we have repeatedly stressed the need for member states to start or continue in-depth , independent , impartial investigations to establish the truth of such claims , " barroso said at the press conference with grybauskaite .
according to pace 's marty , it is only a matter of time until the truth surfaces .
europe 's integrity depended on it .
" i have always believed that the ' dynamic of truth ' would prevail in the face of state secrecy , " marty said .
" but european credibility is damaged by these repeated leaks of only partial truths every few weeks or months .
let us draw a line under this , once and for all , and come clean . "
according to human rights expert brody , public pressure could help in clarifying the allegations .
" europeans are shocked by the idea that in the 21st century , there are secret prisons in europe in which people are being tortured , " brody said .
" there has been a lot of outrage and hopefully that outrage will translate into truth . "

but clarifying the matter is proving to be challenging , as some officials appear to be stalling investigations . lithuania has promised to investigate the latest allegations of hosting a secret cia prison for al qaeda suspects on the outskirts of the capital vilnius , said its new president dalia grybauskaite .
the parliament of the former soviet country was already putting together a special committee to look into the case , grybauskaite told reporters during an official visit to brussels on tuesday .
however , she said she had no confirmation of the claims .
" it is regretful that my country 's name is on the list , " said grybauskaite .
" it will be for us to prove if it is true or not . "
last week , former cia officials directly involved or briefed on the highly classified program told us television network abc news that lithuania was the third country in europe to provide the cia with such facilities .
sources have previously named poland and romania , as well .
a potential crime dick marty , the rapporteur of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe -lrb- pace -rrb- on secret detentions , said his own sources confirmed the news report .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty has been heading the inquiry into secret cia prisons since 2005 " the time has now come for europe to account in full for its involvement in this shameful episode , " said marty after the latest allegations were disclosed .
however , this is proving to be a difficult task .
romania has repeatedly denied the allegations , while polish prosecutors are still investigating the issue .
lithuanian government officials and grybauskaite 's predecessor , valdas adamkus , have denied the abc report .
" the idea that a country was housing a site where torture was probably committed is obviously very difficult to admit , " said reed brody from the brussels office of human rights watch .
" the fact is that this is embarrassing and , in particular , it is potentially criminal , " brody told deutsche welle .
" it is illegal to torture ; it is illegal to hold people incommunicado without any rights .
this potentially exposes officials , who are involved , to criminal liability . "
though this process of accountability had begun in the us , it had yet to start in europe , he said .
the fact that investigations were dragging on , for example in poland , could have ulterior motives .
" it would appear that the governments are hoping that people will forget about it , " brody said .
" but with each new revelation , with each new batch of evidence of how people were treated and the criminality of this program , it makes it harder to sweep it under the rug . "
getting washington 's ear all three countries named were formerly part of the soviet bloc and are new members of the european union .
lithuania , together with poland , joined the eu in 2004 ; romania in 2007 .
according to brody , this history may have played a role in the matter .
" it 's obvious that the relations of the new european countries with the united states are different , " he said .
a former intelligence official involved in the program told abc that lithuania agreed to host a prison because it wanted better relations with the us .
" these are countries that , to put it bluntly , may have thought it in their interests to suck up to washington and perhaps have less wherewithal to withstand the entreaties of a criminally-minded bush administration , " brody said .
the search for the truth european commission president jose manuel barroso restated that eu member states should investigate such allegations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a secret facility on the outskirts of vilnius reportedly housed eight men " we have repeatedly stressed the need for member states to start or continue in-depth , independent , impartial investigations to establish the truth of such claims , " barroso said at the press conference with grybauskaite .
according to pace 's marty , it is only a matter of time until the truth surfaces .
europe 's integrity depended on it .
" i have always believed that the ' dynamic of truth ' would prevail in the face of state secrecy , " marty said .
" but european credibility is damaged by these repeated leaks of only partial truths every few weeks or months .
let us draw a line under this , once and for all , and come clean . "
according to human rights expert brody , public pressure could help in clarifying the allegations .
" europeans are shocked by the idea that in the 21st century , there are secret prisons in europe in which people are being tortured , " brody said .
" there has been a lot of outrage and hopefully that outrage will translate into truth . "

sap was found to have violated the american company 's patents . both companies specialize in business software and in 2007 the texas-based versata sued sap , saying that sap 's business suite products infringed upon its patents .

that company has sued sap for alleged industrial espionage and charges that the damage caused cost it up to one billion euros .
that case is set to be heard by a san francisco , california court next year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 27.08.2009 experts see five possible solutions to the opel drama großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel 's future remains unclear now that gm has failed to choose a buyer like a soap opera entering its 15th season , the opel saga took a twist this week when it was revealed that general motors had turned down magna 's offer for the firm .
what could happen to the automaker now ? it was less than ten months ago that chancellor angela merkel stood in the chancellery with advisors and general motors executives and said she had n't yet made up her mind on whether to extend loan guarantees to help prevent the collapse of opel .
now , merkel and her government are knee-deep in opel 's affairs , having given the company a 1.5 billion euro bridging loan in the spring before its parent company , general motors , went into bankruptcy in the us .
merkel and her economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg have been trying to broker a government-financed sale of opel to a buyer that would be willing to guarantee the lion 's share of the 25,000 opel jobs in germany .
merkel put her weight behind a consortium led by canadian auto parts maker magna .
under the deal , magna and its russian partner sberbank would each buy a 27.5-percent stake , opel employees would take 10 percent , and the remainder would be held by gm .
but gm 's board refused to accept magna 's offer last week , citing concerns about intellectual property and conditions berlin had placed on aid , among other issues .
instead , gm hopes to sign a deal with the belgium-based investment fund rhj international , which has offered to take a 50.1 percent stake in opel , leaving 39.9 percent in gm 's hands and 10 percent with opel employees .
media reports suggest that a deal with rhj would allow gm to repurchase a controlling stake in opel at a later date if the company and the auto industry recover from the current economic crisis .
delay seen as inevitable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel wanted the opel sale to be complete before september elections with the magna deal on ice , at least for now , analysts say there are several possible scenarios explaining how the opel saga might end .
most agree that a resolution is unlikely before german national elections scheduled for september 27 - a possibility chancellor merkel has admitted , herself .
" substance has to be put before speed .
and if there are still questions to clear up , then we 'll clear them up , " merkel said wednesday in an interview with n24 television network .
deutsche welle asked industry analysts what they thought about the opel soap opera , and found there are at least five possible ways the story could end .
scenario 1 : magna succeeds despite the gm board 's rejection of magna 's offer for opel , the canadian company has a significant head-start over other bidders , if only because it has been viewed as the most serious contender from the very start and has had months to develop detailed plans for the acquisition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel workers want gm to give up control , arguing it has run the company poorly " magna had done a very in-depth analysis on opel and they came up with a very strong restructuring program , " said ferdidand dudenhoeffer , who runs the center for automotive research at the university of essen .
a combined opel-magna would receive up to 4.5 billion euros worth of state and federal loan guarantees to make the merger work , which is likely to be the most generous financing option available .
german leaders have said they back magna because the company has promised not to close any of opel 's german factories .
a deal between gm and magna is still possible , said ihs global insight auto analyst tim urquhart , but only if magna is prepared to make , " very , very significant concessions " on intellectual property and control of gm brands in russia .
" magna wanted complete control over gm operations in russia , including the ability to sell and produce chevrolets , completely cutting gm out of the russian market , effectively , " urquhart said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" they want to retain full control and full ownership of their technology . "
following the gm board 's decision , urquhart said magna would have to rethink its approach to merging with opel and rated the chances of a deal with magna succeeding at about 50 percent .
scenario 2 : rhj succeeds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel has four factories in germany and the government hopes to keep all of them open as the only other bidder that stayed in the running throughout the bidding process , rhj international , which is affiliated with the ripplewood private equity fund , should be in a strong position .
but german politicians fear the company would eliminate many jobs in germany .
in an interview in july , rhj director leonard fischer said the company would slash 10,000 of opel 's 50,000 european workers in an effort to make the company more competitive .
german politicians regularly compare private equity funds to ' locusts , ' making it difficult for such a bid to receive public backing .
" there is this great enmity that exists towards private equity in germany , but it 's almost gone to the point where it 's completely illogical - any mention of it is completely inconceivable , " said urquhart .
having spurned magna 's advances just weeks before germany 's national election , gm can now strong-arm the german government into financing a deal with rhj , auto expert dudenhoeffer said .
" i think general motors has the best position in the world in the negotiation process , " he told deutsche welle .
after the election , dudenhoeffer said , gm could present the german government with the rhj bid and a warning that it risked defaulting on its1.5 billion euro bridging loan - which could lead to bankruptcy and plant closures - if it does n't receive government financing .
" they will continue to blackmail germany and they will win if the germans do not counteract , " dudenhoeffer , who supports the magna bid , said .
scenario 3 : gm holds onto opel when gm began negotiations to sell opel , the company was hemorrhaging money and seemed just weeks away from collapse .
now that the company has emerged from bankruptcy with the us government holding 60 percent of its shares and domestic sales have jumped thanks to washington 's ' cash for clunkers ' program , analysts say the attitude of gm 's management has changed .
" it 's no longer the unstable mess it once was .
it 's now got a solid footing to move forward and they seem more confident about themselves , " urquhart said .
as a result , gm may now reconsider the wisdom of losing control of a company that has nearly eight percent of the market share in europe - one of the world 's largest car markets .
the challenge for gm will be to raise the three billion euros it says it would need to revamp opel 's product line .
with germany 's contribution up in the air , gm would most likely approach the governments of spain and belgium , which are also home to opel factories , as well as britain , where gm has two vauxhall factories , to obtain funding .
gm 's new ownership status may also make the company more attractive for some private investors who were previously worried about taking on too much risk , urquhart said .
" sources of private financing might begin to open up to them now that they 're underpinned by the us government - that 's not a bad guarantor , " said urquhart , before adding that private investment alone is not likely to be sufficient in itself .
" they really do need that working capital from the germans .
three billion euros is a lot of money and they 're unlikely to get that kind of money just from private sources , " said urquhart .
scenario 4 : the dark horses ride back onto the scene bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian newspapers report that fiat may once again be considering a bid for opel one of the first companies to express interest in opel as the company 's troubles began last year was italy 's fiat , led by ceo sergio marchionne .
the company pulled out of the race to buy opel in may .
its bid was criticized by the german government and labor unions on the grounds that it would cost too many jobs and likely result in the closure of several german factories .
with the failure of magna 's attempt to take over opel , italian newspaper reports this week suggested that marchionne might be preparing another attempt to buy opel .
in doing so , according to researcher dudenheoffer , fiat could gain access to some of opel 's small-car technology , which is better-suited to the american car market than fiat 's current technology .
fiat could then use that know-how in compact models it would sell through the american car company chrysler , of which fiat recently acquired control .
" i do n't believe that is an alternative for general motors because , then , general motors would have a major competitor in its home market , chrysler , competing using gm 's own technology , " dudenhoeffer said .
other bidders could also be lurking in the wings , which could , depending on the desperation of the german government to complete the sale , quickly become serious contenders .
" there 's some talk that beijing will be back at the table , who knows ? "
urquhart said , referring to a failed bid for opel by the state-owned baic carmaker .
" it 's a crazy situation . "
scenario 5 : chaos ?
if no bidder manages to secure control of opel , and if gm fails to find the money it needs to prop up the unit , then opel 's future is hazy .
german officials have said they expect gm to repay the 1.5 billion euro bridge loan , which is expected to run out by november .
" the whole thing is a bit of a catch-22 , " urquhart said , explaining that while governments want to lend money to opel in order to secure domestic jobs , opel needs the funding to revamp its operations - a process that 's likely to shed thousands of jobs .
gm 's decision to avoid choosing a bidder right away is , in urquhart 's eyes , an attempt to wait out the fervor of german electoral politics .
after the september 27 poll , which could lead to the formation of a more business-friendly coalition between merkel 's cdu and the liberal free democrats , gm hopes the situation " calms down and then they can evaluate and there 's less of a febrile atmosphere around the negotiations , " said urquhart .
gm holds a board meeting september 8-9 and merkel said wednesday she hopes the company can finalize its decision about opel 's fate by then .

following the gm board 's decision , urquhart said magna would have to rethink its approach to merging with opel and rated the chances of a deal with magna succeeding at about 50 percent .
scenario 2 : rhj succeeds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel has four factories in germany and the government hopes to keep all of them open as the only other bidder that stayed in the running throughout the bidding process , rhj international , which is affiliated with the ripplewood private equity fund , should be in a strong position .
but german politicians fear the company would eliminate many jobs in germany .
in an interview in july , rhj director leonard fischer said the company would slash 10,000 of opel 's 50,000 european workers in an effort to make the company more competitive .
german politicians regularly compare private equity funds to ' locusts , ' making it difficult for such a bid to receive public backing .
" there is this great enmity that exists towards private equity in germany , but it 's almost gone to the point where it 's completely illogical - any mention of it is completely inconceivable , " said urquhart .
having spurned magna 's advances just weeks before germany 's national election , gm can now strong-arm the german government into financing a deal with rhj , auto expert dudenhoeffer said .
" i think general motors has the best position in the world in the negotiation process , " he told deutsche welle .
after the election , dudenhoeffer said , gm could present the german government with the rhj bid and a warning that it risked defaulting on its1.5 billion euro bridging loan - which could lead to bankruptcy and plant closures - if it does n't receive government financing .
" they will continue to blackmail germany and they will win if the germans do not counteract , " dudenhoeffer , who supports the magna bid , said .
scenario 3 : gm holds onto opel when gm began negotiations to sell opel , the company was hemorrhaging money and seemed just weeks away from collapse .
now that the company has emerged from bankruptcy with the us government holding 60 percent of its shares and domestic sales have jumped thanks to washington 's ' cash for clunkers ' program , analysts say the attitude of gm 's management has changed .
" it 's no longer the unstable mess it once was .
it 's now got a solid footing to move forward and they seem more confident about themselves , " urquhart said .
as a result , gm may now reconsider the wisdom of losing control of a company that has nearly eight percent of the market share in europe - one of the world 's largest car markets .
the challenge for gm will be to raise the three billion euros it says it would need to revamp opel 's product line .
with germany 's contribution up in the air , gm would most likely approach the governments of spain and belgium , which are also home to opel factories , as well as britain , where gm has two vauxhall factories , to obtain funding .
gm 's new ownership status may also make the company more attractive for some private investors who were previously worried about taking on too much risk , urquhart said .
" sources of private financing might begin to open up to them now that they 're underpinned by the us government - that 's not a bad guarantor , " said urquhart , before adding that private investment alone is not likely to be sufficient in itself .
" they really do need that working capital from the germans .
three billion euros is a lot of money and they 're unlikely to get that kind of money just from private sources , " said urquhart .
scenario 4 : the dark horses ride back onto the scene bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian newspapers report that fiat may once again be considering a bid for opel one of the first companies to express interest in opel as the company 's troubles began last year was italy 's fiat , led by ceo sergio marchionne .
the company pulled out of the race to buy opel in may .
its bid was criticized by the german government and labor unions on the grounds that it would cost too many jobs and likely result in the closure of several german factories .
with the failure of magna 's attempt to take over opel , italian newspaper reports this week suggested that marchionne might be preparing another attempt to buy opel .
in doing so , according to researcher dudenheoffer , fiat could gain access to some of opel 's small-car technology , which is better-suited to the american car market than fiat 's current technology .
fiat could then use that know-how in compact models it would sell through the american car company chrysler , of which fiat recently acquired control .
" i do n't believe that is an alternative for general motors because , then , general motors would have a major competitor in its home market , chrysler , competing using gm 's own technology , " dudenhoeffer said .
other bidders could also be lurking in the wings , which could , depending on the desperation of the german government to complete the sale , quickly become serious contenders .
" there 's some talk that beijing will be back at the table , who knows ? "
urquhart said , referring to a failed bid for opel by the state-owned baic carmaker .
" it 's a crazy situation . "
scenario 5 : chaos ?
if no bidder manages to secure control of opel , and if gm fails to find the money it needs to prop up the unit , then opel 's future is hazy .
german officials have said they expect gm to repay the 1.5 billion euro bridge loan , which is expected to run out by november .
" the whole thing is a bit of a catch-22 , " urquhart said , explaining that while governments want to lend money to opel in order to secure domestic jobs , opel needs the funding to revamp its operations - a process that 's likely to shed thousands of jobs .
gm 's decision to avoid choosing a bidder right away is , in urquhart 's eyes , an attempt to wait out the fervor of german electoral politics .
after the september 27 poll , which could lead to the formation of a more business-friendly coalition between merkel 's cdu and the liberal free democrats , gm hopes the situation " calms down and then they can evaluate and there 's less of a febrile atmosphere around the negotiations , " said urquhart .
gm holds a board meeting september 8-9 and merkel said wednesday she hopes the company can finalize its decision about opel 's fate by then .

now , a draft law on a general rehabilitation is set to receive the support of mps . an estimated 100,000 people were convicted as ” war traitors ” by the nazis .
some 30,000 of them were sentenced to death , and the death penalties were actually carried out in about 20,000 cases .
laws on war traitors originated in 1872 following the franco-german war and were adapted by the nazis in 1934 .
starting then , germans could be convicted of treason for making negative comments about hitler , treating pows too well , helping jews to flee , or possessing a leaflet calling for an end to the nazi dictatorship .
today , although most of the dictatorship 's victims have been fully rehabilitated , the question of how to deal with war traitors has remained a largely unresolved issue .
in 2006 , when germany 's left party began calling for a general rehabilitation of people branded as war traitors by the nazis , conservatives like norbert geis from bavaria 's christian social union were up in arms . ” back then , we did n't support endeavors to rehabilitate war traitors , " geis said .
" we were certain that evidence could be found , proving that at least some of those traitors deliberately jeopardized the lives of their comrades with their actions , and we did n't want to signal approval for such behavior . ”
concerns over actions of deserters military historian ralf-dieter mueller says that , in some cases , rehabilitation of a war traitor would be tricky .
a german soldier who defected and then told the enemy about troop locations , for example , would have deliberately endangered the lives of other soldiers .
" there 's a certain degree of underhandedness involved which would be extremely hard to justify and endorse , ” mueller said .
in the meantime , though , germany 's conservatives have given up their resistance to the idea of general rehabilitation , after extensive archival research failed to unearth evidence suggesting that deserters had ever acted in such a way .
opposition greens mp wolfgang wieland goes one step further , arguing that it 's impossible to separate " good traitors " from the bad ones by considering whether they put other people 's lives at risk .
" colonel claus von stauffenberg killed other officers with his bomb that was meant to kill hitler in his 1944 assassination plot , " wieland said .
" he knew that ' collateral damage ' would be inevitable .
nonetheless , what he did was right . "
from traitor to national hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig baumann while stauffenberg is now hailed as a national hero , many other surviving " war traitors " are still waiting to have their honor and dignity restored .
among them is ludwig baumann , head of the federal union of victims of nazi military justice .
in 2002 , the german parliament decided against granting a general rehabilitation - a decision baumann says lumps him and others like him in together with looters and people who robbed corpses .
" that 's the context we 're placed in , and it 's such a derision of war victims , " said baumann , who deserted hitler 's army in 1942 only to be captured and tortured by the nazis because he refused to reveal the name of the frenchman who helped him to flee .
the 87-year-old was rehabilitated in 2002 , but he continues to campaign for the general rehabilitation of all nazi war traitors .
parliament will vote again on the issue on september 8 , and this time , there 's every reason to assume that , with the conservatives on board , baumann will finally get the general rehabilitation he longs for .

now , a draft law on a general rehabilitation is set to receive the support of mps . an estimated 100,000 people were convicted as ” war traitors ” by the nazis .
some 30,000 of them were sentenced to death , and the death penalties were actually carried out in about 20,000 cases .
laws on war traitors originated in 1872 following the franco-german war and were adapted by the nazis in 1934 .
starting then , germans could be convicted of treason for making negative comments about hitler , treating pows too well , helping jews to flee , or possessing a leaflet calling for an end to the nazi dictatorship .
today , although most of the dictatorship 's victims have been fully rehabilitated , the question of how to deal with war traitors has remained a largely unresolved issue .
in 2006 , when germany 's left party began calling for a general rehabilitation of people branded as war traitors by the nazis , conservatives like norbert geis from bavaria 's christian social union were up in arms . ” back then , we did n't support endeavors to rehabilitate war traitors , " geis said .
" we were certain that evidence could be found , proving that at least some of those traitors deliberately jeopardized the lives of their comrades with their actions , and we did n't want to signal approval for such behavior . ”
concerns over actions of deserters military historian ralf-dieter mueller says that , in some cases , rehabilitation of a war traitor would be tricky .
a german soldier who defected and then told the enemy about troop locations , for example , would have deliberately endangered the lives of other soldiers .
" there 's a certain degree of underhandedness involved which would be extremely hard to justify and endorse , ” mueller said .
in the meantime , though , germany 's conservatives have given up their resistance to the idea of general rehabilitation , after extensive archival research failed to unearth evidence suggesting that deserters had ever acted in such a way .
opposition greens mp wolfgang wieland goes one step further , arguing that it 's impossible to separate " good traitors " from the bad ones by considering whether they put other people 's lives at risk .
" colonel claus von stauffenberg killed other officers with his bomb that was meant to kill hitler in his 1944 assassination plot , " wieland said .
" he knew that ' collateral damage ' would be inevitable .
nonetheless , what he did was right . "

" ducks versus chickens " is the title of a new comic book published by the npd , designed to convert disaffected young people to its racist right-wing cause .
the comic , whose first edition runs 30,000 copies , is to be distributed free of charge , and represents " the first in a series of political comics , " an npd statement said .
structured as an allegorical fable with a strong , overarching moral , the story , told in rhyming couplets , revolves around a peaceful community of ducks who live in a colorful , bucolic paradise , " in a free land , far from our times . "
the ducks live there happily , sharing their food in a primitive socialist community .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd is using increasingly revolutionary rhetoric to gain supporters the comic then shows how this harmonious duck-land is invaded by an influx of chicken guests , who complain that an " evil fox " has driven them there .
with their higher fertility rate , the chickens quickly multiply and dominate duck-land .
the chickens also tempt the good , happy ducks into materialism , drug abuse , criminality and homosexuality , causing a general decay in duck society .
borrowing from nazi propaganda in the far-right comic book , the chickens are seen taking over neighboring lands from the native geese and swans and enslaving the inhabitants of these other poultry-based countries , who occasionally die as martyrs if they resist .
the final message is then unequivocally aggressive , exhorting its readers to fight the immigrants , shut borders to newcomers , and " do n't follow foreign birds . "
with its provocative , anti-immigrant message and eye-catching , populist aesthetic , the comic 's style owes much to the nazi propaganda of the late 1920s and early 1930s , which often used animal metaphors to portray foreigners as the root of social ills .
nazi mythology also frequently imagined a pre-capitalist idyll of pure , simple communities .
the book also borrows from the lilting , rhyming style of german children 's storiese , clearly aiming to seduce young readers .

some wonder whether we need another climate conference .
others say you can ’ t have enough of them . the term " world climate conference " causes most people to think of the top-level discussion rounds taking place around the world under the auspices of the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- to try to broker a post-kyoto climate plan .
given all the media hype surrounding " copenhagen 2009 , " the mistake is forgivable . in fact the first two " world climate conferences " organized by the world meteorological organization -lrb- wmo -rrb- , were held in 1979 and 1990 and played an important role in the creation of the un climate secretariat , and in putting the subject of climate change onto the political , scientific and public agenda .
that 's history now , but the conference organizers do not feel their event has become redundant . just three months ahead of the key unfccc conference in copenhagen , world climate conference 3 sees itself not as a rival or duplicate event , but an important complement and a bridge between climate issues at the international politics level and everyday life . while negotiators the meeting in copenhagen will try to haggle out the legal details and binding targets , the organizers of wcc say they want to take a practical approach , getting information on the effects of a changing climate across to the ordinary man or woman on the street - or in the fields , as the case may be . " better climate information for a better future " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adapting agriculture to changing weather will be part of the discussion dr jose romero from the swiss federal office for the environment is chairman of the conference 's high-level subcommittee .
in his view , the conference will help to establish a " global framework for climate services , " practical assistance in adapting to a changing world . water , energy , agriculture , town planning - according to romero , there is virtually no sector that does not stand to benefit from " better climate information for a better future , " the motto of wcc-3 .
the meteorological services and environmental protection agencies around the world already have a wealth of climate data , and the capacity to provide good forecasts on different time scales . the ambition of the conference , he said , " is to put all this knowledge into a global network and provide practical information and tools at a very local level , for the users . " data on current trends and forecasts of likely changes both for a current season and for coming months , years , or decades , are essential to help people affected by changing weather patterns .
agriculture and food security are prime examples on the conference agenda .
preparation for dry periods , the use of different seeds , and the choice of different crops are all classical adaptation methods .
but getting the message across to the farmers who need it at the right time is another matter . the organizers say establishing a global network is one of the main aims of wcc-3 .
this would include the high-tech options available to the industrialized world , but also media such as radio to pass on locally relevant information in the developing world , for instance weather warnings , drought information or news of insect plagues that could endanger the harvest . turning data into action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say more sets of talks are good for the planet it 's easy to be skeptical towards the idea of " yet another climate conference . "
but the one thousand participants heading for geneva this weekend clearly share the organizers ' view that this conference has its place in the mosaic of climate events taking place every day in some part of the world . many organizations involved with climate issues confirm the organizers ' view of the geneva event as an important complement to the unfccc negotiations , including professor gerd tetzlaff , meteorologist at the university of leipzig and the chief scientific advisor to the german disaster prevention agency dkkv . in his view , wcc-3 plays a key role " because it 's virtually the first time the climate experts will be meeting in a framework like this to discuss how you actually reach the relevant responsible parties to draw practical conclusions from the results of climate forecasts . " dr. walter amman is president of the global risk forum , an international organization based in davos in switzerland .
he will be among the participants at what he also sees as a key event in the climate change debate .
in his opinion , you can not have enough discussions on climate issues at the moment - discussions he hopes will result in action . " every effort currently being undertaken is very valuable with a view to turning a global movement into the practical implementation of preventive measures and climate adaptation programs , " he said . author : irene quaile editor : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 27.08.2009 artists see eu light bulb ban as an aesthetic calamity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leds and other alternatives to traditional light bulbs just are n't the same , say artists on sept .
1 , the eu ban on old-fashioned light bulbs goes into effect .
but artists and museum owners say energy-saving lamps will completely change the way art is viewed and created - for the worse . peter orth likes to surround himself with art .
that 's why he converted his quaint two-storey home into a museum .
every room , including the garden and courtyard , is adorned with his collection of art works , ranging from stained glass windows and ornate chairs , to sculptures and paintings . orth says his entire collection would lack half its lustre if it were n't for one thing : the light bulb .
throughout the museum , he has set miniature light bulbs into the ceiling to highlight specific aspects of the paintings or sculptures . lighting art and light as art bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : light changes the way works of art are perceived , says orth " without the light bulb , the painting still has its colors , but it is overshadowed by the gray tones from the rest of the room , " said orth .
" the lights help to bring out certain elements in a painting as intended by the artist or the gallery designer . " some of the exhibits in the orth house museum are inherently dependent on the display of light bulbs .
inspired by his travels across the world on a sail boat years ago , orth has converted one of the basement rooms into a nautical sky scene , with light bulbs built into the ceiling to represent constellations of stars . other works consist mainly of light , like the sculptures lit from within by miniature bulbs . " most of these lights have been designed specifically for the art work .
i can not find a suitable energy-saving lamp to fit those requirements , " said orth .
" changing the system would mean major structural changes , including tearing down walls , which again requires so much expenditure .
then where 's the energy savings ? " barriers to artistic creativity photographer marcel panne is also concerned about the upcoming light bulb ban .
he works with the cologne-based artists ' collective lichtfaktor , which uses various light sources to produce photos and videos of cities by night .
their work involves " painting " with light using long-term exposure . while lichtfaktor mostly works with led lights and battery-operated flashlights or bicycle lights , panne says he ca n't visualize his work without the good old-fashioned light bulb . " as light painters , we need a huge range of different qualities of light , " he said .
" sometimes we need the cold quality of a led or neon light , but sometimes we need a warm light , which only the light bulb can provide .
this light ca n't be simulated . " while incandescent light bulbs bring out the entire spectrum of light , the energy-saving lamps have higher components of blue and white , which can make the light appear more artificial . bildunterschrift : lichtfaktor works with a wide variety of light sources shedding light on the future for those who are n't willing to alter the appearance of their artwork , the only option is to to stock up on the old-fashioned bulbs .
several museums have already started doing that , such as the museum ludwig in cologne . " it may even be a lucrative business option for some people in the future , to buy large stocks of light-bulbs from elsewhere and sell them to those who need them , " said panne . since the eu , despite all the protests , is going through with the sept .
1 ban , efforts are now on to find a suitable energy-efficient substitute for the light bulb that has the same quality of light .
but this will be an uphill task , as " energy-saving lights will just not function in a museum , " according to orth .
" even halogen lights have limited use in displaying art . " it will be up to the creative people to find solutions in the future , says michael gaertner from the central association for european design culture or zvedk . " for the existing classics in designer lamps that have been produced in the last century using the incandescent light bulb , this ban is an aesthetic calamity , " he said . need for new technology the european union , however , contends that there are suitable options and alternative technologies available for museum owners , artists and photographers . " improved incandescent bulbs with halogen technology provide exactly the same type and quality of light as conventional incandescent light bulbs or conventional halogens , " said ferran tarradellas espuny , eu spokesperson for energy .
" they come in the same shapes and appearances , and fit into all existing luminaries . " he added that while these alternatives currently cost more than conventional lamps , their prices would drop once mass production gets underway . still , gaernter says that " not all interests were represented " when the eu passed the light bulb regulation .
at the same time , he feels that a reform in light technology could have a positive effect by making designers conscious about saving energy , too . the zvedk is working together with industry and the eu to find suitable alternatives that will strike the right balance between energy efficiency and aesthetics . bildunterschrift : the old light bulbs will be phased out gradually in the eu author : pia chandavarkar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany ’ s international broadcaster signs cooperation agreements with mexican broadcasters . “ deutsche welle would like to strengthen its ties with latin america through its tv programming in spanish .
mexico is a central partner in the region for germany .
producing shows together can foster dialogue between the two countries , ” said erik bettermann , deutsche welle director general , in guadalajara -lrb- mexico -rrb- during a talk show produced jointly by dw-tv and mexico ’ s public broadcaster , sjrtv .
the co-production will be broadcast today -lrb- thursday -rrb- on dw-tv latinoamérica .
the program will feature bettermann discussing the challenges and role of journalism in the 21st century alongside diego petersen farah , the head of the magazine “ público-milenio ” from guadalajara , and the cultural journalist yolanda zamora puente .
according to bettermann , the internet and “ infotainment ” have brought about a radical shift in worldwide media usage .
he added that the rapidly increasing amount of information available has caused media outlets to compete more for attention .
“ publicly-funded media ventures must present themselves as ‘ trusted guides ’ in the disorienting new media landscape , ” said bettermann , who also described the dual system of public broadcasting and private media as a central pillar of democracy in germany .
currently , mexico is engaged in intense discussions about the reorganization of its media system .
the television landscape is dominated by private stations , which are owned by just two media companies .
this fact has drawn increasing criticism from politicians and from the public at large .
public broadcasters in mexico are currently attempting to modernize , while achieving greater independence and strengthening ties with the international community .
given these developments , deutsche welle has increased its level of cooperation with mexican media outlets .
bettermann signed a declaration of intent with the mexican educational channel dgtve on august 24 , 2009 in order to make significant cooperation possible between deutsche welle and dgtve .
spanish programming from the deutsche welle will be broadcast in the future over dgtve ’ s edusat network , which reaches more than four million students and 33,000 schools and cultural centers .
just a few months ago , dw-tv and canal judicial , a station associated with mexico ’ s highest court , co-produced a program on the fight against corruption .
since 2008 , the mexican station has been broadcasting dw-tv ’ s spanish language programming . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? dw-tv europe live quadriga - der internationale talk we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

this means that when readers open a freshly altered entry they will be given the choice of looking at the old and the new version , but will be made aware that the latter is awaiting review by an official editor . shutting out vandals wikipedia spokesman jay walsh told the afp news agency that the time delay between flagging and editor viewing could itself act as a deterrent to vandals seeking to malign and defame high-profile public figures . bildunterschrift : graffiti is as much an online as a real world problem " basic factors suggest that most people who have ill intent are looking for rapid satisfaction , " walsh said .
" they come in and they want to be jerks ; just like vandalism or graffiti in the real world .
the new feature removes that immediacy . " walsh said volunteers are currently putting the software through its paces before it becomes an official part of the english-language wikipedia profile . yet for all its newness to articles in english , the german language site has been test-driving the software for the past year . raimond spekking , software developer for the online encyclopaedia said wikipedia deutschland introduced the feature to satisfy the demands of the german-language readership . " we did n't want visitors to the site to be reading vandalized articles , " spekking told deutsche welle .
" we wanted to show them they were protected . " keeping it clean bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german language editors have their work cut out for them and the german-speaking wiki community responded to the outcome well .
" we ran a survey after the introduction and more than two thirds of people said they wanted us to continue with it . " so continue they have .
there are currently almost 7,500 editors working on the reviewing process , and although it is voluntary work , becoming a member of the team requires a certain amount of commitment . " users who make at least 300 edits in 60 days automatically qualify to become editors , " spekking explained .
" or if they can not manage that , they can make an application and do just 200 edits in 60 days . " and unlike the proposed changes to articles in english , the german site does not restrict the business of flagging and reviewing to entries about living people , but applies it across the board . the idea there is not only to minimize the risk of potential damage to big names but to lessen the likelihood that obscenities or falsehoods of any description make their way to the public under the wikipedia name . but opponents to the planned new editing feature say that very name has another responsibility , and that is to remain true to its democratic roots . wikipedia still open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barack obama 's wikipedia article is currently " locked " spekking said such criticism was rife among german-speaking users around the time wikipedia deutschland launched its revision software , but he says there really is nothing to get worked up about . " articles can still be edited by anybody , " he said , adding that the practice actually means it is possible to ' unlock ' pages which have been closed to edits from the public on the grounds that they are at particularly high risk of vandalism . and from this point of view , proponents argue , the proposed changes actually open the site further .
" people have a perception that wikipedia is straight forward , it 's open and belongs to everyone , " said jay walsh .

there are as many references to his drinking and his womanising as to his political successes .
in the guardian joyce carol oates says kennedy " genuinely refashioned himself as a serious , idealistic , tirelessly energetic liberal democrat " .
but the daily mail describes kennedy as the " senator of sleaze " , an unprincipled drunk , and a sexual bully .
' downright cruel treatment ' healthcare in the uk is the lead for the daily telegraph .
it highlights a report which suggests a million nhs patients have been victims of " neglectful , demeaning , and sometimes downright cruel treatment " .
by contrast , the daily express leads on research which it is claimed could wipe out crippling diseases passed on from parent to child .
the daily mail pictures monkeys created from three parents to stop the spread of incurable inherited conditions .
' swollen ' salaries the times leads with the revelation that just 150 votes were cast by afghans in one of the areas that has claimed many british lives .
" four british soldiers die for the sake of 150 votes , " runs the headline .
the financial times reports that the head of britain 's financial watchdog backs the idea of taxes on banks as a way to curb the bonus culture .
the paper reports him as warning that a " swollen " financial sector paying huge salaries has grown too big for society .
big brother evicted most papers cover the decision by channel 4 to scrap big brother , and few can resist the temptation of saying that the programme has been evicted .

ayatollah ali khamenei 's comments contradict accusations which have frequently been made by hardliners .
a number of senior opposition figures are currently on trial in tehran accused of conspiring with foreign powers to organise unrest .
but the ayatollah appears to be trying to reduce tensions , say correspondents .
" i do not accuse the leaders of the recent incidents to be subordinate to the foreigners , like the united states and britain , since this issue has not been proven for me , " said ayatollah khamenei , in a statement read out on iranian television .
but he said there was " no doubt " the mass demonstrations , in which at least 30 people died , had been planned in advance , " whether its leaders know or not " .
" this plot was defeated , since fortunately our enemies still do not understand the issue in iran , " he said .
" our enemies were given a slap in the face by the iranian nation , but they are still hopeful and they are pursuing the issue . "
' suspicions and rumours ' opposition leaders say dozens of people were killed and hundreds arrested during the protests after mahmoud ahmadinejad was declared the winner of the presidential election .
iran unrest 12 june presidential election saw incumbent mahmoud ahmadinejad re-elected with 63 % of vote main challenger mir hossein mousavi called for result to be annulled , alleging poll fraud mass street protests saw at least 30 people killed and foreign media restricted profile : mahmoud ahmadinejad q & a : election aftermath trials are taking place of some of those allegedly involved in the unrest , but they have been dismissed by critics as show trials .
hardliners are calling for the arrest of the two leading opposition candidates in the election - mir hossein mousavi and mehdi karroubi - as well as former president akbar rafsanjani .
they accuse mr rafsanjani of being part of a plan by the us and britain to destabilise iran .
but ayatollah khamenei said : " one can not move based on suspicions and rumours in issues with such high importance .
" everyone can be sure that crimes will not be tolerated , but in such important issues the judiciary should judge based on strong reasons and evidence . "
a senior cleric , grand ayatollah hossein ali montazeri , has attacked the actions of iran 's ruling elite .
" the biggest oppression ... is despotic treatment of the people in the name of islam , " said ayatollah montazeri in a statement posted on his website .
" i hope the responsible authorities give up the deviant path they are pursuing and restore the trampled rights of the people . "
the bbc 's kasra naji says ayatollah khamenei appears to be seeking to restrain his followers .
there are indications that the trials - in which some of the accused have allegedly confessed to being part of a foreign-instigated plot - are pushing iran into more uncertainty , our correspondent adds .

ayatollah ali khamenei 's comments contradict accusations which have frequently been made by hardliners .
a number of senior opposition figures are currently on trial in tehran accused of conspiring with foreign powers to organise unrest .
but the ayatollah appears to be trying to reduce tensions , say correspondents .
" i do not accuse the leaders of the recent incidents to be subordinate to the foreigners , like the united states and britain , since this issue has not been proven for me , " said ayatollah khamenei , in a statement read out on iranian television .
but he said there was " no doubt " the mass demonstrations , in which at least 30 people died , had been planned in advance , " whether its leaders know or not " .
" this plot was defeated , since fortunately our enemies still do not understand the issue in iran , " he said .
" our enemies were given a slap in the face by the iranian nation , but they are still hopeful and they are pursuing the issue . "
' suspicions and rumours ' opposition leaders say dozens of people were killed and hundreds arrested during the protests after mahmoud ahmadinejad was declared the winner of the presidential election .
iran unrest 12 june presidential election saw incumbent mahmoud ahmadinejad re-elected with 63 % of vote main challenger mir hossein mousavi called for result to be annulled , alleging poll fraud mass street protests saw at least 30 people killed and foreign media restricted profile : mahmoud ahmadinejad q & a : election aftermath trials are taking place of some of those allegedly involved in the unrest , but they have been dismissed by critics as show trials .
hardliners are calling for the arrest of the two leading opposition candidates in the election - mir hossein mousavi and mehdi karroubi - as well as former president akbar rafsanjani .
they accuse mr rafsanjani of being part of a plan by the us and britain to destabilise iran .
but ayatollah khamenei said : " one can not move based on suspicions and rumours in issues with such high importance .
" everyone can be sure that crimes will not be tolerated , but in such important issues the judiciary should judge based on strong reasons and evidence . "
a senior cleric , grand ayatollah hossein ali montazeri , has attacked the actions of iran 's ruling elite .
" the biggest oppression ... is despotic treatment of the people in the name of islam , " said ayatollah montazeri in a statement posted on his website .
" i hope the responsible authorities give up the deviant path they are pursuing and restore the trampled rights of the people . "
the bbc 's kasra naji says ayatollah khamenei appears to be seeking to restrain his followers .
there are indications that the trials - in which some of the accused have allegedly confessed to being part of a foreign-instigated plot - are pushing iran into more uncertainty , our correspondent adds .

but the 33-year-old funnyman is glad he did .
not only did he get virgin trains to change its rules but he also turned the experience into a fringe show which has been nominated for the edinburgh comedy awards .
last october , the comedian was travelling from manchester to london when a " jobsworth " attendant reduced a 75-year-old woman to tears because she was on the wrong train .
her pre-booked ticket was for a train 30 minutes later but her travel itinerary , printed by station staff , mistakenly gave the wrong time .
she was told to pay £ 115 for a new ticket , 10 times her original fare , because she was not allowed to buy an off-peak ticket once she had boarded the train .
sheer brutality " something about this situation made me act at the time , " the comedian said .
" i think it was the sheer brutality of it .
the sheer heartlessness of what the ticket collector did .
" it would have been so easy for him to walk away .
it was absolutely grotesque . "
with the woman reduced to tears , wrigglesworth arranged a whip-round among the other passengers .
he was then accused of begging and questioned by the police when he arrived in london .
after the incident , wrigglesworth took on virgin trains and got it to change its policy on buying off-peak tickets on the train , although other operators maintain the same restrictions .
a practice the comedian described as " extortion " .
the sheffield-born comedian turned the whole experience into an edinburgh show called open return letter to richard branson . "
i ca n't imagine i am going to turn into mark thomas overnight , but who knows ? "
tom wrigglesworth his performance has earned him a comedy awards nomination , yet he admits he almost did not intervene .
" when it actually happened , i nearly did n't do anything , " he said .
" i thought she 's just an old woman why should i even bother ?
" it was on a knife-edge whether i even did anything about it . "
he added : " i was extremely angry at the time of the incident and that quickly turned into farce as he threatened to get me arrested for begging .
" it all just got a bit out of hand and it was only about 20 minutes after it happened that i realised , ' this is hilarious ' . "
wrigglesworth said he had never been an " activist " and he did not think his comedy would continue to be about campaigning .
" i ca n't imagine i am going to turn into mark thomas overnight , but who knows ? , " he said .

but the 33-year-old funnyman is glad he did .
not only did he get virgin trains to change its rules but he also turned the experience into a fringe show which has been nominated for the edinburgh comedy awards .
last october , the comedian was travelling from manchester to london when a " jobsworth " attendant reduced a 75-year-old woman to tears because she was on the wrong train .
her pre-booked ticket was for a train 30 minutes later but her travel itinerary , printed by station staff , mistakenly gave the wrong time .
she was told to pay £ 115 for a new ticket , 10 times her original fare , because she was not allowed to buy an off-peak ticket once she had boarded the train .
sheer brutality " something about this situation made me act at the time , " the comedian said .
" i think it was the sheer brutality of it .
the sheer heartlessness of what the ticket collector did .
" it would have been so easy for him to walk away .
it was absolutely grotesque . "
with the woman reduced to tears , wrigglesworth arranged a whip-round among the other passengers .
he was then accused of begging and questioned by the police when he arrived in london .
after the incident , wrigglesworth took on virgin trains and got it to change its policy on buying off-peak tickets on the train , although other operators maintain the same restrictions .
a practice the comedian described as " extortion " .
the sheffield-born comedian turned the whole experience into an edinburgh show called open return letter to richard branson .
i ca n't imagine i am going to turn into mark thomas overnight , but who knows ?
tom wrigglesworth his performance has earned him a comedy awards nomination , yet he admits he almost did not intervene .
" when it actually happened , i nearly did n't do anything , " he said .
" i thought she 's just an old woman why should i even bother ?
" it was on a knife-edge whether i even did anything about it . "
he added : " i was extremely angry at the time of the incident and that quickly turned into farce as he threatened to get me arrested for begging .
" it all just got a bit out of hand and it was only about 20 minutes after it happened that i realised , ' this is hilarious ' . "
wrigglesworth said he had never been an " activist " and he did not think his comedy would continue to be about campaigning .
" i ca n't imagine i am going to turn into mark thomas overnight , but who knows ? , " he said .

some shoppers are bulk buying conventional 100 watt light bulbs before they are phased out , some independent retailers have claimed .
many traditional bulbs will not be available under european law from 1 september to be replaced by energy-saving bulbs .
and some stores say many of their older customers are buying up to 50 old-style bulbs at a time .
but some of the bigger chain stores say the demand for the new bulbs was high .
one electrical shop manager from cardiff said the old-style bulbs were flying off the shelves .
lesley urrutia , who has run pilton electrical in cardiff for 25 years , said she normally sold around 10 light bulbs a day but was currently selling more than 80 a day .
she said : " elderly customers seem to be the most worried because they do n't like the new energy saving light bulbs . "
i 've bought a pack of 20 of the old proper ones - they should last me a few years yet " bronwen jones , 67 " they are panic buying because they have heard they wo n't be able to get traditional light bulbs any more .
i 've checked with my supplier and that is n't the case .
" they will stop manufacturing them but will continue to supply me from their huge stockpile of light bulbs .
they will run out eventually but customers are trying to get their hands on as many as possible now . "
many supermarkets and chain stores have already phased the old bulbs out before the new legislation comes in .
but corner shops and specialist electrical stores are continuing to sell the old-style bulbs until stocks run out .
it is hoped the new bulbs will lower household energy bills and reduce carbon dioxide levels .
bronwen jones , 67 , of merthyr tydfil , said she did not like the new bulbs because they " gave off a different light " .
" i 've bought a pack of 20 of the old proper ones - they should last me a few years yet , " she said .
' full of mercury ' all types of opaque " incandescent " bulbs will be phased out from tuesday while clear 100 watt bulbs will also start disappearing .
stores are allowed to sell off existing stocks after that but importing more of the old-style bulbs will be punishable by a fine or prosecution .
nigel farage mep , leader of the uk independence party , said the idea of banning incandescent bulbs went back to a heads of european union meeting a couple of years ago .
he said : " we 're getting rid of good light bulbs that give us good light from which we can read to be replaced by these new ones which really are n't terribly good .
" they are full of mercury which will give us all sorts of problems when it comes to disposing of millions or billions of them at the end of their life . "
but donnachadh mccarthy , founder of national carbon footprint day , said the new bulbs were as good as the old-style ones and would save people money .
" the reason why people say they 're rubbish is , just like the incandescent bulbs come in different sizes , so do energy-saving bulbs , " he said .
" people often think they come in one size and they put in the wrong size bulbs and they think it 's not producing the same light but the problem is they 've got the wrong bulbs . "
some stores said they had seen demand increasing for the new light bulbs , with customers happy to switch from incandescent bulbs .
a b & q spokesperson said the chain had seen " a significant uplift in demand for energy efficient lighting in store , and from september we are doubling our range of low energy light bulbs to keep up with the growing demand " .
a tesco spokesperson said its customers had been moving towards energy saving light bulbs , helped by promotions in its stores .

lesley urrutia , who has run pilton electrical in cardiff for 25 years , said she normally sold around 10 light bulbs a day but was currently selling more than 80 a day .
she said : " elderly customers seem to be the most worried because they do n't like the new energy saving light bulbs .
i 've bought a pack of 20 of the old proper ones - they should last me a few years yet bronwen jones , 67 " they are panic buying because they have heard they wo n't be able to get traditional light bulbs any more .
i 've checked with my supplier and that is n't the case .
" they will stop manufacturing them but will continue to supply me from their huge stockpile of light bulbs .
they will run out eventually but customers are trying to get their hands on as many as possible now . "
many supermarkets and chain stores have already phased the old bulbs out before the new legislation comes in .
but corner shops and specialist electrical stores are continuing to sell the old-style bulbs until stocks run out .
it is hoped the new bulbs will lower household energy bills and reduce carbon dioxide levels .
bronwen jones , 67 , of merthyr tydfil , said she did not like the new bulbs because they " gave off a different light " .
" i 've bought a pack of 20 of the old proper ones - they should last me a few years yet , " she said .
' full of mercury ' all types of opaque " incandescent " bulbs will be phased out from tuesday while clear 100 watt bulbs will also start disappearing .
stores are allowed to sell off existing stocks after that but importing more of the old-style bulbs will be punishable by a fine or prosecution .
nigel farage mep , leader of the uk independence party , said the idea of banning incandescent bulbs went back to a heads of european union meeting a couple of years ago .
he said : " we 're getting rid of good light bulbs that give us good light from which we can read to be replaced by these new ones which really are n't terribly good .
" they are full of mercury which will give us all sorts of problems when it comes to disposing of millions or billions of them at the end of their life . "
but donnachadh mccarthy , founder of national carbon footprint day , said the new bulbs were as good as the old-style ones and would save people money .
" the reason why people say they 're rubbish is , just like the incandescent bulbs come in different sizes , so do energy-saving bulbs , " he said .
" people often think they come in one size and they put in the wrong size bulbs and they think it 's not producing the same light but the problem is they 've got the wrong bulbs . "
some stores said they had seen demand increasing for the new light bulbs , with customers happy to switch from incandescent bulbs .
a b & q spokesperson said the chain had seen " a significant uplift in demand for energy efficient lighting in store , and from september we are doubling our range of low energy light bulbs to keep up with the growing demand " .
a tesco spokesperson said its customers had been moving towards energy saving light bulbs , helped by promotions in its stores .
