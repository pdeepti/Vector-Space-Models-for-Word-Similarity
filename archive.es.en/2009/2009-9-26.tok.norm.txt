the move comes as the us has said it wants to engage diplomatically with the country ’ s regime . washington 's new policy towards burma will include more direct and deeper engagement with the junta .
us secretary of state hillary clinton made the announcement on the sidelines of the united nations general assembly in new york this week .
however , she insisted that sanctions against the regime would remain an important part of us policy .
" engagement versus sanctions is a false choice in our opinion .
going forward , we will be employing both of those tools , pursuing our same goal .
to help achieve democratic reform we will be engaging directly with burmese authorities . "
clinton also said that the change in policy did not mean there would be any compromise on the demands for credible democratic reform and the unconditional release of all political prisoners , including pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi .
there have been mixed reactions to clinton 's announcement .
some activists doubt whether it will really help to bring about change in the country , which has been in the tight grip of the junta for decades .
sonny aung than oo from the germany-based ngo burma bureau is skeptical : " until now the regime has not cared about any of the un 's demands or those of the international community .
they do n't care .
they keep going their own way .
they have killed monks in the past and many people are political prisoners . "
but other observers think the new policy might have some positive effects in view of the fact that economic sanctions and aid restrictions imposed by western governments in the past have failed to persuade the junta to introduce democratic reforms .
failed sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sanctions have not improved the situation in burma robert templer of the international crisis group in new york explains that the sanction regime did n't really work : " the sanctions were never universally applied .
china did n't apply them , india did n't apply them .
none of the neighboring states have any sanctions on myanmar -lrb- the official name given to burma by its military rulers -rrb- .
so , myanmar 's economy has been hurt to some degree but it has been hurt by its own policies more than by the western sanctions . "
there was first talk about a possible shift in policy towards burma after us senator jim webb , an ardent advocate for easing the sanctions , travelled there last month .
he secured the release of john yettaw , an american who had been jailed for swimming to suu kyi 's house .
webb met the detained pro-democracy leader during his trip , as well as top generals .
for the international crisis group 's templer , washington 's latest change in course is a sign of pragmatism : " for the past nearly 20 years , they have not had high-level contacts with the regime and that lack of contact has really created a diplomatic vacuum , which is very much filled by china , " he says .
" so , even if the us does n't like the government there and does n't regard it as democratic , it does feel the need to discuss a variety of issues with it and to try to find some common ground and some avenues for progress as it has been a very static situation for a long time . "
less paranoia templer added that although it might be a slow process , any contact that the junta had with the outside world was likely to persuade it to introduce reforms eventually .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition leader aung san suu kyi supports the policy shift " it will make them more confident and less paranoid , " he said .
" it will make them more aware of the possibilities of re-engaging with the international community .
engagement tends to have a better record in promoting transformation than isolation . "
aung san suu kyi , for her part , has welcomed the us 's announcement of a policy shift .
according to her lawyer nyan win , she said washington 's direct engagement with burma would be welcome as long as there were talks with the government , but also the opposition .

that spot stays with hamburg sv for the fourth straight week . after hamburg 's draw against frankfurt last week and bayern 's third straight league win over nuremberg left just three points between the two sides , bayern was in a good position to close the gap on hamburg coming into saturday 's match .
hamburg had the advantage of home turf , but were coming off a loss on penalty kicks earlier in the week in the german cup .
bayern , on the other hand , was fresh of a 5-0 german cup drubbing of rw oberhausen and was hungry for a glimpse from the top of the league .
there was no clear favorite for most of the game and the equally matched squads appeared to be headed for a draw until hamburg 's mladen petric scored the winning goal in the 72nd minute to tip the game 1-0 to hamburg .
bayern coach louis van gaal acknowledged that hamburg had earned the victory .
" it was a great game .
we had several chances but we did n't take them .
that was the problem - and hamburg are a top side .
the side that gets the goal wins it , " he said .
the loss drops bayern munich to sixth in the league , and they trail hamburg by six points .

in cologne 's german cup match during the week , a 3-2 victory over defending bundesliga champs wolfsburg was a glimmer of hope for the team in what has been an otherwise dismal season .
despite holding leverkusen goalless for nearly the entire game , leverkusen 's simon rolfes slipped one into the net in the 82nd minute to put an end to cologne 's short-lived success .
leverkusen are second in the bundesliga to hamburg on goal difference , while cologne continues to languish in second to last place .

the game 's only goal came from peruvian striker jefferson farfan in the 31st minute .
the highest scoring match of the day was a 4-2 win for vfl wolfsburg against hanover .
last year 's bundesliga champs used four different scorers to dispatch hanover .

but for musicians aiming to be stars , they 're the key to a successful career .
dw follows young hopefuls as they brave the jury that could decide their future . johannes brahms ' father , in his time the foremost double bassist in hamburg , is said to have pointed out that a correct note on his instrument is a crapshoot - at best .
that rings true if you listen to bass players struggle , but one could ask why that is .
after all , they have so much more space to hit the right note - inches more , seemingly - than violinists .
one person who gave an answer to the question is a first-round participant at the ard international music competition , which wrapped up recently in munich .
" we do n't have more space for the right note .
the right note is just as precise a point on the fingerboard as on the violin , " said 19-year-old ha-young jung , who was born and raised in seoul and is now based in london .
she was one of the 40 bassists who were accepted and made the trip to munich for the ard competition .

" i think competitions are very good because we have to play and prepare for so many pieces in such a short period , " she said .
she said she thought focusing on competitions too much , however , could be limiting .
" it can get a little bit tense when you think about how to play without making mistakes or that one needs to be perfect all the time . "
she tries not to worry about what judges think too much .
" at the end of the day , music is so personal that i ca n't possibly know what it is the jury really likes .
so i do what i like . "
then , with a glance at her regular russian pianist , who fulfils a role somewhere between ersatz -mother and drillmaster , she quipped , " or what my accompanist wants . "
the bass as solo instrument bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bassists were once mostly men ; that is changing ten or fifteen years ago , women playing the double bass were still a rare sight .
that is changing now , but jung still gets funny looks - not necessarily because she 's a woman playing the double bass , but because she is , or wants to be , a solo bass player .
" many people do n't consider the bass a solo instrument , " she pointed out .
" its register is low , its sound difficult to project when you play with an orchestra .
but i think it depends on how a player brings out the qualities of the instrument , rather than on the instrument itself . "
she would n't want to limit herself to just solo bass , however .
" i love playing chamber music , i love playing with chamber orchestras … i just love playing bass , really . "
expanding the repertoire playing in an orchestra , while enjoyable , is also challenging .
" when i play in an orchestra for a few days , i get very , very ill , because i just give everything , " she said .
but then she waxed philosophical .
" there 's something about the very big picture that 's part of playing in an orchestra and i enjoy it very much - and some aspects are even more demanding than playing solo . "

" but bottesini is one of the few composers who really tried to expand the repertoire and i think he 's very musical , very much fun to play , and fun to listen to . "
still , she did n't advance in the competition .
following her disappointment and departure from munich , jung was upbeat again .
she was looking forward to a recital at wigmore hall in london with famous violinist sarah chang .
weight matters before she left , there was question one question she still had to answer : did she ever feel stuck with the double bass and so little music to be grateful for ? " well , there are many ways to look at this .

but the use of subtitles to address a german audience so close to sunday 's general election appeared calculated to provoke public unease . germany has 4,200 troops in afghanistan , a deployment that is highly unpopular with the electorate . the bin laden audio recording , titled " a message to the people of europe " , lashed out at what it called " the injustices " committed by foreign troops in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three videos in a week warn of terror attacks in germany unless its military leaves afghanistan . three videos in a week single out germany by contrast , the third , and most recent , video , also released on friday , was aimed specifically at germany , and said " because of your commitment against islam , attacking germany has become an attractive idea for us , the mujahedeen . " photographs of famous german sites and events then appear , including the brandenburg gate in berlin , munich 's oktoberfest beer festival and cologne 's imposing gothic cathedral .
politicians , including interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and defense minister franz josef jung are also shown . a german crime investigator told deutsche welle that the threat was the most concrete so far due to the people and places mentioned .
he added that there was concern that the spate of messages could signal an attack was indeed being planned . man arrested for posting video the latest flurry of islamist propaganda comes as police announced the arrest of a turkish man suspected of posting the bin laden video . the 25-year-old suspect is known to authorities as a supporter of islamist activists and is said to have been under police observation .
police from germany 's southern city of stuttgart , where the arrest was made , say the man is not thought to have taken part in producing the internet video that threatens germany ahead of the country 's national elections on sunday .
" in searching his apartment , investigators secured numerous items of evidence .
the unemployed suspect , who lived alone , was apparently intensely active on notorious internet platforms , ” the police statement said .
the german government has played down a travel alert issued by the us state department on wednesday warning american citizens in germany to be vigilant .
german officials have heightened security in public spaces and train stations as a precaution .
germany , so far , has not been the target of a major attack by islamist militants .
in 2004 , islamist militants bombed a madrid commuter train , killing 191 people three days before a spanish general election . gb / afp / ap -lrb- / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move comes as the us has said it wants to engage diplomatically with the country ’ s regime . washington 's new policy towards burma will include more direct and deeper engagement with the junta .
us secretary of state hillary clinton made the announcement on the sidelines of the united nations general assembly in new york this week .
however , she insisted that sanctions against the regime would remain an important part of us policy .
" engagement versus sanctions is a false choice in our opinion .
going forward , we will be employing both of those tools , pursuing our same goal .
to help achieve democratic reform we will be engaging directly with burmese authorities . "
clinton also said that the change in policy did not mean there would be any compromise on the demands for credible democratic reform and the unconditional release of all political prisoners , including pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi .
there have been mixed reactions to clinton 's announcement .
some activists doubt whether it will really help to bring about change in the country , which has been in the tight grip of the junta for decades .
sonny aung than oo from the germany-based ngo burma bureau is skeptical : " until now the regime has not cared about any of the un 's demands or those of the international community .
they do n't care .
they keep going their own way .
they have killed monks in the past and many people are political prisoners . "
but other observers think the new policy might have some positive effects in view of the fact that economic sanctions and aid restrictions imposed by western governments in the past have failed to persuade the junta to introduce democratic reforms .
failed sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sanctions have not improved the situation in burma robert templer of the international crisis group in new york explains that the sanction regime did n't really work : " the sanctions were never universally applied .
china did n't apply them , india did n't apply them .
none of the neighboring states have any sanctions on myanmar -lrb- the official name given to burma by its military rulers -rrb- .
so , myanmar 's economy has been hurt to some degree but it has been hurt by its own policies more than by the western sanctions . "
there was first talk about a possible shift in policy towards burma after us senator jim webb , an ardent advocate for easing the sanctions , travelled there last month .
he secured the release of john yettaw , an american who had been jailed for swimming to suu kyi 's house .
webb met the detained pro-democracy leader during his trip , as well as top generals .
for the international crisis group 's templer , washington 's latest change in course is a sign of pragmatism : " for the past nearly 20 years , they have not had high-level contacts with the regime and that lack of contact has really created a diplomatic vacuum , which is very much filled by china , " he says .
" so , even if the us does n't like the government there and does n't regard it as democratic , it does feel the need to discuss a variety of issues with it and to try to find some common ground and some avenues for progress as it has been a very static situation for a long time . "
less paranoia templer added that although it might be a slow process , any contact that the junta had with the outside world was likely to persuade it to introduce reforms eventually .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition leader aung san suu kyi supports the policy shift " it will make them more confident and less paranoid , " he said .
" it will make them more aware of the possibilities of re-engaging with the international community .
engagement tends to have a better record in promoting transformation than isolation . "
aung san suu kyi , for her part , has welcomed the us 's announcement of a policy shift .
according to her lawyer nyan win , she said washington 's direct engagement with burma would be welcome as long as there were talks with the government , but also the opposition .

but for musicians aiming to be stars , they 're the key to a successful career .
dw follows young hopefuls as they brave the jury that could decide their future . johannes brahms ' father , in his time the foremost double bassist in hamburg , is said to have pointed out that a correct note on his instrument is a crapshoot - at best .
that rings true if you listen to bass players struggle , but one could ask why that is .
after all , they have so much more space to hit the right note - inches more , seemingly - than violinists .
one person who gave an answer to the question is a first-round participant at the ard international music competition , which wrapped up recently in munich .
" we do n't have more space for the right note .
the right note is just as precise a point on the fingerboard as on the violin , " said 19-year-old ha-young jung , who was born and raised in seoul and is now based in london .
she was one of the 40 bassists who were accepted and made the trip to munich for the ard competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung started playing music as a child " but we have two inches of wrong note between each right one .
and we have to move our arms inches , not our fingers millimeters , to get from one note to the next , " she pointed out .
that 's good to keep in mind when listening to a first round of double bassists in any competition .
right notes are indeed exceptions to a cacophonous rule .
competitions expand repertoire jung said she was excited to participate in the ard competition because it involved learning so much .
" i think competitions are very good because we have to play and prepare for so many pieces in such a short period , " she said .
she said she thought focusing on competitions too much , however , could be limiting .
" it can get a little bit tense when you think about how to play without making mistakes or that one needs to be perfect all the time . "
she tries not to worry about what judges think too much .
" at the end of the day , music is so personal that i ca n't possibly know what it is the jury really likes .
so i do what i like . "
then , with a glance at her regular russian pianist , who fulfils a role somewhere between ersatz -mother and drillmaster , she quipped , " or what my accompanist wants . "
the bass as solo instrument bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bassists were once mostly men ; that is changing ten or fifteen years ago , women playing the double bass were still a rare sight .
that is changing now , but jung still gets funny looks - not necessarily because she 's a woman playing the double bass , but because she is , or wants to be , a solo bass player .
" many people do n't consider the bass a solo instrument , " she pointed out .
" its register is low , its sound difficult to project when you play with an orchestra .
but i think it depends on how a player brings out the qualities of the instrument , rather than on the instrument itself . "
she would n't want to limit herself to just solo bass , however .
" i love playing chamber music , i love playing with chamber orchestras … i just love playing bass , really . "
expanding the repertoire playing in an orchestra , while enjoyable , is also challenging .
" when i play in an orchestra for a few days , i get very , very ill , because i just give everything , " she said .
but then she waxed philosophical .
" there 's something about the very big picture that 's part of playing in an orchestra and i enjoy it very much - and some aspects are even more demanding than playing solo . "
in the competition in munich , jung played - among others - bottesini 's “ elegy and tarantella . "
every phrase made musical sense and her unbridled energy made it seem like someone had opened the windows in the windowless studio .
" there is n't a lot of repertoire for the bass anyway , compared to other instruments , " she said .
" but bottesini is one of the few composers who really tried to expand the repertoire and i think he 's very musical , very much fun to play , and fun to listen to . "
still , she did n't advance in the competition .
following her disappointment and departure from munich , jung was upbeat again .
she was looking forward to a recital at wigmore hall in london with famous violinist sarah chang .
weight matters before she left , there was question one question she still had to answer : did she ever feel stuck with the double bass and so little music to be grateful for ? " well , there are many ways to look at this .
for me , i do n't envy pianists or violinists ... i do n't envy the particular repertoire they have , even if it is so much bigger and , well , better .
i 'm happy playing bass . "

the move comes as the us has said it wants to engage diplomatically with the country ’ s regime . washington 's new policy towards burma will include more direct and deeper engagement with the junta .
us secretary of state hillary clinton made the announcement on the sidelines of the united nations general assembly in new york this week .
however , she insisted that sanctions against the regime would remain an important part of us policy .
" engagement versus sanctions is a false choice in our opinion .
going forward , we will be employing both of those tools , pursuing our same goal .
to help achieve democratic reform we will be engaging directly with burmese authorities . "
clinton also said that the change in policy did not mean there would be any compromise on the demands for credible democratic reform and the unconditional release of all political prisoners , including pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi .
there have been mixed reactions to clinton 's announcement .
some activists doubt whether it will really help to bring about change in the country , which has been in the tight grip of the junta for decades .
sonny aung than oo from the germany-based ngo burma bureau is skeptical : " until now the regime has not cared about any of the un 's demands or those of the international community .
they do n't care .
they keep going their own way .
they have killed monks in the past and many people are political prisoners . "
but other observers think the new policy might have some positive effects in view of the fact that economic sanctions and aid restrictions imposed by western governments in the past have failed to persuade the junta to introduce democratic reforms .
failed sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sanctions have not improved the situation in burma robert templer of the international crisis group in new york explains that the sanction regime did n't really work : " the sanctions were never universally applied .
china did n't apply them , india did n't apply them .
none of the neighboring states have any sanctions on myanmar -lrb- the official name given to burma by its military rulers -rrb- .
so , myanmar 's economy has been hurt to some degree but it has been hurt by its own policies more than by the western sanctions . "
there was first talk about a possible shift in policy towards burma after us senator jim webb , an ardent advocate for easing the sanctions , travelled there last month .
he secured the release of john yettaw , an american who had been jailed for swimming to suu kyi 's house .
webb met the detained pro-democracy leader during his trip , as well as top generals .
for the international crisis group 's templer , washington 's latest change in course is a sign of pragmatism : " for the past nearly 20 years , they have not had high-level contacts with the regime and that lack of contact has really created a diplomatic vacuum , which is very much filled by china , " he says .
" so , even if the us does n't like the government there and does n't regard it as democratic , it does feel the need to discuss a variety of issues with it and to try to find some common ground and some avenues for progress as it has been a very static situation for a long time . "
less paranoia templer added that although it might be a slow process , any contact that the junta had with the outside world was likely to persuade it to introduce reforms eventually .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition leader aung san suu kyi supports the policy shift " it will make them more confident and less paranoid , " he said .
" it will make them more aware of the possibilities of re-engaging with the international community .
engagement tends to have a better record in promoting transformation than isolation . "
aung san suu kyi , for her part , has welcomed the us 's announcement of a policy shift .
according to her lawyer nyan win , she said washington 's direct engagement with burma would be welcome as long as there were talks with the government , but also the opposition .

but for musicians aiming to be stars , they 're the key to a successful career .
dw follows young hopefuls as they brave the jury that could decide their future . johannes brahms ' father , in his time the foremost double bassist in hamburg , is said to have pointed out that a correct note on his instrument is a crapshoot - at best .
that rings true if you listen to bass players struggle , but one could ask why that is .
after all , they have so much more space to hit the right note - inches more , seemingly - than violinists .
one person who gave an answer to the question is a first-round participant at the ard international music competition , which wrapped up recently in munich .
" we do n't have more space for the right note .
the right note is just as precise a point on the fingerboard as on the violin , " said 19-year-old ha-young jung , who was born and raised in seoul and is now based in london .
she was one of the 40 bassists who were accepted and made the trip to munich for the ard competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung started playing music as a child " but we have two inches of wrong note between each right one .
and we have to move our arms inches , not our fingers millimeters , to get from one note to the next , " she pointed out .
that 's good to keep in mind when listening to a first round of double bassists in any competition .
right notes are indeed exceptions to a cacophonous rule .
competitions expand repertoire jung said she was excited to participate in the ard competition because it involved learning so much .
" i think competitions are very good because we have to play and prepare for so many pieces in such a short period , " she said .
she said she thought focusing on competitions too much , however , could be limiting .
" it can get a little bit tense when you think about how to play without making mistakes or that one needs to be perfect all the time . "
she tries not to worry about what judges think too much .
" at the end of the day , music is so personal that i ca n't possibly know what it is the jury really likes .
so i do what i like . "
then , with a glance at her regular russian pianist , who fulfils a role somewhere between ersatz -mother and drillmaster , she quipped , " or what my accompanist wants . "
the bass as solo instrument bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bassists were once mostly men ; that is changing ten or fifteen years ago , women playing the double bass were still a rare sight .
that is changing now , but jung still gets funny looks - not necessarily because she 's a woman playing the double bass , but because she is , or wants to be , a solo bass player .
" many people do n't consider the bass a solo instrument , " she pointed out .
" its register is low , its sound difficult to project when you play with an orchestra .
but i think it depends on how a player brings out the qualities of the instrument , rather than on the instrument itself . "
she would n't want to limit herself to just solo bass , however .
" i love playing chamber music , i love playing with chamber orchestras … i just love playing bass , really . "
expanding the repertoire playing in an orchestra , while enjoyable , is also challenging .
" when i play in an orchestra for a few days , i get very , very ill , because i just give everything , " she said .
but then she waxed philosophical .
" there 's something about the very big picture that 's part of playing in an orchestra and i enjoy it very much - and some aspects are even more demanding than playing solo . "
in the competition in munich , jung played - among others - bottesini 's “ elegy and tarantella . "
every phrase made musical sense and her unbridled energy made it seem like someone had opened the windows in the windowless studio .
" there is n't a lot of repertoire for the bass anyway , compared to other instruments , " she said .
" but bottesini is one of the few composers who really tried to expand the repertoire and i think he 's very musical , very much fun to play , and fun to listen to . "
still , she did n't advance in the competition .
following her disappointment and departure from munich , jung was upbeat again .
she was looking forward to a recital at wigmore hall in london with famous violinist sarah chang .
weight matters before she left , there was question one question she still had to answer : did she ever feel stuck with the double bass and so little music to be grateful for ? " well , there are many ways to look at this .
for me , i do n't envy pianists or violinists ... i do n't envy the particular repertoire they have , even if it is so much bigger and , well , better .
i 'm happy playing bass . "
then , glancing at her colleagues hauling basses about , " what i envy is the size of other instruments ! "

" whatever we did was within the legal framework and in line with all iaea regulations , " salehi said . the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- required iran to notify them about any new nuclear plant six months before it became operational .
salehi said that he had let them know about the plant well in advance of the deadline : the new site is n't due to go online before the end of 2010 . iran 's revolutionary guards also announced on saturday plans to hold missile defense drills over several days beginning on sunday .
their website said the exercises would include simultaneous firings of missiles at targets .
a statement quoted by iranian news agencies named the purpose as " maintaining and improving the deterrent capability of the armed forces .

separately , it announced plans to hold missile defense drills to test its military capabilities . the head of iran 's atomic organization , ali akbar salehi , told iranian state television on saturday , sept .
26 , that " there will be an inspection in due time , " without mentioning a date . " whatever we did was within the legal framework and in line with all iaea regulations , " salehi said . the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- required iran to notify them about any new nuclear plant six months before it became operational .
salehi said that he had let them know about the plant well in advance of the deadline : the new site is n't due to go online before the end of 2010 . iran 's revolutionary guards also announced on saturday plans to hold missile defense drills over several days beginning on sunday .
their website said the exercises would include simultaneous firings of missiles at targets .
a statement quoted by iranian news agencies named the purpose as " maintaining and improving the deterrent capability of the armed forces . " un urges iran to cooperate united nations secretary ban ki moon , who met the iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on friday evening in new york , had urged tehran to implement relevant security council resolutions and to co-operate with the iaea on resolving concerns related to its nuclear activities . ahmadinejad , however , insisted that his country had done nothing wrong . " it is not a secret site , " he told reporters at a news conference in new york . us president barack obama and a host of european leaders , including german chancellor angela merkel , however , made clear their doubts that the new facility was strictly for the peaceful generation of energy . playing with an open hand obama said it was time for tehran to put its cards on the table .
" i think iran is on notice that , when we meet with them on oct .
1 , they are going to have to come clean and they are going to have to make a choice . " he said he had not ruled out military action , but that he preferred to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three of the world 's most powerful men are worried by iran 's nuclear ambitions french president , nicolas sarkozy said iran was " taking the world down a dangerous path " and he threatened sanctions by the end of the year if the iranian leadership did not change its nuclear course . angela merkel called on ahmadinejad to explain the new facility .
she said germany , like france , britain and the us was " deeply concerned " about the plant , which violated the requirements laid down by the un and the iaea . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also criticized iran , saying that the revelation increased existing doubts about its nuclear program . six major world powers - britain , france , russia , china , germany and the united states - are meeting iran 's top nuclear negotiator saeed jalili in geneva next week for talks on ways to allay those doubts . meanwhile , the head of iran 's nuclear program , ali akbar salehi , has said that construction of the second plant was necessary in order to ensure continued uranium enrichment in the event of foreign air raids on other sites . speaking on iranian television , he said " considering the threats , our organization decided to do what is necessary to preserve and continue our nuclear activities . "
he added that they would not stop their nuclear activities " at any cost . " inspections expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bird 's eye view of iran 's natanz nuclear facility prior to this week , iran 's only known enrichment facility was at natanz , near the central city of isfahan . europe and the us said they believe that the scale of the new plant is such that uranium could be enriched to far higher levels than at natanz , possibly to weapons-grade .
the us president said that he expects iaea inspectors “ to immediately investigate this disturbing information and to report to the iaea board of governors . " the iaea said on friday that iran had sent a letter on monday confirming that it was indeed constructing the facility . iranian state news agency isna reported that tehran had told the vienna-based agency the plant would produce nuclear fuel with an enrichment level of only up to 5 percent - insufficient for use in nuclear weapons . svs / tkw / reuters / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical music -pipe- 26.09.2009 competitions can be tickets to stardom for young musicians großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her aspirations to be a soloist set jung apart artistic competitions may seem like an oxymoron .
but for musicians aiming to be stars , they 're the key to a successful career .
dw follows young hopefuls as they brave the jury that could decide their future . johannes brahms ' father , in his time the foremost double bassist in hamburg , is said to have pointed out that a correct note on his instrument is a crapshoot - at best .
that rings true if you listen to bass players struggle , but one could ask why that is .
after all , they have so much more space to hit the right note - inches more , seemingly - than violinists .
one person who gave an answer to the question is a first-round participant at the ard international music competition , which wrapped up recently in munich .
" we do n't have more space for the right note .
the right note is just as precise a point on the fingerboard as on the violin , " said 19-year-old ha-young jung , who was born and raised in seoul and is now based in london .
she was one of the 40 bassists who were accepted and made the trip to munich for the ard competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung started playing music as a child " but we have two inches of wrong note between each right one .
and we have to move our arms inches , not our fingers millimeters , to get from one note to the next , " she pointed out .
that 's good to keep in mind when listening to a first round of double bassists in any competition .
right notes are indeed exceptions to a cacophonous rule .
competitions expand repertoire jung said she was excited to participate in the ard competition because it involved learning so much .
" i think competitions are very good because we have to play and prepare for so many pieces in such a short period , " she said .
she said she thought focusing on competitions too much , however , could be limiting .
" it can get a little bit tense when you think about how to play without making mistakes or that one needs to be perfect all the time . "
she tries not to worry about what judges think too much .
" at the end of the day , music is so personal that i ca n't possibly know what it is the jury really likes .
so i do what i like . "
then , with a glance at her regular russian pianist , who fulfils a role somewhere between ersatz -mother and drillmaster , she quipped , " or what my accompanist wants . "
the bass as solo instrument bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bassists were once mostly men ; that is changing ten or fifteen years ago , women playing the double bass were still a rare sight .
that is changing now , but jung still gets funny looks - not necessarily because she 's a woman playing the double bass , but because she is , or wants to be , a solo bass player .
" many people do n't consider the bass a solo instrument , " she pointed out .
" its register is low , its sound difficult to project when you play with an orchestra .
but i think it depends on how a player brings out the qualities of the instrument , rather than on the instrument itself . "
she would n't want to limit herself to just solo bass , however .
" i love playing chamber music , i love playing with chamber orchestras … i just love playing bass , really . "
expanding the repertoire playing in an orchestra , while enjoyable , is also challenging .
" when i play in an orchestra for a few days , i get very , very ill , because i just give everything , " she said .
but then she waxed philosophical .
" there 's something about the very big picture that 's part of playing in an orchestra and i enjoy it very much - and some aspects are even more demanding than playing solo . "
in the competition in munich , jung played - among others - bottesini 's “ elegy and tarantella . "
every phrase made musical sense and her unbridled energy made it seem like someone had opened the windows in the windowless studio .
" there is n't a lot of repertoire for the bass anyway , compared to other instruments , " she said .
" but bottesini is one of the few composers who really tried to expand the repertoire and i think he 's very musical , very much fun to play , and fun to listen to . "
still , she did n't advance in the competition .
following her disappointment and departure from munich , jung was upbeat again .
she was looking forward to a recital at wigmore hall in london with famous violinist sarah chang .
weight matters before she left , there was question one question she still had to answer : did she ever feel stuck with the double bass and so little music to be grateful for ? " well , there are many ways to look at this .
for me , i do n't envy pianists or violinists ... i do n't envy the particular repertoire they have , even if it is so much bigger and , well , better .
i 'm happy playing bass . "
then , glancing at her colleagues hauling basses about , " what i envy is the size of other instruments ! "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 26.09.2009 mixed reactions to us policy shift towards burma großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to engage directly with burma 's military regime for the first time in 14 years , burma 's prime minister , thein sein , will travel to the un 's general assembly meeting .
the move comes as the us has said it wants to engage diplomatically with the country ’ s regime . washington 's new policy towards burma will include more direct and deeper engagement with the junta .
us secretary of state hillary clinton made the announcement on the sidelines of the united nations general assembly in new york this week .
however , she insisted that sanctions against the regime would remain an important part of us policy .
" engagement versus sanctions is a false choice in our opinion .
going forward , we will be employing both of those tools , pursuing our same goal .
to help achieve democratic reform we will be engaging directly with burmese authorities . "
clinton also said that the change in policy did not mean there would be any compromise on the demands for credible democratic reform and the unconditional release of all political prisoners , including pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi .
there have been mixed reactions to clinton 's announcement .
some activists doubt whether it will really help to bring about change in the country , which has been in the tight grip of the junta for decades .
sonny aung than oo from the germany-based ngo burma bureau is skeptical : " until now the regime has not cared about any of the un 's demands or those of the international community .
they do n't care .
they keep going their own way .
they have killed monks in the past and many people are political prisoners . "
but other observers think the new policy might have some positive effects in view of the fact that economic sanctions and aid restrictions imposed by western governments in the past have failed to persuade the junta to introduce democratic reforms .
failed sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sanctions have not improved the situation in burma robert templer of the international crisis group in new york explains that the sanction regime did n't really work : " the sanctions were never universally applied .
china did n't apply them , india did n't apply them .
none of the neighboring states have any sanctions on myanmar -lrb- the official name given to burma by its military rulers -rrb- .
so , myanmar 's economy has been hurt to some degree but it has been hurt by its own policies more than by the western sanctions . "
there was first talk about a possible shift in policy towards burma after us senator jim webb , an ardent advocate for easing the sanctions , travelled there last month .
he secured the release of john yettaw , an american who had been jailed for swimming to suu kyi 's house .

in an audiotape , the message said they were " sacrificing men and money in an unjust us-led war . " the bin laden tape follows two video threats against germany for its role in afghanistan earlier this week and came just hours after a third german-language tape by a militant calling himself abu talha al-almani , " the german " , alias bekkay harrach , who has threatened a " rude awakening " for germany . the latest bin laden message did not threaten new attacks and contained no mention of germany , except to note that thanks to the financial crisis , " the heart of europe is no longer number one in world exports " .
but the use of subtitles to address a german audience so close to sunday 's general election appeared calculated to provoke public unease . germany has 4,200 troops in afghanistan , a deployment that is highly unpopular with the electorate . the bin laden audio recording , titled " a message to the people of europe " , lashed out at what it called " the injustices " committed by foreign troops in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three videos in a week warn of terror attacks in germany unless its military leaves afghanistan . three videos in a week single out germany by contrast , the third , and most recent , video , also released on friday , was aimed specifically at germany , and said " because of your commitment against islam , attacking germany has become an attractive idea for us , the mujahedeen . " photographs of famous german sites and events then appear , including the brandenburg gate in berlin , munich 's oktoberfest beer festival and cologne 's imposing gothic cathedral .
politicians , including interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and defense minister franz josef jung are also shown . a german crime investigator told deutsche welle that the threat was the most concrete so far due to the people and places mentioned .
he added that there was concern that the spate of messages could signal an attack was indeed being planned . man arrested for posting video the latest flurry of islamist propaganda comes as police announced the arrest of a turkish man suspected of posting the bin laden video . the 25-year-old suspect is known to authorities as a supporter of islamist activists and is said to have been under police observation .
police from germany 's southern city of stuttgart , where the arrest was made , say the man is not thought to have taken part in producing the internet video that threatens germany ahead of the country 's national elections on sunday .
" in searching his apartment , investigators secured numerous items of evidence .
the unemployed suspect , who lived alone , was apparently intensely active on notorious internet platforms , ” the police statement said .
the german government has played down a travel alert issued by the us state department on wednesday warning american citizens in germany to be vigilant .
german officials have heightened security in public spaces and train stations as a precaution .
germany , so far , has not been the target of a major attack by islamist militants .

in an audiotape , the message said they were " sacrificing men and money in an unjust us-led war . " the bin laden tape follows two video threats against germany for its role in afghanistan earlier this week and came just hours after a third german-language tape by a militant calling himself abu talha al-almani , " the german " , alias bekkay harrach , who has threatened a " rude awakening " for germany . the latest bin laden message did not threaten new attacks and contained no mention of germany , except to note that thanks to the financial crisis , " the heart of europe is no longer number one in world exports " .
but the use of subtitles to address a german audience so close to sunday 's general election appeared calculated to provoke public unease . germany has 4,200 troops in afghanistan , a deployment that is highly unpopular with the electorate . the bin laden audio recording , titled " a message to the people of europe " , lashed out at what it called " the injustices " committed by foreign troops in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three videos in a week warn of terror attacks in germany unless its military leaves afghanistan . three videos in a week single out germany by contrast , the third , and most recent , video , also released on friday , was aimed specifically at germany , and said " because of your commitment against islam , attacking germany has become an attractive idea for us , the mujahedeen . " photographs of famous german sites and events then appear , including the brandenburg gate in berlin , munich 's oktoberfest beer festival and cologne 's imposing gothic cathedral .
politicians , including interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and defense minister franz josef jung are also shown . a german crime investigator told deutsche welle that the threat was the most concrete so far due to the people and places mentioned .
he added that there was concern that the spate of messages could signal an attack was indeed being planned . man arrested for posting video the latest flurry of islamist propaganda comes as police announced the arrest of a turkish man suspected of posting the bin laden video . the 25-year-old suspect is known to authorities as a supporter of islamist activists and is said to have been under police observation .
police from germany 's southern city of stuttgart , where the arrest was made , say the man is not thought to have taken part in producing the internet video that threatens germany ahead of the country 's national elections on sunday .
" in searching his apartment , investigators secured numerous items of evidence .
the unemployed suspect , who lived alone , was apparently intensely active on notorious internet platforms , ” the police statement said .
the german government has played down a travel alert issued by the us state department on wednesday warning american citizens in germany to be vigilant .
german officials have heightened security in public spaces and train stations as a precaution .
germany , so far , has not been the target of a major attack by islamist militants .
in 2004 , islamist militants bombed a madrid commuter train , killing 191 people three days before a spanish general election . gb / afp / ap -lrb- / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but for musicians aiming to be stars , they 're the key to a successful career .
dw follows young hopefuls as they brave the jury that could decide their future . johannes brahms ' father , in his time the foremost double bassist in hamburg , is said to have pointed out that a correct note on his instrument is a crapshoot - at best .
that rings true if you listen to bass players struggle , but one could ask why that is .
after all , they have so much more space to hit the right note - inches more , seemingly - than violinists .
one person who gave an answer to the question is a first-round participant at the ard international music competition , which wrapped up recently in munich .
" we do n't have more space for the right note .
the right note is just as precise a point on the fingerboard as on the violin , " said 19-year-old ha-young jung , who was born and raised in seoul and is now based in london .
she was one of the 40 bassists who were accepted and made the trip to munich for the ard competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung started playing music as a child " but we have two inches of wrong note between each right one .
and we have to move our arms inches , not our fingers millimeters , to get from one note to the next , " she pointed out .
that 's good to keep in mind when listening to a first round of double bassists in any competition .
right notes are indeed exceptions to a cacophonous rule .
competitions expand repertoire jung said she was excited to participate in the ard competition because it involved learning so much .
" i think competitions are very good because we have to play and prepare for so many pieces in such a short period , " she said .
she said she thought focusing on competitions too much , however , could be limiting .
" it can get a little bit tense when you think about how to play without making mistakes or that one needs to be perfect all the time . "
she tries not to worry about what judges think too much .
" at the end of the day , music is so personal that i ca n't possibly know what it is the jury really likes .
so i do what i like . "
then , with a glance at her regular russian pianist , who fulfils a role somewhere between ersatz -mother and drillmaster , she quipped , " or what my accompanist wants . "
the bass as solo instrument bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bassists were once mostly men ; that is changing ten or fifteen years ago , women playing the double bass were still a rare sight .
that is changing now , but jung still gets funny looks - not necessarily because she 's a woman playing the double bass , but because she is , or wants to be , a solo bass player .
" many people do n't consider the bass a solo instrument , " she pointed out .
" its register is low , its sound difficult to project when you play with an orchestra .
but i think it depends on how a player brings out the qualities of the instrument , rather than on the instrument itself . "
she would n't want to limit herself to just solo bass , however .
" i love playing chamber music , i love playing with chamber orchestras … i just love playing bass , really . "
expanding the repertoire playing in an orchestra , while enjoyable , is also challenging .
" when i play in an orchestra for a few days , i get very , very ill , because i just give everything , " she said .
but then she waxed philosophical .
" there 's something about the very big picture that 's part of playing in an orchestra and i enjoy it very much - and some aspects are even more demanding than playing solo . "
in the competition in munich , jung played - among others - bottesini 's “ elegy and tarantella . "
every phrase made musical sense and her unbridled energy made it seem like someone had opened the windows in the windowless studio .
" there is n't a lot of repertoire for the bass anyway , compared to other instruments , " she said .
" but bottesini is one of the few composers who really tried to expand the repertoire and i think he 's very musical , very much fun to play , and fun to listen to . "
still , she did n't advance in the competition .
following her disappointment and departure from munich , jung was upbeat again .
she was looking forward to a recital at wigmore hall in london with famous violinist sarah chang .
weight matters before she left , there was question one question she still had to answer : did she ever feel stuck with the double bass and so little music to be grateful for ? " well , there are many ways to look at this .
for me , i do n't envy pianists or violinists ... i do n't envy the particular repertoire they have , even if it is so much bigger and , well , better .
i 'm happy playing bass . "
then , glancing at her colleagues hauling basses about , " what i envy is the size of other instruments ! "

the move comes as the us has said it wants to engage diplomatically with the country ’ s regime . washington 's new policy towards burma will include more direct and deeper engagement with the junta .
us secretary of state hillary clinton made the announcement on the sidelines of the united nations general assembly in new york this week .
however , she insisted that sanctions against the regime would remain an important part of us policy .
" engagement versus sanctions is a false choice in our opinion .
going forward , we will be employing both of those tools , pursuing our same goal .
to help achieve democratic reform we will be engaging directly with burmese authorities . "
clinton also said that the change in policy did not mean there would be any compromise on the demands for credible democratic reform and the unconditional release of all political prisoners , including pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi .
there have been mixed reactions to clinton 's announcement .
some activists doubt whether it will really help to bring about change in the country , which has been in the tight grip of the junta for decades .
sonny aung than oo from the germany-based ngo burma bureau is skeptical : " until now the regime has not cared about any of the un 's demands or those of the international community .
they do n't care .
they keep going their own way .
they have killed monks in the past and many people are political prisoners . "
but other observers think the new policy might have some positive effects in view of the fact that economic sanctions and aid restrictions imposed by western governments in the past have failed to persuade the junta to introduce democratic reforms .
failed sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sanctions have not improved the situation in burma robert templer of the international crisis group in new york explains that the sanction regime did n't really work : " the sanctions were never universally applied .
china did n't apply them , india did n't apply them .
none of the neighboring states have any sanctions on myanmar -lrb- the official name given to burma by its military rulers -rrb- .
so , myanmar 's economy has been hurt to some degree but it has been hurt by its own policies more than by the western sanctions . "
there was first talk about a possible shift in policy towards burma after us senator jim webb , an ardent advocate for easing the sanctions , travelled there last month .
he secured the release of john yettaw , an american who had been jailed for swimming to suu kyi 's house .
webb met the detained pro-democracy leader during his trip , as well as top generals .
for the international crisis group 's templer , washington 's latest change in course is a sign of pragmatism : " for the past nearly 20 years , they have not had high-level contacts with the regime and that lack of contact has really created a diplomatic vacuum , which is very much filled by china , " he says .
" so , even if the us does n't like the government there and does n't regard it as democratic , it does feel the need to discuss a variety of issues with it and to try to find some common ground and some avenues for progress as it has been a very static situation for a long time . "
less paranoia templer added that although it might be a slow process , any contact that the junta had with the outside world was likely to persuade it to introduce reforms eventually .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition leader aung san suu kyi supports the policy shift " it will make them more confident and less paranoid , " he said .
" it will make them more aware of the possibilities of re-engaging with the international community .
engagement tends to have a better record in promoting transformation than isolation . "
aung san suu kyi , for her part , has welcomed the us 's announcement of a policy shift .
according to her lawyer nyan win , she said washington 's direct engagement with burma would be welcome as long as there were talks with the government , but also the opposition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 26.09.2009 mixed reactions to us policy shift towards burma großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to engage directly with burma 's military regime for the first time in 14 years , burma 's prime minister , thein sein , will travel to the un 's general assembly meeting .
the move comes as the us has said it wants to engage diplomatically with the country ’ s regime . washington 's new policy towards burma will include more direct and deeper engagement with the junta .
us secretary of state hillary clinton made the announcement on the sidelines of the united nations general assembly in new york this week .
however , she insisted that sanctions against the regime would remain an important part of us policy .
" engagement versus sanctions is a false choice in our opinion .
going forward , we will be employing both of those tools , pursuing our same goal .
to help achieve democratic reform we will be engaging directly with burmese authorities . "
clinton also said that the change in policy did not mean there would be any compromise on the demands for credible democratic reform and the unconditional release of all political prisoners , including pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi .
there have been mixed reactions to clinton 's announcement .
some activists doubt whether it will really help to bring about change in the country , which has been in the tight grip of the junta for decades .
sonny aung than oo from the germany-based ngo burma bureau is skeptical : " until now the regime has not cared about any of the un 's demands or those of the international community .
they do n't care .
they keep going their own way .
they have killed monks in the past and many people are political prisoners . "
but other observers think the new policy might have some positive effects in view of the fact that economic sanctions and aid restrictions imposed by western governments in the past have failed to persuade the junta to introduce democratic reforms .
failed sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sanctions have not improved the situation in burma robert templer of the international crisis group in new york explains that the sanction regime did n't really work : " the sanctions were never universally applied .
china did n't apply them , india did n't apply them .
none of the neighboring states have any sanctions on myanmar -lrb- the official name given to burma by its military rulers -rrb- .
so , myanmar 's economy has been hurt to some degree but it has been hurt by its own policies more than by the western sanctions . "
there was first talk about a possible shift in policy towards burma after us senator jim webb , an ardent advocate for easing the sanctions , travelled there last month .
he secured the release of john yettaw , an american who had been jailed for swimming to suu kyi 's house .
webb met the detained pro-democracy leader during his trip , as well as top generals .
for the international crisis group 's templer , washington 's latest change in course is a sign of pragmatism : " for the past nearly 20 years , they have not had high-level contacts with the regime and that lack of contact has really created a diplomatic vacuum , which is very much filled by china , " he says .
" so , even if the us does n't like the government there and does n't regard it as democratic , it does feel the need to discuss a variety of issues with it and to try to find some common ground and some avenues for progress as it has been a very static situation for a long time . "
less paranoia templer added that although it might be a slow process , any contact that the junta had with the outside world was likely to persuade it to introduce reforms eventually .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition leader aung san suu kyi supports the policy shift " it will make them more confident and less paranoid , " he said .
" it will make them more aware of the possibilities of re-engaging with the international community .
engagement tends to have a better record in promoting transformation than isolation . "
aung san suu kyi , for her part , has welcomed the us 's announcement of a policy shift .
according to her lawyer nyan win , she said washington 's direct engagement with burma would be welcome as long as there were talks with the government , but also the opposition .

european union and chinese officials at the g-20 summit in pittsburgh said that a tentative deal was in place to give rising powers greater voting power in the international monetary fund " as things stand now , we believe that all parties have the strong will to accelerate reform of the international financial institutions , " chinese vice foreign minister he yafei said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reform is coming to the imf brazil , russia , india and china , known as the bric countries , had requested earlier this month that the most developed countries reduce their voting share in the imf to 50 percent , down from 57 percent .
they argued that a number of european nations wielded inordinate influence on the fund , especially inappropriate in light of the fact that their economies had been surpassed in size by bric countries in recent decades .
the united states , too , has occasionally grumbled that europe has too much say in imf policy decisions .
statement of principles it appears that , in pittsburgh , europe has relented , in part , to putting its stamp on the g-20 's draft agreement on economic policy .
china , along with other countries that have been criticized for running large , unhealthy surpluses and relying on exports for growth , are being urged to boost domestic consumption .
at the same time , countries with outsized public debt , such as the united states , are called on to promote private savings .
" we recognize that the process to ensure more balanced global growth must be undertaken in an orderly manner .
all g-20 members agree to address the respective weaknesses of their economies , " the draft agreement declares .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g-20 leaders agreed on a new direction for the financial sector tougher finance rules world leaders also pledged to reform the financial sector in an effort to stop risky banking practices seen as a cause of the global economic crisis .
in a joint statement issued at the end of the summit , g-20 leaders were clear on the new direction of financial regulation . " major failures of regulation and supervision , plus reckless and irresponsible risk taking by banks and other financial institutions , created dangerous financial fragilities that contributed significantly to the current crisis , " the statement said .
" a return to the excessive risk taking prevalent in some countries before the crisis is not an option . " tougher controls on compensation and bonus payments for banking executives were also endorsed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy was satisfied with the g-20 summit many european leaders , including german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , had hoped tackling problems in the financial sector would be at the top of the agenda in pittsburgh . " there was unanimity around the table that the errors of the past wo n't happen again , " sarkozy said after the meeting .
" i am very satisfied by what we decided . " the leaders also agreed to keep emergency stimulus funding in place for the time being , with plans to scale them back when sustainable recovery is reached . while the world 's largest economies agreed to phase out fossil fuel subsidies to combat global warming , climate change was a largely overlooked topic in pittsburgh .
no consensus was reached regarding the amount wealthy nations should pay to support the efforts of developing nations to curb global warming , which is seen as an essential step towards a new global treaty proposed for the copenhagen climate summit in december . mrh / mz / reuters / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move comes as the us has said it wants to engage diplomatically with the country ’ s regime . washington 's new policy towards burma will include more direct and deeper engagement with the junta .
us secretary of state hillary clinton made the announcement on the sidelines of the united nations general assembly in new york this week .
however , she insisted that sanctions against the regime would remain an important part of us policy .
" engagement versus sanctions is a false choice in our opinion .
going forward , we will be employing both of those tools , pursuing our same goal .
to help achieve democratic reform we will be engaging directly with burmese authorities . "
clinton also said that the change in policy did not mean there would be any compromise on the demands for credible democratic reform and the unconditional release of all political prisoners , including pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi .
there have been mixed reactions to clinton 's announcement .
some activists doubt whether it will really help to bring about change in the country , which has been in the tight grip of the junta for decades .
sonny aung than oo from the germany-based ngo burma bureau is skeptical : " until now the regime has not cared about any of the un 's demands or those of the international community .
they do n't care .
they keep going their own way .
they have killed monks in the past and many people are political prisoners . "
but other observers think the new policy might have some positive effects in view of the fact that economic sanctions and aid restrictions imposed by western governments in the past have failed to persuade the junta to introduce democratic reforms .
failed sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sanctions have not improved the situation in burma robert templer of the international crisis group in new york explains that the sanction regime did n't really work : " the sanctions were never universally applied .
china did n't apply them , india did n't apply them .
none of the neighboring states have any sanctions on myanmar -lrb- the official name given to burma by its military rulers -rrb- .
so , myanmar 's economy has been hurt to some degree but it has been hurt by its own policies more than by the western sanctions . "
there was first talk about a possible shift in policy towards burma after us senator jim webb , an ardent advocate for easing the sanctions , travelled there last month .
he secured the release of john yettaw , an american who had been jailed for swimming to suu kyi 's house .
webb met the detained pro-democracy leader during his trip , as well as top generals .
for the international crisis group 's templer , washington 's latest change in course is a sign of pragmatism : " for the past nearly 20 years , they have not had high-level contacts with the regime and that lack of contact has really created a diplomatic vacuum , which is very much filled by china , " he says .
" so , even if the us does n't like the government there and does n't regard it as democratic , it does feel the need to discuss a variety of issues with it and to try to find some common ground and some avenues for progress as it has been a very static situation for a long time . "
less paranoia templer added that although it might be a slow process , any contact that the junta had with the outside world was likely to persuade it to introduce reforms eventually .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition leader aung san suu kyi supports the policy shift " it will make them more confident and less paranoid , " he said .
" it will make them more aware of the possibilities of re-engaging with the international community .
engagement tends to have a better record in promoting transformation than isolation . "
aung san suu kyi , for her part , has welcomed the us 's announcement of a policy shift .
according to her lawyer nyan win , she said washington 's direct engagement with burma would be welcome as long as there were talks with the government , but also the opposition .

but for musicians aiming to be stars , they 're the key to a successful career .
dw follows young hopefuls as they brave the jury that could decide their future . johannes brahms ' father , in his time the foremost double bassist in hamburg , is said to have pointed out that a correct note on his instrument is a crapshoot - at best .
that rings true if you listen to bass players struggle , but one could ask why that is .

right notes are indeed exceptions to a cacophonous rule .
competitions expand repertoire jung said she was excited to participate in the ard competition because it involved learning so much .
" i think competitions are very good because we have to play and prepare for so many pieces in such a short period , " she said .
she said she thought focusing on competitions too much , however , could be limiting .

the bass as solo instrument bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bassists were once mostly men ; that is changing ten or fifteen years ago , women playing the double bass were still a rare sight .
that is changing now , but jung still gets funny looks - not necessarily because she 's a woman playing the double bass , but because she is , or wants to be , a solo bass player .
" many people do n't consider the bass a solo instrument , " she pointed out .
" its register is low , its sound difficult to project when you play with an orchestra .

she would n't want to limit herself to just solo bass , however .

expanding the repertoire playing in an orchestra , while enjoyable , is also challenging .
" when i play in an orchestra for a few days , i get very , very ill , because i just give everything , " she said .
but then she waxed philosophical .
" there 's something about the very big picture that 's part of playing in an orchestra and i enjoy it very much - and some aspects are even more demanding than playing solo . "
in the competition in munich , jung played - among others - bottesini 's “ elegy and tarantella . "

" but bottesini is one of the few composers who really tried to expand the repertoire and i think he 's very musical , very much fun to play , and fun to listen to . "
still , she did n't advance in the competition .
following her disappointment and departure from munich , jung was upbeat again .
she was looking forward to a recital at wigmore hall in london with famous violinist sarah chang .
weight matters before she left , there was question one question she still had to answer : did she ever feel stuck with the double bass and so little music to be grateful for ? " well , there are many ways to look at this .

but for musicians aiming to be stars , they 're the key to a successful career .
dw follows young hopefuls as they brave the jury that could decide their future . johannes brahms ' father , in his time the foremost double bassist in hamburg , is said to have pointed out that a correct note on his instrument is a crapshoot - at best .
that rings true if you listen to bass players struggle , but one could ask why that is .
after all , they have so much more space to hit the right note - inches more , seemingly - than violinists .
one person who gave an answer to the question is a first-round participant at the ard international music competition , which wrapped up recently in munich .
" we do n't have more space for the right note .
the right note is just as precise a point on the fingerboard as on the violin , " said 19-year-old ha-young jung , who was born and raised in seoul and is now based in london .
she was one of the 40 bassists who were accepted and made the trip to munich for the ard competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung started playing music as a child " but we have two inches of wrong note between each right one .
and we have to move our arms inches , not our fingers millimeters , to get from one note to the next , " she pointed out .
that 's good to keep in mind when listening to a first round of double bassists in any competition .
right notes are indeed exceptions to a cacophonous rule .
competitions expand repertoire jung said she was excited to participate in the ard competition because it involved learning so much .
" i think competitions are very good because we have to play and prepare for so many pieces in such a short period , " she said .
she said she thought focusing on competitions too much , however , could be limiting .
" it can get a little bit tense when you think about how to play without making mistakes or that one needs to be perfect all the time . "
she tries not to worry about what judges think too much .
" at the end of the day , music is so personal that i ca n't possibly know what it is the jury really likes .
so i do what i like . "
then , with a glance at her regular russian pianist , who fulfils a role somewhere between ersatz -mother and drillmaster , she quipped , " or what my accompanist wants . "
the bass as solo instrument bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bassists were once mostly men ; that is changing ten or fifteen years ago , women playing the double bass were still a rare sight .
that is changing now , but jung still gets funny looks - not necessarily because she 's a woman playing the double bass , but because she is , or wants to be , a solo bass player .
" many people do n't consider the bass a solo instrument , " she pointed out .
" its register is low , its sound difficult to project when you play with an orchestra .
but i think it depends on how a player brings out the qualities of the instrument , rather than on the instrument itself . "
she would n't want to limit herself to just solo bass , however .
" i love playing chamber music , i love playing with chamber orchestras … i just love playing bass , really . "
expanding the repertoire playing in an orchestra , while enjoyable , is also challenging .
" when i play in an orchestra for a few days , i get very , very ill , because i just give everything , " she said .
but then she waxed philosophical .
" there 's something about the very big picture that 's part of playing in an orchestra and i enjoy it very much - and some aspects are even more demanding than playing solo . "
in the competition in munich , jung played - among others - bottesini 's “ elegy and tarantella . "
every phrase made musical sense and her unbridled energy made it seem like someone had opened the windows in the windowless studio .
" there is n't a lot of repertoire for the bass anyway , compared to other instruments , " she said .
" but bottesini is one of the few composers who really tried to expand the repertoire and i think he 's very musical , very much fun to play , and fun to listen to . "
still , she did n't advance in the competition .
following her disappointment and departure from munich , jung was upbeat again .
she was looking forward to a recital at wigmore hall in london with famous violinist sarah chang .
weight matters before she left , there was question one question she still had to answer : did she ever feel stuck with the double bass and so little music to be grateful for ? " well , there are many ways to look at this .
for me , i do n't envy pianists or violinists ... i do n't envy the particular repertoire they have , even if it is so much bigger and , well , better .
i 'm happy playing bass . "
then , glancing at her colleagues hauling basses about , " what i envy is the size of other instruments ! "

bayern coach louis van gaal acknowledged that hamburg had earned the victory .
" it was a great game .

bayern , on the other hand , was fresh of a 5-0 german cup drubbing of rw oberhausen and was hungry for a glimpse from the top of the league .

european union and chinese officials at the g-20 summit in pittsburgh said that a tentative deal was in place to give rising powers greater voting power in the international monetary fund " as things stand now , we believe that all parties have the strong will to accelerate reform of the international financial institutions , " chinese vice foreign minister he yafei said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reform is coming to the imf brazil , russia , india and china , known as the bric countries , had requested earlier this month that the most developed countries reduce their voting share in the imf to 50 percent , down from 57 percent .
they argued that a number of european nations wielded inordinate influence on the fund , especially inappropriate in light of the fact that their economies had been surpassed in size by bric countries in recent decades .
the united states , too , has occasionally grumbled that europe has too much say in imf policy decisions .
statement of principles it appears that , in pittsburgh , europe has relented , in part , to putting its stamp on the g-20 's draft agreement on economic policy .
china , along with other countries that have been criticized for running large , unhealthy surpluses and relying on exports for growth , are being urged to boost domestic consumption .
at the same time , countries with outsized public debt , such as the united states , are called on to promote private savings .
" we recognize that the process to ensure more balanced global growth must be undertaken in an orderly manner .
all g-20 members agree to address the respective weaknesses of their economies , " the draft agreement declares .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g-20 leaders agreed on a new direction for the financial sector tougher finance rules world leaders also pledged to reform the financial sector in an effort to stop risky banking practices seen as a cause of the global economic crisis .
in a joint statement issued at the end of the summit , g-20 leaders were clear on the new direction of financial regulation . " major failures of regulation and supervision , plus reckless and irresponsible risk taking by banks and other financial institutions , created dangerous financial fragilities that contributed significantly to the current crisis , " the statement said .
" a return to the excessive risk taking prevalent in some countries before the crisis is not an option . " tougher controls on compensation and bonus payments for banking executives were also endorsed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy was satisfied with the g-20 summit many european leaders , including german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , had hoped tackling problems in the financial sector would be at the top of the agenda in pittsburgh . " there was unanimity around the table that the errors of the past wo n't happen again , " sarkozy said after the meeting .
" i am very satisfied by what we decided . " the leaders also agreed to keep emergency stimulus funding in place for the time being , with plans to scale them back when sustainable recovery is reached . while the world 's largest economies agreed to phase out fossil fuel subsidies to combat global warming , climate change was a largely overlooked topic in pittsburgh .
no consensus was reached regarding the amount wealthy nations should pay to support the efforts of developing nations to curb global warming , which is seen as an essential step towards a new global treaty proposed for the copenhagen climate summit in december . mrh / mz / reuters / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that spot stays with hamburg sv for the fourth straight week . after hamburg 's draw against frankfurt last week and bayern 's third straight league win over nuremberg left just three points between the two sides , bayern was in a good position to close the gap on hamburg coming into saturday 's match .
hamburg had the advantage of home turf , but were coming off a loss on penalty kicks earlier in the week in the german cup .
bayern , on the other hand , was fresh of a 5-0 german cup drubbing of rw oberhausen and was hungry for a glimpse from the top of the league .
there was no clear favorite for most of the game and the equally matched squads appeared to be headed for a draw until hamburg 's mladen petric scored the winning goal in the 72nd minute to tip the game 1-0 to hamburg .
bayern coach louis van gaal acknowledged that hamburg had earned the victory .
" it was a great game .
we had several chances but we did n't take them .
that was the problem - and hamburg are a top side .
the side that gets the goal wins it , " he said .
the loss drops bayern munich to sixth in the league , and they trail hamburg by six points .
leverkusen stays in the hunt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc cologne 's season has n't been able to get off the ground while hamburg were able to dispatch one challenger to their top position in the table , bayer leverkusen remains close on hamburg 's heels with a 1-0 win over fc cologne .
in cologne 's german cup match during the week , a 3-2 victory over defending bundesliga champs wolfsburg was a glimmer of hope for the team in what has been an otherwise dismal season .
despite holding leverkusen goalless for nearly the entire game , leverkusen 's simon rolfes slipped one into the net in the 82nd minute to put an end to cologne 's short-lived success .
leverkusen are second in the bundesliga to hamburg on goal difference , while cologne continues to languish in second to last place .

the game 's only goal came from peruvian striker jefferson farfan in the 31st minute .
the highest scoring match of the day was a 4-2 win for vfl wolfsburg against hanover .
last year 's bundesliga champs used four different scorers to dispatch hanover .
zvjezdan misimovic , christian gentner , makoto hasebe , and edin dzeko all found the back of the net , and wolfsburg 's alexander madlung even gave a goal away , scoring an own-goal in the 50th minute .
hanover 's other goal came from hanno balitsch .
wolfsburg have been hit and miss so far this season , winning four and losing three .
they are currently in fifth place and tied on points with werder bremen , who beat mainz 3-0 on two goals from claudio pizarro and one from aaron hunt .
rounding out saturday 's matches , vfb stuttgart blanked eintracht frankfurt 3-0 thanks to two goals from u-21 national striker julian schieber in the 17th and 31st minute .
thomas hitzlsperger added the third insurance goal for suttgart in the 54th minute .

separately , it announced plans to hold missile defense drills to test its military capabilities . the head of iran 's atomic organization , ali akbar salehi , told iranian state television on saturday , sept .
26 , that " there will be an inspection in due time , " without mentioning a date . " whatever we did was within the legal framework and in line with all iaea regulations , " salehi said . the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- required iran to notify them about any new nuclear plant six months before it became operational .
salehi said that he had let them know about the plant well in advance of the deadline : the new site is n't due to go online before the end of 2010 . iran 's revolutionary guards also announced on saturday plans to hold missile defense drills over several days beginning on sunday .
their website said the exercises would include simultaneous firings of missiles at targets .
a statement quoted by iranian news agencies named the purpose as " maintaining and improving the deterrent capability of the armed forces . " un urges iran to cooperate united nations secretary ban ki moon , who met the iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on friday evening in new york , had urged tehran to implement relevant security council resolutions and to co-operate with the iaea on resolving concerns related to its nuclear activities . ahmadinejad , however , insisted that his country had done nothing wrong . " it is not a secret site , " he told reporters at a news conference in new york . us president barack obama and a host of european leaders , including german chancellor angela merkel , however , made clear their doubts that the new facility was strictly for the peaceful generation of energy . playing with an open hand obama said it was time for tehran to put its cards on the table .
" i think iran is on notice that , when we meet with them on oct .
1 , they are going to have to come clean and they are going to have to make a choice . " he said he had not ruled out military action , but that he preferred to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three of the world 's most powerful men are worried by iran 's nuclear ambitions french president , nicolas sarkozy said iran was " taking the world down a dangerous path " and he threatened sanctions by the end of the year if the iranian leadership did not change its nuclear course . angela merkel called on ahmadinejad to explain the new facility .
she said germany , like france , britain and the us was " deeply concerned " about the plant , which violated the requirements laid down by the un and the iaea . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also criticized iran , saying that the revelation increased existing doubts about its nuclear program . six major world powers - britain , france , russia , china , germany and the united states - are meeting iran 's top nuclear negotiator saeed jalili in geneva next week for talks on ways to allay those doubts . meanwhile , the head of iran 's nuclear program , ali akbar salehi , has said that construction of the second plant was necessary in order to ensure continued uranium enrichment in the event of foreign air raids on other sites . speaking on iranian television , he said " considering the threats , our organization decided to do what is necessary to preserve and continue our nuclear activities . "
he added that they would not stop their nuclear activities " at any cost . " inspections expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bird 's eye view of iran 's natanz nuclear facility prior to this week , iran 's only known enrichment facility was at natanz , near the central city of isfahan . europe and the us said they believe that the scale of the new plant is such that uranium could be enriched to far higher levels than at natanz , possibly to weapons-grade .
the us president said that he expects iaea inspectors “ to immediately investigate this disturbing information and to report to the iaea board of governors . " the iaea said on friday that iran had sent a letter on monday confirming that it was indeed constructing the facility . iranian state news agency isna reported that tehran had told the vienna-based agency the plant would produce nuclear fuel with an enrichment level of only up to 5 percent - insufficient for use in nuclear weapons . svs / tkw / reuters / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

separately , it announced plans to hold missile defense drills to test its military capabilities . the head of iran 's atomic organization , ali akbar salehi , told iranian state television on saturday , sept .

a statement quoted by iranian news agencies named the purpose as " maintaining and improving the deterrent capability of the armed forces . " un urges iran to cooperate united nations secretary ban ki moon , who met the iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on friday evening in new york , had urged tehran to implement relevant security council resolutions and to co-operate with the iaea on resolving concerns related to its nuclear activities . ahmadinejad , however , insisted that his country had done nothing wrong .

she said germany , like france , britain and the us was " deeply concerned " about the plant , which violated the requirements laid down by the un and the iaea . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also criticized iran , saying that the revelation increased existing doubts about its nuclear program . six major world powers - britain , france , russia , china , germany and the united states - are meeting iran 's top nuclear negotiator saeed jalili in geneva next week for talks on ways to allay those doubts . meanwhile , the head of iran 's nuclear program , ali akbar salehi , has said that construction of the second plant was necessary in order to ensure continued uranium enrichment in the event of foreign air raids on other sites . speaking on iranian television , he said " considering the threats , our organization decided to do what is necessary to preserve and continue our nuclear activities . "
he added that they would not stop their nuclear activities " at any cost .

the us president said that he expects iaea inspectors “ to immediately investigate this disturbing information and to report to the iaea board of governors . " the iaea said on friday that iran had sent a letter on monday confirming that it was indeed constructing the facility . iranian state news agency isna reported that tehran had told the vienna-based agency the plant would produce nuclear fuel with an enrichment level of only up to 5 percent - insufficient for use in nuclear weapons . svs / tkw / reuters / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european union and chinese officials at the g-20 summit in pittsburgh said that a tentative deal was in place to give rising powers greater voting power in the international monetary fund " as things stand now , we believe that all parties have the strong will to accelerate reform of the international financial institutions , " chinese vice foreign minister he yafei said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reform is coming to the imf brazil , russia , india and china , known as the bric countries , had requested earlier this month that the most developed countries reduce their voting share in the imf to 50 percent , down from 57 percent .
they argued that a number of european nations wielded inordinate influence on the fund , especially inappropriate in light of the fact that their economies had been surpassed in size by bric countries in recent decades .
the united states , too , has occasionally grumbled that europe has too much say in imf policy decisions .
statement of principles it appears that , in pittsburgh , europe has relented , in part , to putting its stamp on the g-20 's draft agreement on economic policy .
china , along with other countries that have been criticized for running large , unhealthy surpluses and relying on exports for growth , are being urged to boost domestic consumption .
at the same time , countries with outsized public debt , such as the united states , are called on to promote private savings .
" we recognize that the process to ensure more balanced global growth must be undertaken in an orderly manner .
all g-20 members agree to address the respective weaknesses of their economies , " the draft agreement declares .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g-20 leaders agreed on a new direction for the financial sector tougher finance rules world leaders also pledged to reform the financial sector in an effort to stop risky banking practices seen as a cause of the global economic crisis .
in a joint statement issued at the end of the summit , g-20 leaders were clear on the new direction of financial regulation . " major failures of regulation and supervision , plus reckless and irresponsible risk taking by banks and other financial institutions , created dangerous financial fragilities that contributed significantly to the current crisis , " the statement said .
" a return to the excessive risk taking prevalent in some countries before the crisis is not an option . " tougher controls on compensation and bonus payments for banking executives were also endorsed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy was satisfied with the g-20 summit many european leaders , including german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , had hoped tackling problems in the financial sector would be at the top of the agenda in pittsburgh . " there was unanimity around the table that the errors of the past wo n't happen again , " sarkozy said after the meeting .
" i am very satisfied by what we decided . " the leaders also agreed to keep emergency stimulus funding in place for the time being , with plans to scale them back when sustainable recovery is reached . while the world 's largest economies agreed to phase out fossil fuel subsidies to combat global warming , climate change was a largely overlooked topic in pittsburgh .
no consensus was reached regarding the amount wealthy nations should pay to support the efforts of developing nations to curb global warming , which is seen as an essential step towards a new global treaty proposed for the copenhagen climate summit in december . mrh / mz / reuters / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move comes as the us has said it wants to engage diplomatically with the country ’ s regime . washington 's new policy towards burma will include more direct and deeper engagement with the junta .
us secretary of state hillary clinton made the announcement on the sidelines of the united nations general assembly in new york this week .
however , she insisted that sanctions against the regime would remain an important part of us policy .
" engagement versus sanctions is a false choice in our opinion .
going forward , we will be employing both of those tools , pursuing our same goal .
to help achieve democratic reform we will be engaging directly with burmese authorities . "
clinton also said that the change in policy did not mean there would be any compromise on the demands for credible democratic reform and the unconditional release of all political prisoners , including pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi .
there have been mixed reactions to clinton 's announcement .
some activists doubt whether it will really help to bring about change in the country , which has been in the tight grip of the junta for decades .
sonny aung than oo from the germany-based ngo burma bureau is skeptical : " until now the regime has not cared about any of the un 's demands or those of the international community .
they do n't care .
they keep going their own way .
they have killed monks in the past and many people are political prisoners . "
but other observers think the new policy might have some positive effects in view of the fact that economic sanctions and aid restrictions imposed by western governments in the past have failed to persuade the junta to introduce democratic reforms .
failed sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sanctions have not improved the situation in burma robert templer of the international crisis group in new york explains that the sanction regime did n't really work : " the sanctions were never universally applied .
china did n't apply them , india did n't apply them .
none of the neighboring states have any sanctions on myanmar -lrb- the official name given to burma by its military rulers -rrb- .
so , myanmar 's economy has been hurt to some degree but it has been hurt by its own policies more than by the western sanctions . "
there was first talk about a possible shift in policy towards burma after us senator jim webb , an ardent advocate for easing the sanctions , travelled there last month .
he secured the release of john yettaw , an american who had been jailed for swimming to suu kyi 's house .
webb met the detained pro-democracy leader during his trip , as well as top generals .
for the international crisis group 's templer , washington 's latest change in course is a sign of pragmatism : " for the past nearly 20 years , they have not had high-level contacts with the regime and that lack of contact has really created a diplomatic vacuum , which is very much filled by china , " he says .
" so , even if the us does n't like the government there and does n't regard it as democratic , it does feel the need to discuss a variety of issues with it and to try to find some common ground and some avenues for progress as it has been a very static situation for a long time . "
less paranoia templer added that although it might be a slow process , any contact that the junta had with the outside world was likely to persuade it to introduce reforms eventually .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition leader aung san suu kyi supports the policy shift " it will make them more confident and less paranoid , " he said .
" it will make them more aware of the possibilities of re-engaging with the international community .
engagement tends to have a better record in promoting transformation than isolation . "
aung san suu kyi , for her part , has welcomed the us 's announcement of a policy shift .
according to her lawyer nyan win , she said washington 's direct engagement with burma would be welcome as long as there were talks with the government , but also the opposition .

26 .
the airspace restriction came at the request of the federal interior ministry .
munich 's theresienwiese beer garden is spread over 77 acres -lrb- 31 hectares -rrb- , where 6 million people join in the 16-day celebration every year .
" a no-fly zone appears to be a necessity , given the current security situation , " herrmann said , referring to the multiple terrorist threats directed at germany over the past few days .
on thursday , fears about commercial flights transiting over the festival grounds led to several concerned phone calls to the authorities by oktoberfest attendees .
a torrent of terrorist threats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : video messages have threatened german targets no less than five threatening messages have surfaced recently , including a message from al qaeda 's osama bin laden - replete with german subtitles - demanding that europeans leave afghanistan .
other video threats have been delivered , including a video discovered on friday , which , according to the german interior ministry , had come from the taliban " because of your commitment here against islam , attacking germany has become an attractive idea for us , the mujahedeen , " a man calling himself " ajjub " spoke in german in the video .
the footage included images of potential targets such as munich 's oktoberfest festival , as well as the brandenburg gate in berlin and cologne 's massive cathedral . images of defense minister franz-josef jung and interior minister wolfgang shaeuble were also shown .
this latest video was just another in a string of threats apparently designed to cast a pall over sunday 's national elections .
no fear-mongering meanwhile , chairman of the islamic council of germany , ali kizilkaya , released a statement saying that he was happy with interior minister schaeuble 's management of the threats so far .
" even in this tense stage of the election campaign , all the democrats have refrained from exploiting the threats , " he said .
the no-fly zone will remain in effect until oct .
4 , when the festival comes to an end .

26 .
the airspace restriction came at the request of the federal interior ministry .
munich 's theresienwiese beer garden is spread over 77 acres -lrb- 31 hectares -rrb- , where 6 million people join in the 16-day celebration every year .
" a no-fly zone appears to be a necessity , given the current security situation , " herrmann said , referring to the multiple terrorist threats directed at germany over the past few days .
on thursday , fears about commercial flights transiting over the festival grounds led to several concerned phone calls to the authorities by oktoberfest attendees .
a torrent of terrorist threats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : video messages have threatened german targets no less than five threatening messages have surfaced recently , including a message from al qaeda 's osama bin laden - replete with german subtitles - demanding that europeans leave afghanistan .
other video threats have been delivered , including a video discovered on friday , which , according to the german interior ministry , had come from the taliban " because of your commitment here against islam , attacking germany has become an attractive idea for us , the mujahedeen , " a man calling himself " ajjub " spoke in german in the video .
the footage included images of potential targets such as munich 's oktoberfest festival , as well as the brandenburg gate in berlin and cologne 's massive cathedral . images of defense minister franz-josef jung and interior minister wolfgang shaeuble were also shown .
this latest video was just another in a string of threats apparently designed to cast a pall over sunday 's national elections .
no fear-mongering meanwhile , chairman of the islamic council of germany , ali kizilkaya , released a statement saying that he was happy with interior minister schaeuble 's management of the threats so far .
" even in this tense stage of the election campaign , all the democrats have refrained from exploiting the threats , " he said .
the no-fly zone will remain in effect until oct .
4 , when the festival comes to an end .

26 .
the airspace restriction came at the request of the federal interior ministry .
munich 's theresienwiese beer garden is spread over 77 acres -lrb- 31 hectares -rrb- , where 6 million people join in the 16-day celebration every year .
" a no-fly zone appears to be a necessity , given the current security situation , " herrmann said , referring to the multiple terrorist threats directed at germany over the past few days .
on thursday , fears about commercial flights transiting over the festival grounds led to several concerned phone calls to the authorities by oktoberfest attendees .
a torrent of terrorist threats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : video messages have threatened german targets no less than five threatening messages have surfaced recently , including a message from al qaeda 's osama bin laden - replete with german subtitles - demanding that europeans leave afghanistan .
other video threats have been delivered , including a video discovered on friday , which , according to the german interior ministry , had come from the taliban " because of your commitment here against islam , attacking germany has become an attractive idea for us , the mujahedeen , " a man calling himself " ajjub " spoke in german in the video .
the footage included images of potential targets such as munich 's oktoberfest festival , as well as the brandenburg gate in berlin and cologne 's massive cathedral . images of defense minister franz-josef jung and interior minister wolfgang shaeuble were also shown .
this latest video was just another in a string of threats apparently designed to cast a pall over sunday 's national elections .
no fear-mongering meanwhile , chairman of the islamic council of germany , ali kizilkaya , released a statement saying that he was happy with interior minister schaeuble 's management of the threats so far .
" even in this tense stage of the election campaign , all the democrats have refrained from exploiting the threats , " he said .
the no-fly zone will remain in effect until oct .
4 , when the festival comes to an end .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 26.09.2009 mixed reactions to us policy shift towards burma großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to engage directly with burma 's military regime for the first time in 14 years , burma 's prime minister , thein sein , will travel to the un 's general assembly meeting .
the move comes as the us has said it wants to engage diplomatically with the country ’ s regime . washington 's new policy towards burma will include more direct and deeper engagement with the junta .
us secretary of state hillary clinton made the announcement on the sidelines of the united nations general assembly in new york this week .
however , she insisted that sanctions against the regime would remain an important part of us policy .
" engagement versus sanctions is a false choice in our opinion .
going forward , we will be employing both of those tools , pursuing our same goal .
to help achieve democratic reform we will be engaging directly with burmese authorities . "
clinton also said that the change in policy did not mean there would be any compromise on the demands for credible democratic reform and the unconditional release of all political prisoners , including pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi .
there have been mixed reactions to clinton 's announcement .
some activists doubt whether it will really help to bring about change in the country , which has been in the tight grip of the junta for decades .
sonny aung than oo from the germany-based ngo burma bureau is skeptical : " until now the regime has not cared about any of the un 's demands or those of the international community .
they do n't care .
they keep going their own way .
they have killed monks in the past and many people are political prisoners . "
but other observers think the new policy might have some positive effects in view of the fact that economic sanctions and aid restrictions imposed by western governments in the past have failed to persuade the junta to introduce democratic reforms .
failed sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sanctions have not improved the situation in burma robert templer of the international crisis group in new york explains that the sanction regime did n't really work : " the sanctions were never universally applied .
china did n't apply them , india did n't apply them .
none of the neighboring states have any sanctions on myanmar -lrb- the official name given to burma by its military rulers -rrb- .
so , myanmar 's economy has been hurt to some degree but it has been hurt by its own policies more than by the western sanctions . "
there was first talk about a possible shift in policy towards burma after us senator jim webb , an ardent advocate for easing the sanctions , travelled there last month .
he secured the release of john yettaw , an american who had been jailed for swimming to suu kyi 's house .
webb met the detained pro-democracy leader during his trip , as well as top generals .
for the international crisis group 's templer , washington 's latest change in course is a sign of pragmatism : " for the past nearly 20 years , they have not had high-level contacts with the regime and that lack of contact has really created a diplomatic vacuum , which is very much filled by china , " he says .
" so , even if the us does n't like the government there and does n't regard it as democratic , it does feel the need to discuss a variety of issues with it and to try to find some common ground and some avenues for progress as it has been a very static situation for a long time . "
less paranoia templer added that although it might be a slow process , any contact that the junta had with the outside world was likely to persuade it to introduce reforms eventually .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition leader aung san suu kyi supports the policy shift " it will make them more confident and less paranoid , " he said .
" it will make them more aware of the possibilities of re-engaging with the international community .
engagement tends to have a better record in promoting transformation than isolation . "
aung san suu kyi , for her part , has welcomed the us 's announcement of a policy shift .
according to her lawyer nyan win , she said washington 's direct engagement with burma would be welcome as long as there were talks with the government , but also the opposition .

that spot stays with hamburg sv for the fourth straight week . after hamburg 's draw against frankfurt last week and bayern 's third straight league win over nuremberg left just three points between the two sides , bayern was in a good position to close the gap on hamburg coming into saturday 's match .
hamburg had the advantage of home turf , but were coming off a loss on penalty kicks earlier in the week in the german cup .
bayern , on the other hand , was fresh of a 5-0 german cup drubbing of rw oberhausen and was hungry for a glimpse from the top of the league .
there was no clear favorite for most of the game and the equally matched squads appeared to be headed for a draw until hamburg 's mladen petric scored the winning goal in the 72nd minute to tip the game 1-0 to hamburg .
bayern coach louis van gaal acknowledged that hamburg had earned the victory .
" it was a great game .
we had several chances but we did n't take them .
that was the problem - and hamburg are a top side .
the side that gets the goal wins it , " he said .
the loss drops bayern munich to sixth in the league , and they trail hamburg by six points .
leverkusen stays in the hunt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc cologne 's season has n't been able to get off the ground while hamburg were able to dispatch one challenger to their top position in the table , bayer leverkusen remains close on hamburg 's heels with a 1-0 win over fc cologne .
in cologne 's german cup match during the week , a 3-2 victory over defending bundesliga champs wolfsburg was a glimmer of hope for the team in what has been an otherwise dismal season .
despite holding leverkusen goalless for nearly the entire game , leverkusen 's simon rolfes slipped one into the net in the 82nd minute to put an end to cologne 's short-lived success .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 26.09.2009 mixed reactions to us policy shift towards burma großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to engage directly with burma 's military regime for the first time in 14 years , burma 's prime minister , thein sein , will travel to the un 's general assembly meeting .
the move comes as the us has said it wants to engage diplomatically with the country ’ s regime . washington 's new policy towards burma will include more direct and deeper engagement with the junta .
us secretary of state hillary clinton made the announcement on the sidelines of the united nations general assembly in new york this week .
however , she insisted that sanctions against the regime would remain an important part of us policy .
" engagement versus sanctions is a false choice in our opinion .
going forward , we will be employing both of those tools , pursuing our same goal .
to help achieve democratic reform we will be engaging directly with burmese authorities . "
clinton also said that the change in policy did not mean there would be any compromise on the demands for credible democratic reform and the unconditional release of all political prisoners , including pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi .
there have been mixed reactions to clinton 's announcement .
some activists doubt whether it will really help to bring about change in the country , which has been in the tight grip of the junta for decades .
sonny aung than oo from the germany-based ngo burma bureau is skeptical : " until now the regime has not cared about any of the un 's demands or those of the international community .
they do n't care .
they keep going their own way .
they have killed monks in the past and many people are political prisoners . "
but other observers think the new policy might have some positive effects in view of the fact that economic sanctions and aid restrictions imposed by western governments in the past have failed to persuade the junta to introduce democratic reforms .
failed sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sanctions have not improved the situation in burma robert templer of the international crisis group in new york explains that the sanction regime did n't really work : " the sanctions were never universally applied .
china did n't apply them , india did n't apply them .

so , myanmar 's economy has been hurt to some degree but it has been hurt by its own policies more than by the western sanctions . "
there was first talk about a possible shift in policy towards burma after us senator jim webb , an ardent advocate for easing the sanctions , travelled there last month .
he secured the release of john yettaw , an american who had been jailed for swimming to suu kyi 's house .
webb met the detained pro-democracy leader during his trip , as well as top generals .
for the international crisis group 's templer , washington 's latest change in course is a sign of pragmatism : " for the past nearly 20 years , they have not had high-level contacts with the regime and that lack of contact has really created a diplomatic vacuum , which is very much filled by china , " he says .
" so , even if the us does n't like the government there and does n't regard it as democratic , it does feel the need to discuss a variety of issues with it and to try to find some common ground and some avenues for progress as it has been a very static situation for a long time . "
less paranoia templer added that although it might be a slow process , any contact that the junta had with the outside world was likely to persuade it to introduce reforms eventually .

the move comes as the us has said it wants to engage diplomatically with the country ’ s regime . washington 's new policy towards burma will include more direct and deeper engagement with the junta .
us secretary of state hillary clinton made the announcement on the sidelines of the united nations general assembly in new york this week .
however , she insisted that sanctions against the regime would remain an important part of us policy .
" engagement versus sanctions is a false choice in our opinion .
going forward , we will be employing both of those tools , pursuing our same goal .
to help achieve democratic reform we will be engaging directly with burmese authorities . "
clinton also said that the change in policy did not mean there would be any compromise on the demands for credible democratic reform and the unconditional release of all political prisoners , including pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi .
there have been mixed reactions to clinton 's announcement .
some activists doubt whether it will really help to bring about change in the country , which has been in the tight grip of the junta for decades .
sonny aung than oo from the germany-based ngo burma bureau is skeptical : " until now the regime has not cared about any of the un 's demands or those of the international community .
they do n't care .
they keep going their own way .
they have killed monks in the past and many people are political prisoners . "
but other observers think the new policy might have some positive effects in view of the fact that economic sanctions and aid restrictions imposed by western governments in the past have failed to persuade the junta to introduce democratic reforms .
failed sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sanctions have not improved the situation in burma robert templer of the international crisis group in new york explains that the sanction regime did n't really work : " the sanctions were never universally applied .
china did n't apply them , india did n't apply them .
none of the neighboring states have any sanctions on myanmar -lrb- the official name given to burma by its military rulers -rrb- .
so , myanmar 's economy has been hurt to some degree but it has been hurt by its own policies more than by the western sanctions . "

that spot stays with hamburg sv for the fourth straight week . after hamburg 's draw against frankfurt last week and bayern 's third straight league win over nuremberg left just three points between the two sides , bayern was in a good position to close the gap on hamburg coming into saturday 's match .
hamburg had the advantage of home turf , but were coming off a loss on penalty kicks earlier in the week in the german cup .
bayern , on the other hand , was fresh of a 5-0 german cup drubbing of rw oberhausen and was hungry for a glimpse from the top of the league .
there was no clear favorite for most of the game and the equally matched squads appeared to be headed for a draw until hamburg 's mladen petric scored the winning goal in the 72nd minute to tip the game 1-0 to hamburg .
bayern coach louis van gaal acknowledged that hamburg had earned the victory .
" it was a great game .
we had several chances but we did n't take them .
that was the problem - and hamburg are a top side .
the side that gets the goal wins it , " he said .
the loss drops bayern munich to sixth in the league , and they trail hamburg by six points .
leverkusen stays in the hunt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc cologne 's season has n't been able to get off the ground while hamburg were able to dispatch one challenger to their top position in the table , bayer leverkusen remains close on hamburg 's heels with a 1-0 win over fc cologne .
in cologne 's german cup match during the week , a 3-2 victory over defending bundesliga champs wolfsburg was a glimmer of hope for the team in what has been an otherwise dismal season .
despite holding leverkusen goalless for nearly the entire game , leverkusen 's simon rolfes slipped one into the net in the 82nd minute to put an end to cologne 's short-lived success .
leverkusen are second in the bundesliga to hamburg on goal difference , while cologne continues to languish in second to last place .
wins for wolfsburg and werder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke fans take over a dortmund flag schalke 04 trail hamburg and leverkusen by four points but managed to move up in the table to third place with a 1-0 victory over dortmund .
the game 's only goal came from peruvian striker jefferson farfan in the 31st minute .
the highest scoring match of the day was a 4-2 win for vfl wolfsburg against hanover .
last year 's bundesliga champs used four different scorers to dispatch hanover .
zvjezdan misimovic , christian gentner , makoto hasebe , and edin dzeko all found the back of the net , and wolfsburg 's alexander madlung even gave a goal away , scoring an own-goal in the 50th minute .
hanover 's other goal came from hanno balitsch .
wolfsburg have been hit and miss so far this season , winning four and losing three .
they are currently in fifth place and tied on points with werder bremen , who beat mainz 3-0 on two goals from claudio pizarro and one from aaron hunt .
rounding out saturday 's matches , vfb stuttgart blanked eintracht frankfurt 3-0 thanks to two goals from u-21 national striker julian schieber in the 17th and 31st minute .
thomas hitzlsperger added the third insurance goal for suttgart in the 54th minute .
in friday 's only game , bochum beat nuremberg 1-0 .
the bundesliga 's seventh game day continues sunday as freiburg try to keep their momentum going against borussia moenchengladbach after beating hertha berlin 4-0 last week .

" whatever we did was within the legal framework and in line with all iaea regulations , " salehi said . the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- required iran to notify them about any new nuclear plant six months before it became operational .
salehi said that he had let them know about the plant well in advance of the deadline : the new site is n't due to go online before the end of 2010 . iran 's revolutionary guards also announced on saturday plans to hold missile defense drills over several days beginning on sunday .
their website said the exercises would include simultaneous firings of missiles at targets .
a statement quoted by iranian news agencies named the purpose as " maintaining and improving the deterrent capability of the armed forces . " un urges iran to cooperate united nations secretary ban ki moon , who met the iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on friday evening in new york , had urged tehran to implement relevant security council resolutions and to co-operate with the iaea on resolving concerns related to its nuclear activities . ahmadinejad , however , insisted that his country had done nothing wrong .

she said germany , like france , britain and the us was " deeply concerned " about the plant , which violated the requirements laid down by the un and the iaea . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also criticized iran , saying that the revelation increased existing doubts about its nuclear program . six major world powers - britain , france , russia , china , germany and the united states - are meeting iran 's top nuclear negotiator saeed jalili in geneva next week for talks on ways to allay those doubts . meanwhile , the head of iran 's nuclear program , ali akbar salehi , has said that construction of the second plant was necessary in order to ensure continued uranium enrichment in the event of foreign air raids on other sites . speaking on iranian television , he said " considering the threats , our organization decided to do what is necessary to preserve and continue our nuclear activities . "
he added that they would not stop their nuclear activities " at any cost . " inspections expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bird 's eye view of iran 's natanz nuclear facility prior to this week , iran 's only known enrichment facility was at natanz , near the central city of isfahan . europe and the us said they believe that the scale of the new plant is such that uranium could be enriched to far higher levels than at natanz , possibly to weapons-grade .
the us president said that he expects iaea inspectors “ to immediately investigate this disturbing information and to report to the iaea board of governors . " the iaea said on friday that iran had sent a letter on monday confirming that it was indeed constructing the facility . iranian state news agency isna reported that tehran had told the vienna-based agency the plant would produce nuclear fuel with an enrichment level of only up to 5 percent - insufficient for use in nuclear weapons . svs / tkw / reuters / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

separately , it announced plans to hold missile defense drills to test its military capabilities . the head of iran 's atomic organization , ali akbar salehi , told iranian state television on saturday , sept .
26 , that " there will be an inspection in due time , " without mentioning a date . " whatever we did was within the legal framework and in line with all iaea regulations , " salehi said . the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- required iran to notify them about any new nuclear plant six months before it became operational .
salehi said that he had let them know about the plant well in advance of the deadline : the new site is n't due to go online before the end of 2010 . iran 's revolutionary guards also announced on saturday plans to hold missile defense drills over several days beginning on sunday .
their website said the exercises would include simultaneous firings of missiles at targets .
a statement quoted by iranian news agencies named the purpose as " maintaining and improving the deterrent capability of the armed forces . " un urges iran to cooperate united nations secretary ban ki moon , who met the iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on friday evening in new york , had urged tehran to implement relevant security council resolutions and to co-operate with the iaea on resolving concerns related to its nuclear activities . ahmadinejad , however , insisted that his country had done nothing wrong .

" i think iran is on notice that , when we meet with them on oct .
1 , they are going to have to come clean and they are going to have to make a choice .

she said germany , like france , britain and the us was " deeply concerned " about the plant , which violated the requirements laid down by the un and the iaea . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also criticized iran , saying that the revelation increased existing doubts about its nuclear program . six major world powers - britain , france , russia , china , germany and the united states - are meeting iran 's top nuclear negotiator saeed jalili in geneva next week for talks on ways to allay those doubts . meanwhile , the head of iran 's nuclear program , ali akbar salehi , has said that construction of the second plant was necessary in order to ensure continued uranium enrichment in the event of foreign air raids on other sites . speaking on iranian television , he said " considering the threats , our organization decided to do what is necessary to preserve and continue our nuclear activities . "
he added that they would not stop their nuclear activities " at any cost . " inspections expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bird 's eye view of iran 's natanz nuclear facility prior to this week , iran 's only known enrichment facility was at natanz , near the central city of isfahan . europe and the us said they believe that the scale of the new plant is such that uranium could be enriched to far higher levels than at natanz , possibly to weapons-grade .
the us president said that he expects iaea inspectors “ to immediately investigate this disturbing information and to report to the iaea board of governors . " the iaea said on friday that iran had sent a letter on monday confirming that it was indeed constructing the facility . iranian state news agency isna reported that tehran had told the vienna-based agency the plant would produce nuclear fuel with an enrichment level of only up to 5 percent - insufficient for use in nuclear weapons . svs / tkw / reuters / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the airspace restriction came at the request of the federal interior ministry .
munich 's theresienwiese beer garden is spread over 77 acres -lrb- 31 hectares -rrb- , where 6 million people join in the 16-day celebration every year .
" a no-fly zone appears to be a necessity , given the current security situation , " herrmann said , referring to the multiple terrorist threats directed at germany over the past few days .
on thursday , fears about commercial flights transiting over the festival grounds led to several concerned phone calls to the authorities by oktoberfest attendees .
a torrent of terrorist threats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : video messages have threatened german targets no less than five threatening messages have surfaced recently , including a message from al qaeda 's osama bin laden - replete with german subtitles - demanding that europeans leave afghanistan .
other video threats have been delivered , including a video discovered on friday , which , according to the german interior ministry , had come from the taliban " because of your commitment here against islam , attacking germany has become an attractive idea for us , the mujahedeen , " a man calling himself " ajjub " spoke in german in the video .
the footage included images of potential targets such as munich 's oktoberfest festival , as well as the brandenburg gate in berlin and cologne 's massive cathedral . images of defense minister franz-josef jung and interior minister wolfgang shaeuble were also shown .
this latest video was just another in a string of threats apparently designed to cast a pall over sunday 's national elections .
no fear-mongering meanwhile , chairman of the islamic council of germany , ali kizilkaya , released a statement saying that he was happy with interior minister schaeuble 's management of the threats so far .
" even in this tense stage of the election campaign , all the democrats have refrained from exploiting the threats , " he said .
the no-fly zone will remain in effect until oct .
4 , when the festival comes to an end .

26 .
the airspace restriction came at the request of the federal interior ministry .
munich 's theresienwiese beer garden is spread over 77 acres -lrb- 31 hectares -rrb- , where 6 million people join in the 16-day celebration every year .
" a no-fly zone appears to be a necessity , given the current security situation , " herrmann said , referring to the multiple terrorist threats directed at germany over the past few days .
on thursday , fears about commercial flights transiting over the festival grounds led to several concerned phone calls to the authorities by oktoberfest attendees .
a torrent of terrorist threats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : video messages have threatened german targets no less than five threatening messages have surfaced recently , including a message from al qaeda 's osama bin laden - replete with german subtitles - demanding that europeans leave afghanistan .
other video threats have been delivered , including a video discovered on friday , which , according to the german interior ministry , had come from the taliban " because of your commitment here against islam , attacking germany has become an attractive idea for us , the mujahedeen , " a man calling himself " ajjub " spoke in german in the video .
the footage included images of potential targets such as munich 's oktoberfest festival , as well as the brandenburg gate in berlin and cologne 's massive cathedral . images of defense minister franz-josef jung and interior minister wolfgang shaeuble were also shown .
this latest video was just another in a string of threats apparently designed to cast a pall over sunday 's national elections .
no fear-mongering meanwhile , chairman of the islamic council of germany , ali kizilkaya , released a statement saying that he was happy with interior minister schaeuble 's management of the threats so far .
" even in this tense stage of the election campaign , all the democrats have refrained from exploiting the threats , " he said .
the no-fly zone will remain in effect until oct .
4 , when the festival comes to an end .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 26.09.2009 mixed reactions to us policy shift towards burma großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to engage directly with burma 's military regime for the first time in 14 years , burma 's prime minister , thein sein , will travel to the un 's general assembly meeting .
the move comes as the us has said it wants to engage diplomatically with the country ’ s regime . washington 's new policy towards burma will include more direct and deeper engagement with the junta .
us secretary of state hillary clinton made the announcement on the sidelines of the united nations general assembly in new york this week .
however , she insisted that sanctions against the regime would remain an important part of us policy .
" engagement versus sanctions is a false choice in our opinion .
going forward , we will be employing both of those tools , pursuing our same goal .
to help achieve democratic reform we will be engaging directly with burmese authorities . "
clinton also said that the change in policy did not mean there would be any compromise on the demands for credible democratic reform and the unconditional release of all political prisoners , including pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi .
there have been mixed reactions to clinton 's announcement .
some activists doubt whether it will really help to bring about change in the country , which has been in the tight grip of the junta for decades .
sonny aung than oo from the germany-based ngo burma bureau is skeptical : " until now the regime has not cared about any of the un 's demands or those of the international community .
they do n't care .
they keep going their own way .
they have killed monks in the past and many people are political prisoners . "
but other observers think the new policy might have some positive effects in view of the fact that economic sanctions and aid restrictions imposed by western governments in the past have failed to persuade the junta to introduce democratic reforms .
failed sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sanctions have not improved the situation in burma robert templer of the international crisis group in new york explains that the sanction regime did n't really work : " the sanctions were never universally applied .
china did n't apply them , india did n't apply them .
none of the neighboring states have any sanctions on myanmar -lrb- the official name given to burma by its military rulers -rrb- .
so , myanmar 's economy has been hurt to some degree but it has been hurt by its own policies more than by the western sanctions . "
there was first talk about a possible shift in policy towards burma after us senator jim webb , an ardent advocate for easing the sanctions , travelled there last month .
he secured the release of john yettaw , an american who had been jailed for swimming to suu kyi 's house .
webb met the detained pro-democracy leader during his trip , as well as top generals .
for the international crisis group 's templer , washington 's latest change in course is a sign of pragmatism : " for the past nearly 20 years , they have not had high-level contacts with the regime and that lack of contact has really created a diplomatic vacuum , which is very much filled by china , " he says .
" so , even if the us does n't like the government there and does n't regard it as democratic , it does feel the need to discuss a variety of issues with it and to try to find some common ground and some avenues for progress as it has been a very static situation for a long time . "
less paranoia templer added that although it might be a slow process , any contact that the junta had with the outside world was likely to persuade it to introduce reforms eventually .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition leader aung san suu kyi supports the policy shift " it will make them more confident and less paranoid , " he said .
" it will make them more aware of the possibilities of re-engaging with the international community .
engagement tends to have a better record in promoting transformation than isolation . "
aung san suu kyi , for her part , has welcomed the us 's announcement of a policy shift .
according to her lawyer nyan win , she said washington 's direct engagement with burma would be welcome as long as there were talks with the government , but also the opposition .

but for musicians aiming to be stars , they 're the key to a successful career .
dw follows young hopefuls as they brave the jury that could decide their future . johannes brahms ' father , in his time the foremost double bassist in hamburg , is said to have pointed out that a correct note on his instrument is a crapshoot - at best .
that rings true if you listen to bass players struggle , but one could ask why that is .
after all , they have so much more space to hit the right note - inches more , seemingly - than violinists .
one person who gave an answer to the question is a first-round participant at the ard international music competition , which wrapped up recently in munich .
" we do n't have more space for the right note .
the right note is just as precise a point on the fingerboard as on the violin , " said 19-year-old ha-young jung , who was born and raised in seoul and is now based in london .
she was one of the 40 bassists who were accepted and made the trip to munich for the ard competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung started playing music as a child " but we have two inches of wrong note between each right one .
and we have to move our arms inches , not our fingers millimeters , to get from one note to the next , " she pointed out .
that 's good to keep in mind when listening to a first round of double bassists in any competition .
right notes are indeed exceptions to a cacophonous rule .
competitions expand repertoire jung said she was excited to participate in the ard competition because it involved learning so much .
" i think competitions are very good because we have to play and prepare for so many pieces in such a short period , " she said .
she said she thought focusing on competitions too much , however , could be limiting .
" it can get a little bit tense when you think about how to play without making mistakes or that one needs to be perfect all the time . "
she tries not to worry about what judges think too much .
" at the end of the day , music is so personal that i ca n't possibly know what it is the jury really likes .
so i do what i like . "
then , with a glance at her regular russian pianist , who fulfils a role somewhere between ersatz -mother and drillmaster , she quipped , " or what my accompanist wants . "
the bass as solo instrument bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bassists were once mostly men ; that is changing ten or fifteen years ago , women playing the double bass were still a rare sight .
that is changing now , but jung still gets funny looks - not necessarily because she 's a woman playing the double bass , but because she is , or wants to be , a solo bass player .
" many people do n't consider the bass a solo instrument , " she pointed out .
" its register is low , its sound difficult to project when you play with an orchestra .
but i think it depends on how a player brings out the qualities of the instrument , rather than on the instrument itself . "
she would n't want to limit herself to just solo bass , however .
" i love playing chamber music , i love playing with chamber orchestras … i just love playing bass , really . "
expanding the repertoire playing in an orchestra , while enjoyable , is also challenging .
" when i play in an orchestra for a few days , i get very , very ill , because i just give everything , " she said .
but then she waxed philosophical .
" there 's something about the very big picture that 's part of playing in an orchestra and i enjoy it very much - and some aspects are even more demanding than playing solo . "
in the competition in munich , jung played - among others - bottesini 's “ elegy and tarantella . "
every phrase made musical sense and her unbridled energy made it seem like someone had opened the windows in the windowless studio .
" there is n't a lot of repertoire for the bass anyway , compared to other instruments , " she said .
" but bottesini is one of the few composers who really tried to expand the repertoire and i think he 's very musical , very much fun to play , and fun to listen to . "
still , she did n't advance in the competition .
following her disappointment and departure from munich , jung was upbeat again .
she was looking forward to a recital at wigmore hall in london with famous violinist sarah chang .
weight matters before she left , there was question one question she still had to answer : did she ever feel stuck with the double bass and so little music to be grateful for ? " well , there are many ways to look at this .
for me , i do n't envy pianists or violinists ... i do n't envy the particular repertoire they have , even if it is so much bigger and , well , better .
i 'm happy playing bass . "
then , glancing at her colleagues hauling basses about , " what i envy is the size of other instruments ! "

european union and chinese officials at the g-20 summit in pittsburgh said that a tentative deal was in place to give rising powers greater voting power in the international monetary fund " as things stand now , we believe that all parties have the strong will to accelerate reform of the international financial institutions , " chinese vice foreign minister he yafei said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reform is coming to the imf brazil , russia , india and china , known as the bric countries , had requested earlier this month that the most developed countries reduce their voting share in the imf to 50 percent , down from 57 percent .
they argued that a number of european nations wielded inordinate influence on the fund , especially inappropriate in light of the fact that their economies had been surpassed in size by bric countries in recent decades .
the united states , too , has occasionally grumbled that europe has too much say in imf policy decisions .
statement of principles it appears that , in pittsburgh , europe has relented , in part , to putting its stamp on the g-20 's draft agreement on economic policy .
china , along with other countries that have been criticized for running large , unhealthy surpluses and relying on exports for growth , are being urged to boost domestic consumption .
at the same time , countries with outsized public debt , such as the united states , are called on to promote private savings .
" we recognize that the process to ensure more balanced global growth must be undertaken in an orderly manner .

separately , it announced plans to hold missile defense drills to test its military capabilities . the head of iran 's atomic organization , ali akbar salehi , told iranian state television on saturday , sept .
26 , that " there will be an inspection in due time , " without mentioning a date . " whatever we did was within the legal framework and in line with all iaea regulations , " salehi said . the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- required iran to notify them about any new nuclear plant six months before it became operational .
salehi said that he had let them know about the plant well in advance of the deadline : the new site is n't due to go online before the end of 2010 . iran 's revolutionary guards also announced on saturday plans to hold missile defense drills over several days beginning on sunday .
their website said the exercises would include simultaneous firings of missiles at targets .
a statement quoted by iranian news agencies named the purpose as " maintaining and improving the deterrent capability of the armed forces . " un urges iran to cooperate united nations secretary ban ki moon , who met the iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on friday evening in new york , had urged tehran to implement relevant security council resolutions and to co-operate with the iaea on resolving concerns related to its nuclear activities . ahmadinejad , however , insisted that his country had done nothing wrong . " it is not a secret site , " he told reporters at a news conference in new york . us president barack obama and a host of european leaders , including german chancellor angela merkel , however , made clear their doubts that the new facility was strictly for the peaceful generation of energy . playing with an open hand obama said it was time for tehran to put its cards on the table .
" i think iran is on notice that , when we meet with them on oct .
1 , they are going to have to come clean and they are going to have to make a choice .

she said germany , like france , britain and the us was " deeply concerned " about the plant , which violated the requirements laid down by the un and the iaea . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also criticized iran , saying that the revelation increased existing doubts about its nuclear program . six major world powers - britain , france , russia , china , germany and the united states - are meeting iran 's top nuclear negotiator saeed jalili in geneva next week for talks on ways to allay those doubts . meanwhile , the head of iran 's nuclear program , ali akbar salehi , has said that construction of the second plant was necessary in order to ensure continued uranium enrichment in the event of foreign air raids on other sites . speaking on iranian television , he said " considering the threats , our organization decided to do what is necessary to preserve and continue our nuclear activities . "
he added that they would not stop their nuclear activities " at any cost .

the us president said that he expects iaea inspectors “ to immediately investigate this disturbing information and to report to the iaea board of governors . " the iaea said on friday that iran had sent a letter on monday confirming that it was indeed constructing the facility . iranian state news agency isna reported that tehran had told the vienna-based agency the plant would produce nuclear fuel with an enrichment level of only up to 5 percent - insufficient for use in nuclear weapons . svs / tkw / reuters / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 26.09.2009 mixed reactions to us policy shift towards burma großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to engage directly with burma 's military regime for the first time in 14 years , burma 's prime minister , thein sein , will travel to the un 's general assembly meeting .
the move comes as the us has said it wants to engage diplomatically with the country ’ s regime . washington 's new policy towards burma will include more direct and deeper engagement with the junta .
us secretary of state hillary clinton made the announcement on the sidelines of the united nations general assembly in new york this week .
however , she insisted that sanctions against the regime would remain an important part of us policy .
" engagement versus sanctions is a false choice in our opinion .
going forward , we will be employing both of those tools , pursuing our same goal .
to help achieve democratic reform we will be engaging directly with burmese authorities . "
clinton also said that the change in policy did not mean there would be any compromise on the demands for credible democratic reform and the unconditional release of all political prisoners , including pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi .
there have been mixed reactions to clinton 's announcement .
some activists doubt whether it will really help to bring about change in the country , which has been in the tight grip of the junta for decades .
sonny aung than oo from the germany-based ngo burma bureau is skeptical : " until now the regime has not cared about any of the un 's demands or those of the international community .
they do n't care .
they keep going their own way .
they have killed monks in the past and many people are political prisoners . "
but other observers think the new policy might have some positive effects in view of the fact that economic sanctions and aid restrictions imposed by western governments in the past have failed to persuade the junta to introduce democratic reforms .
failed sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sanctions have not improved the situation in burma robert templer of the international crisis group in new york explains that the sanction regime did n't really work : " the sanctions were never universally applied .
china did n't apply them , india did n't apply them .
none of the neighboring states have any sanctions on myanmar -lrb- the official name given to burma by its military rulers -rrb- .
so , myanmar 's economy has been hurt to some degree but it has been hurt by its own policies more than by the western sanctions . "
there was first talk about a possible shift in policy towards burma after us senator jim webb , an ardent advocate for easing the sanctions , travelled there last month .
he secured the release of john yettaw , an american who had been jailed for swimming to suu kyi 's house .
webb met the detained pro-democracy leader during his trip , as well as top generals .
for the international crisis group 's templer , washington 's latest change in course is a sign of pragmatism : " for the past nearly 20 years , they have not had high-level contacts with the regime and that lack of contact has really created a diplomatic vacuum , which is very much filled by china , " he says .
" so , even if the us does n't like the government there and does n't regard it as democratic , it does feel the need to discuss a variety of issues with it and to try to find some common ground and some avenues for progress as it has been a very static situation for a long time . "
less paranoia templer added that although it might be a slow process , any contact that the junta had with the outside world was likely to persuade it to introduce reforms eventually .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition leader aung san suu kyi supports the policy shift " it will make them more confident and less paranoid , " he said .
" it will make them more aware of the possibilities of re-engaging with the international community .
engagement tends to have a better record in promoting transformation than isolation . "
aung san suu kyi , for her part , has welcomed the us 's announcement of a policy shift .
according to her lawyer nyan win , she said washington 's direct engagement with burma would be welcome as long as there were talks with the government , but also the opposition .

but for musicians aiming to be stars , they 're the key to a successful career .
dw follows young hopefuls as they brave the jury that could decide their future . johannes brahms ' father , in his time the foremost double bassist in hamburg , is said to have pointed out that a correct note on his instrument is a crapshoot - at best .
that rings true if you listen to bass players struggle , but one could ask why that is .
after all , they have so much more space to hit the right note - inches more , seemingly - than violinists .
one person who gave an answer to the question is a first-round participant at the ard international music competition , which wrapped up recently in munich .
" we do n't have more space for the right note .
the right note is just as precise a point on the fingerboard as on the violin , " said 19-year-old ha-young jung , who was born and raised in seoul and is now based in london .
she was one of the 40 bassists who were accepted and made the trip to munich for the ard competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung started playing music as a child " but we have two inches of wrong note between each right one .
and we have to move our arms inches , not our fingers millimeters , to get from one note to the next , " she pointed out .
that 's good to keep in mind when listening to a first round of double bassists in any competition .
right notes are indeed exceptions to a cacophonous rule .
competitions expand repertoire jung said she was excited to participate in the ard competition because it involved learning so much .
" i think competitions are very good because we have to play and prepare for so many pieces in such a short period , " she said .
she said she thought focusing on competitions too much , however , could be limiting .
" it can get a little bit tense when you think about how to play without making mistakes or that one needs to be perfect all the time . "
she tries not to worry about what judges think too much .
" at the end of the day , music is so personal that i ca n't possibly know what it is the jury really likes .
so i do what i like . "
then , with a glance at her regular russian pianist , who fulfils a role somewhere between ersatz -mother and drillmaster , she quipped , " or what my accompanist wants . "
the bass as solo instrument bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bassists were once mostly men ; that is changing ten or fifteen years ago , women playing the double bass were still a rare sight .
that is changing now , but jung still gets funny looks - not necessarily because she 's a woman playing the double bass , but because she is , or wants to be , a solo bass player .
" many people do n't consider the bass a solo instrument , " she pointed out .
" its register is low , its sound difficult to project when you play with an orchestra .
but i think it depends on how a player brings out the qualities of the instrument , rather than on the instrument itself . "
she would n't want to limit herself to just solo bass , however .
" i love playing chamber music , i love playing with chamber orchestras … i just love playing bass , really . "
expanding the repertoire playing in an orchestra , while enjoyable , is also challenging .
" when i play in an orchestra for a few days , i get very , very ill , because i just give everything , " she said .
but then she waxed philosophical .
" there 's something about the very big picture that 's part of playing in an orchestra and i enjoy it very much - and some aspects are even more demanding than playing solo . "
in the competition in munich , jung played - among others - bottesini 's “ elegy and tarantella . "
every phrase made musical sense and her unbridled energy made it seem like someone had opened the windows in the windowless studio .
" there is n't a lot of repertoire for the bass anyway , compared to other instruments , " she said .
" but bottesini is one of the few composers who really tried to expand the repertoire and i think he 's very musical , very much fun to play , and fun to listen to . "
still , she did n't advance in the competition .
following her disappointment and departure from munich , jung was upbeat again .
she was looking forward to a recital at wigmore hall in london with famous violinist sarah chang .
weight matters before she left , there was question one question she still had to answer : did she ever feel stuck with the double bass and so little music to be grateful for ? " well , there are many ways to look at this .
for me , i do n't envy pianists or violinists ... i do n't envy the particular repertoire they have , even if it is so much bigger and , well , better .
i 'm happy playing bass . "
then , glancing at her colleagues hauling basses about , " what i envy is the size of other instruments ! "

european union and chinese officials at the g-20 summit in pittsburgh said that a tentative deal was in place to give rising powers greater voting power in the international monetary fund " as things stand now , we believe that all parties have the strong will to accelerate reform of the international financial institutions , " chinese vice foreign minister he yafei said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reform is coming to the imf brazil , russia , india and china , known as the bric countries , had requested earlier this month that the most developed countries reduce their voting share in the imf to 50 percent , down from 57 percent .
they argued that a number of european nations wielded inordinate influence on the fund , especially inappropriate in light of the fact that their economies had been surpassed in size by bric countries in recent decades .
the united states , too , has occasionally grumbled that europe has too much say in imf policy decisions .
statement of principles it appears that , in pittsburgh , europe has relented , in part , to putting its stamp on the g-20 's draft agreement on economic policy .
china , along with other countries that have been criticized for running large , unhealthy surpluses and relying on exports for growth , are being urged to boost domestic consumption .
at the same time , countries with outsized public debt , such as the united states , are called on to promote private savings .
" we recognize that the process to ensure more balanced global growth must be undertaken in an orderly manner .

european union and chinese officials at the g-20 summit in pittsburgh said that a tentative deal was in place to give rising powers greater voting power in the international monetary fund " as things stand now , we believe that all parties have the strong will to accelerate reform of the international financial institutions , " chinese vice foreign minister he yafei said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reform is coming to the imf brazil , russia , india and china , known as the bric countries , had requested earlier this month that the most developed countries reduce their voting share in the imf to 50 percent , down from 57 percent .
they argued that a number of european nations wielded inordinate influence on the fund , especially inappropriate in light of the fact that their economies had been surpassed in size by bric countries in recent decades .
the united states , too , has occasionally grumbled that europe has too much say in imf policy decisions .
statement of principles it appears that , in pittsburgh , europe has relented , in part , to putting its stamp on the g-20 's draft agreement on economic policy .
china , along with other countries that have been criticized for running large , unhealthy surpluses and relying on exports for growth , are being urged to boost domestic consumption .
at the same time , countries with outsized public debt , such as the united states , are called on to promote private savings .
" we recognize that the process to ensure more balanced global growth must be undertaken in an orderly manner .
all g-20 members agree to address the respective weaknesses of their economies , " the draft agreement declares .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g-20 leaders agreed on a new direction for the financial sector tougher finance rules world leaders also pledged to reform the financial sector in an effort to stop risky banking practices seen as a cause of the global economic crisis .
in a joint statement issued at the end of the summit , g-20 leaders were clear on the new direction of financial regulation . " major failures of regulation and supervision , plus reckless and irresponsible risk taking by banks and other financial institutions , created dangerous financial fragilities that contributed significantly to the current crisis , " the statement said .
" a return to the excessive risk taking prevalent in some countries before the crisis is not an option . " tougher controls on compensation and bonus payments for banking executives were also endorsed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy was satisfied with the g-20 summit many european leaders , including german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , had hoped tackling problems in the financial sector would be at the top of the agenda in pittsburgh . " there was unanimity around the table that the errors of the past wo n't happen again , " sarkozy said after the meeting .
" i am very satisfied by what we decided . " the leaders also agreed to keep emergency stimulus funding in place for the time being , with plans to scale them back when sustainable recovery is reached . while the world 's largest economies agreed to phase out fossil fuel subsidies to combat global warming , climate change was a largely overlooked topic in pittsburgh .
no consensus was reached regarding the amount wealthy nations should pay to support the efforts of developing nations to curb global warming , which is seen as an essential step towards a new global treaty proposed for the copenhagen climate summit in december . mrh / mz / reuters / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an audiotape , the message said they were " sacrificing men and money in an unjust us-led war . " the bin laden tape follows two video threats against germany for its role in afghanistan earlier this week and came just hours after a third german-language tape by a militant calling himself abu talha al-almani , " the german " , alias bekkay harrach , who has threatened a " rude awakening " for germany . the latest bin laden message did not threaten new attacks and contained no mention of germany , except to note that thanks to the financial crisis , " the heart of europe is no longer number one in world exports " .
but the use of subtitles to address a german audience so close to sunday 's general election appeared calculated to provoke public unease . germany has 4,200 troops in afghanistan , a deployment that is highly unpopular with the electorate . the bin laden audio recording , titled " a message to the people of europe " , lashed out at what it called " the injustices " committed by foreign troops in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three videos in a week warn of terror attacks in germany unless its military leaves afghanistan . three videos in a week single out germany by contrast , the third , and most recent , video , also released on friday , was aimed specifically at germany , and said " because of your commitment against islam , attacking germany has become an attractive idea for us , the mujahedeen . " photographs of famous german sites and events then appear , including the brandenburg gate in berlin , munich 's oktoberfest beer festival and cologne 's imposing gothic cathedral .
politicians , including interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and defense minister franz josef jung are also shown . a german crime investigator told deutsche welle that the threat was the most concrete so far due to the people and places mentioned .
he added that there was concern that the spate of messages could signal an attack was indeed being planned . man arrested for posting video the latest flurry of islamist propaganda comes as police announced the arrest of a turkish man suspected of posting the bin laden video . the 25-year-old suspect is known to authorities as a supporter of islamist activists and is said to have been under police observation .
police from germany 's southern city of stuttgart , where the arrest was made , say the man is not thought to have taken part in producing the internet video that threatens germany ahead of the country 's national elections on sunday .
" in searching his apartment , investigators secured numerous items of evidence .
the unemployed suspect , who lived alone , was apparently intensely active on notorious internet platforms , ” the police statement said .
the german government has played down a travel alert issued by the us state department on wednesday warning american citizens in germany to be vigilant .
german officials have heightened security in public spaces and train stations as a precaution .
germany , so far , has not been the target of a major attack by islamist militants .

separately , it announced plans to hold missile defense drills to test its military capabilities . the head of iran 's atomic organization , ali akbar salehi , told iranian state television on saturday , sept .
26 , that " there will be an inspection in due time , " without mentioning a date . " whatever we did was within the legal framework and in line with all iaea regulations , " salehi said . the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- required iran to notify them about any new nuclear plant six months before it became operational .
salehi said that he had let them know about the plant well in advance of the deadline : the new site is n't due to go online before the end of 2010 . iran 's revolutionary guards also announced on saturday plans to hold missile defense drills over several days beginning on sunday .
their website said the exercises would include simultaneous firings of missiles at targets .
a statement quoted by iranian news agencies named the purpose as " maintaining and improving the deterrent capability of the armed forces . " un urges iran to cooperate united nations secretary ban ki moon , who met the iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on friday evening in new york , had urged tehran to implement relevant security council resolutions and to co-operate with the iaea on resolving concerns related to its nuclear activities . ahmadinejad , however , insisted that his country had done nothing wrong .

" i think iran is on notice that , when we meet with them on oct .

she said germany , like france , britain and the us was " deeply concerned " about the plant , which violated the requirements laid down by the un and the iaea . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also criticized iran , saying that the revelation increased existing doubts about its nuclear program . six major world powers - britain , france , russia , china , germany and the united states - are meeting iran 's top nuclear negotiator saeed jalili in geneva next week for talks on ways to allay those doubts . meanwhile , the head of iran 's nuclear program , ali akbar salehi , has said that construction of the second plant was necessary in order to ensure continued uranium enrichment in the event of foreign air raids on other sites . speaking on iranian television , he said " considering the threats , our organization decided to do what is necessary to preserve and continue our nuclear activities . "
he added that they would not stop their nuclear activities " at any cost .

the us president said that he expects iaea inspectors “ to immediately investigate this disturbing information and to report to the iaea board of governors . " the iaea said on friday that iran had sent a letter on monday confirming that it was indeed constructing the facility . iranian state news agency isna reported that tehran had told the vienna-based agency the plant would produce nuclear fuel with an enrichment level of only up to 5 percent - insufficient for use in nuclear weapons . svs / tkw / reuters / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move comes as the us has said it wants to engage diplomatically with the country ’ s regime . washington 's new policy towards burma will include more direct and deeper engagement with the junta .
us secretary of state hillary clinton made the announcement on the sidelines of the united nations general assembly in new york this week .
however , she insisted that sanctions against the regime would remain an important part of us policy .
" engagement versus sanctions is a false choice in our opinion .
going forward , we will be employing both of those tools , pursuing our same goal .
to help achieve democratic reform we will be engaging directly with burmese authorities . "
clinton also said that the change in policy did not mean there would be any compromise on the demands for credible democratic reform and the unconditional release of all political prisoners , including pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi .
there have been mixed reactions to clinton 's announcement .
some activists doubt whether it will really help to bring about change in the country , which has been in the tight grip of the junta for decades .
sonny aung than oo from the germany-based ngo burma bureau is skeptical : " until now the regime has not cared about any of the un 's demands or those of the international community .
they do n't care .
they keep going their own way .
they have killed monks in the past and many people are political prisoners . "
but other observers think the new policy might have some positive effects in view of the fact that economic sanctions and aid restrictions imposed by western governments in the past have failed to persuade the junta to introduce democratic reforms .
failed sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sanctions have not improved the situation in burma robert templer of the international crisis group in new york explains that the sanction regime did n't really work : " the sanctions were never universally applied .
china did n't apply them , india did n't apply them .
none of the neighboring states have any sanctions on myanmar -lrb- the official name given to burma by its military rulers -rrb- .
so , myanmar 's economy has been hurt to some degree but it has been hurt by its own policies more than by the western sanctions . "
there was first talk about a possible shift in policy towards burma after us senator jim webb , an ardent advocate for easing the sanctions , travelled there last month .
he secured the release of john yettaw , an american who had been jailed for swimming to suu kyi 's house .
webb met the detained pro-democracy leader during his trip , as well as top generals .
for the international crisis group 's templer , washington 's latest change in course is a sign of pragmatism : " for the past nearly 20 years , they have not had high-level contacts with the regime and that lack of contact has really created a diplomatic vacuum , which is very much filled by china , " he says .
" so , even if the us does n't like the government there and does n't regard it as democratic , it does feel the need to discuss a variety of issues with it and to try to find some common ground and some avenues for progress as it has been a very static situation for a long time . "
less paranoia templer added that although it might be a slow process , any contact that the junta had with the outside world was likely to persuade it to introduce reforms eventually .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition leader aung san suu kyi supports the policy shift " it will make them more confident and less paranoid , " he said .
" it will make them more aware of the possibilities of re-engaging with the international community .
engagement tends to have a better record in promoting transformation than isolation . "
aung san suu kyi , for her part , has welcomed the us 's announcement of a policy shift .
according to her lawyer nyan win , she said washington 's direct engagement with burma would be welcome as long as there were talks with the government , but also the opposition .

clinton also said that the change in policy did not mean there would be any compromise on the demands for credible democratic reform and the unconditional release of all political prisoners , including pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi .
there have been mixed reactions to clinton 's announcement .
some activists doubt whether it will really help to bring about change in the country , which has been in the tight grip of the junta for decades .
sonny aung than oo from the germany-based ngo burma bureau is skeptical : " until now the regime has not cared about any of the un 's demands or those of the international community .
they do n't care .
they keep going their own way .
they have killed monks in the past and many people are political prisoners . "
but other observers think the new policy might have some positive effects in view of the fact that economic sanctions and aid restrictions imposed by western governments in the past have failed to persuade the junta to introduce democratic reforms .
failed sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sanctions have not improved the situation in burma robert templer of the international crisis group in new york explains that the sanction regime did n't really work : " the sanctions were never universally applied .
china did n't apply them , india did n't apply them .
none of the neighboring states have any sanctions on myanmar -lrb- the official name given to burma by its military rulers -rrb- .
so , myanmar 's economy has been hurt to some degree but it has been hurt by its own policies more than by the western sanctions . "
there was first talk about a possible shift in policy towards burma after us senator jim webb , an ardent advocate for easing the sanctions , travelled there last month .
he secured the release of john yettaw , an american who had been jailed for swimming to suu kyi 's house .
webb met the detained pro-democracy leader during his trip , as well as top generals .
for the international crisis group 's templer , washington 's latest change in course is a sign of pragmatism : " for the past nearly 20 years , they have not had high-level contacts with the regime and that lack of contact has really created a diplomatic vacuum , which is very much filled by china , " he says .
" so , even if the us does n't like the government there and does n't regard it as democratic , it does feel the need to discuss a variety of issues with it and to try to find some common ground and some avenues for progress as it has been a very static situation for a long time . "
less paranoia templer added that although it might be a slow process , any contact that the junta had with the outside world was likely to persuade it to introduce reforms eventually .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition leader aung san suu kyi supports the policy shift " it will make them more confident and less paranoid , " he said .
" it will make them more aware of the possibilities of re-engaging with the international community .
engagement tends to have a better record in promoting transformation than isolation . "
aung san suu kyi , for her part , has welcomed the us 's announcement of a policy shift .
according to her lawyer nyan win , she said washington 's direct engagement with burma would be welcome as long as there were talks with the government , but also the opposition .

26 .
the airspace restriction came at the request of the federal interior ministry .
munich 's theresienwiese beer garden is spread over 77 acres -lrb- 31 hectares -rrb- , where 6 million people join in the 16-day celebration every year .
" a no-fly zone appears to be a necessity , given the current security situation , " herrmann said , referring to the multiple terrorist threats directed at germany over the past few days .
on thursday , fears about commercial flights transiting over the festival grounds led to several concerned phone calls to the authorities by oktoberfest attendees .
a torrent of terrorist threats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : video messages have threatened german targets no less than five threatening messages have surfaced recently , including a message from al qaeda 's osama bin laden - replete with german subtitles - demanding that europeans leave afghanistan .
other video threats have been delivered , including a video discovered on friday , which , according to the german interior ministry , had come from the taliban " because of your commitment here against islam , attacking germany has become an attractive idea for us , the mujahedeen , " a man calling himself " ajjub " spoke in german in the video .
the footage included images of potential targets such as munich 's oktoberfest festival , as well as the brandenburg gate in berlin and cologne 's massive cathedral . images of defense minister franz-josef jung and interior minister wolfgang shaeuble were also shown .
this latest video was just another in a string of threats apparently designed to cast a pall over sunday 's national elections .
no fear-mongering meanwhile , chairman of the islamic council of germany , ali kizilkaya , released a statement saying that he was happy with interior minister schaeuble 's management of the threats so far .
" even in this tense stage of the election campaign , all the democrats have refrained from exploiting the threats , " he said .
the no-fly zone will remain in effect until oct .
4 , when the festival comes to an end .

in an audiotape , the message said they were " sacrificing men and money in an unjust us-led war . " the bin laden tape follows two video threats against germany for its role in afghanistan earlier this week and came just hours after a third german-language tape by a militant calling himself abu talha al-almani , " the german " , alias bekkay harrach , who has threatened a " rude awakening " for germany . the latest bin laden message did not threaten new attacks and contained no mention of germany , except to note that thanks to the financial crisis , " the heart of europe is no longer number one in world exports " .
but the use of subtitles to address a german audience so close to sunday 's general election appeared calculated to provoke public unease . germany has 4,200 troops in afghanistan , a deployment that is highly unpopular with the electorate . the bin laden audio recording , titled " a message to the people of europe " , lashed out at what it called " the injustices " committed by foreign troops in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three videos in a week warn of terror attacks in germany unless its military leaves afghanistan . three videos in a week single out germany by contrast , the third , and most recent , video , also released on friday , was aimed specifically at germany , and said " because of your commitment against islam , attacking germany has become an attractive idea for us , the mujahedeen . " photographs of famous german sites and events then appear , including the brandenburg gate in berlin , munich 's oktoberfest beer festival and cologne 's imposing gothic cathedral .
politicians , including interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and defense minister franz josef jung are also shown . a german crime investigator told deutsche welle that the threat was the most concrete so far due to the people and places mentioned .
he added that there was concern that the spate of messages could signal an attack was indeed being planned . man arrested for posting video the latest flurry of islamist propaganda comes as police announced the arrest of a turkish man suspected of posting the bin laden video . the 25-year-old suspect is known to authorities as a supporter of islamist activists and is said to have been under police observation .
police from germany 's southern city of stuttgart , where the arrest was made , say the man is not thought to have taken part in producing the internet video that threatens germany ahead of the country 's national elections on sunday .
" in searching his apartment , investigators secured numerous items of evidence .
the unemployed suspect , who lived alone , was apparently intensely active on notorious internet platforms , ” the police statement said .
the german government has played down a travel alert issued by the us state department on wednesday warning american citizens in germany to be vigilant .
german officials have heightened security in public spaces and train stations as a precaution .
germany , so far , has not been the target of a major attack by islamist militants .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 26.09.2009 battle for top of the bundesliga goes to hamburg großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg celebrates mladen petric 's winning goal bayern munich ca n't keep a three game bundesliga winning streak alive and miss an opportunity to gain ground on first place .
that spot stays with hamburg sv for the fourth straight week . after hamburg 's draw against frankfurt last week and bayern 's third straight league win over nuremberg left just three points between the two sides , bayern was in a good position to close the gap on hamburg coming into saturday 's match .
hamburg had the advantage of home turf , but were coming off a loss on penalty kicks earlier in the week in the german cup .
bayern , on the other hand , was fresh of a 5-0 german cup drubbing of rw oberhausen and was hungry for a glimpse from the top of the league .
there was no clear favorite for most of the game and the equally matched squads appeared to be headed for a draw until hamburg 's mladen petric scored the winning goal in the 72nd minute to tip the game 1-0 to hamburg .
bayern coach louis van gaal acknowledged that hamburg had earned the victory .
" it was a great game .
we had several chances but we did n't take them .
that was the problem - and hamburg are a top side .
the side that gets the goal wins it , " he said .
the loss drops bayern munich to sixth in the league , and they trail hamburg by six points .
leverkusen stays in the hunt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc cologne 's season has n't been able to get off the ground while hamburg were able to dispatch one challenger to their top position in the table , bayer leverkusen remains close on hamburg 's heels with a 1-0 win over fc cologne .
in cologne 's german cup match during the week , a 3-2 victory over defending bundesliga champs wolfsburg was a glimmer of hope for the team in what has been an otherwise dismal season .
despite holding leverkusen goalless for nearly the entire game , leverkusen 's simon rolfes slipped one into the net in the 82nd minute to put an end to cologne 's short-lived success .
leverkusen are second in the bundesliga to hamburg on goal difference , while cologne continues to languish in second to last place .
wins for wolfsburg and werder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke fans take over a dortmund flag schalke 04 trail hamburg and leverkusen by four points but managed to move up in the table to third place with a 1-0 victory over dortmund .
the game 's only goal came from peruvian striker jefferson farfan in the 31st minute .
the highest scoring match of the day was a 4-2 win for vfl wolfsburg against hanover .
last year 's bundesliga champs used four different scorers to dispatch hanover .
zvjezdan misimovic , christian gentner , makoto hasebe , and edin dzeko all found the back of the net , and wolfsburg 's alexander madlung even gave a goal away , scoring an own-goal in the 50th minute .
hanover 's other goal came from hanno balitsch .
wolfsburg have been hit and miss so far this season , winning four and losing three .
they are currently in fifth place and tied on points with werder bremen , who beat mainz 3-0 on two goals from claudio pizarro and one from aaron hunt .
rounding out saturday 's matches , vfb stuttgart blanked eintracht frankfurt 3-0 thanks to two goals from u-21 national striker julian schieber in the 17th and 31st minute .
thomas hitzlsperger added the third insurance goal for suttgart in the 54th minute .
in friday 's only game , bochum beat nuremberg 1-0 .
the bundesliga 's seventh game day continues sunday as freiburg try to keep their momentum going against borussia moenchengladbach after beating hertha berlin 4-0 last week .

that spot stays with hamburg sv for the fourth straight week . after hamburg 's draw against frankfurt last week and bayern 's third straight league win over nuremberg left just three points between the two sides , bayern was in a good position to close the gap on hamburg coming into saturday 's match .
hamburg had the advantage of home turf , but were coming off a loss on penalty kicks earlier in the week in the german cup .
bayern , on the other hand , was fresh of a 5-0 german cup drubbing of rw oberhausen and was hungry for a glimpse from the top of the league .
there was no clear favorite for most of the game and the equally matched squads appeared to be headed for a draw until hamburg 's mladen petric scored the winning goal in the 72nd minute to tip the game 1-0 to hamburg .
bayern coach louis van gaal acknowledged that hamburg had earned the victory .
" it was a great game .
we had several chances but we did n't take them .
that was the problem - and hamburg are a top side .
the side that gets the goal wins it , " he said .
the loss drops bayern munich to sixth in the league , and they trail hamburg by six points .

in cologne 's german cup match during the week , a 3-2 victory over defending bundesliga champs wolfsburg was a glimmer of hope for the team in what has been an otherwise dismal season .
despite holding leverkusen goalless for nearly the entire game , leverkusen 's simon rolfes slipped one into the net in the 82nd minute to put an end to cologne 's short-lived success .
leverkusen are second in the bundesliga to hamburg on goal difference , while cologne continues to languish in second to last place .

the game 's only goal came from peruvian striker jefferson farfan in the 31st minute .
the highest scoring match of the day was a 4-2 win for vfl wolfsburg against hanover .
last year 's bundesliga champs used four different scorers to dispatch hanover .
zvjezdan misimovic , christian gentner , makoto hasebe , and edin dzeko all found the back of the net , and wolfsburg 's alexander madlung even gave a goal away , scoring an own-goal in the 50th minute .
hanover 's other goal came from hanno balitsch .
wolfsburg have been hit and miss so far this season , winning four and losing three .
they are currently in fifth place and tied on points with werder bremen , who beat mainz 3-0 on two goals from claudio pizarro and one from aaron hunt .

but for musicians aiming to be stars , they 're the key to a successful career .
dw follows young hopefuls as they brave the jury that could decide their future . johannes brahms ' father , in his time the foremost double bassist in hamburg , is said to have pointed out that a correct note on his instrument is a crapshoot - at best .
that rings true if you listen to bass players struggle , but one could ask why that is .
after all , they have so much more space to hit the right note - inches more , seemingly - than violinists .
one person who gave an answer to the question is a first-round participant at the ard international music competition , which wrapped up recently in munich .
" we do n't have more space for the right note .
the right note is just as precise a point on the fingerboard as on the violin , " said 19-year-old ha-young jung , who was born and raised in seoul and is now based in london .
she was one of the 40 bassists who were accepted and made the trip to munich for the ard competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung started playing music as a child " but we have two inches of wrong note between each right one .
and we have to move our arms inches , not our fingers millimeters , to get from one note to the next , " she pointed out .
that 's good to keep in mind when listening to a first round of double bassists in any competition .
right notes are indeed exceptions to a cacophonous rule .
competitions expand repertoire jung said she was excited to participate in the ard competition because it involved learning so much .
" i think competitions are very good because we have to play and prepare for so many pieces in such a short period , " she said .
she said she thought focusing on competitions too much , however , could be limiting .
" it can get a little bit tense when you think about how to play without making mistakes or that one needs to be perfect all the time . "
she tries not to worry about what judges think too much .
" at the end of the day , music is so personal that i ca n't possibly know what it is the jury really likes .
so i do what i like . "
then , with a glance at her regular russian pianist , who fulfils a role somewhere between ersatz -mother and drillmaster , she quipped , " or what my accompanist wants . "
the bass as solo instrument bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bassists were once mostly men ; that is changing ten or fifteen years ago , women playing the double bass were still a rare sight .
that is changing now , but jung still gets funny looks - not necessarily because she 's a woman playing the double bass , but because she is , or wants to be , a solo bass player .
" many people do n't consider the bass a solo instrument , " she pointed out .
" its register is low , its sound difficult to project when you play with an orchestra .
but i think it depends on how a player brings out the qualities of the instrument , rather than on the instrument itself . "
she would n't want to limit herself to just solo bass , however .
" i love playing chamber music , i love playing with chamber orchestras … i just love playing bass , really . "
expanding the repertoire playing in an orchestra , while enjoyable , is also challenging .
" when i play in an orchestra for a few days , i get very , very ill , because i just give everything , " she said .
but then she waxed philosophical .
" there 's something about the very big picture that 's part of playing in an orchestra and i enjoy it very much - and some aspects are even more demanding than playing solo . "
in the competition in munich , jung played - among others - bottesini 's “ elegy and tarantella . "
every phrase made musical sense and her unbridled energy made it seem like someone had opened the windows in the windowless studio .
" there is n't a lot of repertoire for the bass anyway , compared to other instruments , " she said .
" but bottesini is one of the few composers who really tried to expand the repertoire and i think he 's very musical , very much fun to play , and fun to listen to . "
still , she did n't advance in the competition .
following her disappointment and departure from munich , jung was upbeat again .
she was looking forward to a recital at wigmore hall in london with famous violinist sarah chang .
weight matters before she left , there was question one question she still had to answer : did she ever feel stuck with the double bass and so little music to be grateful for ? " well , there are many ways to look at this .
for me , i do n't envy pianists or violinists ... i do n't envy the particular repertoire they have , even if it is so much bigger and , well , better .
i 'm happy playing bass . "
then , glancing at her colleagues hauling basses about , " what i envy is the size of other instruments ! "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 26.09.2009 new bin laden video issues warning on afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bin laden tape warns europeans against following us al-qaeda leader osama bin laden has demanded that european nations withdraw their troops from afghanistan .
in an audiotape , the message said they were " sacrificing men and money in an unjust us-led war . " the bin laden tape follows two video threats against germany for its role in afghanistan earlier this week and came just hours after a third german-language tape by a militant calling himself abu talha al-almani , " the german " , alias bekkay harrach , who has threatened a " rude awakening " for germany . the latest bin laden message did not threaten new attacks and contained no mention of germany , except to note that thanks to the financial crisis , " the heart of europe is no longer number one in world exports " .
but the use of subtitles to address a german audience so close to sunday 's general election appeared calculated to provoke public unease . germany has 4,200 troops in afghanistan , a deployment that is highly unpopular with the electorate . the bin laden audio recording , titled " a message to the people of europe " , lashed out at what it called " the injustices " committed by foreign troops in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three videos in a week warn of terror attacks in germany unless its military leaves afghanistan . three videos in a week single out germany by contrast , the third , and most recent , video , also released on friday , was aimed specifically at germany , and said " because of your commitment against islam , attacking germany has become an attractive idea for us , the mujahedeen . " photographs of famous german sites and events then appear , including the brandenburg gate in berlin , munich 's oktoberfest beer festival and cologne 's imposing gothic cathedral .
politicians , including interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and defense minister franz josef jung are also shown . a german crime investigator told deutsche welle that the threat was the most concrete so far due to the people and places mentioned .
he added that there was concern that the spate of messages could signal an attack was indeed being planned . man arrested for posting video the latest flurry of islamist propaganda comes as police announced the arrest of a turkish man suspected of posting the bin laden video . the 25-year-old suspect is known to authorities as a supporter of islamist activists and is said to have been under police observation .
police from germany 's southern city of stuttgart , where the arrest was made , say the man is not thought to have taken part in producing the internet video that threatens germany ahead of the country 's national elections on sunday .
" in searching his apartment , investigators secured numerous items of evidence .
the unemployed suspect , who lived alone , was apparently intensely active on notorious internet platforms , ” the police statement said .
the german government has played down a travel alert issued by the us state department on wednesday warning american citizens in germany to be vigilant .
german officials have heightened security in public spaces and train stations as a precaution .
germany , so far , has not been the target of a major attack by islamist militants .
in 2004 , islamist militants bombed a madrid commuter train , killing 191 people three days before a spanish general election . gb / afp / ap -lrb- / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 26.09.2009 battle for top of the bundesliga goes to hamburg großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg celebrates mladen petric 's winning goal bayern munich ca n't keep a three game bundesliga winning streak alive and miss an opportunity to gain ground on first place .
that spot stays with hamburg sv for the fourth straight week . after hamburg 's draw against frankfurt last week and bayern 's third straight league win over nuremberg left just three points between the two sides , bayern was in a good position to close the gap on hamburg coming into saturday 's match .
hamburg had the advantage of home turf , but were coming off a loss on penalty kicks earlier in the week in the german cup .
bayern , on the other hand , was fresh of a 5-0 german cup drubbing of rw oberhausen and was hungry for a glimpse from the top of the league .
there was no clear favorite for most of the game and the equally matched squads appeared to be headed for a draw until hamburg 's mladen petric scored the winning goal in the 72nd minute to tip the game 1-0 to hamburg .
bayern coach louis van gaal acknowledged that hamburg had earned the victory .
" it was a great game .
we had several chances but we did n't take them .
that was the problem - and hamburg are a top side .
the side that gets the goal wins it , " he said .
the loss drops bayern munich to sixth in the league , and they trail hamburg by six points .
leverkusen stays in the hunt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc cologne 's season has n't been able to get off the ground while hamburg were able to dispatch one challenger to their top position in the table , bayer leverkusen remains close on hamburg 's heels with a 1-0 win over fc cologne .
in cologne 's german cup match during the week , a 3-2 victory over defending bundesliga champs wolfsburg was a glimmer of hope for the team in what has been an otherwise dismal season .
despite holding leverkusen goalless for nearly the entire game , leverkusen 's simon rolfes slipped one into the net in the 82nd minute to put an end to cologne 's short-lived success .
leverkusen are second in the bundesliga to hamburg on goal difference , while cologne continues to languish in second to last place .
wins for wolfsburg and werder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke fans take over a dortmund flag schalke 04 trail hamburg and leverkusen by four points but managed to move up in the table to third place with a 1-0 victory over dortmund .
the game 's only goal came from peruvian striker jefferson farfan in the 31st minute .
the highest scoring match of the day was a 4-2 win for vfl wolfsburg against hanover .
last year 's bundesliga champs used four different scorers to dispatch hanover .
zvjezdan misimovic , christian gentner , makoto hasebe , and edin dzeko all found the back of the net , and wolfsburg 's alexander madlung even gave a goal away , scoring an own-goal in the 50th minute .
hanover 's other goal came from hanno balitsch .
wolfsburg have been hit and miss so far this season , winning four and losing three .
they are currently in fifth place and tied on points with werder bremen , who beat mainz 3-0 on two goals from claudio pizarro and one from aaron hunt .
rounding out saturday 's matches , vfb stuttgart blanked eintracht frankfurt 3-0 thanks to two goals from u-21 national striker julian schieber in the 17th and 31st minute .
thomas hitzlsperger added the third insurance goal for suttgart in the 54th minute .

dw follows young hopefuls as they brave the jury that could decide their future . johannes brahms ' father , in his time the foremost double bassist in hamburg , is said to have pointed out that a correct note on his instrument is a crapshoot - at best .
that rings true if you listen to bass players struggle , but one could ask why that is .
after all , they have so much more space to hit the right note - inches more , seemingly - than violinists .
one person who gave an answer to the question is a first-round participant at the ard international music competition , which wrapped up recently in munich .
" we do n't have more space for the right note .
the right note is just as precise a point on the fingerboard as on the violin , " said 19-year-old ha-young jung , who was born and raised in seoul and is now based in london .
she was one of the 40 bassists who were accepted and made the trip to munich for the ard competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung started playing music as a child " but we have two inches of wrong note between each right one .
and we have to move our arms inches , not our fingers millimeters , to get from one note to the next , " she pointed out .
that 's good to keep in mind when listening to a first round of double bassists in any competition .
right notes are indeed exceptions to a cacophonous rule .
competitions expand repertoire jung said she was excited to participate in the ard competition because it involved learning so much .
" i think competitions are very good because we have to play and prepare for so many pieces in such a short period , " she said .
she said she thought focusing on competitions too much , however , could be limiting .
" it can get a little bit tense when you think about how to play without making mistakes or that one needs to be perfect all the time . "
she tries not to worry about what judges think too much .
" at the end of the day , music is so personal that i ca n't possibly know what it is the jury really likes .
so i do what i like . "
then , with a glance at her regular russian pianist , who fulfils a role somewhere between ersatz -mother and drillmaster , she quipped , " or what my accompanist wants . "
the bass as solo instrument bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bassists were once mostly men ; that is changing ten or fifteen years ago , women playing the double bass were still a rare sight .
that is changing now , but jung still gets funny looks - not necessarily because she 's a woman playing the double bass , but because she is , or wants to be , a solo bass player .
" many people do n't consider the bass a solo instrument , " she pointed out .
" its register is low , its sound difficult to project when you play with an orchestra .
but i think it depends on how a player brings out the qualities of the instrument , rather than on the instrument itself . "
she would n't want to limit herself to just solo bass , however .
" i love playing chamber music , i love playing with chamber orchestras … i just love playing bass , really . "
expanding the repertoire playing in an orchestra , while enjoyable , is also challenging .
" when i play in an orchestra for a few days , i get very , very ill , because i just give everything , " she said .
but then she waxed philosophical .
" there 's something about the very big picture that 's part of playing in an orchestra and i enjoy it very much - and some aspects are even more demanding than playing solo . "
in the competition in munich , jung played - among others - bottesini 's “ elegy and tarantella . "
every phrase made musical sense and her unbridled energy made it seem like someone had opened the windows in the windowless studio .
" there is n't a lot of repertoire for the bass anyway , compared to other instruments , " she said .
" but bottesini is one of the few composers who really tried to expand the repertoire and i think he 's very musical , very much fun to play , and fun to listen to . "
still , she did n't advance in the competition .
following her disappointment and departure from munich , jung was upbeat again .
she was looking forward to a recital at wigmore hall in london with famous violinist sarah chang .
weight matters before she left , there was question one question she still had to answer : did she ever feel stuck with the double bass and so little music to be grateful for ? " well , there are many ways to look at this .
for me , i do n't envy pianists or violinists ... i do n't envy the particular repertoire they have , even if it is so much bigger and , well , better .

" i think competitions are very good because we have to play and prepare for so many pieces in such a short period , " she said .
she said she thought focusing on competitions too much , however , could be limiting .

the bass as solo instrument bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bassists were once mostly men ; that is changing ten or fifteen years ago , women playing the double bass were still a rare sight .

" many people do n't consider the bass a solo instrument , " she pointed out .

european union and chinese officials at the g-20 summit in pittsburgh said that a tentative deal was in place to give rising powers greater voting power in the international monetary fund " as things stand now , we believe that all parties have the strong will to accelerate reform of the international financial institutions , " chinese vice foreign minister he yafei said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reform is coming to the imf brazil , russia , india and china , known as the bric countries , had requested earlier this month that the most developed countries reduce their voting share in the imf to 50 percent , down from 57 percent .
they argued that a number of european nations wielded inordinate influence on the fund , especially inappropriate in light of the fact that their economies had been surpassed in size by bric countries in recent decades .
the united states , too , has occasionally grumbled that europe has too much say in imf policy decisions .
statement of principles it appears that , in pittsburgh , europe has relented , in part , to putting its stamp on the g-20 's draft agreement on economic policy .
china , along with other countries that have been criticized for running large , unhealthy surpluses and relying on exports for growth , are being urged to boost domestic consumption .
at the same time , countries with outsized public debt , such as the united states , are called on to promote private savings .
" we recognize that the process to ensure more balanced global growth must be undertaken in an orderly manner .
all g-20 members agree to address the respective weaknesses of their economies , " the draft agreement declares .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g-20 leaders agreed on a new direction for the financial sector tougher finance rules world leaders also pledged to reform the financial sector in an effort to stop risky banking practices seen as a cause of the global economic crisis .
in a joint statement issued at the end of the summit , g-20 leaders were clear on the new direction of financial regulation . " major failures of regulation and supervision , plus reckless and irresponsible risk taking by banks and other financial institutions , created dangerous financial fragilities that contributed significantly to the current crisis , " the statement said .
" a return to the excessive risk taking prevalent in some countries before the crisis is not an option . " tougher controls on compensation and bonus payments for banking executives were also endorsed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy was satisfied with the g-20 summit many european leaders , including german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , had hoped tackling problems in the financial sector would be at the top of the agenda in pittsburgh . " there was unanimity around the table that the errors of the past wo n't happen again , " sarkozy said after the meeting .
" i am very satisfied by what we decided . " the leaders also agreed to keep emergency stimulus funding in place for the time being , with plans to scale them back when sustainable recovery is reached . while the world 's largest economies agreed to phase out fossil fuel subsidies to combat global warming , climate change was a largely overlooked topic in pittsburgh .
no consensus was reached regarding the amount wealthy nations should pay to support the efforts of developing nations to curb global warming , which is seen as an essential step towards a new global treaty proposed for the copenhagen climate summit in december . mrh / mz / reuters / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 .
the airspace restriction came at the request of the federal interior ministry .
munich 's theresienwiese beer garden is spread over 77 acres -lrb- 31 hectares -rrb- , where 6 million people join in the 16-day celebration every year .
" a no-fly zone appears to be a necessity , given the current security situation , " herrmann said , referring to the multiple terrorist threats directed at germany over the past few days .
on thursday , fears about commercial flights transiting over the festival grounds led to several concerned phone calls to the authorities by oktoberfest attendees .
a torrent of terrorist threats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : video messages have threatened german targets no less than five threatening messages have surfaced recently , including a message from al qaeda 's osama bin laden - replete with german subtitles - demanding that europeans leave afghanistan .
other video threats have been delivered , including a video discovered on friday , which , according to the german interior ministry , had come from the taliban " because of your commitment here against islam , attacking germany has become an attractive idea for us , the mujahedeen , " a man calling himself " ajjub " spoke in german in the video .
the footage included images of potential targets such as munich 's oktoberfest festival , as well as the brandenburg gate in berlin and cologne 's massive cathedral . images of defense minister franz-josef jung and interior minister wolfgang shaeuble were also shown .
this latest video was just another in a string of threats apparently designed to cast a pall over sunday 's national elections .
no fear-mongering meanwhile , chairman of the islamic council of germany , ali kizilkaya , released a statement saying that he was happy with interior minister schaeuble 's management of the threats so far .
" even in this tense stage of the election campaign , all the democrats have refrained from exploiting the threats , " he said .
the no-fly zone will remain in effect until oct .
4 , when the festival comes to an end .

26 .
the airspace restriction came at the request of the federal interior ministry .
munich 's theresienwiese beer garden is spread over 77 acres -lrb- 31 hectares -rrb- , where 6 million people join in the 16-day celebration every year .
" a no-fly zone appears to be a necessity , given the current security situation , " herrmann said , referring to the multiple terrorist threats directed at germany over the past few days .
on thursday , fears about commercial flights transiting over the festival grounds led to several concerned phone calls to the authorities by oktoberfest attendees .
a torrent of terrorist threats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : video messages have threatened german targets no less than five threatening messages have surfaced recently , including a message from al qaeda 's osama bin laden - replete with german subtitles - demanding that europeans leave afghanistan .
other video threats have been delivered , including a video discovered on friday , which , according to the german interior ministry , had come from the taliban " because of your commitment here against islam , attacking germany has become an attractive idea for us , the mujahedeen , " a man calling himself " ajjub " spoke in german in the video .

bayern , on the other hand , was fresh of a 5-0 german cup drubbing of rw oberhausen and was hungry for a glimpse from the top of the league .

european union and chinese officials at the g-20 summit in pittsburgh said that a tentative deal was in place to give rising powers greater voting power in the international monetary fund " as things stand now , we believe that all parties have the strong will to accelerate reform of the international financial institutions , " chinese vice foreign minister he yafei said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reform is coming to the imf brazil , russia , india and china , known as the bric countries , had requested earlier this month that the most developed countries reduce their voting share in the imf to 50 percent , down from 57 percent .
they argued that a number of european nations wielded inordinate influence on the fund , especially inappropriate in light of the fact that their economies had been surpassed in size by bric countries in recent decades .
the united states , too , has occasionally grumbled that europe has too much say in imf policy decisions .
statement of principles it appears that , in pittsburgh , europe has relented , in part , to putting its stamp on the g-20 's draft agreement on economic policy .
china , along with other countries that have been criticized for running large , unhealthy surpluses and relying on exports for growth , are being urged to boost domestic consumption .
at the same time , countries with outsized public debt , such as the united states , are called on to promote private savings .
" we recognize that the process to ensure more balanced global growth must be undertaken in an orderly manner .
all g-20 members agree to address the respective weaknesses of their economies , " the draft agreement declares .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g-20 leaders agreed on a new direction for the financial sector tougher finance rules world leaders also pledged to reform the financial sector in an effort to stop risky banking practices seen as a cause of the global economic crisis .
in a joint statement issued at the end of the summit , g-20 leaders were clear on the new direction of financial regulation . " major failures of regulation and supervision , plus reckless and irresponsible risk taking by banks and other financial institutions , created dangerous financial fragilities that contributed significantly to the current crisis , " the statement said .
" a return to the excessive risk taking prevalent in some countries before the crisis is not an option . " tougher controls on compensation and bonus payments for banking executives were also endorsed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy was satisfied with the g-20 summit many european leaders , including german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , had hoped tackling problems in the financial sector would be at the top of the agenda in pittsburgh . " there was unanimity around the table that the errors of the past wo n't happen again , " sarkozy said after the meeting .
" i am very satisfied by what we decided . " the leaders also agreed to keep emergency stimulus funding in place for the time being , with plans to scale them back when sustainable recovery is reached . while the world 's largest economies agreed to phase out fossil fuel subsidies to combat global warming , climate change was a largely overlooked topic in pittsburgh .
no consensus was reached regarding the amount wealthy nations should pay to support the efforts of developing nations to curb global warming , which is seen as an essential step towards a new global treaty proposed for the copenhagen climate summit in december . mrh / mz / reuters / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but for musicians aiming to be stars , they 're the key to a successful career .
dw follows young hopefuls as they brave the jury that could decide their future . johannes brahms ' father , in his time the foremost double bassist in hamburg , is said to have pointed out that a correct note on his instrument is a crapshoot - at best .
that rings true if you listen to bass players struggle , but one could ask why that is .
after all , they have so much more space to hit the right note - inches more , seemingly - than violinists .
one person who gave an answer to the question is a first-round participant at the ard international music competition , which wrapped up recently in munich .
" we do n't have more space for the right note .
the right note is just as precise a point on the fingerboard as on the violin , " said 19-year-old ha-young jung , who was born and raised in seoul and is now based in london .
she was one of the 40 bassists who were accepted and made the trip to munich for the ard competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung started playing music as a child " but we have two inches of wrong note between each right one .
and we have to move our arms inches , not our fingers millimeters , to get from one note to the next , " she pointed out .
that 's good to keep in mind when listening to a first round of double bassists in any competition .
right notes are indeed exceptions to a cacophonous rule .
competitions expand repertoire jung said she was excited to participate in the ard competition because it involved learning so much .
" i think competitions are very good because we have to play and prepare for so many pieces in such a short period , " she said .
she said she thought focusing on competitions too much , however , could be limiting .

dw follows young hopefuls as they brave the jury that could decide their future . johannes brahms ' father , in his time the foremost double bassist in hamburg , is said to have pointed out that a correct note on his instrument is a crapshoot - at best .
that rings true if you listen to bass players struggle , but one could ask why that is .
after all , they have so much more space to hit the right note - inches more , seemingly - than violinists .
one person who gave an answer to the question is a first-round participant at the ard international music competition , which wrapped up recently in munich .
" we do n't have more space for the right note .
the right note is just as precise a point on the fingerboard as on the violin , " said 19-year-old ha-young jung , who was born and raised in seoul and is now based in london .
she was one of the 40 bassists who were accepted and made the trip to munich for the ard competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung started playing music as a child " but we have two inches of wrong note between each right one .
and we have to move our arms inches , not our fingers millimeters , to get from one note to the next , " she pointed out .
that 's good to keep in mind when listening to a first round of double bassists in any competition .
right notes are indeed exceptions to a cacophonous rule .
competitions expand repertoire jung said she was excited to participate in the ard competition because it involved learning so much .
" i think competitions are very good because we have to play and prepare for so many pieces in such a short period , " she said .
she said she thought focusing on competitions too much , however , could be limiting .
" it can get a little bit tense when you think about how to play without making mistakes or that one needs to be perfect all the time . "
she tries not to worry about what judges think too much .
" at the end of the day , music is so personal that i ca n't possibly know what it is the jury really likes .
so i do what i like . "
then , with a glance at her regular russian pianist , who fulfils a role somewhere between ersatz -mother and drillmaster , she quipped , " or what my accompanist wants . "
the bass as solo instrument bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bassists were once mostly men ; that is changing ten or fifteen years ago , women playing the double bass were still a rare sight .
that is changing now , but jung still gets funny looks - not necessarily because she 's a woman playing the double bass , but because she is , or wants to be , a solo bass player .
" many people do n't consider the bass a solo instrument , " she pointed out .
" its register is low , its sound difficult to project when you play with an orchestra .
but i think it depends on how a player brings out the qualities of the instrument , rather than on the instrument itself . "
she would n't want to limit herself to just solo bass , however .
" i love playing chamber music , i love playing with chamber orchestras … i just love playing bass , really . "
expanding the repertoire playing in an orchestra , while enjoyable , is also challenging .
" when i play in an orchestra for a few days , i get very , very ill , because i just give everything , " she said .
but then she waxed philosophical .
" there 's something about the very big picture that 's part of playing in an orchestra and i enjoy it very much - and some aspects are even more demanding than playing solo . "
in the competition in munich , jung played - among others - bottesini 's “ elegy and tarantella . "
every phrase made musical sense and her unbridled energy made it seem like someone had opened the windows in the windowless studio .
" there is n't a lot of repertoire for the bass anyway , compared to other instruments , " she said .
" but bottesini is one of the few composers who really tried to expand the repertoire and i think he 's very musical , very much fun to play , and fun to listen to . "
still , she did n't advance in the competition .
following her disappointment and departure from munich , jung was upbeat again .
she was looking forward to a recital at wigmore hall in london with famous violinist sarah chang .
weight matters before she left , there was question one question she still had to answer : did she ever feel stuck with the double bass and so little music to be grateful for ? " well , there are many ways to look at this .
for me , i do n't envy pianists or violinists ... i do n't envy the particular repertoire they have , even if it is so much bigger and , well , better .
i 'm happy playing bass . "
then , glancing at her colleagues hauling basses about , " what i envy is the size of other instruments ! "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 26.09.2009 mixed reactions to us policy shift towards burma großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to engage directly with burma 's military regime for the first time in 14 years , burma 's prime minister , thein sein , will travel to the un 's general assembly meeting .
the move comes as the us has said it wants to engage diplomatically with the country ’ s regime . washington 's new policy towards burma will include more direct and deeper engagement with the junta .
us secretary of state hillary clinton made the announcement on the sidelines of the united nations general assembly in new york this week .
however , she insisted that sanctions against the regime would remain an important part of us policy .
" engagement versus sanctions is a false choice in our opinion .
going forward , we will be employing both of those tools , pursuing our same goal .
to help achieve democratic reform we will be engaging directly with burmese authorities . "
clinton also said that the change in policy did not mean there would be any compromise on the demands for credible democratic reform and the unconditional release of all political prisoners , including pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi .
there have been mixed reactions to clinton 's announcement .
some activists doubt whether it will really help to bring about change in the country , which has been in the tight grip of the junta for decades .
sonny aung than oo from the germany-based ngo burma bureau is skeptical : " until now the regime has not cared about any of the un 's demands or those of the international community .
they do n't care .
they keep going their own way .
they have killed monks in the past and many people are political prisoners . "
but other observers think the new policy might have some positive effects in view of the fact that economic sanctions and aid restrictions imposed by western governments in the past have failed to persuade the junta to introduce democratic reforms .
failed sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sanctions have not improved the situation in burma robert templer of the international crisis group in new york explains that the sanction regime did n't really work : " the sanctions were never universally applied .
china did n't apply them , india did n't apply them .
none of the neighboring states have any sanctions on myanmar -lrb- the official name given to burma by its military rulers -rrb- .
so , myanmar 's economy has been hurt to some degree but it has been hurt by its own policies more than by the western sanctions . "
there was first talk about a possible shift in policy towards burma after us senator jim webb , an ardent advocate for easing the sanctions , travelled there last month .
he secured the release of john yettaw , an american who had been jailed for swimming to suu kyi 's house .
webb met the detained pro-democracy leader during his trip , as well as top generals .
for the international crisis group 's templer , washington 's latest change in course is a sign of pragmatism : " for the past nearly 20 years , they have not had high-level contacts with the regime and that lack of contact has really created a diplomatic vacuum , which is very much filled by china , " he says .
" so , even if the us does n't like the government there and does n't regard it as democratic , it does feel the need to discuss a variety of issues with it and to try to find some common ground and some avenues for progress as it has been a very static situation for a long time . "
less paranoia templer added that although it might be a slow process , any contact that the junta had with the outside world was likely to persuade it to introduce reforms eventually .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition leader aung san suu kyi supports the policy shift " it will make them more confident and less paranoid , " he said .
" it will make them more aware of the possibilities of re-engaging with the international community .
engagement tends to have a better record in promoting transformation than isolation . "
aung san suu kyi , for her part , has welcomed the us 's announcement of a policy shift .
according to her lawyer nyan win , she said washington 's direct engagement with burma would be welcome as long as there were talks with the government , but also the opposition .

the move comes as the us has said it wants to engage diplomatically with the country ’ s regime . washington 's new policy towards burma will include more direct and deeper engagement with the junta .
us secretary of state hillary clinton made the announcement on the sidelines of the united nations general assembly in new york this week .
however , she insisted that sanctions against the regime would remain an important part of us policy .
" engagement versus sanctions is a false choice in our opinion .
going forward , we will be employing both of those tools , pursuing our same goal .
to help achieve democratic reform we will be engaging directly with burmese authorities . "
clinton also said that the change in policy did not mean there would be any compromise on the demands for credible democratic reform and the unconditional release of all political prisoners , including pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi .
there have been mixed reactions to clinton 's announcement .
some activists doubt whether it will really help to bring about change in the country , which has been in the tight grip of the junta for decades .
sonny aung than oo from the germany-based ngo burma bureau is skeptical : " until now the regime has not cared about any of the un 's demands or those of the international community .
they do n't care .
they keep going their own way .
they have killed monks in the past and many people are political prisoners . "
but other observers think the new policy might have some positive effects in view of the fact that economic sanctions and aid restrictions imposed by western governments in the past have failed to persuade the junta to introduce democratic reforms .
failed sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sanctions have not improved the situation in burma robert templer of the international crisis group in new york explains that the sanction regime did n't really work : " the sanctions were never universally applied .
china did n't apply them , india did n't apply them .
none of the neighboring states have any sanctions on myanmar -lrb- the official name given to burma by its military rulers -rrb- .
so , myanmar 's economy has been hurt to some degree but it has been hurt by its own policies more than by the western sanctions . "
there was first talk about a possible shift in policy towards burma after us senator jim webb , an ardent advocate for easing the sanctions , travelled there last month .
he secured the release of john yettaw , an american who had been jailed for swimming to suu kyi 's house .
webb met the detained pro-democracy leader during his trip , as well as top generals .
for the international crisis group 's templer , washington 's latest change in course is a sign of pragmatism : " for the past nearly 20 years , they have not had high-level contacts with the regime and that lack of contact has really created a diplomatic vacuum , which is very much filled by china , " he says .
" so , even if the us does n't like the government there and does n't regard it as democratic , it does feel the need to discuss a variety of issues with it and to try to find some common ground and some avenues for progress as it has been a very static situation for a long time . "
less paranoia templer added that although it might be a slow process , any contact that the junta had with the outside world was likely to persuade it to introduce reforms eventually .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition leader aung san suu kyi supports the policy shift " it will make them more confident and less paranoid , " he said .
" it will make them more aware of the possibilities of re-engaging with the international community .
engagement tends to have a better record in promoting transformation than isolation . "
aung san suu kyi , for her part , has welcomed the us 's announcement of a policy shift .
according to her lawyer nyan win , she said washington 's direct engagement with burma would be welcome as long as there were talks with the government , but also the opposition .

26 .
the airspace restriction came at the request of the federal interior ministry .
munich 's theresienwiese beer garden is spread over 77 acres -lrb- 31 hectares -rrb- , where 6 million people join in the 16-day celebration every year .
" a no-fly zone appears to be a necessity , given the current security situation , " herrmann said , referring to the multiple terrorist threats directed at germany over the past few days .
on thursday , fears about commercial flights transiting over the festival grounds led to several concerned phone calls to the authorities by oktoberfest attendees .
a torrent of terrorist threats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : video messages have threatened german targets no less than five threatening messages have surfaced recently , including a message from al qaeda 's osama bin laden - replete with german subtitles - demanding that europeans leave afghanistan .
other video threats have been delivered , including a video discovered on friday , which , according to the german interior ministry , had come from the taliban " because of your commitment here against islam , attacking germany has become an attractive idea for us , the mujahedeen , " a man calling himself " ajjub " spoke in german in the video .
the footage included images of potential targets such as munich 's oktoberfest festival , as well as the brandenburg gate in berlin and cologne 's massive cathedral . images of defense minister franz-josef jung and interior minister wolfgang shaeuble were also shown .
this latest video was just another in a string of threats apparently designed to cast a pall over sunday 's national elections .
no fear-mongering meanwhile , chairman of the islamic council of germany , ali kizilkaya , released a statement saying that he was happy with interior minister schaeuble 's management of the threats so far .
" even in this tense stage of the election campaign , all the democrats have refrained from exploiting the threats , " he said .
the no-fly zone will remain in effect until oct .
4 , when the festival comes to an end .

separately , it announced plans to hold missile defense drills to test its military capabilities . the head of iran 's atomic organization , ali akbar salehi , told iranian state television on saturday , sept .
26 , that " there will be an inspection in due time , " without mentioning a date . " whatever we did was within the legal framework and in line with all iaea regulations , " salehi said . the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- required iran to notify them about any new nuclear plant six months before it became operational .
salehi said that he had let them know about the plant well in advance of the deadline : the new site is n't due to go online before the end of 2010 . iran 's revolutionary guards also announced on saturday plans to hold missile defense drills over several days beginning on sunday .
their website said the exercises would include simultaneous firings of missiles at targets .
a statement quoted by iranian news agencies named the purpose as " maintaining and improving the deterrent capability of the armed forces . " un urges iran to cooperate united nations secretary ban ki moon , who met the iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on friday evening in new york , had urged tehran to implement relevant security council resolutions and to co-operate with the iaea on resolving concerns related to its nuclear activities . ahmadinejad , however , insisted that his country had done nothing wrong . " it is not a secret site , " he told reporters at a news conference in new york . us president barack obama and a host of european leaders , including german chancellor angela merkel , however , made clear their doubts that the new facility was strictly for the peaceful generation of energy . playing with an open hand obama said it was time for tehran to put its cards on the table .
" i think iran is on notice that , when we meet with them on oct .
1 , they are going to have to come clean and they are going to have to make a choice . " he said he had not ruled out military action , but that he preferred to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three of the world 's most powerful men are worried by iran 's nuclear ambitions french president , nicolas sarkozy said iran was " taking the world down a dangerous path " and he threatened sanctions by the end of the year if the iranian leadership did not change its nuclear course . angela merkel called on ahmadinejad to explain the new facility .
she said germany , like france , britain and the us was " deeply concerned " about the plant , which violated the requirements laid down by the un and the iaea . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also criticized iran , saying that the revelation increased existing doubts about its nuclear program . six major world powers - britain , france , russia , china , germany and the united states - are meeting iran 's top nuclear negotiator saeed jalili in geneva next week for talks on ways to allay those doubts . meanwhile , the head of iran 's nuclear program , ali akbar salehi , has said that construction of the second plant was necessary in order to ensure continued uranium enrichment in the event of foreign air raids on other sites . speaking on iranian television , he said " considering the threats , our organization decided to do what is necessary to preserve and continue our nuclear activities . "
he added that they would not stop their nuclear activities " at any cost . " inspections expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bird 's eye view of iran 's natanz nuclear facility prior to this week , iran 's only known enrichment facility was at natanz , near the central city of isfahan . europe and the us said they believe that the scale of the new plant is such that uranium could be enriched to far higher levels than at natanz , possibly to weapons-grade .
the us president said that he expects iaea inspectors “ to immediately investigate this disturbing information and to report to the iaea board of governors . " the iaea said on friday that iran had sent a letter on monday confirming that it was indeed constructing the facility . iranian state news agency isna reported that tehran had told the vienna-based agency the plant would produce nuclear fuel with an enrichment level of only up to 5 percent - insufficient for use in nuclear weapons . svs / tkw / reuters / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european union and chinese officials at the g-20 summit in pittsburgh said that a tentative deal was in place to give rising powers greater voting power in the international monetary fund " as things stand now , we believe that all parties have the strong will to accelerate reform of the international financial institutions , " chinese vice foreign minister he yafei said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reform is coming to the imf brazil , russia , india and china , known as the bric countries , had requested earlier this month that the most developed countries reduce their voting share in the imf to 50 percent , down from 57 percent .
they argued that a number of european nations wielded inordinate influence on the fund , especially inappropriate in light of the fact that their economies had been surpassed in size by bric countries in recent decades .
the united states , too , has occasionally grumbled that europe has too much say in imf policy decisions .
statement of principles it appears that , in pittsburgh , europe has relented , in part , to putting its stamp on the g-20 's draft agreement on economic policy .
china , along with other countries that have been criticized for running large , unhealthy surpluses and relying on exports for growth , are being urged to boost domestic consumption .
at the same time , countries with outsized public debt , such as the united states , are called on to promote private savings .
" we recognize that the process to ensure more balanced global growth must be undertaken in an orderly manner .
all g-20 members agree to address the respective weaknesses of their economies , " the draft agreement declares .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g-20 leaders agreed on a new direction for the financial sector tougher finance rules world leaders also pledged to reform the financial sector in an effort to stop risky banking practices seen as a cause of the global economic crisis .
in a joint statement issued at the end of the summit , g-20 leaders were clear on the new direction of financial regulation . " major failures of regulation and supervision , plus reckless and irresponsible risk taking by banks and other financial institutions , created dangerous financial fragilities that contributed significantly to the current crisis , " the statement said .
" a return to the excessive risk taking prevalent in some countries before the crisis is not an option . " tougher controls on compensation and bonus payments for banking executives were also endorsed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy was satisfied with the g-20 summit many european leaders , including german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , had hoped tackling problems in the financial sector would be at the top of the agenda in pittsburgh . " there was unanimity around the table that the errors of the past wo n't happen again , " sarkozy said after the meeting .
" i am very satisfied by what we decided . " the leaders also agreed to keep emergency stimulus funding in place for the time being , with plans to scale them back when sustainable recovery is reached . while the world 's largest economies agreed to phase out fossil fuel subsidies to combat global warming , climate change was a largely overlooked topic in pittsburgh .
no consensus was reached regarding the amount wealthy nations should pay to support the efforts of developing nations to curb global warming , which is seen as an essential step towards a new global treaty proposed for the copenhagen climate summit in december . mrh / mz / reuters / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

by andrew walker bbc news , pittsburgh the g20 's leaders have moved on a little .
when they last met in london in april they were still on the brink , wondering whether the world might be facing an economic depression .
so they threw everything at the problem .
in the pittsburgh communique they concluded " it worked " .
they are not denying that there is more work to do to make the current stirrings of recovery durable .
but it does mean they can look a little further into the future .
one leading preoccupation now is preventing future financial crises .
to do that , they plan an overhaul of financial regulation , with the aim of discouraging the high levels of lending to borrowers who were liable to default , that was a central feature of the crisis .
bankers ' bonuses are an important element in the reforms .
with this issue there 's a lot of politics .
what is the g20 ?
set up after the asian financial crisis in 1999 as a forum for finance ministers and central bankers first g20 leaders summit in 2008 to discuss response to economic crisis members are : argentina , australia , brazil , canada , china , eu , france , germany , india , indonesia , italy , japan , mexico , russia , saudi arabia , south africa , south korea , turkey , uk , usa joined by spain , netherlands , international monetary fund and world trade organisation summit protesters lack focus q & a : the g20 pittsburgh summit g20 : are promises being kept ?
the g20 : thoughts from a summit leaders know that many voters are appalled by the amount that some bankers receive , and some want to show they are responsive to those concerns .
and if you think the kind of inequality that financial sector pay produces is unethical , you would want politicians to respond .
but there is another , more pragmatic reason for the g20 to take on bankers ' pay .
it can give them an incentive to take risks , to make a quick but unsustainable profit and then cash in a bonus .
so the g20 plan rules to make that harder to do .
they want bonuses to be linked to long-term performance and to enable banks to claw them back in some cases .
there is no plan for general caps on the amount banks can pay out , something that some european governments wanted .
the one exception is that the g20 proposals would limit a bank 's bonus payments if paying out too much would endanger its financial soundness .
financial cushion will it work ?
there are plenty of people in finance who are ingenious enough to find ways round many regulations .
with bonus rules the motive for making the effort is obvious .
another key area is the amount banks have to keep in reserve to absorb losses - their capital .
the key element is money from shareholders or profits not paid out as dividends to shareholders .
the g20 want to increase the size of the financial cushion that banks have to maintain .
it might make a difference , but it will depend on how much extra capital they have to hold , and that has not been agreed .
some elements of this plan are likely to be very complex .
for example , making these capital requirements more onerous in boom times is a good idea in theory .
why not make banks put a lot more aside in the good times , so they can better weather the storms ?
the problem is that it will be difficult to spell out in practical terms .
' fiendishly difficult ' there 's another theme in the communique that could help prevent crises - global economic imbalances .
they were partly responsible for the crisis .
chinese consumers saved and the government built up foreign currency reserves .
much of this money was lent to the us and it enabled american consumers to borrow easily .
they did and many got into financial difficulty .
the g20 communique does have an outline plan for some countries to stimulate more spending and less saving .
there are no names , but china is the obvious candidate .
there is , however , no real enforcement mechanism beyond an unfavourable assessment from the international monetary fund .
the g20 's plans do address some real problems that contributed to the crisis .
but a very complex financial world is fiendishly difficult to regulate effectively .
if the g20 countries do all they say they will , it might reduce the risks to the banking system .
but it is just not realistic to expect to banish crises for good .

by andrew walker bbc news , pittsburgh us president obama said the g20 took " bold and concerted action " the g20 's leaders have moved on a little .
when they last met in london in april they were still on the brink , wondering whether the world might be facing an economic depression .
so they threw everything at the problem .
in the pittsburgh communique they concluded " it worked " .
they are not denying that there is more work to do to make the current stirrings of recovery durable .
but it does mean they can look a little further into the future .
one leading preoccupation now is preventing future financial crises .
to do that , they plan an overhaul of financial regulation , with the aim of discouraging the high levels of lending to borrowers who were liable to default , that was a central feature of the crisis .
bankers ' bonuses are an important element in the reforms .
with this issue there 's a lot of politics .
what is the g20 ?
set up after the asian financial crisis in 1999 as a forum for finance ministers and central bankers first g20 leaders summit in 2008 to discuss response to economic crisis members are : argentina , australia , brazil , canada , china , eu , france , germany , india , indonesia , italy , japan , mexico , russia , saudi arabia , south africa , south korea , turkey , uk , usa joined by spain , netherlands , international monetary fund and world trade organisation summit protesters lack focus q & a : the g20 pittsburgh summit g20 : are promises being kept ?
the g20 : thoughts from a summit leaders know that many voters are appalled by the amount that some bankers receive , and some want to show they are responsive to those concerns .
and if you think the kind of inequality that financial sector pay produces is unethical , you would want politicians to respond .
but there is another , more pragmatic reason for the g20 to take on bankers ' pay .
it can give them an incentive to take risks , to make a quick but unsustainable profit and then cash in a bonus .
so the g20 plan rules to make that harder to do .
they want bonuses to be linked to long-term performance and to enable banks to claw them back in some cases .
there is no plan for general caps on the amount banks can pay out , something that some european governments wanted .
the one exception is that the g20 proposals would limit a bank 's bonus payments if paying out too much would endanger its financial soundness .
financial cushion will it work ?
there are plenty of people in finance who are ingenious enough to find ways round many regulations .
with bonus rules the motive for making the effort is obvious .
another key area is the amount banks have to keep in reserve to absorb losses - their capital .
the key element is money from shareholders or profits not paid out as dividends to shareholders .
the g20 want to increase the size of the financial cushion that banks have to maintain .
it might make a difference , but it will depend on how much extra capital they have to hold , and that has not been agreed .
some elements of this plan are likely to be very complex .
for example , making these capital requirements more onerous in boom times is a good idea in theory .
why not make banks put a lot more aside in the good times , so they can better weather the storms ?
the problem is that it will be difficult to spell out in practical terms .
' fiendishly difficult ' there 's another theme in the communique that could help prevent crises - global economic imbalances .
they were partly responsible for the crisis .
chinese consumers saved and the government built up foreign currency reserves .
much of this money was lent to the us and it enabled american consumers to borrow easily .
they did and many got into financial difficulty .
the g20 communique does have an outline plan for some countries to stimulate more spending and less saving .
there are no names , but china is the obvious candidate .
there is , however , no real enforcement mechanism beyond an unfavourable assessment from the international monetary fund .
the g20 's plans do address some real problems that contributed to the crisis .
but a very complex financial world is fiendishly difficult to regulate effectively .
if the g20 countries do all they say they will , it might reduce the risks to the banking system .
but it is just not realistic to expect to banish crises for good .
