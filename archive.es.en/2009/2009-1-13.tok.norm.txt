by the year 2050 , there will be 10 million fewer people in the country then there are today - with dramatic consequences for the working world . in the future , the classic office swivel chair will be something of a rarity .
instead , those reclining television lounge chairs will be everywhere .
and among the other novelties in the office of the future : more breaks where employees can nibble from fruit platters or have a massage in the company 's own fitness center .
even blue-collar workers will find that their jobs offer more comforts . the reason for these fantastic-sounding benefits is n't a sudden burst of benevolence on the part of employers , rather a necessary bit of calculation , says werner eichhorst from the institute for the study of labor in bonn . " in the future , it 'll be all about making the work load easier - on a daily , weekly , and yearly basis - because with fewer germans , there are fewer employees on the market , and those that are available are growing older , " he said .
" employers can no longer afford to wear out their workforce , and that 's why they have to take better care of them . " tomorrow 's working world if the current estimates from the federal statistics office come to pass , then in the next 30 years , germany will have six million fewer workers .
and the average age of an employee will increase from 42 to 48 . " fewer , older employees means that we wo n't be able to stick to the legal retirement age , " say experts at the bonn-based institute .
they 're predicting a retirement age close to 69 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts predict more german women will enter full-time work fewer people in germany and therefore fewer employees will be able to shoulder more of the daily workload .
the classic " nine to five " shift will no longer be possible , especially in the service sector .
the culture of presence in the workplace will fall away and even in manufacturing , more flexibility will be required .
eichhorst is convinced that more and more employees will work flexi-hours and be compensated according to their output or performance . " in a sense , the employee will become the employer , " he said . germany 's dwindling , ageing population will have other effects too , according to the institute for the study of labor .
until now , employees over the age of 45 have been considered too expensive by most employers . " the pay scales are going to change , " said eichhorst .
" it will no longer be the case that your salary automatically goes up the older you get . " new reality , new opportunities the lack of skilled workers will also make itself increasingly felt , especially as it 's not something that can be combated by the current rates of immigration .
labor researchers therefore expect policy in this area to undergo much improvement .
work conditions in germany have so far shown themselves to be less than attractive among sought-after skilled workers . the institute predicts two developments as a result : increased training opportunities for low-skilled workers and a jump in the number of women in full-time jobs . " germany has a lot to catch up on in this respect - a lot of improvement is needed , " eichhorst said . wolfgang dick -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but not all experts are convinced it can help beat the downturn . germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel was full of praise for the initiative , being touted as a " pact for germany , " which her coalition passed on tuesday , january 11 . merkel told reporters her government was doing " everything possible so that germany does not just overcome this crisis , but emerges from it stronger . " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier from merkel 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , said the german package of investments , government loans and hand-outs , and tax cuts , compared favorably with stimulus measures taken by other nations . " when i look around europe , i ca n't see anyone else doing more or taking better steps than we are , " he told reporters . the package has come after mounting criticism that the government was being too hesitant in combating the economic decline prompted by the global financial crisis . soon enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " konjunktur " is german for " economic growth , " but not everyone likes this package but leading private-sector economists in germany disagreed about whether the so-called pact was all government ministers were claiming . the chief economist of commerzbank , joerg kraemer , was impressed . " no economic program in the world can stave off a recession , but the measures will no doubt contribute to stabilizing the economy in the second half of the year , " he told dpa news agency . the head economist at the bank of america , holger schmieding , has a different assessment . " this may only kick in late this year and thus do nothing to help us when the recession is at its worst - over the current quarter and the nest , " schmieding told reuters news agency . but others thought that the likely length of the slump would give the package time to work . " the economic downturn will last so long that the full effect of the stimulus measures are bound to be felt , " bhf bank chief economist uwe angenendt told dpa , and deka bank chief economist also offered that agency pretty much the same analysis . debts and more debts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german car sales are currently in a deep freeze the association of german taxpayers is considerable less happy with the package , which will run up the federal deficit . in an official statement , association president karl heinz daeke called the measures a " smokescreen to distract from -lsb- the absence of -rsb- true tax relief . " while greeting the 18 billion euros of investment foreseen in the package , daeke called for increased vigilance to ensure that the money was n't wasted . he criticized the government premium of 2,500 euros to be paid to people who scrap their old cars and buy new ones , saying the auto industry would have benefited more from direct tax cuts . and he reminded germans that the program would come at a high cost . " every taxpayer should be aware that this stimulus package is being financed with debts which the community of tax payers will have to pay off in the future , " daeke said . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the former head of deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel , is reportedly ready to confess to tax evasion in return for a suspended sentence .
many ordinary taxpayers are , predictably , not amused . one of germany 's leading financial newspapers , handelsblatt , reported the deal late on monday evening , jan .
12 .
the paper cited an unnamed court official as its source .
zumwinkel was scheduled to go on trial next week for allegedly using the lgt bank in liechtenstein to hide nearly one million euros -lrb- $ 1.32 million -rrb- in income from german tax authorities .
the former ceo of germany 's postal company , deutsche post , was one of the most prominent figures involved in a scandal that broke last year , when it emerged that hundreds of wealthy germans were purportedly using foreign accounts to conceal money from the government .
the news led to many european governments to step up the pressure on so-called tax havens like liechtenstein to change their banking secrecy laws .
zumwinkel subsequently resigned his position at the deutsche post .
under the terms of the reported plea bargain , zumwinkel would admit to wrongdoing in return for receiving a two-year suspended sentence .
when asked by the afp news agency , a spokesperson for the court in bochum , where the trial is scheduled to take place , refused to confirm or deny the deal .
new legislation needed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : llb is another liechtenstein bank to be accused of aiding tax cheats according to handelsblatt , the plea bargain was only possible because the court had ruled that zumwinkel would only have to answer on charges of evading 970,000 euros in taxes from 2002-6 .
further evasion accusations from 2001 were deemed inadmissible because of germany 's statute of limitations - german law prohibits suspended sentences in cases involving more than million euros .
germany 's federal prosecutor monika harms has called in the past for legislation against so-called " back-room deals " in cases of serious economic crimes .
and germany 's bloggers are , not surprisingly , outraged by the news of the zumwinkel arrangement .
" it 's very bitter indeed for an ' average citizen ' to see the state differentiate between classes in applying its laws , " wrote one user of the bild newspaper 's online edition .
" it 's simply disgusting . "
few germans believe that zumwinkel would be able to reach such a deal , if he were not a former top executive .
" here in germany , tax evasion is sometimes prosecuted more vigorously than cases of rape , " wrote a commentator on the blog virtual nights .
" only if you 're the former boss of the post office , you can emerge from the affair with merely a black eye . "
but one user - presumably a former postal employee - took the news with a measure of humor .
" great , " he wrote .
" my ex-boss really knows what he 's doing . "

the former head of deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel , is reportedly ready to confess to tax evasion in return for a suspended sentence .
many ordinary taxpayers are , predictably , not amused . one of germany 's leading financial newspapers , handelsblatt , reported the deal late on monday evening , jan .
12 .
the paper cited an unnamed court official as its source .
zumwinkel was scheduled to go on trial next week for allegedly using the lgt bank in liechtenstein to hide nearly one million euros -lrb- $ 1.32 million -rrb- in income from german tax authorities .
the former ceo of germany 's postal company , deutsche post , was one of the most prominent figures involved in a scandal that broke last year , when it emerged that hundreds of wealthy germans were purportedly using foreign accounts to conceal money from the government .
the news led to many european governments to step up the pressure on so-called tax havens like liechtenstein to change their banking secrecy laws .
zumwinkel subsequently resigned his position at the deutsche post .
under the terms of the reported plea bargain , zumwinkel would admit to wrongdoing in return for receiving a two-year suspended sentence .
when asked by the afp news agency , a spokesperson for the court in bochum , where the trial is scheduled to take place , refused to confirm or deny the deal .
new legislation needed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : llb is another liechtenstein bank to be accused of aiding tax cheats according to handelsblatt , the plea bargain was only possible because the court had ruled that zumwinkel would only have to answer on charges of evading 970,000 euros in taxes from 2002-6 .
further evasion accusations from 2001 were deemed inadmissible because of germany 's statute of limitations - german law prohibits suspended sentences in cases involving more than million euros .
germany 's federal prosecutor monika harms has called in the past for legislation against so-called " back-room deals " in cases of serious economic crimes .
and germany 's bloggers are , not surprisingly , outraged by the news of the zumwinkel arrangement .
" it 's very bitter indeed for an ' average citizen ' to see the state differentiate between classes in applying its laws , " wrote one user of the bild newspaper 's online edition .
" it 's simply disgusting . "
few germans believe that zumwinkel would be able to reach such a deal , if he were not a former top executive .
" here in germany , tax evasion is sometimes prosecuted more vigorously than cases of rape , " wrote a commentator on the blog virtual nights .
" only if you 're the former boss of the post office , you can emerge from the affair with merely a black eye . "
but one user - presumably a former postal employee - took the news with a measure of humor .
" great , " he wrote .
" my ex-boss really knows what he 's doing . "
a number of prominent german executives - including former vw personnel boss and government advisor peter hartz - have received light sentences in criminal cases in recent years , prompting growing public anger and dismay . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the basis for successful crisis talks is rather weak , says dw 's bernd riegert . it was a similar situation three years ago .
russia and ukraine fought about gas prices .
the ones to suffer were the eu countries , whose gas supplies became scarce .
at the time , gas volumes were only reduced , the gas taps were n't fully turned off as is the case this winter .
at the time , the eu member states grandly promised to pursue a common energy policy which would lead to more independence from russia .
three years have passed and not a lot has happened .
quite the opposite is the case : russia and ukraine are even more brazenly showing the european union who has more pull when it comes to gas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission determined in its second report on an energy strategy last november that the dependence on russian gas will grow significantly in the next few years .
there is no prospect of this dependence easing before 2020 .
building new gas pipelines and finding suppliers in central asia or north africa was taking longer than they thought . in addition , russia was doing everything possible to torpedo european plans .
russia itself is going shopping for gas reserves in central asia .
russia is trying to form a supplier cartel of gas producing countries .
and russia is successfully attempting to divide the eu .
moscow has made bilateral supply and pipeline agreements with a few eu countries , which moscow considers to be friendly .
others - particularly the baltic states , poland , the czech republic and slovakia - should be thwarted from a russian perspective . the baltic pipeline which will connect russia directly with germany will not lessen the dependency on russian natural gas .
the necessary suppliers for the nabucco pipeline via turkey are still missing .
even iran , which could provide gas supplies one day , would not really be the most reliable partner . european interests differ meanwhile , european solidarity and the common gas market , which eu commission president jose barroso already evoked three years ago , is not far gone .
only now are countries beginning to think about connecting eu nations with each other with pipelines so that there is n't only the one-way street from russia .
no country is really willing to open its gas reserves for another nation .
there is no european storage for gas , only nationally administered ones . within the eu , the dependency on russian gas varies greatly .
finland and poland , for example , get every cubic meter of gas they use from russia .
spain does n't import any russian gas at all .
it 's evident that the interests are very different . it has now become clear to european gas clients and the eu commission in brussels that russia is no longer a reliable supplier .
moscow employs gas as a political weapon .
that should be a constructive shock for the eu .
the bloc 's summit in march will have to come up with an effective counter strategy . moscow is also dependent on the eu the success of the czech eu presidency is a ray of hope .
the czech republic 's prime minister mirek topolanek was able to mediate and get eu inspectors to monitor the gas flow from russia via ukraine .
this could be a beginning in taking action against the corruption in the gas business in russia and ukraine .
for with each cubic meter of gas sold , dubious middlemen also earn money . twenty percent of turnover is allegedly redirected into the pockets of the political and economic elite this way . the european union has to remain unified against russia and push through a new energy agreement .

falling prices are likely to make the leadership in moscow see that cooperation with the eu and western investors is better than confrontation . ukraine too is acting just as unreliably as russia is .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 13.01.2009 opinion : europe should push through a common energy policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should act as a mediator in the russia-ukraine energy row given that large parts of the continent have had their gas supplies cut .
but the basis for successful crisis talks is rather weak , says dw 's bernd riegert . it was a similar situation three years ago .
russia and ukraine fought about gas prices .
the ones to suffer were the eu countries , whose gas supplies became scarce .
at the time , gas volumes were only reduced , the gas taps were n't fully turned off as is the case this winter .
at the time , the eu member states grandly promised to pursue a common energy policy which would lead to more independence from russia .
three years have passed and not a lot has happened .
quite the opposite is the case : russia and ukraine are even more brazenly showing the european union who has more pull when it comes to gas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission determined in its second report on an energy strategy last november that the dependence on russian gas will grow significantly in the next few years .
there is no prospect of this dependence easing before 2020 .
building new gas pipelines and finding suppliers in central asia or north africa was taking longer than they thought . in addition , russia was doing everything possible to torpedo european plans .
russia itself is going shopping for gas reserves in central asia .
russia is trying to form a supplier cartel of gas producing countries .
and russia is successfully attempting to divide the eu .
moscow has made bilateral supply and pipeline agreements with a few eu countries , which moscow considers to be friendly .
others - particularly the baltic states , poland , the czech republic and slovakia - should be thwarted from a russian perspective . the baltic pipeline which will connect russia directly with germany will not lessen the dependency on russian natural gas .
the necessary suppliers for the nabucco pipeline via turkey are still missing .
even iran , which could provide gas supplies one day , would not really be the most reliable partner . european interests differ meanwhile , european solidarity and the common gas market , which eu commission president jose barroso already evoked three years ago , is not far gone .
only now are countries beginning to think about connecting eu nations with each other with pipelines so that there is n't only the one-way street from russia .
no country is really willing to open its gas reserves for another nation .
there is no european storage for gas , only nationally administered ones . within the eu , the dependency on russian gas varies greatly .
finland and poland , for example , get every cubic meter of gas they use from russia .
spain does n't import any russian gas at all .
it 's evident that the interests are very different . it has now become clear to european gas clients and the eu commission in brussels that russia is no longer a reliable supplier .
moscow employs gas as a political weapon .
that should be a constructive shock for the eu .
the bloc 's summit in march will have to come up with an effective counter strategy . moscow is also dependent on the eu the success of the czech eu presidency is a ray of hope .
the czech republic 's prime minister mirek topolanek was able to mediate and get eu inspectors to monitor the gas flow from russia via ukraine .
this could be a beginning in taking action against the corruption in the gas business in russia and ukraine .
for with each cubic meter of gas sold , dubious middlemen also earn money . twenty percent of turnover is allegedly redirected into the pockets of the political and economic elite this way . the european union has to remain unified against russia and push through a new energy agreement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 13.01.2009 opinion : bold stimulus package merits mixed grades großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's rolf wenkel says germany 's uneven economic-stimulus package shows courage despite its flaws . " test your strength " appears to be a midway favorite at the carnival that is this year 's recession , but the first time the german government swung the hammer , the needle did n't make it past " weakling . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now , government leaders - who admit their earlier tries were insufficient - have stepped right up and bought themselves another chance .
they 've decided to go whole hog , pledging 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 66 billion -rrb- over the next two years to help take the edge off the recession and spark the german economy .
education gets an ' a ' ...
but someone aiming to give the government marks for its various efforts would have to award grades running from an " a " all the way down to a " d. "
the investment program alone , which mainly commands spending in educational institutions , is worth some 18 billion euros .
it is brave , on-the-mark - and worthy of an " a. "
states and municipalities have been putting off investment for ages ; now they can get to work .
all they have to do is pull out their long-finished investment plans and dust them off . which means the plans can be put into effect quickly , thus providing an actual economic boost .
in an effort to give citizens and businesses a break and to boost consumer spending , the state lowered the marginal tax rate and raised the limit for non-taxable income .
it means there will be some nine billion fewer tax euros in government coffers . ... but the ' wrecking premium ' earns a ' d ' but lowering the marginal tax rate , and limiting so-called " cold progression " - an unfortunate system whereby the state increases its percentage claim on income in lockstep with an income increase - was long overdue .
it 's a measure that should have been taken even without an economic crisis , and so it only deserves a " c. "
the planned reduction in insurance contributions is likely to provide immediate relief not only to businesses and taxpayers , but also to retirees and low-income households .
it will cost the state another nine billion euros - and earns an " a " even though it is clear that the state can not continue to prop up the ailing social system at this level .
on the other hand , hotly debated protective measures for businesses are problematic .
in this case , the financial aid is aimed at sluggish bank lending , but not at the capital investments of the state in businesses , thus taking the touchy subject of state investment in business off the table .
but if companies take the government up on its guarantees , it could certainly prove to be expensive for the state .
ultimately , then , it is impossible to assign a grade to this move .
other measures are worthy of a " d " at best .
giving 100 euros per child to each citizen is unlikely to spark much consumer spending , and a " wrecking premium " for cars that are more than nine years old could give a leg up to the car industry - but which one ?
the french and japanese could profit as well as the germans on that account .
bold - or just brash ?
taken all together , though , the whole package can be labeled a courageous effort .
not only because it is the largest economic-stimulus package post-war germany has yet to create , but also because the state is narrowing its tax base - and thereby risks losing some of its negotiating status .
it is courageous because it is the first time germany has been willing to clearly breach the 40-billion-euro debt record set in 1996 , and thereby cross the debt-ratio line set by the maastricht treaty .
it is courageous in its self-confidence and belief in a better future .
but inordinate courage is often shown by those who are desperate .
time will tell just what kind of courage it took to strike this deal .

ukraine says it 's russia 's fault . the ukrainian gas company naftogas confirmed tuesday , january 13th that it was blocking gas shipments from russia .
but naftogas said that because russia had pumped the gas into the wrong pipeline , it could not be delivered without cutting off supplies to several regions in the ukraine itself .
the nthinky veiled implication was that russian gas company gazprom may have intentionally misrouted the gas to drive a wedge betwen the eu and ukraine .
the statements came after the eu had complained that little to no gas was on its way through ukrainian pipelines .
" the information we have from our monitors in russia is that little or no gas is currently flowing , eu commission spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde hansen told reporters earlier on tuesday .
ferran tarradellas , the spokesman for the eu 's energy commissioner , said that complaints had been registered with russian prime minister vladimir putin .
putin was reported to have said that ukraine was responsible for the blockage - gazprom said on tuesday that it had sent 76 million cubic meters of gas had been sent through the pipelines at 10 am moscow .
experts say it could take up to three days for gas pumped from siberia to reach europe , where thousands of people have been left without heat in one of the coldest winters the continent has seen in a decade .

europe relies on russia for roughly one quarter of all the natural gas it burns , and 80 percent of that gas arrives in the eu through pipelines crossing ukraine .
russian has discontinued gas supplies to ukraine itself amidst a dispute about the price kyiv should pay for russian gas .

ukraine says it 's russia 's fault . the ukrainian gas company naftogas confirmed tuesday , january 13th that it was blocking gas shipments from russia .
but naftogas said that because russia had pumped the gas into the wrong pipeline , it could not be delivered without cutting off supplies to several regions in the ukraine itself .
the nthinky veiled implication was that russian gas company gazprom may have intentionally misrouted the gas to drive a wedge betwen the eu and ukraine .
the statements came after the eu had complained that little to no gas was on its way through ukrainian pipelines .
" the information we have from our monitors in russia is that little or no gas is currently flowing , eu commission spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde hansen told reporters earlier on tuesday .
ferran tarradellas , the spokesman for the eu 's energy commissioner , said that complaints had been registered with russian prime minister vladimir putin .
putin was reported to have said that ukraine was responsible for the blockage - gazprom said on tuesday that it had sent 76 million cubic meters of gas had been sent through the pipelines at 10 am moscow .
experts say it could take up to three days for gas pumped from siberia to reach europe , where thousands of people have been left without heat in one of the coldest winters the continent has seen in a decade .
russia supplies an average of 350 million cubic meters of gas to europe in the winter months .

by the year 2050 , there will be 10 million fewer people in the country then there are today - with dramatic consequences for the working world . in the future , the classic office swivel chair will be something of a rarity .
instead , those reclining television lounge chairs will be everywhere .
and among the other novelties in the office of the future : more breaks where employees can nibble from fruit platters or have a massage in the company 's own fitness center .
even blue-collar workers will find that their jobs offer more comforts . the reason for these fantastic-sounding benefits is n't a sudden burst of benevolence on the part of employers , rather a necessary bit of calculation , says werner eichhorst from the institute for the study of labor in bonn . " in the future , it 'll be all about making the work load easier - on a daily , weekly , and yearly basis - because with fewer germans , there are fewer employees on the market , and those that are available are growing older , " he said .
" employers can no longer afford to wear out their workforce , and that 's why they have to take better care of them . " tomorrow 's working world if the current estimates from the federal statistics office come to pass , then in the next 30 years , germany will have six million fewer workers .
and the average age of an employee will increase from 42 to 48 . " fewer , older employees means that we wo n't be able to stick to the legal retirement age , " say experts at the bonn-based institute .
they 're predicting a retirement age close to 69 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts predict more german women will enter full-time work fewer people in germany and therefore fewer employees will be able to shoulder more of the daily workload .
the classic " nine to five " shift will no longer be possible , especially in the service sector .
the culture of presence in the workplace will fall away and even in manufacturing , more flexibility will be required .
eichhorst is convinced that more and more employees will work flexi-hours and be compensated according to their output or performance . " in a sense , the employee will become the employer , " he said . germany 's dwindling , ageing population will have other effects too , according to the institute for the study of labor .
until now , employees over the age of 45 have been considered too expensive by most employers . " the pay scales are going to change , " said eichhorst .
" it will no longer be the case that your salary automatically goes up the older you get . " new reality , new opportunities the lack of skilled workers will also make itself increasingly felt , especially as it 's not something that can be combated by the current rates of immigration .
labor researchers therefore expect policy in this area to undergo much improvement .
work conditions in germany have so far shown themselves to be less than attractive among sought-after skilled workers . the institute predicts two developments as a result : increased training opportunities for low-skilled workers and a jump in the number of women in full-time jobs .

the former head of deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel , is reportedly ready to confess to tax evasion in return for a suspended sentence .
many ordinary taxpayers are , predictably , not amused . one of germany 's leading financial newspapers , handelsblatt , reported the deal late on monday evening , jan .
12 .
the paper cited an unnamed court official as its source .
zumwinkel was scheduled to go on trial next week for allegedly using the lgt bank in liechtenstein to hide nearly one million euros -lrb- $ 1.32 million -rrb- in income from german tax authorities .
the former ceo of germany 's postal company , deutsche post , was one of the most prominent figures involved in a scandal that broke last year , when it emerged that hundreds of wealthy germans were purportedly using foreign accounts to conceal money from the government .
the news led to many european governments to step up the pressure on so-called tax havens like liechtenstein to change their banking secrecy laws .
zumwinkel subsequently resigned his position at the deutsche post .
under the terms of the reported plea bargain , zumwinkel would admit to wrongdoing in return for receiving a two-year suspended sentence .
when asked by the afp news agency , a spokesperson for the court in bochum , where the trial is scheduled to take place , refused to confirm or deny the deal .
new legislation needed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : llb is another liechtenstein bank to be accused of aiding tax cheats according to handelsblatt , the plea bargain was only possible because the court had ruled that zumwinkel would only have to answer on charges of evading 970,000 euros in taxes from 2002-6 .
further evasion accusations from 2001 were deemed inadmissible because of germany 's statute of limitations - german law prohibits suspended sentences in cases involving more than million euros .
germany 's federal prosecutor monika harms has called in the past for legislation against so-called " back-room deals " in cases of serious economic crimes .
and germany 's bloggers are , not surprisingly , outraged by the news of the zumwinkel arrangement .
" it 's very bitter indeed for an ' average citizen ' to see the state differentiate between classes in applying its laws , " wrote one user of the bild newspaper 's online edition .
" it 's simply disgusting . "
few germans believe that zumwinkel would be able to reach such a deal , if he were not a former top executive .
" here in germany , tax evasion is sometimes prosecuted more vigorously than cases of rape , " wrote a commentator on the blog virtual nights .
" only if you 're the former boss of the post office , you can emerge from the affair with merely a black eye . "
but one user - presumably a former postal employee - took the news with a measure of humor .
" great , " he wrote .
" my ex-boss really knows what he 's doing . "
a number of prominent german executives - including former vw personnel boss and government advisor peter hartz - have received light sentences in criminal cases in recent years , prompting growing public anger and dismay . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the three parties of germany 's grand coalition have agreed on a fresh round of stimulus measures worth billions to protect the weakening economy .
but some already worry the package will not offer the help that 's needed . in talks held late into the night on monday , jan .
12 , the governing parties committed to a huge wave of spending likely to inject up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 66 billion -rrb- into europe 's biggest economy , party officials said . in addition , the federal government would set up a massive fund to give loans and guarantees to struggling industries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : csu 's seehofer got the tax cuts he was wishing for the " credit and guarantee fund " will reportedly be worth 100 billion euros .
officials said its name would be a way of stressing that it would not be a vehicle for taking industries into government ownership . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have been wrangling for weeks with merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- over the package , with each of them eager to include pet policies in the huge surge of state spending . change of heart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel agreed to a ' credit and guarantee ' fund merkel initially resisted vast government spending as an antidote to recession , as advocated by the french and british governments , but a stream of bad economic data and the prospect of a general election this september changed the government 's mind . the round of emergency spending , spread over two years , would be the biggest since modern germany was established in 1949 . the broad terms were jointly announced by the chiefs of the three governing-party caucuses in the bundestag parliament : volker kauder of the cdu , peter ramsauer of the csu and peter struck of the spd . they said the cuts in corporate and income taxes , to take effect on july 1 , would inject 9 billion euros into the german economy , with the income tax scale beginning at 14 instead of 15 percent . a cut in state health-insurance premiums for german workers would cost a further 9 billion euros .
families with children are to receive a one-off bonus benefit of 100 euros per child , they added . " wrecking bonus " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can a " wrecking bonus " spur new-car sales ?
massive new government investment in education , highways and other projects would total 18 billion euros . sources said the six-hour meeting also produced agreement to grant a " wrecking bonus " to new-car buyers who send their old cars to the crusher .
the car industry has been complaining about slumping sales in germany . the agreement also includes cuts in health insurance contributions in order to put more cash in shoppers ' pockets , and simpler rules on creating temporary jobs , the officials said after the meeting .
" all in all this is a package that will help us to get through this economic crisis and keep jobs , " volker kauder , head of the cdu in parliament , told reporters late monday .
but some economists are worried the package will not help germany where it needs it most : its massive , but struggling , export sector .
the global downturn has significantly damaged the foreign demand for german goods . merkel to bring details merkel was scheduled to brief opposition parties early tuesday , jan .
13 .
she will then detail the package at a news conference , joined at the microphone by foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who is the social democratic party 's nominee for the chancellorship at this year 's election , and bavarian premier horst seehofer . the tax cuts marked a victory for the csu , the bavaria-only party that seehofer leads .
it had repeatedly attacked merkel 's insistence on balancing the budget before reforming tax scales . while the three-year-old grand coalition of germany 's main parties has become more fractious as the general election nears , there was broad agreement before the meeting that action against the nation 's economic woes was urgently needed . deepening recession a slew of fresh data has underscored that a deepening recession is taking hold in europe 's biggest economy .
figures last week showed a dramatic 10.6-percent plunge in german exports in november along with a hefty drop in factory orders and a bigger-than-forecast rise in december unemployment . leading german companies have already announced plans for layoffs and production cuts as global economic growth spirals downwards . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ukraine says it 's russia 's fault . the ukrainian gas company naftogas confirmed tuesday , january 13th that it was blocking gas shipments from russia .
but naftogas said that because russia had pumped the gas into the wrong pipeline , it could not be delivered without cutting off supplies to several regions in the ukraine itself .
the nthinky veiled implication was that russian gas company gazprom may have intentionally misrouted the gas to drive a wedge betwen the eu and ukraine .
the statements came after the eu had complained that little to no gas was on its way through ukrainian pipelines .
" the information we have from our monitors in russia is that little or no gas is currently flowing , eu commission spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde hansen told reporters earlier on tuesday .
ferran tarradellas , the spokesman for the eu 's energy commissioner , said that complaints had been registered with russian prime minister vladimir putin .
putin was reported to have said that ukraine was responsible for the blockage - gazprom said on tuesday that it had sent 76 million cubic meters of gas had been sent through the pipelines at 10 am moscow .
experts say it could take up to three days for gas pumped from siberia to reach europe , where thousands of people have been left without heat in one of the coldest winters the continent has seen in a decade .
russia supplies an average of 350 million cubic meters of gas to europe in the winter months .

europe relies on russia for roughly one quarter of all the natural gas it burns , and 80 percent of that gas arrives in the eu through pipelines crossing ukraine .
russian has discontinued gas supplies to ukraine itself amidst a dispute about the price kyiv should pay for russian gas .
russia , which has traditionally sold ukraine gas as prices far lower than those it asks from western europe , wants to raise its fees to $ 250 per 1000 cubic meters .

but early on tuesday , experts said still hardly any was flowing through ukraine pipelines .
ukraine says it 's russia 's fault . the ukrainian gas company naftogas confirmed tuesday , january 13th that it was blocking gas shipments from russia .
but naftogas said that because russia had pumped the gas into the wrong pipeline , it could not be delivered without cutting off supplies to several regions in the ukraine itself .
the nthinky veiled implication was that russian gas company gazprom may have intentionally misrouted the gas to drive a wedge betwen the eu and ukraine .
the statements came after the eu had complained that little to no gas was on its way through ukrainian pipelines .
" the information we have from our monitors in russia is that little or no gas is currently flowing , eu commission spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde hansen told reporters earlier on tuesday .
ferran tarradellas , the spokesman for the eu 's energy commissioner , said that complaints had been registered with russian prime minister vladimir putin .
putin was reported to have said that ukraine was responsible for the blockage - gazprom said on tuesday that it had sent 76 million cubic meters of gas had been sent through the pipelines at 10 am moscow .
experts say it could take up to three days for gas pumped from siberia to reach europe , where thousands of people have been left without heat in one of the coldest winters the continent has seen in a decade .
russia supplies an average of 350 million cubic meters of gas to europe in the winter months .
and because of the ongoing hostility between russia and ukraine , that supply is in jeopardy .
deal signed twice last wednesday , jan .

europe relies on russia for roughly one quarter of all the natural gas it burns , and 80 percent of that gas arrives in the eu through pipelines crossing ukraine .
russian has discontinued gas supplies to ukraine itself amidst a dispute about the price kyiv should pay for russian gas .
russia , which has traditionally sold ukraine gas as prices far lower than those it asks from western europe , wants to raise its fees to $ 250 per 1000 cubic meters .
kyiv says it ca n't afford to pay any more than $ 201 .
moscow has also accused kyiv of failing to settle old debts and of siphoning off gas from deliveries intended for western europe . dw staff -lrb- jc / jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the former head of deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel , is reportedly ready to confess to tax evasion in return for a suspended sentence .
many ordinary taxpayers are , predictably , not amused . one of germany 's leading financial newspapers , handelsblatt , reported the deal late on monday evening , jan .
12 .
the paper cited an unnamed court official as its source .
zumwinkel was scheduled to go on trial next week for allegedly using the lgt bank in liechtenstein to hide nearly one million euros -lrb- $ 1.32 million -rrb- in income from german tax authorities .
the former ceo of germany 's postal company , deutsche post , was one of the most prominent figures involved in a scandal that broke last year , when it emerged that hundreds of wealthy germans were purportedly using foreign accounts to conceal money from the government .
the news led to many european governments to step up the pressure on so-called tax havens like liechtenstein to change their banking secrecy laws .
zumwinkel subsequently resigned his position at the deutsche post .
under the terms of the reported plea bargain , zumwinkel would admit to wrongdoing in return for receiving a two-year suspended sentence .
when asked by the afp news agency , a spokesperson for the court in bochum , where the trial is scheduled to take place , refused to confirm or deny the deal .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : llb is another liechtenstein bank to be accused of aiding tax cheats according to handelsblatt , the plea bargain was only possible because the court had ruled that zumwinkel would only have to answer on charges of evading 970,000 euros in taxes from 2002-6 .
further evasion accusations from 2001 were deemed inadmissible because of germany 's statute of limitations - german law prohibits suspended sentences in cases involving more than million euros .
germany 's federal prosecutor monika harms has called in the past for legislation against so-called " back-room deals " in cases of serious economic crimes .

his aim is to translate music for his audiences . dw-world.de : mr. metzmacher , the history of dso -lrb- deutsches symphonieorchester berlin -rrb- is closely linked to germany 's history .
however , you are the orchestra 's first german principal conductor .
does that fact have special meaning to you ? ingo metzmacher : actually the orchestra was founded by the americans just after the war in 1946-47 .
it 's also interesting to know that it 's linked to the time just after the war when the americans , english , french and russians really tried to give germany a chance to rebuild .
they founded this orchestra for their radio station . for me , the orchestra represents the newborn germany after the second world war .
they 've had a wonderful line of chief conductors since then , but i 'm the first german .
i 've lived for maybe ten years in belgium and holland , so i think i also have a european or international background .
i feel very german , but within europe and within the world . do you think the orchestra 's unique history has an impact on its role today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metzmacher is also active as a pianist it should have a more important role .
it 's called the german symphony orchestra berlin , so i would like for it to be even more representative of the country and its culture .
also , we have more than 20 nationalities in the orchestra .
it really represents the international germany that we have today - especially in berlin .
there 's been a big change in germany and i think that this very young orchestra can show that to the world . this is your second season with dso .
what are your goals for your time with the orchestra ? i would like to strengthen the role i just described and , on the other hand , i would like to maintain the very high quality of playing .
during my time here , i have a project in mind - to look after the " german soul " in music .
that means : i 'm interested in the special relationship of the german culture to music .
major composers were born in the german-speaking world .
when you look at germany , with all its theaters and orchestras , its cultural landscape is unique in the world .
i think it represents the deep roots , which we have as germans , of music and theater . i think part of the reason is germany 's geographical position in the middle of europe .
it 's always been confronted by influences from all sides .
and the culture was always able to adopt the good parts of what came into the country .
you can see that , during the time when germany decided not to take in anything from outside but just to concentrate on the german roots , it completely failed .
it was a disaster .
i think the richness of the german culture is due to the fact that it always took in what came from outside . you 're known for your interest in modern and contemporary music .
how did this interest develop ? it came when i was maybe 20 years old .
i discovered the world of modern music for me .
i come from a very traditional , classical / romantic background .
my father was a musician and , for him , music was a kind of holy world .
i did n't believe so much in that when i grew up .
and it was very interesting for me to discover that there was a modern world of music - starting , actually , in 1909 .
since then , music for me has been a wide open field which i 've tried to discover for myself . how do you convey that to audiences ? i 've written a book ; i 've done hundreds of introductions before concerts ; i sometimes speak openly on the stage ; i do these casual concerts in berlin where i explain music to people .
after all , i do n't think it 's so difficult to explain music .
i think you just have to find the right words to describe what 's really happening .
you have to find a way to translate it .
that 's something that interests me a lot - trying to translate my understanding of music into a language with words .
that ’ s not easy because when you listen to the music you should forget the words again and try to understand the language that has no words . bildunterschrift : the deutsches symphonieorchester as you mentioned , you 've lived in several countries .
where do you feel at home ? i 've started to feel at home in berlin .
i always thought i would , but it took me longer than i thought .
my head told me berlin was the place i always wanted to be .
since i was young , i have longed for a german capital , which we didn ’ t have at the time .
when i was in london or paris i thought , what a pity that germany does n't have one like that - a real big city where everything comes together .
since reunification , i think berlin is growing into a major international capital .
so i was very thrilled to come here .
but it 's also not easy here .
it takes time to get used to it . what 's not easy about berlin ? it 's tough , especially in my field of music .
we have seven orchestras in this city ; we have three operas ; we have the berlin philharmonic as a major player - not only in germany but in the world .
it 's tough to find your audience , to create your own profile , and to convince the politicians they should give you the money you need . how does the dso try to create its own profile ? we are the only orchestra in town that has a theme .
we have the german soul .
we have 1909 .
we have a programmatic plan - that music has more to say than only to be beautiful .
i strongly believe in the content of music , although it has no words .

however , you are the orchestra 's first german principal conductor .
does that fact have special meaning to you ? ingo metzmacher : actually the orchestra was founded by the americans just after the war in 1946-47 .
it 's also interesting to know that it 's linked to the time just after the war when the americans , english , french and russians really tried to give germany a chance to rebuild .

his aim is to translate music for his audiences . dw-world.de : mr. metzmacher , the history of dso -lrb- deutsches symphonieorchester berlin -rrb- is closely linked to germany 's history .
however , you are the orchestra 's first german principal conductor .
does that fact have special meaning to you ? ingo metzmacher : actually the orchestra was founded by the americans just after the war in 1946-47 .
it 's also interesting to know that it 's linked to the time just after the war when the americans , english , french and russians really tried to give germany a chance to rebuild .
they founded this orchestra for their radio station . for me , the orchestra represents the newborn germany after the second world war .
they 've had a wonderful line of chief conductors since then , but i 'm the first german .
i 've lived for maybe ten years in belgium and holland , so i think i also have a european or international background .
i feel very german , but within europe and within the world . do you think the orchestra 's unique history has an impact on its role today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metzmacher is also active as a pianist it should have a more important role .
it 's called the german symphony orchestra berlin , so i would like for it to be even more representative of the country and its culture .
also , we have more than 20 nationalities in the orchestra .
it really represents the international germany that we have today - especially in berlin .
there 's been a big change in germany and i think that this very young orchestra can show that to the world . this is your second season with dso .
what are your goals for your time with the orchestra ? i would like to strengthen the role i just described and , on the other hand , i would like to maintain the very high quality of playing .
during my time here , i have a project in mind - to look after the " german soul " in music .
that means : i 'm interested in the special relationship of the german culture to music .
major composers were born in the german-speaking world .
when you look at germany , with all its theaters and orchestras , its cultural landscape is unique in the world .
i think it represents the deep roots , which we have as germans , of music and theater . i think part of the reason is germany 's geographical position in the middle of europe .
it 's always been confronted by influences from all sides .
and the culture was always able to adopt the good parts of what came into the country .
you can see that , during the time when germany decided not to take in anything from outside but just to concentrate on the german roots , it completely failed .
it was a disaster .
i think the richness of the german culture is due to the fact that it always took in what came from outside . you 're known for your interest in modern and contemporary music .
how did this interest develop ? it came when i was maybe 20 years old .
i discovered the world of modern music for me .
i come from a very traditional , classical / romantic background .
my father was a musician and , for him , music was a kind of holy world .
i did n't believe so much in that when i grew up .
and it was very interesting for me to discover that there was a modern world of music - starting , actually , in 1909 .
since then , music for me has been a wide open field which i 've tried to discover for myself . how do you convey that to audiences ? i 've written a book ; i 've done hundreds of introductions before concerts ; i sometimes speak openly on the stage ; i do these casual concerts in berlin where i explain music to people .
after all , i do n't think it 's so difficult to explain music .
i think you just have to find the right words to describe what 's really happening .
you have to find a way to translate it .
that 's something that interests me a lot - trying to translate my understanding of music into a language with words .
that ’ s not easy because when you listen to the music you should forget the words again and try to understand the language that has no words . bildunterschrift : the deutsches symphonieorchester as you mentioned , you 've lived in several countries .
where do you feel at home ? i 've started to feel at home in berlin .
i always thought i would , but it took me longer than i thought .
my head told me berlin was the place i always wanted to be .
since i was young , i have longed for a german capital , which we didn ’ t have at the time .
when i was in london or paris i thought , what a pity that germany does n't have one like that - a real big city where everything comes together .
since reunification , i think berlin is growing into a major international capital .
so i was very thrilled to come here .

but early on tuesday , experts said still hardly any was flowing through ukraine pipelines .
ukraine says it 's russia 's fault . the ukrainian gas company naftogas confirmed tuesday , january 13th that it was blocking gas shipments from russia .
but naftogas said that because russia had pumped the gas into the wrong pipeline , it could not be delivered without cutting off supplies to several regions in the ukraine itself .
the nthinky veiled implication was that russian gas company gazprom may have intentionally misrouted the gas to drive a wedge betwen the eu and ukraine .
the statements came after the eu had complained that little to no gas was on its way through ukrainian pipelines .
" the information we have from our monitors in russia is that little or no gas is currently flowing , eu commission spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde hansen told reporters earlier on tuesday .
ferran tarradellas , the spokesman for the eu 's energy commissioner , said that complaints had been registered with russian prime minister vladimir putin .
putin was reported to have said that ukraine was responsible for the blockage - gazprom said on tuesday that it had sent 76 million cubic meters of gas had been sent through the pipelines at 10 am moscow .
experts say it could take up to three days for gas pumped from siberia to reach europe , where thousands of people have been left without heat in one of the coldest winters the continent has seen in a decade .
russia supplies an average of 350 million cubic meters of gas to europe in the winter months .

europe relies on russia for roughly one quarter of all the natural gas it burns , and 80 percent of that gas arrives in the eu through pipelines crossing ukraine .
russian has discontinued gas supplies to ukraine itself amidst a dispute about the price kyiv should pay for russian gas .
russia , which has traditionally sold ukraine gas as prices far lower than those it asks from western europe , wants to raise its fees to $ 250 per 1000 cubic meters .
kyiv says it ca n't afford to pay any more than $ 201 .
moscow has also accused kyiv of failing to settle old debts and of siphoning off gas from deliveries intended for western europe . dw staff -lrb- jc / jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the three parties of germany 's grand coalition have agreed on a fresh round of stimulus measures worth billions to protect the weakening economy .
but some already worry the package will not offer the help that 's needed . in talks held late into the night on monday , jan .
12 , the governing parties committed to a huge wave of spending likely to inject up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 66 billion -rrb- into europe 's biggest economy , party officials said . in addition , the federal government would set up a massive fund to give loans and guarantees to struggling industries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : csu 's seehofer got the tax cuts he was wishing for the " credit and guarantee fund " will reportedly be worth 100 billion euros .
officials said its name would be a way of stressing that it would not be a vehicle for taking industries into government ownership . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have been wrangling for weeks with merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- over the package , with each of them eager to include pet policies in the huge surge of state spending . change of heart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel agreed to a ' credit and guarantee ' fund merkel initially resisted vast government spending as an antidote to recession , as advocated by the french and british governments , but a stream of bad economic data and the prospect of a general election this september changed the government 's mind . the round of emergency spending , spread over two years , would be the biggest since modern germany was established in 1949 . the broad terms were jointly announced by the chiefs of the three governing-party caucuses in the bundestag parliament : volker kauder of the cdu , peter ramsauer of the csu and peter struck of the spd . they said the cuts in corporate and income taxes , to take effect on july 1 , would inject 9 billion euros into the german economy , with the income tax scale beginning at 14 instead of 15 percent . a cut in state health-insurance premiums for german workers would cost a further 9 billion euros .
families with children are to receive a one-off bonus benefit of 100 euros per child , they added . " wrecking bonus " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can a " wrecking bonus " spur new-car sales ?
massive new government investment in education , highways and other projects would total 18 billion euros . sources said the six-hour meeting also produced agreement to grant a " wrecking bonus " to new-car buyers who send their old cars to the crusher .
the car industry has been complaining about slumping sales in germany . the agreement also includes cuts in health insurance contributions in order to put more cash in shoppers ' pockets , and simpler rules on creating temporary jobs , the officials said after the meeting .
" all in all this is a package that will help us to get through this economic crisis and keep jobs , " volker kauder , head of the cdu in parliament , told reporters late monday .
but some economists are worried the package will not help germany where it needs it most : its massive , but struggling , export sector .
the global downturn has significantly damaged the foreign demand for german goods . merkel to bring details merkel was scheduled to brief opposition parties early tuesday , jan .
13 .
she will then detail the package at a news conference , joined at the microphone by foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who is the social democratic party 's nominee for the chancellorship at this year 's election , and bavarian premier horst seehofer . the tax cuts marked a victory for the csu , the bavaria-only party that seehofer leads .
it had repeatedly attacked merkel 's insistence on balancing the budget before reforming tax scales . while the three-year-old grand coalition of germany 's main parties has become more fractious as the general election nears , there was broad agreement before the meeting that action against the nation 's economic woes was urgently needed . deepening recession a slew of fresh data has underscored that a deepening recession is taking hold in europe 's biggest economy .
figures last week showed a dramatic 10.6-percent plunge in german exports in november along with a hefty drop in factory orders and a bigger-than-forecast rise in december unemployment . leading german companies have already announced plans for layoffs and production cuts as global economic growth spirals downwards . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 13.01.2009 opinion : bold stimulus package merits mixed grades großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's rolf wenkel says germany 's uneven economic-stimulus package shows courage despite its flaws . " test your strength " appears to be a midway favorite at the carnival that is this year 's recession , but the first time the german government swung the hammer , the needle did n't make it past " weakling . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now , government leaders - who admit their earlier tries were insufficient - have stepped right up and bought themselves another chance .
they 've decided to go whole hog , pledging 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 66 billion -rrb- over the next two years to help take the edge off the recession and spark the german economy .
education gets an ' a ' ...
but someone aiming to give the government marks for its various efforts would have to award grades running from an " a " all the way down to a " d. "
the investment program alone , which mainly commands spending in educational institutions , is worth some 18 billion euros .
it is brave , on-the-mark - and worthy of an " a. "
states and municipalities have been putting off investment for ages ; now they can get to work .
all they have to do is pull out their long-finished investment plans and dust them off . which means the plans can be put into effect quickly , thus providing an actual economic boost .
in an effort to give citizens and businesses a break and to boost consumer spending , the state lowered the marginal tax rate and raised the limit for non-taxable income .
it means there will be some nine billion fewer tax euros in government coffers . ... but the ' wrecking premium ' earns a ' d ' but lowering the marginal tax rate , and limiting so-called " cold progression " - an unfortunate system whereby the state increases its percentage claim on income in lockstep with an income increase - was long overdue .
it 's a measure that should have been taken even without an economic crisis , and so it only deserves a " c. "
the planned reduction in insurance contributions is likely to provide immediate relief not only to businesses and taxpayers , but also to retirees and low-income households .
it will cost the state another nine billion euros - and earns an " a " even though it is clear that the state can not continue to prop up the ailing social system at this level .
on the other hand , hotly debated protective measures for businesses are problematic .
in this case , the financial aid is aimed at sluggish bank lending , but not at the capital investments of the state in businesses , thus taking the touchy subject of state investment in business off the table .
but if companies take the government up on its guarantees , it could certainly prove to be expensive for the state .
ultimately , then , it is impossible to assign a grade to this move .
other measures are worthy of a " d " at best .
giving 100 euros per child to each citizen is unlikely to spark much consumer spending , and a " wrecking premium " for cars that are more than nine years old could give a leg up to the car industry - but which one ?
the french and japanese could profit as well as the germans on that account .
bold - or just brash ?
taken all together , though , the whole package can be labeled a courageous effort .
not only because it is the largest economic-stimulus package post-war germany has yet to create , but also because the state is narrowing its tax base - and thereby risks losing some of its negotiating status .
it is courageous because it is the first time germany has been willing to clearly breach the 40-billion-euro debt record set in 1996 , and thereby cross the debt-ratio line set by the maastricht treaty .
it is courageous in its self-confidence and belief in a better future .
but inordinate courage is often shown by those who are desperate .
time will tell just what kind of courage it took to strike this deal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 13.01.2009 germany 's stimulus package convinces some , not all experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinmeier say no country is doing more than germany to boost its economy german chancellor merkel 's coalition has unveiled a 50-billion-euro stimulus package meant to boost growth and protect jobs in europe 's biggest economy .
but not all experts are convinced it can help beat the downturn . germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel was full of praise for the initiative , being touted as a " pact for germany , " which her coalition passed on tuesday , january 11 . merkel told reporters her government was doing " everything possible so that germany does not just overcome this crisis , but emerges from it stronger . " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier from merkel 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , said the german package of investments , government loans and hand-outs , and tax cuts , compared favorably with stimulus measures taken by other nations . " when i look around europe , i ca n't see anyone else doing more or taking better steps than we are , " he told reporters . the package has come after mounting criticism that the government was being too hesitant in combating the economic decline prompted by the global financial crisis . soon enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " konjunktur " is german for " economic growth , " but not everyone likes this package but leading private-sector economists in germany disagreed about whether the so-called pact was all government ministers were claiming . the chief economist of commerzbank , joerg kraemer , was impressed .

the former head of deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel , is reportedly ready to confess to tax evasion in return for a suspended sentence .
many ordinary taxpayers are , predictably , not amused . one of germany 's leading financial newspapers , handelsblatt , reported the deal late on monday evening , jan .
12 .
the paper cited an unnamed court official as its source .
zumwinkel was scheduled to go on trial next week for allegedly using the lgt bank in liechtenstein to hide nearly one million euros -lrb- $ 1.32 million -rrb- in income from german tax authorities .
the former ceo of germany 's postal company , deutsche post , was one of the most prominent figures involved in a scandal that broke last year , when it emerged that hundreds of wealthy germans were purportedly using foreign accounts to conceal money from the government .
the news led to many european governments to step up the pressure on so-called tax havens like liechtenstein to change their banking secrecy laws .
zumwinkel subsequently resigned his position at the deutsche post .
under the terms of the reported plea bargain , zumwinkel would admit to wrongdoing in return for receiving a two-year suspended sentence .
when asked by the afp news agency , a spokesperson for the court in bochum , where the trial is scheduled to take place , refused to confirm or deny the deal .
new legislation needed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : llb is another liechtenstein bank to be accused of aiding tax cheats according to handelsblatt , the plea bargain was only possible because the court had ruled that zumwinkel would only have to answer on charges of evading 970,000 euros in taxes from 2002-6 .
further evasion accusations from 2001 were deemed inadmissible because of germany 's statute of limitations - german law prohibits suspended sentences in cases involving more than million euros .
germany 's federal prosecutor monika harms has called in the past for legislation against so-called " back-room deals " in cases of serious economic crimes .
and germany 's bloggers are , not surprisingly , outraged by the news of the zumwinkel arrangement .
" it 's very bitter indeed for an ' average citizen ' to see the state differentiate between classes in applying its laws , " wrote one user of the bild newspaper 's online edition .
" it 's simply disgusting . "
few germans believe that zumwinkel would be able to reach such a deal , if he were not a former top executive .
" here in germany , tax evasion is sometimes prosecuted more vigorously than cases of rape , " wrote a commentator on the blog virtual nights .
" only if you 're the former boss of the post office , you can emerge from the affair with merely a black eye . "
but one user - presumably a former postal employee - took the news with a measure of humor .
" great , " he wrote .
" my ex-boss really knows what he 's doing . "

the former head of deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel , is reportedly ready to confess to tax evasion in return for a suspended sentence .
many ordinary taxpayers are , predictably , not amused . one of germany 's leading financial newspapers , handelsblatt , reported the deal late on monday evening , jan .
12 .
the paper cited an unnamed court official as its source .
zumwinkel was scheduled to go on trial next week for allegedly using the lgt bank in liechtenstein to hide nearly one million euros -lrb- $ 1.32 million -rrb- in income from german tax authorities .
the former ceo of germany 's postal company , deutsche post , was one of the most prominent figures involved in a scandal that broke last year , when it emerged that hundreds of wealthy germans were purportedly using foreign accounts to conceal money from the government .
the news led to many european governments to step up the pressure on so-called tax havens like liechtenstein to change their banking secrecy laws .
zumwinkel subsequently resigned his position at the deutsche post .
under the terms of the reported plea bargain , zumwinkel would admit to wrongdoing in return for receiving a two-year suspended sentence .
when asked by the afp news agency , a spokesperson for the court in bochum , where the trial is scheduled to take place , refused to confirm or deny the deal .
new legislation needed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : llb is another liechtenstein bank to be accused of aiding tax cheats according to handelsblatt , the plea bargain was only possible because the court had ruled that zumwinkel would only have to answer on charges of evading 970,000 euros in taxes from 2002-6 .
further evasion accusations from 2001 were deemed inadmissible because of germany 's statute of limitations - german law prohibits suspended sentences in cases involving more than million euros .
germany 's federal prosecutor monika harms has called in the past for legislation against so-called " back-room deals " in cases of serious economic crimes .
and germany 's bloggers are , not surprisingly , outraged by the news of the zumwinkel arrangement .

but early on tuesday , experts said still hardly any was flowing through ukraine pipelines .
ukraine says it 's russia 's fault . the ukrainian gas company naftogas confirmed tuesday , january 13th that it was blocking gas shipments from russia .
but naftogas said that because russia had pumped the gas into the wrong pipeline , it could not be delivered without cutting off supplies to several regions in the ukraine itself .
the nthinky veiled implication was that russian gas company gazprom may have intentionally misrouted the gas to drive a wedge betwen the eu and ukraine .
the statements came after the eu had complained that little to no gas was on its way through ukrainian pipelines .
" the information we have from our monitors in russia is that little or no gas is currently flowing , eu commission spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde hansen told reporters earlier on tuesday .
ferran tarradellas , the spokesman for the eu 's energy commissioner , said that complaints had been registered with russian prime minister vladimir putin .
putin was reported to have said that ukraine was responsible for the blockage - gazprom said on tuesday that it had sent 76 million cubic meters of gas had been sent through the pipelines at 10 am moscow .
experts say it could take up to three days for gas pumped from siberia to reach europe , where thousands of people have been left without heat in one of the coldest winters the continent has seen in a decade .
russia supplies an average of 350 million cubic meters of gas to europe in the winter months .
and because of the ongoing hostility between russia and ukraine , that supply is in jeopardy .
deal signed twice last wednesday , jan .
7 , gazprom halted all shipments in an attempt to stop what it called ukraine 's theft of gas destined for european clients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu observers came to this gas-measuring station under a long-awaited deal that had to be signed twice within the space of a few days , 25 experts from the european union , ukraine and russia are to monitor gas flows at five compressor stations in both ukraine and russia and another three stations in slovakia and romania .
europe relies on russia for roughly one quarter of all the natural gas it burns , and 80 percent of that gas arrives in the eu through pipelines crossing ukraine .
russian has discontinued gas supplies to ukraine itself amidst a dispute about the price kyiv should pay for russian gas .
russia , which has traditionally sold ukraine gas as prices far lower than those it asks from western europe , wants to raise its fees to $ 250 per 1000 cubic meters .
kyiv says it ca n't afford to pay any more than $ 201 .
moscow has also accused kyiv of failing to settle old debts and of siphoning off gas from deliveries intended for western europe . dw staff -lrb- jc / jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the basis for successful crisis talks is rather weak , says dw 's bernd riegert . it was a similar situation three years ago .
russia and ukraine fought about gas prices .
the ones to suffer were the eu countries , whose gas supplies became scarce .
at the time , gas volumes were only reduced , the gas taps were n't fully turned off as is the case this winter .
at the time , the eu member states grandly promised to pursue a common energy policy which would lead to more independence from russia .
three years have passed and not a lot has happened .
quite the opposite is the case : russia and ukraine are even more brazenly showing the european union who has more pull when it comes to gas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission determined in its second report on an energy strategy last november that the dependence on russian gas will grow significantly in the next few years .
there is no prospect of this dependence easing before 2020 .
building new gas pipelines and finding suppliers in central asia or north africa was taking longer than they thought . in addition , russia was doing everything possible to torpedo european plans .
russia itself is going shopping for gas reserves in central asia .
russia is trying to form a supplier cartel of gas producing countries .
and russia is successfully attempting to divide the eu .
moscow has made bilateral supply and pipeline agreements with a few eu countries , which moscow considers to be friendly .
others - particularly the baltic states , poland , the czech republic and slovakia - should be thwarted from a russian perspective . the baltic pipeline which will connect russia directly with germany will not lessen the dependency on russian natural gas .
the necessary suppliers for the nabucco pipeline via turkey are still missing .
even iran , which could provide gas supplies one day , would not really be the most reliable partner . european interests differ meanwhile , european solidarity and the common gas market , which eu commission president jose barroso already evoked three years ago , is not far gone .
only now are countries beginning to think about connecting eu nations with each other with pipelines so that there is n't only the one-way street from russia .
no country is really willing to open its gas reserves for another nation .
there is no european storage for gas , only nationally administered ones . within the eu , the dependency on russian gas varies greatly .
finland and poland , for example , get every cubic meter of gas they use from russia .
spain does n't import any russian gas at all .
it 's evident that the interests are very different . it has now become clear to european gas clients and the eu commission in brussels that russia is no longer a reliable supplier .
moscow employs gas as a political weapon .
that should be a constructive shock for the eu .
the bloc 's summit in march will have to come up with an effective counter strategy . moscow is also dependent on the eu the success of the czech eu presidency is a ray of hope .
the czech republic 's prime minister mirek topolanek was able to mediate and get eu inspectors to monitor the gas flow from russia via ukraine .
this could be a beginning in taking action against the corruption in the gas business in russia and ukraine .
for with each cubic meter of gas sold , dubious middlemen also earn money . twenty percent of turnover is allegedly redirected into the pockets of the political and economic elite this way . the european union has to remain unified against russia and push through a new energy agreement .
european companies have to finally be allowed to tap energy sources in russia and build up infrastructure for its transport . russia raked in tons of cash so long as the world economy was booming and energy prices rose . now , russia as a supplier may be noticing that it too is dependent on its customers .
falling prices are likely to make the leadership in moscow see that cooperation with the eu and western investors is better than confrontation . ukraine too is acting just as unreliably as russia is .
it is diverting gas or blocking deliveries from russia .

the bloc 's summit in march will have to come up with an effective counter strategy . moscow is also dependent on the eu the success of the czech eu presidency is a ray of hope .
the czech republic 's prime minister mirek topolanek was able to mediate and get eu inspectors to monitor the gas flow from russia via ukraine .
this could be a beginning in taking action against the corruption in the gas business in russia and ukraine .
for with each cubic meter of gas sold , dubious middlemen also earn money . twenty percent of turnover is allegedly redirected into the pockets of the political and economic elite this way . the european union has to remain unified against russia and push through a new energy agreement .
european companies have to finally be allowed to tap energy sources in russia and build up infrastructure for its transport . russia raked in tons of cash so long as the world economy was booming and energy prices rose . now , russia as a supplier may be noticing that it too is dependent on its customers .
falling prices are likely to make the leadership in moscow see that cooperation with the eu and western investors is better than confrontation . ukraine too is acting just as unreliably as russia is .
it is diverting gas or blocking deliveries from russia .
this disqualifies ukraine both as a candidate for nato and eu membership . bernd riegert -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the basis for successful crisis talks is rather weak , says dw 's bernd riegert . it was a similar situation three years ago .
russia and ukraine fought about gas prices .
the ones to suffer were the eu countries , whose gas supplies became scarce .
at the time , gas volumes were only reduced , the gas taps were n't fully turned off as is the case this winter .
at the time , the eu member states grandly promised to pursue a common energy policy which would lead to more independence from russia .
three years have passed and not a lot has happened .
quite the opposite is the case : russia and ukraine are even more brazenly showing the european union who has more pull when it comes to gas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission determined in its second report on an energy strategy last november that the dependence on russian gas will grow significantly in the next few years .
there is no prospect of this dependence easing before 2020 .
building new gas pipelines and finding suppliers in central asia or north africa was taking longer than they thought . in addition , russia was doing everything possible to torpedo european plans .
russia itself is going shopping for gas reserves in central asia .
russia is trying to form a supplier cartel of gas producing countries .
and russia is successfully attempting to divide the eu .
moscow has made bilateral supply and pipeline agreements with a few eu countries , which moscow considers to be friendly .
others - particularly the baltic states , poland , the czech republic and slovakia - should be thwarted from a russian perspective . the baltic pipeline which will connect russia directly with germany will not lessen the dependency on russian natural gas .
the necessary suppliers for the nabucco pipeline via turkey are still missing .
even iran , which could provide gas supplies one day , would not really be the most reliable partner . european interests differ meanwhile , european solidarity and the common gas market , which eu commission president jose barroso already evoked three years ago , is not far gone .
only now are countries beginning to think about connecting eu nations with each other with pipelines so that there is n't only the one-way street from russia .
no country is really willing to open its gas reserves for another nation .
there is no european storage for gas , only nationally administered ones . within the eu , the dependency on russian gas varies greatly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 13.01.2009 opinion : europe should push through a common energy policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should act as a mediator in the russia-ukraine energy row given that large parts of the continent have had their gas supplies cut .
but the basis for successful crisis talks is rather weak , says dw 's bernd riegert . it was a similar situation three years ago .
russia and ukraine fought about gas prices .
the ones to suffer were the eu countries , whose gas supplies became scarce .
at the time , gas volumes were only reduced , the gas taps were n't fully turned off as is the case this winter .
at the time , the eu member states grandly promised to pursue a common energy policy which would lead to more independence from russia .
three years have passed and not a lot has happened .
quite the opposite is the case : russia and ukraine are even more brazenly showing the european union who has more pull when it comes to gas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission determined in its second report on an energy strategy last november that the dependence on russian gas will grow significantly in the next few years .
there is no prospect of this dependence easing before 2020 .
building new gas pipelines and finding suppliers in central asia or north africa was taking longer than they thought . in addition , russia was doing everything possible to torpedo european plans .
russia itself is going shopping for gas reserves in central asia .
russia is trying to form a supplier cartel of gas producing countries .
and russia is successfully attempting to divide the eu .
moscow has made bilateral supply and pipeline agreements with a few eu countries , which moscow considers to be friendly .
others - particularly the baltic states , poland , the czech republic and slovakia - should be thwarted from a russian perspective . the baltic pipeline which will connect russia directly with germany will not lessen the dependency on russian natural gas .
the necessary suppliers for the nabucco pipeline via turkey are still missing .
even iran , which could provide gas supplies one day , would not really be the most reliable partner . european interests differ meanwhile , european solidarity and the common gas market , which eu commission president jose barroso already evoked three years ago , is not far gone .
only now are countries beginning to think about connecting eu nations with each other with pipelines so that there is n't only the one-way street from russia .
no country is really willing to open its gas reserves for another nation .
there is no european storage for gas , only nationally administered ones . within the eu , the dependency on russian gas varies greatly .
finland and poland , for example , get every cubic meter of gas they use from russia .
spain does n't import any russian gas at all .
it 's evident that the interests are very different . it has now become clear to european gas clients and the eu commission in brussels that russia is no longer a reliable supplier .
moscow employs gas as a political weapon .
that should be a constructive shock for the eu .
the bloc 's summit in march will have to come up with an effective counter strategy . moscow is also dependent on the eu the success of the czech eu presidency is a ray of hope .
the czech republic 's prime minister mirek topolanek was able to mediate and get eu inspectors to monitor the gas flow from russia via ukraine .
this could be a beginning in taking action against the corruption in the gas business in russia and ukraine .
for with each cubic meter of gas sold , dubious middlemen also earn money . twenty percent of turnover is allegedly redirected into the pockets of the political and economic elite this way . the european union has to remain unified against russia and push through a new energy agreement .

" daimler said it had expected to sell around 16,000 units of the french-made two-seater , but that this figure was bettered by more than 8,000 additional vehicle sales . the new smart even seems to have defied current auto sales trends in the us , which have been in freefall since the credit crunch took hold .
there is a six-month waiting list for the smart . but he warned that high sales in 2008 did not necessarily signal similarly high sales in 2009 . penske said that 55 percent of prospects who placed a $ 99 internet deposit to reserve a smart car had eventually gone through with purchasing one of the vehicles . " we 're being very , very conservative , " he told reporters on the sidelines of the detroit auto show . " we would be happy to stay even and just do what we did in 2008 , " added david schembri , president of smart usa . the deepening recession in the us pushed car sales down 18 percent in the most precipitous decline in 29 years and the lowest levels since 1992 . us car sales have been predicted to fall in 2009 by as much as three million units to around 11 million vehicles . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but early on tuesday , experts said still hardly any was flowing through ukraine pipelines .
ukraine says it 's russia 's fault . the ukrainian gas company naftogas confirmed tuesday , january 13th that it was blocking gas shipments from russia .
but naftogas said that because russia had pumped the gas into the wrong pipeline , it could not be delivered without cutting off supplies to several regions in the ukraine itself .
the nthinky veiled implication was that russian gas company gazprom may have intentionally misrouted the gas to drive a wedge betwen the eu and ukraine .
the statements came after the eu had complained that little to no gas was on its way through ukrainian pipelines .
" the information we have from our monitors in russia is that little or no gas is currently flowing , eu commission spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde hansen told reporters earlier on tuesday .
ferran tarradellas , the spokesman for the eu 's energy commissioner , said that complaints had been registered with russian prime minister vladimir putin .
putin was reported to have said that ukraine was responsible for the blockage - gazprom said on tuesday that it had sent 76 million cubic meters of gas had been sent through the pipelines at 10 am moscow .
experts say it could take up to three days for gas pumped from siberia to reach europe , where thousands of people have been left without heat in one of the coldest winters the continent has seen in a decade .
russia supplies an average of 350 million cubic meters of gas to europe in the winter months .
and because of the ongoing hostility between russia and ukraine , that supply is in jeopardy .
deal signed twice last wednesday , jan .
7 , gazprom halted all shipments in an attempt to stop what it called ukraine 's theft of gas destined for european clients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu observers came to this gas-measuring station under a long-awaited deal that had to be signed twice within the space of a few days , 25 experts from the european union , ukraine and russia are to monitor gas flows at five compressor stations in both ukraine and russia and another three stations in slovakia and romania .
europe relies on russia for roughly one quarter of all the natural gas it burns , and 80 percent of that gas arrives in the eu through pipelines crossing ukraine .
russian has discontinued gas supplies to ukraine itself amidst a dispute about the price kyiv should pay for russian gas .
russia , which has traditionally sold ukraine gas as prices far lower than those it asks from western europe , wants to raise its fees to $ 250 per 1000 cubic meters .
kyiv says it ca n't afford to pay any more than $ 201 .
moscow has also accused kyiv of failing to settle old debts and of siphoning off gas from deliveries intended for western europe . dw staff -lrb- jc / jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his aim is to translate music for his audiences . dw-world.de : mr. metzmacher , the history of dso -lrb- deutsches symphonieorchester berlin -rrb- is closely linked to germany 's history .
however , you are the orchestra 's first german principal conductor .
does that fact have special meaning to you ? ingo metzmacher : actually the orchestra was founded by the americans just after the war in 1946-47 .
it 's also interesting to know that it 's linked to the time just after the war when the americans , english , french and russians really tried to give germany a chance to rebuild .
they founded this orchestra for their radio station . for me , the orchestra represents the newborn germany after the second world war .
they 've had a wonderful line of chief conductors since then , but i 'm the first german .
i 've lived for maybe ten years in belgium and holland , so i think i also have a european or international background .
i feel very german , but within europe and within the world . do you think the orchestra 's unique history has an impact on its role today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metzmacher is also active as a pianist it should have a more important role .
it 's called the german symphony orchestra berlin , so i would like for it to be even more representative of the country and its culture .
also , we have more than 20 nationalities in the orchestra .
it really represents the international germany that we have today - especially in berlin .
there 's been a big change in germany and i think that this very young orchestra can show that to the world . this is your second season with dso .
what are your goals for your time with the orchestra ? i would like to strengthen the role i just described and , on the other hand , i would like to maintain the very high quality of playing .
during my time here , i have a project in mind - to look after the " german soul " in music .
that means : i 'm interested in the special relationship of the german culture to music .
major composers were born in the german-speaking world .
when you look at germany , with all its theaters and orchestras , its cultural landscape is unique in the world .
i think it represents the deep roots , which we have as germans , of music and theater . i think part of the reason is germany 's geographical position in the middle of europe .
it 's always been confronted by influences from all sides .
and the culture was always able to adopt the good parts of what came into the country .
you can see that , during the time when germany decided not to take in anything from outside but just to concentrate on the german roots , it completely failed .
it was a disaster .
i think the richness of the german culture is due to the fact that it always took in what came from outside . you 're known for your interest in modern and contemporary music .
how did this interest develop ? it came when i was maybe 20 years old .
i discovered the world of modern music for me .
i come from a very traditional , classical / romantic background .
my father was a musician and , for him , music was a kind of holy world .
i did n't believe so much in that when i grew up .
and it was very interesting for me to discover that there was a modern world of music - starting , actually , in 1909 .
since then , music for me has been a wide open field which i 've tried to discover for myself . how do you convey that to audiences ? i 've written a book ; i 've done hundreds of introductions before concerts ; i sometimes speak openly on the stage ; i do these casual concerts in berlin where i explain music to people .
after all , i do n't think it 's so difficult to explain music .
i think you just have to find the right words to describe what 's really happening .
you have to find a way to translate it .
that 's something that interests me a lot - trying to translate my understanding of music into a language with words .
that ’ s not easy because when you listen to the music you should forget the words again and try to understand the language that has no words . bildunterschrift : the deutsches symphonieorchester as you mentioned , you 've lived in several countries .
where do you feel at home ? i 've started to feel at home in berlin .

his aim is to translate music for his audiences . dw-world.de : mr. metzmacher , the history of dso -lrb- deutsches symphonieorchester berlin -rrb- is closely linked to germany 's history .
however , you are the orchestra 's first german principal conductor .
does that fact have special meaning to you ? ingo metzmacher : actually the orchestra was founded by the americans just after the war in 1946-47 .
it 's also interesting to know that it 's linked to the time just after the war when the americans , english , french and russians really tried to give germany a chance to rebuild .
they founded this orchestra for their radio station . for me , the orchestra represents the newborn germany after the second world war .
they 've had a wonderful line of chief conductors since then , but i 'm the first german .
i 've lived for maybe ten years in belgium and holland , so i think i also have a european or international background .
i feel very german , but within europe and within the world . do you think the orchestra 's unique history has an impact on its role today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metzmacher is also active as a pianist it should have a more important role .
it 's called the german symphony orchestra berlin , so i would like for it to be even more representative of the country and its culture .
also , we have more than 20 nationalities in the orchestra .
it really represents the international germany that we have today - especially in berlin .
there 's been a big change in germany and i think that this very young orchestra can show that to the world . this is your second season with dso .
what are your goals for your time with the orchestra ? i would like to strengthen the role i just described and , on the other hand , i would like to maintain the very high quality of playing .
during my time here , i have a project in mind - to look after the " german soul " in music .
that means : i 'm interested in the special relationship of the german culture to music .
major composers were born in the german-speaking world .
when you look at germany , with all its theaters and orchestras , its cultural landscape is unique in the world .
i think it represents the deep roots , which we have as germans , of music and theater . i think part of the reason is germany 's geographical position in the middle of europe .
it 's always been confronted by influences from all sides .
and the culture was always able to adopt the good parts of what came into the country .
you can see that , during the time when germany decided not to take in anything from outside but just to concentrate on the german roots , it completely failed .
it was a disaster .
i think the richness of the german culture is due to the fact that it always took in what came from outside . you 're known for your interest in modern and contemporary music .
how did this interest develop ? it came when i was maybe 20 years old .
i discovered the world of modern music for me .
i come from a very traditional , classical / romantic background .
my father was a musician and , for him , music was a kind of holy world .
i did n't believe so much in that when i grew up .
and it was very interesting for me to discover that there was a modern world of music - starting , actually , in 1909 .
since then , music for me has been a wide open field which i 've tried to discover for myself . how do you convey that to audiences ? i 've written a book ; i 've done hundreds of introductions before concerts ; i sometimes speak openly on the stage ; i do these casual concerts in berlin where i explain music to people .
after all , i do n't think it 's so difficult to explain music .
i think you just have to find the right words to describe what 's really happening .
you have to find a way to translate it .
that 's something that interests me a lot - trying to translate my understanding of music into a language with words .
that ’ s not easy because when you listen to the music you should forget the words again and try to understand the language that has no words . bildunterschrift : the deutsches symphonieorchester as you mentioned , you 've lived in several countries .
where do you feel at home ? i 've started to feel at home in berlin .
i always thought i would , but it took me longer than i thought .
my head told me berlin was the place i always wanted to be .
since i was young , i have longed for a german capital , which we didn ’ t have at the time .

his aim is to translate music for his audiences . dw-world.de : mr. metzmacher , the history of dso -lrb- deutsches symphonieorchester berlin -rrb- is closely linked to germany 's history .
however , you are the orchestra 's first german principal conductor .
does that fact have special meaning to you ? ingo metzmacher : actually the orchestra was founded by the americans just after the war in 1946-47 .
it 's also interesting to know that it 's linked to the time just after the war when the americans , english , french and russians really tried to give germany a chance to rebuild .
they founded this orchestra for their radio station . for me , the orchestra represents the newborn germany after the second world war .
they 've had a wonderful line of chief conductors since then , but i 'm the first german .
i 've lived for maybe ten years in belgium and holland , so i think i also have a european or international background .
i feel very german , but within europe and within the world . do you think the orchestra 's unique history has an impact on its role today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metzmacher is also active as a pianist it should have a more important role .
it 's called the german symphony orchestra berlin , so i would like for it to be even more representative of the country and its culture .
also , we have more than 20 nationalities in the orchestra .
it really represents the international germany that we have today - especially in berlin .
there 's been a big change in germany and i think that this very young orchestra can show that to the world . this is your second season with dso .
what are your goals for your time with the orchestra ? i would like to strengthen the role i just described and , on the other hand , i would like to maintain the very high quality of playing .
during my time here , i have a project in mind - to look after the " german soul " in music .
that means : i 'm interested in the special relationship of the german culture to music .
major composers were born in the german-speaking world .
when you look at germany , with all its theaters and orchestras , its cultural landscape is unique in the world .
i think it represents the deep roots , which we have as germans , of music and theater . i think part of the reason is germany 's geographical position in the middle of europe .
it 's always been confronted by influences from all sides .
and the culture was always able to adopt the good parts of what came into the country .
you can see that , during the time when germany decided not to take in anything from outside but just to concentrate on the german roots , it completely failed .
it was a disaster .
i think the richness of the german culture is due to the fact that it always took in what came from outside . you 're known for your interest in modern and contemporary music .
how did this interest develop ? it came when i was maybe 20 years old .
i discovered the world of modern music for me .
i come from a very traditional , classical / romantic background .
my father was a musician and , for him , music was a kind of holy world .
i did n't believe so much in that when i grew up .
and it was very interesting for me to discover that there was a modern world of music - starting , actually , in 1909 .
since then , music for me has been a wide open field which i 've tried to discover for myself . how do you convey that to audiences ? i 've written a book ; i 've done hundreds of introductions before concerts ; i sometimes speak openly on the stage ; i do these casual concerts in berlin where i explain music to people .
after all , i do n't think it 's so difficult to explain music .
i think you just have to find the right words to describe what 's really happening .
you have to find a way to translate it .
that 's something that interests me a lot - trying to translate my understanding of music into a language with words .
that ’ s not easy because when you listen to the music you should forget the words again and try to understand the language that has no words . bildunterschrift : the deutsches symphonieorchester as you mentioned , you 've lived in several countries .
where do you feel at home ? i 've started to feel at home in berlin .
i always thought i would , but it took me longer than i thought .
my head told me berlin was the place i always wanted to be .
since i was young , i have longed for a german capital , which we didn ’ t have at the time .
when i was in london or paris i thought , what a pity that germany does n't have one like that - a real big city where everything comes together .
since reunification , i think berlin is growing into a major international capital .
so i was very thrilled to come here .
but it 's also not easy here .
it takes time to get used to it . what 's not easy about berlin ? it 's tough , especially in my field of music .
we have seven orchestras in this city ; we have three operas ; we have the berlin philharmonic as a major player - not only in germany but in the world .
it 's tough to find your audience , to create your own profile , and to convince the politicians they should give you the money you need . how does the dso try to create its own profile ? we are the only orchestra in town that has a theme .
we have the german soul .
we have 1909 .
we have a programmatic plan - that music has more to say than only to be beautiful .
i strongly believe in the content of music , although it has no words .
and i want to show that . click on the audio link below to hear ingo metzmacher discuss the series " who 's afraid of 20th century music ?

it 's also interesting to know that it 's linked to the time just after the war when the americans , english , french and russians really tried to give germany a chance to rebuild .
they founded this orchestra for their radio station . for me , the orchestra represents the newborn germany after the second world war .
they 've had a wonderful line of chief conductors since then , but i 'm the first german .
i 've lived for maybe ten years in belgium and holland , so i think i also have a european or international background .
i feel very german , but within europe and within the world . do you think the orchestra 's unique history has an impact on its role today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metzmacher is also active as a pianist it should have a more important role .
it 's called the german symphony orchestra berlin , so i would like for it to be even more representative of the country and its culture .
also , we have more than 20 nationalities in the orchestra .
it really represents the international germany that we have today - especially in berlin .
there 's been a big change in germany and i think that this very young orchestra can show that to the world . this is your second season with dso .
what are your goals for your time with the orchestra ? i would like to strengthen the role i just described and , on the other hand , i would like to maintain the very high quality of playing .
during my time here , i have a project in mind - to look after the " german soul " in music .
that means : i 'm interested in the special relationship of the german culture to music .
major composers were born in the german-speaking world .
when you look at germany , with all its theaters and orchestras , its cultural landscape is unique in the world .
i think it represents the deep roots , which we have as germans , of music and theater . i think part of the reason is germany 's geographical position in the middle of europe .
it 's always been confronted by influences from all sides .
and the culture was always able to adopt the good parts of what came into the country .
you can see that , during the time when germany decided not to take in anything from outside but just to concentrate on the german roots , it completely failed .
it was a disaster .
i think the richness of the german culture is due to the fact that it always took in what came from outside . you 're known for your interest in modern and contemporary music .
how did this interest develop ? it came when i was maybe 20 years old .
i discovered the world of modern music for me .
i come from a very traditional , classical / romantic background .
my father was a musician and , for him , music was a kind of holy world .
i did n't believe so much in that when i grew up .
and it was very interesting for me to discover that there was a modern world of music - starting , actually , in 1909 .
since then , music for me has been a wide open field which i 've tried to discover for myself . how do you convey that to audiences ? i 've written a book ; i 've done hundreds of introductions before concerts ; i sometimes speak openly on the stage ; i do these casual concerts in berlin where i explain music to people .
after all , i do n't think it 's so difficult to explain music .
i think you just have to find the right words to describe what 's really happening .
you have to find a way to translate it .
that 's something that interests me a lot - trying to translate my understanding of music into a language with words .
that ’ s not easy because when you listen to the music you should forget the words again and try to understand the language that has no words . bildunterschrift : the deutsches symphonieorchester as you mentioned , you 've lived in several countries .
where do you feel at home ? i 've started to feel at home in berlin .
i always thought i would , but it took me longer than i thought .
my head told me berlin was the place i always wanted to be .
since i was young , i have longed for a german capital , which we didn ’ t have at the time .
when i was in london or paris i thought , what a pity that germany does n't have one like that - a real big city where everything comes together .
since reunification , i think berlin is growing into a major international capital .
so i was very thrilled to come here .
but it 's also not easy here .
it takes time to get used to it . what 's not easy about berlin ? it 's tough , especially in my field of music .
we have seven orchestras in this city ; we have three operas ; we have the berlin philharmonic as a major player - not only in germany but in the world .
it 's tough to find your audience , to create your own profile , and to convince the politicians they should give you the money you need . how does the dso try to create its own profile ? we are the only orchestra in town that has a theme .
we have the german soul .
we have 1909 .
we have a programmatic plan - that music has more to say than only to be beautiful .
i strongly believe in the content of music , although it has no words .

" daimler said it had expected to sell around 16,000 units of the french-made two-seater , but that this figure was bettered by more than 8,000 additional vehicle sales . the new smart even seems to have defied current auto sales trends in the us , which have been in freefall since the credit crunch took hold .
there is a six-month waiting list for the smart . but he warned that high sales in 2008 did not necessarily signal similarly high sales in 2009 . penske said that 55 percent of prospects who placed a $ 99 internet deposit to reserve a smart car had eventually gone through with purchasing one of the vehicles . " we 're being very , very conservative , " he told reporters on the sidelines of the detroit auto show . " we would be happy to stay even and just do what we did in 2008 , " added david schembri , president of smart usa . the deepening recession in the us pushed car sales down 18 percent in the most precipitous decline in 29 years and the lowest levels since 1992 . us car sales have been predicted to fall in 2009 by as much as three million units to around 11 million vehicles . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : listen to dso live from hong kong return to the dso special music -pipe- 13.01.2009 conductor ingo metzmacher aims to uncover " german soul " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metzmacher has a passion for making modern music accessible ingo metzmacher , principal conductor of the german symphony orchestra berlin -lrb- dso -rrb- , says music is closely linked to the german soul .
his aim is to translate music for his audiences . dw-world.de : mr. metzmacher , the history of dso -lrb- deutsches symphonieorchester berlin -rrb- is closely linked to germany 's history .
however , you are the orchestra 's first german principal conductor .
does that fact have special meaning to you ? ingo metzmacher : actually the orchestra was founded by the americans just after the war in 1946-47 .
it 's also interesting to know that it 's linked to the time just after the war when the americans , english , french and russians really tried to give germany a chance to rebuild .
they founded this orchestra for their radio station . for me , the orchestra represents the newborn germany after the second world war .
they 've had a wonderful line of chief conductors since then , but i 'm the first german .
i 've lived for maybe ten years in belgium and holland , so i think i also have a european or international background .
i feel very german , but within europe and within the world . do you think the orchestra 's unique history has an impact on its role today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metzmacher is also active as a pianist it should have a more important role .
it 's called the german symphony orchestra berlin , so i would like for it to be even more representative of the country and its culture .
also , we have more than 20 nationalities in the orchestra .
it really represents the international germany that we have today - especially in berlin .
there 's been a big change in germany and i think that this very young orchestra can show that to the world . this is your second season with dso .
what are your goals for your time with the orchestra ? i would like to strengthen the role i just described and , on the other hand , i would like to maintain the very high quality of playing .
during my time here , i have a project in mind - to look after the " german soul " in music .
that means : i 'm interested in the special relationship of the german culture to music .
major composers were born in the german-speaking world .
when you look at germany , with all its theaters and orchestras , its cultural landscape is unique in the world .
i think it represents the deep roots , which we have as germans , of music and theater . i think part of the reason is germany 's geographical position in the middle of europe .
it 's always been confronted by influences from all sides .
and the culture was always able to adopt the good parts of what came into the country .
you can see that , during the time when germany decided not to take in anything from outside but just to concentrate on the german roots , it completely failed .
it was a disaster .
i think the richness of the german culture is due to the fact that it always took in what came from outside . you 're known for your interest in modern and contemporary music .
how did this interest develop ? it came when i was maybe 20 years old .
i discovered the world of modern music for me .
i come from a very traditional , classical / romantic background .
my father was a musician and , for him , music was a kind of holy world .
i did n't believe so much in that when i grew up .
and it was very interesting for me to discover that there was a modern world of music - starting , actually , in 1909 .
since then , music for me has been a wide open field which i 've tried to discover for myself . how do you convey that to audiences ? i 've written a book ; i 've done hundreds of introductions before concerts ; i sometimes speak openly on the stage ; i do these casual concerts in berlin where i explain music to people .
after all , i do n't think it 's so difficult to explain music .
i think you just have to find the right words to describe what 's really happening .
you have to find a way to translate it .
that 's something that interests me a lot - trying to translate my understanding of music into a language with words .
that ’ s not easy because when you listen to the music you should forget the words again and try to understand the language that has no words . bildunterschrift : the deutsches symphonieorchester as you mentioned , you 've lived in several countries .
where do you feel at home ? i 've started to feel at home in berlin .
i always thought i would , but it took me longer than i thought .
my head told me berlin was the place i always wanted to be .
since i was young , i have longed for a german capital , which we didn ’ t have at the time .
when i was in london or paris i thought , what a pity that germany does n't have one like that - a real big city where everything comes together .
since reunification , i think berlin is growing into a major international capital .
so i was very thrilled to come here .
but it 's also not easy here .
it takes time to get used to it . what 's not easy about berlin ? it 's tough , especially in my field of music .
we have seven orchestras in this city ; we have three operas ; we have the berlin philharmonic as a major player - not only in germany but in the world .
it 's tough to find your audience , to create your own profile , and to convince the politicians they should give you the money you need . how does the dso try to create its own profile ? we are the only orchestra in town that has a theme .
we have the german soul .
we have 1909 .
we have a programmatic plan - that music has more to say than only to be beautiful .
i strongly believe in the content of music , although it has no words .
and i want to show that . click on the audio link below to hear ingo metzmacher discuss the series " who 's afraid of 20th century music ?

by the year 2050 , there will be 10 million fewer people in the country then there are today - with dramatic consequences for the working world . in the future , the classic office swivel chair will be something of a rarity .
instead , those reclining television lounge chairs will be everywhere .
and among the other novelties in the office of the future : more breaks where employees can nibble from fruit platters or have a massage in the company 's own fitness center .
even blue-collar workers will find that their jobs offer more comforts . the reason for these fantastic-sounding benefits is n't a sudden burst of benevolence on the part of employers , rather a necessary bit of calculation , says werner eichhorst from the institute for the study of labor in bonn . " in the future , it 'll be all about making the work load easier - on a daily , weekly , and yearly basis - because with fewer germans , there are fewer employees on the market , and those that are available are growing older , " he said .
" employers can no longer afford to wear out their workforce , and that 's why they have to take better care of them . " tomorrow 's working world if the current estimates from the federal statistics office come to pass , then in the next 30 years , germany will have six million fewer workers .
and the average age of an employee will increase from 42 to 48 . " fewer , older employees means that we wo n't be able to stick to the legal retirement age , " say experts at the bonn-based institute .
they 're predicting a retirement age close to 69 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts predict more german women will enter full-time work fewer people in germany and therefore fewer employees will be able to shoulder more of the daily workload .
the classic " nine to five " shift will no longer be possible , especially in the service sector .
the culture of presence in the workplace will fall away and even in manufacturing , more flexibility will be required .
eichhorst is convinced that more and more employees will work flexi-hours and be compensated according to their output or performance . " in a sense , the employee will become the employer , " he said . germany 's dwindling , ageing population will have other effects too , according to the institute for the study of labor .
until now , employees over the age of 45 have been considered too expensive by most employers . " the pay scales are going to change , " said eichhorst .
" it will no longer be the case that your salary automatically goes up the older you get . " new reality , new opportunities the lack of skilled workers will also make itself increasingly felt , especially as it 's not something that can be combated by the current rates of immigration .
labor researchers therefore expect policy in this area to undergo much improvement .
work conditions in germany have so far shown themselves to be less than attractive among sought-after skilled workers . the institute predicts two developments as a result : increased training opportunities for low-skilled workers and a jump in the number of women in full-time jobs . " germany has a lot to catch up on in this respect - a lot of improvement is needed , " eichhorst said . wolfgang dick -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but not all experts are convinced it can help beat the downturn . germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel was full of praise for the initiative , being touted as a " pact for germany , " which her coalition passed on tuesday , january 11 . merkel told reporters her government was doing " everything possible so that germany does not just overcome this crisis , but emerges from it stronger . " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier from merkel 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , said the german package of investments , government loans and hand-outs , and tax cuts , compared favorably with stimulus measures taken by other nations . " when i look around europe , i ca n't see anyone else doing more or taking better steps than we are , " he told reporters . the package has come after mounting criticism that the government was being too hesitant in combating the economic decline prompted by the global financial crisis . soon enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " konjunktur " is german for " economic growth , " but not everyone likes this package but leading private-sector economists in germany disagreed about whether the so-called pact was all government ministers were claiming . the chief economist of commerzbank , joerg kraemer , was impressed . " no economic program in the world can stave off a recession , but the measures will no doubt contribute to stabilizing the economy in the second half of the year , " he told dpa news agency . the head economist at the bank of america , holger schmieding , has a different assessment . " this may only kick in late this year and thus do nothing to help us when the recession is at its worst - over the current quarter and the nest , " schmieding told reuters news agency . but others thought that the likely length of the slump would give the package time to work . " the economic downturn will last so long that the full effect of the stimulus measures are bound to be felt , " bhf bank chief economist uwe angenendt told dpa , and deka bank chief economist also offered that agency pretty much the same analysis . debts and more debts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german car sales are currently in a deep freeze the association of german taxpayers is considerable less happy with the package , which will run up the federal deficit . in an official statement , association president karl heinz daeke called the measures a " smokescreen to distract from -lsb- the absence of -rsb- true tax relief . " while greeting the 18 billion euros of investment foreseen in the package , daeke called for increased vigilance to ensure that the money was n't wasted . he criticized the government premium of 2,500 euros to be paid to people who scrap their old cars and buy new ones , saying the auto industry would have benefited more from direct tax cuts . and he reminded germans that the program would come at a high cost .

but early on tuesday , experts said still hardly any was flowing through ukraine pipelines .
ukraine says it 's russia 's fault . the ukrainian gas company naftogas confirmed tuesday , january 13th that it was blocking gas shipments from russia .
but naftogas said that because russia had pumped the gas into the wrong pipeline , it could not be delivered without cutting off supplies to several regions in the ukraine itself .
the nthinky veiled implication was that russian gas company gazprom may have intentionally misrouted the gas to drive a wedge betwen the eu and ukraine .
the statements came after the eu had complained that little to no gas was on its way through ukrainian pipelines .
" the information we have from our monitors in russia is that little or no gas is currently flowing , eu commission spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde hansen told reporters earlier on tuesday .
ferran tarradellas , the spokesman for the eu 's energy commissioner , said that complaints had been registered with russian prime minister vladimir putin .
putin was reported to have said that ukraine was responsible for the blockage - gazprom said on tuesday that it had sent 76 million cubic meters of gas had been sent through the pipelines at 10 am moscow .
experts say it could take up to three days for gas pumped from siberia to reach europe , where thousands of people have been left without heat in one of the coldest winters the continent has seen in a decade .
russia supplies an average of 350 million cubic meters of gas to europe in the winter months .
and because of the ongoing hostility between russia and ukraine , that supply is in jeopardy .
deal signed twice last wednesday , jan .
7 , gazprom halted all shipments in an attempt to stop what it called ukraine 's theft of gas destined for european clients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu observers came to this gas-measuring station under a long-awaited deal that had to be signed twice within the space of a few days , 25 experts from the european union , ukraine and russia are to monitor gas flows at five compressor stations in both ukraine and russia and another three stations in slovakia and romania .
europe relies on russia for roughly one quarter of all the natural gas it burns , and 80 percent of that gas arrives in the eu through pipelines crossing ukraine .
russian has discontinued gas supplies to ukraine itself amidst a dispute about the price kyiv should pay for russian gas .
russia , which has traditionally sold ukraine gas as prices far lower than those it asks from western europe , wants to raise its fees to $ 250 per 1000 cubic meters .
kyiv says it ca n't afford to pay any more than $ 201 .
moscow has also accused kyiv of failing to settle old debts and of siphoning off gas from deliveries intended for western europe . dw staff -lrb- jc / jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the former head of deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel , is reportedly ready to confess to tax evasion in return for a suspended sentence .
many ordinary taxpayers are , predictably , not amused . one of germany 's leading financial newspapers , handelsblatt , reported the deal late on monday evening , jan .
12 .
the paper cited an unnamed court official as its source .
zumwinkel was scheduled to go on trial next week for allegedly using the lgt bank in liechtenstein to hide nearly one million euros -lrb- $ 1.32 million -rrb- in income from german tax authorities .
the former ceo of germany 's postal company , deutsche post , was one of the most prominent figures involved in a scandal that broke last year , when it emerged that hundreds of wealthy germans were purportedly using foreign accounts to conceal money from the government .
the news led to many european governments to step up the pressure on so-called tax havens like liechtenstein to change their banking secrecy laws .
zumwinkel subsequently resigned his position at the deutsche post .
under the terms of the reported plea bargain , zumwinkel would admit to wrongdoing in return for receiving a two-year suspended sentence .
when asked by the afp news agency , a spokesperson for the court in bochum , where the trial is scheduled to take place , refused to confirm or deny the deal .
new legislation needed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : llb is another liechtenstein bank to be accused of aiding tax cheats according to handelsblatt , the plea bargain was only possible because the court had ruled that zumwinkel would only have to answer on charges of evading 970,000 euros in taxes from 2002-6 .
further evasion accusations from 2001 were deemed inadmissible because of germany 's statute of limitations - german law prohibits suspended sentences in cases involving more than million euros .
germany 's federal prosecutor monika harms has called in the past for legislation against so-called " back-room deals " in cases of serious economic crimes .
and germany 's bloggers are , not surprisingly , outraged by the news of the zumwinkel arrangement .
" it 's very bitter indeed for an ' average citizen ' to see the state differentiate between classes in applying its laws , " wrote one user of the bild newspaper 's online edition .
" it 's simply disgusting . "
few germans believe that zumwinkel would be able to reach such a deal , if he were not a former top executive .
" here in germany , tax evasion is sometimes prosecuted more vigorously than cases of rape , " wrote a commentator on the blog virtual nights .
" only if you 're the former boss of the post office , you can emerge from the affair with merely a black eye . "
but one user - presumably a former postal employee - took the news with a measure of humor .
" great , " he wrote .
" my ex-boss really knows what he 's doing . "
a number of prominent german executives - including former vw personnel boss and government advisor peter hartz - have received light sentences in criminal cases in recent years , prompting growing public anger and dismay . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ones to suffer were the eu countries , whose gas supplies became scarce .
at the time , gas volumes were only reduced , the gas taps were n't fully turned off as is the case this winter .
at the time , the eu member states grandly promised to pursue a common energy policy which would lead to more independence from russia .

quite the opposite is the case : russia and ukraine are even more brazenly showing the european union who has more pull when it comes to gas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission determined in its second report on an energy strategy last november that the dependence on russian gas will grow significantly in the next few years .

others - particularly the baltic states , poland , the czech republic and slovakia - should be thwarted from a russian perspective . the baltic pipeline which will connect russia directly with germany will not lessen the dependency on russian natural gas .

but the basis for successful crisis talks is rather weak , says dw 's bernd riegert . it was a similar situation three years ago .
russia and ukraine fought about gas prices .
the ones to suffer were the eu countries , whose gas supplies became scarce .
at the time , gas volumes were only reduced , the gas taps were n't fully turned off as is the case this winter .
at the time , the eu member states grandly promised to pursue a common energy policy which would lead to more independence from russia .
three years have passed and not a lot has happened .
quite the opposite is the case : russia and ukraine are even more brazenly showing the european union who has more pull when it comes to gas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission determined in its second report on an energy strategy last november that the dependence on russian gas will grow significantly in the next few years .
there is no prospect of this dependence easing before 2020 .
building new gas pipelines and finding suppliers in central asia or north africa was taking longer than they thought . in addition , russia was doing everything possible to torpedo european plans .
russia itself is going shopping for gas reserves in central asia .
russia is trying to form a supplier cartel of gas producing countries .
and russia is successfully attempting to divide the eu .
moscow has made bilateral supply and pipeline agreements with a few eu countries , which moscow considers to be friendly .
others - particularly the baltic states , poland , the czech republic and slovakia - should be thwarted from a russian perspective . the baltic pipeline which will connect russia directly with germany will not lessen the dependency on russian natural gas .
the necessary suppliers for the nabucco pipeline via turkey are still missing .
even iran , which could provide gas supplies one day , would not really be the most reliable partner . european interests differ meanwhile , european solidarity and the common gas market , which eu commission president jose barroso already evoked three years ago , is not far gone .
only now are countries beginning to think about connecting eu nations with each other with pipelines so that there is n't only the one-way street from russia .
no country is really willing to open its gas reserves for another nation .
there is no european storage for gas , only nationally administered ones . within the eu , the dependency on russian gas varies greatly .
finland and poland , for example , get every cubic meter of gas they use from russia .
spain does n't import any russian gas at all .
it 's evident that the interests are very different . it has now become clear to european gas clients and the eu commission in brussels that russia is no longer a reliable supplier .
moscow employs gas as a political weapon .
that should be a constructive shock for the eu .
the bloc 's summit in march will have to come up with an effective counter strategy . moscow is also dependent on the eu the success of the czech eu presidency is a ray of hope .
the czech republic 's prime minister mirek topolanek was able to mediate and get eu inspectors to monitor the gas flow from russia via ukraine .
this could be a beginning in taking action against the corruption in the gas business in russia and ukraine .
for with each cubic meter of gas sold , dubious middlemen also earn money . twenty percent of turnover is allegedly redirected into the pockets of the political and economic elite this way . the european union has to remain unified against russia and push through a new energy agreement .
european companies have to finally be allowed to tap energy sources in russia and build up infrastructure for its transport . russia raked in tons of cash so long as the world economy was booming and energy prices rose . now , russia as a supplier may be noticing that it too is dependent on its customers .
falling prices are likely to make the leadership in moscow see that cooperation with the eu and western investors is better than confrontation . ukraine too is acting just as unreliably as russia is .
it is diverting gas or blocking deliveries from russia .

but not all experts are convinced it can help beat the downturn . germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel was full of praise for the initiative , being touted as a " pact for germany , " which her coalition passed on tuesday , january 11 . merkel told reporters her government was doing " everything possible so that germany does not just overcome this crisis , but emerges from it stronger . " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier from merkel 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , said the german package of investments , government loans and hand-outs , and tax cuts , compared favorably with stimulus measures taken by other nations . " when i look around europe , i ca n't see anyone else doing more or taking better steps than we are , " he told reporters . the package has come after mounting criticism that the government was being too hesitant in combating the economic decline prompted by the global financial crisis . soon enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " konjunktur " is german for " economic growth , " but not everyone likes this package but leading private-sector economists in germany disagreed about whether the so-called pact was all government ministers were claiming . the chief economist of commerzbank , joerg kraemer , was impressed . " no economic program in the world can stave off a recession , but the measures will no doubt contribute to stabilizing the economy in the second half of the year , " he told dpa news agency . the head economist at the bank of america , holger schmieding , has a different assessment . " this may only kick in late this year and thus do nothing to help us when the recession is at its worst - over the current quarter and the nest , " schmieding told reuters news agency . but others thought that the likely length of the slump would give the package time to work . " the economic downturn will last so long that the full effect of the stimulus measures are bound to be felt , " bhf bank chief economist uwe angenendt told dpa , and deka bank chief economist also offered that agency pretty much the same analysis . debts and more debts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german car sales are currently in a deep freeze the association of german taxpayers is considerable less happy with the package , which will run up the federal deficit . in an official statement , association president karl heinz daeke called the measures a " smokescreen to distract from -lsb- the absence of -rsb- true tax relief . " while greeting the 18 billion euros of investment foreseen in the package , daeke called for increased vigilance to ensure that the money was n't wasted . he criticized the government premium of 2,500 euros to be paid to people who scrap their old cars and buy new ones , saying the auto industry would have benefited more from direct tax cuts . and he reminded germans that the program would come at a high cost . " every taxpayer should be aware that this stimulus package is being financed with debts which the community of tax payers will have to pay off in the future , " daeke said . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 13.01.2009 opinion : europe should push through a common energy policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should act as a mediator in the russia-ukraine energy row given that large parts of the continent have had their gas supplies cut .
but the basis for successful crisis talks is rather weak , says dw 's bernd riegert . it was a similar situation three years ago .
russia and ukraine fought about gas prices .
the ones to suffer were the eu countries , whose gas supplies became scarce .
at the time , gas volumes were only reduced , the gas taps were n't fully turned off as is the case this winter .
at the time , the eu member states grandly promised to pursue a common energy policy which would lead to more independence from russia .
three years have passed and not a lot has happened .
quite the opposite is the case : russia and ukraine are even more brazenly showing the european union who has more pull when it comes to gas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission determined in its second report on an energy strategy last november that the dependence on russian gas will grow significantly in the next few years .
there is no prospect of this dependence easing before 2020 .
building new gas pipelines and finding suppliers in central asia or north africa was taking longer than they thought . in addition , russia was doing everything possible to torpedo european plans .
russia itself is going shopping for gas reserves in central asia .
russia is trying to form a supplier cartel of gas producing countries .
and russia is successfully attempting to divide the eu .
moscow has made bilateral supply and pipeline agreements with a few eu countries , which moscow considers to be friendly .
others - particularly the baltic states , poland , the czech republic and slovakia - should be thwarted from a russian perspective . the baltic pipeline which will connect russia directly with germany will not lessen the dependency on russian natural gas .
the necessary suppliers for the nabucco pipeline via turkey are still missing .
even iran , which could provide gas supplies one day , would not really be the most reliable partner . european interests differ meanwhile , european solidarity and the common gas market , which eu commission president jose barroso already evoked three years ago , is not far gone .
only now are countries beginning to think about connecting eu nations with each other with pipelines so that there is n't only the one-way street from russia .
no country is really willing to open its gas reserves for another nation .
there is no european storage for gas , only nationally administered ones . within the eu , the dependency on russian gas varies greatly .
finland and poland , for example , get every cubic meter of gas they use from russia .
spain does n't import any russian gas at all .
it 's evident that the interests are very different . it has now become clear to european gas clients and the eu commission in brussels that russia is no longer a reliable supplier .
moscow employs gas as a political weapon .
that should be a constructive shock for the eu .
the bloc 's summit in march will have to come up with an effective counter strategy . moscow is also dependent on the eu the success of the czech eu presidency is a ray of hope .
the czech republic 's prime minister mirek topolanek was able to mediate and get eu inspectors to monitor the gas flow from russia via ukraine .
this could be a beginning in taking action against the corruption in the gas business in russia and ukraine .
for with each cubic meter of gas sold , dubious middlemen also earn money . twenty percent of turnover is allegedly redirected into the pockets of the political and economic elite this way . the european union has to remain unified against russia and push through a new energy agreement .
european companies have to finally be allowed to tap energy sources in russia and build up infrastructure for its transport . russia raked in tons of cash so long as the world economy was booming and energy prices rose . now , russia as a supplier may be noticing that it too is dependent on its customers .
falling prices are likely to make the leadership in moscow see that cooperation with the eu and western investors is better than confrontation . ukraine too is acting just as unreliably as russia is .
it is diverting gas or blocking deliveries from russia .
this disqualifies ukraine both as a candidate for nato and eu membership . bernd riegert -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de ukraine blocks russian gas from getting to europe the eu thought it had reached an agreement to end the six-day stoppage in russian gas supplies .
but early on tuesday , experts said still hardly any was flowing through ukraine pipelines .
ukraine says it 's russia 's fault .
-lrb- 13.01.2009 -rrb- russian gas supplies to resume tuesday , eu says the eu expects gas supplies from russia to resume on tuesday morning , officials in brussels said monday after a pricing row between russia and ukraine disrupted supplies for nearly a week in freezing temperatures .
-lrb- 12.01.2009 -rrb- ukraine to sign fresh accord on gas monitors , minus extras ukraine has agreed to sign a fresh accord allowing european union monitors to measure gas flows to europe , minus additional conditions it added that led russia to rescind the deal , the european commission said monday .

by the year 2050 , there will be 10 million fewer people in the country then there are today - with dramatic consequences for the working world . in the future , the classic office swivel chair will be something of a rarity .
instead , those reclining television lounge chairs will be everywhere .

even blue-collar workers will find that their jobs offer more comforts . the reason for these fantastic-sounding benefits is n't a sudden burst of benevolence on the part of employers , rather a necessary bit of calculation , says werner eichhorst from the institute for the study of labor in bonn . " in the future , it 'll be all about making the work load easier - on a daily , weekly , and yearly basis - because with fewer germans , there are fewer employees on the market , and those that are available are growing older , " he said .
" employers can no longer afford to wear out their workforce , and that 's why they have to take better care of them . " tomorrow 's working world if the current estimates from the federal statistics office come to pass , then in the next 30 years , germany will have six million fewer workers .
and the average age of an employee will increase from 42 to 48 . " fewer , older employees means that we wo n't be able to stick to the legal retirement age , " say experts at the bonn-based institute .
they 're predicting a retirement age close to 69 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts predict more german women will enter full-time work fewer people in germany and therefore fewer employees will be able to shoulder more of the daily workload .
the classic " nine to five " shift will no longer be possible , especially in the service sector .
the culture of presence in the workplace will fall away and even in manufacturing , more flexibility will be required .
eichhorst is convinced that more and more employees will work flexi-hours and be compensated according to their output or performance . " in a sense , the employee will become the employer , " he said . germany 's dwindling , ageing population will have other effects too , according to the institute for the study of labor .
until now , employees over the age of 45 have been considered too expensive by most employers . " the pay scales are going to change , " said eichhorst .
" it will no longer be the case that your salary automatically goes up the older you get . " new reality , new opportunities the lack of skilled workers will also make itself increasingly felt , especially as it 's not something that can be combated by the current rates of immigration .
labor researchers therefore expect policy in this area to undergo much improvement .
work conditions in germany have so far shown themselves to be less than attractive among sought-after skilled workers . the institute predicts two developments as a result : increased training opportunities for low-skilled workers and a jump in the number of women in full-time jobs .

by the year 2050 , there will be 10 million fewer people in the country then there are today - with dramatic consequences for the working world . in the future , the classic office swivel chair will be something of a rarity .

even blue-collar workers will find that their jobs offer more comforts . the reason for these fantastic-sounding benefits is n't a sudden burst of benevolence on the part of employers , rather a necessary bit of calculation , says werner eichhorst from the institute for the study of labor in bonn . " in the future , it 'll be all about making the work load easier - on a daily , weekly , and yearly basis - because with fewer germans , there are fewer employees on the market , and those that are available are growing older , " he said .
" employers can no longer afford to wear out their workforce , and that 's why they have to take better care of them . " tomorrow 's working world if the current estimates from the federal statistics office come to pass , then in the next 30 years , germany will have six million fewer workers .
and the average age of an employee will increase from 42 to 48 . " fewer , older employees means that we wo n't be able to stick to the legal retirement age , " say experts at the bonn-based institute .

the culture of presence in the workplace will fall away and even in manufacturing , more flexibility will be required .
eichhorst is convinced that more and more employees will work flexi-hours and be compensated according to their output or performance . " in a sense , the employee will become the employer , " he said . germany 's dwindling , ageing population will have other effects too , according to the institute for the study of labor .
until now , employees over the age of 45 have been considered too expensive by most employers . " the pay scales are going to change , " said eichhorst .
" it will no longer be the case that your salary automatically goes up the older you get . " new reality , new opportunities the lack of skilled workers will also make itself increasingly felt , especially as it 's not something that can be combated by the current rates of immigration .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 13.01.2009 opinion : europe should push through a common energy policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should act as a mediator in the russia-ukraine energy row given that large parts of the continent have had their gas supplies cut .
but the basis for successful crisis talks is rather weak , says dw 's bernd riegert . it was a similar situation three years ago .
russia and ukraine fought about gas prices .
the ones to suffer were the eu countries , whose gas supplies became scarce .
at the time , gas volumes were only reduced , the gas taps were n't fully turned off as is the case this winter .
at the time , the eu member states grandly promised to pursue a common energy policy which would lead to more independence from russia .
three years have passed and not a lot has happened .
quite the opposite is the case : russia and ukraine are even more brazenly showing the european union who has more pull when it comes to gas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission determined in its second report on an energy strategy last november that the dependence on russian gas will grow significantly in the next few years .
there is no prospect of this dependence easing before 2020 .
building new gas pipelines and finding suppliers in central asia or north africa was taking longer than they thought . in addition , russia was doing everything possible to torpedo european plans .
russia itself is going shopping for gas reserves in central asia .
russia is trying to form a supplier cartel of gas producing countries .
and russia is successfully attempting to divide the eu .
moscow has made bilateral supply and pipeline agreements with a few eu countries , which moscow considers to be friendly .
others - particularly the baltic states , poland , the czech republic and slovakia - should be thwarted from a russian perspective . the baltic pipeline which will connect russia directly with germany will not lessen the dependency on russian natural gas .
the necessary suppliers for the nabucco pipeline via turkey are still missing .
even iran , which could provide gas supplies one day , would not really be the most reliable partner . european interests differ meanwhile , european solidarity and the common gas market , which eu commission president jose barroso already evoked three years ago , is not far gone .
only now are countries beginning to think about connecting eu nations with each other with pipelines so that there is n't only the one-way street from russia .
no country is really willing to open its gas reserves for another nation .
there is no european storage for gas , only nationally administered ones . within the eu , the dependency on russian gas varies greatly .
finland and poland , for example , get every cubic meter of gas they use from russia .
spain does n't import any russian gas at all .
it 's evident that the interests are very different . it has now become clear to european gas clients and the eu commission in brussels that russia is no longer a reliable supplier .
moscow employs gas as a political weapon .
that should be a constructive shock for the eu .
the bloc 's summit in march will have to come up with an effective counter strategy . moscow is also dependent on the eu the success of the czech eu presidency is a ray of hope .
the czech republic 's prime minister mirek topolanek was able to mediate and get eu inspectors to monitor the gas flow from russia via ukraine .
this could be a beginning in taking action against the corruption in the gas business in russia and ukraine .
for with each cubic meter of gas sold , dubious middlemen also earn money . twenty percent of turnover is allegedly redirected into the pockets of the political and economic elite this way . the european union has to remain unified against russia and push through a new energy agreement .
european companies have to finally be allowed to tap energy sources in russia and build up infrastructure for its transport . russia raked in tons of cash so long as the world economy was booming and energy prices rose . now , russia as a supplier may be noticing that it too is dependent on its customers .
falling prices are likely to make the leadership in moscow see that cooperation with the eu and western investors is better than confrontation . ukraine too is acting just as unreliably as russia is .
it is diverting gas or blocking deliveries from russia .
this disqualifies ukraine both as a candidate for nato and eu membership . bernd riegert -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de ukraine blocks russian gas from getting to europe the eu thought it had reached an agreement to end the six-day stoppage in russian gas supplies .
but early on tuesday , experts said still hardly any was flowing through ukraine pipelines .
ukraine says it 's russia 's fault .
-lrb- 13.01.2009 -rrb- russian gas supplies to resume tuesday , eu says the eu expects gas supplies from russia to resume on tuesday morning , officials in brussels said monday after a pricing row between russia and ukraine disrupted supplies for nearly a week in freezing temperatures .
-lrb- 12.01.2009 -rrb- ukraine to sign fresh accord on gas monitors , minus extras ukraine has agreed to sign a fresh accord allowing european union monitors to measure gas flows to europe , minus additional conditions it added that led russia to rescind the deal , the european commission said monday .

but not all experts are convinced it can help beat the downturn . germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel was full of praise for the initiative , being touted as a " pact for germany , " which her coalition passed on tuesday , january 11 . merkel told reporters her government was doing " everything possible so that germany does not just overcome this crisis , but emerges from it stronger . " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier from merkel 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , said the german package of investments , government loans and hand-outs , and tax cuts , compared favorably with stimulus measures taken by other nations . " when i look around europe , i ca n't see anyone else doing more or taking better steps than we are , " he told reporters . the package has come after mounting criticism that the government was being too hesitant in combating the economic decline prompted by the global financial crisis . soon enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " konjunktur " is german for " economic growth , " but not everyone likes this package but leading private-sector economists in germany disagreed about whether the so-called pact was all government ministers were claiming . the chief economist of commerzbank , joerg kraemer , was impressed . " no economic program in the world can stave off a recession , but the measures will no doubt contribute to stabilizing the economy in the second half of the year , " he told dpa news agency . the head economist at the bank of america , holger schmieding , has a different assessment . " this may only kick in late this year and thus do nothing to help us when the recession is at its worst - over the current quarter and the nest , " schmieding told reuters news agency . but others thought that the likely length of the slump would give the package time to work . " the economic downturn will last so long that the full effect of the stimulus measures are bound to be felt , " bhf bank chief economist uwe angenendt told dpa , and deka bank chief economist also offered that agency pretty much the same analysis . debts and more debts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german car sales are currently in a deep freeze the association of german taxpayers is considerable less happy with the package , which will run up the federal deficit . in an official statement , association president karl heinz daeke called the measures a " smokescreen to distract from -lsb- the absence of -rsb- true tax relief . " while greeting the 18 billion euros of investment foreseen in the package , daeke called for increased vigilance to ensure that the money was n't wasted . he criticized the government premium of 2,500 euros to be paid to people who scrap their old cars and buy new ones , saying the auto industry would have benefited more from direct tax cuts . and he reminded germans that the program would come at a high cost . " every taxpayer should be aware that this stimulus package is being financed with debts which the community of tax payers will have to pay off in the future , " daeke said . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

states and municipalities have been putting off investment for ages ; now they can get to work .
all they have to do is pull out their long-finished investment plans and dust them off . which means the plans can be put into effect quickly , thus providing an actual economic boost .
in an effort to give citizens and businesses a break and to boost consumer spending , the state lowered the marginal tax rate and raised the limit for non-taxable income .
it means there will be some nine billion fewer tax euros in government coffers . ... but the ' wrecking premium ' earns a ' d ' but lowering the marginal tax rate , and limiting so-called " cold progression " - an unfortunate system whereby the state increases its percentage claim on income in lockstep with an income increase - was long overdue .
it 's a measure that should have been taken even without an economic crisis , and so it only deserves a " c. "
the planned reduction in insurance contributions is likely to provide immediate relief not only to businesses and taxpayers , but also to retirees and low-income households .
it will cost the state another nine billion euros - and earns an " a " even though it is clear that the state can not continue to prop up the ailing social system at this level .
on the other hand , hotly debated protective measures for businesses are problematic .
in this case , the financial aid is aimed at sluggish bank lending , but not at the capital investments of the state in businesses , thus taking the touchy subject of state investment in business off the table .

ultimately , then , it is impossible to assign a grade to this move .
other measures are worthy of a " d " at best .
giving 100 euros per child to each citizen is unlikely to spark much consumer spending , and a " wrecking premium " for cars that are more than nine years old could give a leg up to the car industry - but which one ?
the french and japanese could profit as well as the germans on that account .
bold - or just brash ?
taken all together , though , the whole package can be labeled a courageous effort .
not only because it is the largest economic-stimulus package post-war germany has yet to create , but also because the state is narrowing its tax base - and thereby risks losing some of its negotiating status .
it is courageous because it is the first time germany has been willing to clearly breach the 40-billion-euro debt record set in 1996 , and thereby cross the debt-ratio line set by the maastricht treaty .
it is courageous in its self-confidence and belief in a better future .

ukraine says it 's russia 's fault . the ukrainian gas company naftogas confirmed tuesday , january 13th that it was blocking gas shipments from russia .
but naftogas said that because russia had pumped the gas into the wrong pipeline , it could not be delivered without cutting off supplies to several regions in the ukraine itself .
the nthinky veiled implication was that russian gas company gazprom may have intentionally misrouted the gas to drive a wedge betwen the eu and ukraine .
the statements came after the eu had complained that little to no gas was on its way through ukrainian pipelines .
" the information we have from our monitors in russia is that little or no gas is currently flowing , eu commission spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde hansen told reporters earlier on tuesday .
ferran tarradellas , the spokesman for the eu 's energy commissioner , said that complaints had been registered with russian prime minister vladimir putin .

ukraine says it 's russia 's fault . the ukrainian gas company naftogas confirmed tuesday , january 13th that it was blocking gas shipments from russia .
but naftogas said that because russia had pumped the gas into the wrong pipeline , it could not be delivered without cutting off supplies to several regions in the ukraine itself .
the nthinky veiled implication was that russian gas company gazprom may have intentionally misrouted the gas to drive a wedge betwen the eu and ukraine .
the statements came after the eu had complained that little to no gas was on its way through ukrainian pipelines .
" the information we have from our monitors in russia is that little or no gas is currently flowing , eu commission spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde hansen told reporters earlier on tuesday .
ferran tarradellas , the spokesman for the eu 's energy commissioner , said that complaints had been registered with russian prime minister vladimir putin .
putin was reported to have said that ukraine was responsible for the blockage - gazprom said on tuesday that it had sent 76 million cubic meters of gas had been sent through the pipelines at 10 am moscow .
experts say it could take up to three days for gas pumped from siberia to reach europe , where thousands of people have been left without heat in one of the coldest winters the continent has seen in a decade .
russia supplies an average of 350 million cubic meters of gas to europe in the winter months .
and because of the ongoing hostility between russia and ukraine , that supply is in jeopardy .

europe relies on russia for roughly one quarter of all the natural gas it burns , and 80 percent of that gas arrives in the eu through pipelines crossing ukraine .
russian has discontinued gas supplies to ukraine itself amidst a dispute about the price kyiv should pay for russian gas .
russia , which has traditionally sold ukraine gas as prices far lower than those it asks from western europe , wants to raise its fees to $ 250 per 1000 cubic meters .

the former head of deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel , is reportedly ready to confess to tax evasion in return for a suspended sentence .
many ordinary taxpayers are , predictably , not amused . one of germany 's leading financial newspapers , handelsblatt , reported the deal late on monday evening , jan .
12 .
the paper cited an unnamed court official as its source .
zumwinkel was scheduled to go on trial next week for allegedly using the lgt bank in liechtenstein to hide nearly one million euros -lrb- $ 1.32 million -rrb- in income from german tax authorities .
the former ceo of germany 's postal company , deutsche post , was one of the most prominent figures involved in a scandal that broke last year , when it emerged that hundreds of wealthy germans were purportedly using foreign accounts to conceal money from the government .
the news led to many european governments to step up the pressure on so-called tax havens like liechtenstein to change their banking secrecy laws .
zumwinkel subsequently resigned his position at the deutsche post .
under the terms of the reported plea bargain , zumwinkel would admit to wrongdoing in return for receiving a two-year suspended sentence .
when asked by the afp news agency , a spokesperson for the court in bochum , where the trial is scheduled to take place , refused to confirm or deny the deal .
new legislation needed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : llb is another liechtenstein bank to be accused of aiding tax cheats according to handelsblatt , the plea bargain was only possible because the court had ruled that zumwinkel would only have to answer on charges of evading 970,000 euros in taxes from 2002-6 .
further evasion accusations from 2001 were deemed inadmissible because of germany 's statute of limitations - german law prohibits suspended sentences in cases involving more than million euros .
germany 's federal prosecutor monika harms has called in the past for legislation against so-called " back-room deals " in cases of serious economic crimes .
and germany 's bloggers are , not surprisingly , outraged by the news of the zumwinkel arrangement .
" it 's very bitter indeed for an ' average citizen ' to see the state differentiate between classes in applying its laws , " wrote one user of the bild newspaper 's online edition .
" it 's simply disgusting . "
few germans believe that zumwinkel would be able to reach such a deal , if he were not a former top executive .
" here in germany , tax evasion is sometimes prosecuted more vigorously than cases of rape , " wrote a commentator on the blog virtual nights .
" only if you 're the former boss of the post office , you can emerge from the affair with merely a black eye . "
but one user - presumably a former postal employee - took the news with a measure of humor .
" great , " he wrote .
" my ex-boss really knows what he 's doing . "
a number of prominent german executives - including former vw personnel boss and government advisor peter hartz - have received light sentences in criminal cases in recent years , prompting growing public anger and dismay . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the former head of deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel , is reportedly ready to confess to tax evasion in return for a suspended sentence .
many ordinary taxpayers are , predictably , not amused . one of germany 's leading financial newspapers , handelsblatt , reported the deal late on monday evening , jan .
12 .
the paper cited an unnamed court official as its source .
zumwinkel was scheduled to go on trial next week for allegedly using the lgt bank in liechtenstein to hide nearly one million euros -lrb- $ 1.32 million -rrb- in income from german tax authorities .
the former ceo of germany 's postal company , deutsche post , was one of the most prominent figures involved in a scandal that broke last year , when it emerged that hundreds of wealthy germans were purportedly using foreign accounts to conceal money from the government .
the news led to many european governments to step up the pressure on so-called tax havens like liechtenstein to change their banking secrecy laws .
zumwinkel subsequently resigned his position at the deutsche post .
under the terms of the reported plea bargain , zumwinkel would admit to wrongdoing in return for receiving a two-year suspended sentence .
when asked by the afp news agency , a spokesperson for the court in bochum , where the trial is scheduled to take place , refused to confirm or deny the deal .
new legislation needed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : llb is another liechtenstein bank to be accused of aiding tax cheats according to handelsblatt , the plea bargain was only possible because the court had ruled that zumwinkel would only have to answer on charges of evading 970,000 euros in taxes from 2002-6 .
further evasion accusations from 2001 were deemed inadmissible because of germany 's statute of limitations - german law prohibits suspended sentences in cases involving more than million euros .
germany 's federal prosecutor monika harms has called in the past for legislation against so-called " back-room deals " in cases of serious economic crimes .
and germany 's bloggers are , not surprisingly , outraged by the news of the zumwinkel arrangement .
" it 's very bitter indeed for an ' average citizen ' to see the state differentiate between classes in applying its laws , " wrote one user of the bild newspaper 's online edition .
" it 's simply disgusting . "
few germans believe that zumwinkel would be able to reach such a deal , if he were not a former top executive .
" here in germany , tax evasion is sometimes prosecuted more vigorously than cases of rape , " wrote a commentator on the blog virtual nights .
" only if you 're the former boss of the post office , you can emerge from the affair with merely a black eye . "
but one user - presumably a former postal employee - took the news with a measure of humor .
" great , " he wrote .
" my ex-boss really knows what he 's doing . "
a number of prominent german executives - including former vw personnel boss and government advisor peter hartz - have received light sentences in criminal cases in recent years , prompting growing public anger and dismay . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the former head of deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel , is reportedly ready to confess to tax evasion in return for a suspended sentence .
many ordinary taxpayers are , predictably , not amused . one of germany 's leading financial newspapers , handelsblatt , reported the deal late on monday evening , jan .
12 .
the paper cited an unnamed court official as its source .
zumwinkel was scheduled to go on trial next week for allegedly using the lgt bank in liechtenstein to hide nearly one million euros -lrb- $ 1.32 million -rrb- in income from german tax authorities .
the former ceo of germany 's postal company , deutsche post , was one of the most prominent figures involved in a scandal that broke last year , when it emerged that hundreds of wealthy germans were purportedly using foreign accounts to conceal money from the government .
the news led to many european governments to step up the pressure on so-called tax havens like liechtenstein to change their banking secrecy laws .
zumwinkel subsequently resigned his position at the deutsche post .
under the terms of the reported plea bargain , zumwinkel would admit to wrongdoing in return for receiving a two-year suspended sentence .

the former head of deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel , is reportedly ready to confess to tax evasion in return for a suspended sentence .
many ordinary taxpayers are , predictably , not amused . one of germany 's leading financial newspapers , handelsblatt , reported the deal late on monday evening , jan .
12 .
the paper cited an unnamed court official as its source .
zumwinkel was scheduled to go on trial next week for allegedly using the lgt bank in liechtenstein to hide nearly one million euros -lrb- $ 1.32 million -rrb- in income from german tax authorities .
the former ceo of germany 's postal company , deutsche post , was one of the most prominent figures involved in a scandal that broke last year , when it emerged that hundreds of wealthy germans were purportedly using foreign accounts to conceal money from the government .
the news led to many european governments to step up the pressure on so-called tax havens like liechtenstein to change their banking secrecy laws .
zumwinkel subsequently resigned his position at the deutsche post .
under the terms of the reported plea bargain , zumwinkel would admit to wrongdoing in return for receiving a two-year suspended sentence .

the former head of deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel , is reportedly ready to confess to tax evasion in return for a suspended sentence .
many ordinary taxpayers are , predictably , not amused . one of germany 's leading financial newspapers , handelsblatt , reported the deal late on monday evening , jan .
12 .
the paper cited an unnamed court official as its source .
zumwinkel was scheduled to go on trial next week for allegedly using the lgt bank in liechtenstein to hide nearly one million euros -lrb- $ 1.32 million -rrb- in income from german tax authorities .
the former ceo of germany 's postal company , deutsche post , was one of the most prominent figures involved in a scandal that broke last year , when it emerged that hundreds of wealthy germans were purportedly using foreign accounts to conceal money from the government .
the news led to many european governments to step up the pressure on so-called tax havens like liechtenstein to change their banking secrecy laws .
zumwinkel subsequently resigned his position at the deutsche post .
under the terms of the reported plea bargain , zumwinkel would admit to wrongdoing in return for receiving a two-year suspended sentence .
when asked by the afp news agency , a spokesperson for the court in bochum , where the trial is scheduled to take place , refused to confirm or deny the deal .
new legislation needed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : llb is another liechtenstein bank to be accused of aiding tax cheats according to handelsblatt , the plea bargain was only possible because the court had ruled that zumwinkel would only have to answer on charges of evading 970,000 euros in taxes from 2002-6 .
further evasion accusations from 2001 were deemed inadmissible because of germany 's statute of limitations - german law prohibits suspended sentences in cases involving more than million euros .
germany 's federal prosecutor monika harms has called in the past for legislation against so-called " back-room deals " in cases of serious economic crimes .
and germany 's bloggers are , not surprisingly , outraged by the news of the zumwinkel arrangement .
" it 's very bitter indeed for an ' average citizen ' to see the state differentiate between classes in applying its laws , " wrote one user of the bild newspaper 's online edition .
" it 's simply disgusting . "
few germans believe that zumwinkel would be able to reach such a deal , if he were not a former top executive .
" here in germany , tax evasion is sometimes prosecuted more vigorously than cases of rape , " wrote a commentator on the blog virtual nights .
" only if you 're the former boss of the post office , you can emerge from the affair with merely a black eye . "
but one user - presumably a former postal employee - took the news with a measure of humor .
" great , " he wrote .
" my ex-boss really knows what he 's doing . "
a number of prominent german executives - including former vw personnel boss and government advisor peter hartz - have received light sentences in criminal cases in recent years , prompting growing public anger and dismay . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the basis for successful crisis talks is rather weak , says dw 's bernd riegert . it was a similar situation three years ago .
russia and ukraine fought about gas prices .
the ones to suffer were the eu countries , whose gas supplies became scarce .
at the time , gas volumes were only reduced , the gas taps were n't fully turned off as is the case this winter .
at the time , the eu member states grandly promised to pursue a common energy policy which would lead to more independence from russia .
three years have passed and not a lot has happened .
quite the opposite is the case : russia and ukraine are even more brazenly showing the european union who has more pull when it comes to gas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission determined in its second report on an energy strategy last november that the dependence on russian gas will grow significantly in the next few years .
there is no prospect of this dependence easing before 2020 .

russia itself is going shopping for gas reserves in central asia .
russia is trying to form a supplier cartel of gas producing countries .
and russia is successfully attempting to divide the eu .
moscow has made bilateral supply and pipeline agreements with a few eu countries , which moscow considers to be friendly .
others - particularly the baltic states , poland , the czech republic and slovakia - should be thwarted from a russian perspective . the baltic pipeline which will connect russia directly with germany will not lessen the dependency on russian natural gas .
the necessary suppliers for the nabucco pipeline via turkey are still missing .
even iran , which could provide gas supplies one day , would not really be the most reliable partner . european interests differ meanwhile , european solidarity and the common gas market , which eu commission president jose barroso already evoked three years ago , is not far gone .

no country is really willing to open its gas reserves for another nation .
there is no european storage for gas , only nationally administered ones . within the eu , the dependency on russian gas varies greatly .
finland and poland , for example , get every cubic meter of gas they use from russia .
spain does n't import any russian gas at all .
it 's evident that the interests are very different . it has now become clear to european gas clients and the eu commission in brussels that russia is no longer a reliable supplier .
moscow employs gas as a political weapon .
that should be a constructive shock for the eu .
the bloc 's summit in march will have to come up with an effective counter strategy . moscow is also dependent on the eu the success of the czech eu presidency is a ray of hope .
the czech republic 's prime minister mirek topolanek was able to mediate and get eu inspectors to monitor the gas flow from russia via ukraine .
this could be a beginning in taking action against the corruption in the gas business in russia and ukraine .

european companies have to finally be allowed to tap energy sources in russia and build up infrastructure for its transport . russia raked in tons of cash so long as the world economy was booming and energy prices rose . now , russia as a supplier may be noticing that it too is dependent on its customers .
falling prices are likely to make the leadership in moscow see that cooperation with the eu and western investors is better than confrontation . ukraine too is acting just as unreliably as russia is .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 13.01.2009 opinion : europe should push through a common energy policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should act as a mediator in the russia-ukraine energy row given that large parts of the continent have had their gas supplies cut .
but the basis for successful crisis talks is rather weak , says dw 's bernd riegert . it was a similar situation three years ago .
russia and ukraine fought about gas prices .
the ones to suffer were the eu countries , whose gas supplies became scarce .
at the time , gas volumes were only reduced , the gas taps were n't fully turned off as is the case this winter .
at the time , the eu member states grandly promised to pursue a common energy policy which would lead to more independence from russia .
three years have passed and not a lot has happened .
quite the opposite is the case : russia and ukraine are even more brazenly showing the european union who has more pull when it comes to gas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission determined in its second report on an energy strategy last november that the dependence on russian gas will grow significantly in the next few years .
there is no prospect of this dependence easing before 2020 .
building new gas pipelines and finding suppliers in central asia or north africa was taking longer than they thought . in addition , russia was doing everything possible to torpedo european plans .
russia itself is going shopping for gas reserves in central asia .
russia is trying to form a supplier cartel of gas producing countries .
and russia is successfully attempting to divide the eu .
moscow has made bilateral supply and pipeline agreements with a few eu countries , which moscow considers to be friendly .
others - particularly the baltic states , poland , the czech republic and slovakia - should be thwarted from a russian perspective . the baltic pipeline which will connect russia directly with germany will not lessen the dependency on russian natural gas .
the necessary suppliers for the nabucco pipeline via turkey are still missing .
even iran , which could provide gas supplies one day , would not really be the most reliable partner . european interests differ meanwhile , european solidarity and the common gas market , which eu commission president jose barroso already evoked three years ago , is not far gone .
only now are countries beginning to think about connecting eu nations with each other with pipelines so that there is n't only the one-way street from russia .
no country is really willing to open its gas reserves for another nation .
there is no european storage for gas , only nationally administered ones . within the eu , the dependency on russian gas varies greatly .
finland and poland , for example , get every cubic meter of gas they use from russia .
spain does n't import any russian gas at all .
it 's evident that the interests are very different . it has now become clear to european gas clients and the eu commission in brussels that russia is no longer a reliable supplier .
moscow employs gas as a political weapon .
that should be a constructive shock for the eu .
the bloc 's summit in march will have to come up with an effective counter strategy . moscow is also dependent on the eu the success of the czech eu presidency is a ray of hope .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 13.01.2009 opinion : europe should push through a common energy policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should act as a mediator in the russia-ukraine energy row given that large parts of the continent have had their gas supplies cut .
but the basis for successful crisis talks is rather weak , says dw 's bernd riegert . it was a similar situation three years ago .
russia and ukraine fought about gas prices .
the ones to suffer were the eu countries , whose gas supplies became scarce .
at the time , gas volumes were only reduced , the gas taps were n't fully turned off as is the case this winter .
at the time , the eu member states grandly promised to pursue a common energy policy which would lead to more independence from russia .
three years have passed and not a lot has happened .
quite the opposite is the case : russia and ukraine are even more brazenly showing the european union who has more pull when it comes to gas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission determined in its second report on an energy strategy last november that the dependence on russian gas will grow significantly in the next few years .
there is no prospect of this dependence easing before 2020 .
building new gas pipelines and finding suppliers in central asia or north africa was taking longer than they thought . in addition , russia was doing everything possible to torpedo european plans .
russia itself is going shopping for gas reserves in central asia .
russia is trying to form a supplier cartel of gas producing countries .
and russia is successfully attempting to divide the eu .
moscow has made bilateral supply and pipeline agreements with a few eu countries , which moscow considers to be friendly .
others - particularly the baltic states , poland , the czech republic and slovakia - should be thwarted from a russian perspective . the baltic pipeline which will connect russia directly with germany will not lessen the dependency on russian natural gas .
the necessary suppliers for the nabucco pipeline via turkey are still missing .
even iran , which could provide gas supplies one day , would not really be the most reliable partner . european interests differ meanwhile , european solidarity and the common gas market , which eu commission president jose barroso already evoked three years ago , is not far gone .
only now are countries beginning to think about connecting eu nations with each other with pipelines so that there is n't only the one-way street from russia .
no country is really willing to open its gas reserves for another nation .
there is no european storage for gas , only nationally administered ones . within the eu , the dependency on russian gas varies greatly .
finland and poland , for example , get every cubic meter of gas they use from russia .
spain does n't import any russian gas at all .
it 's evident that the interests are very different . it has now become clear to european gas clients and the eu commission in brussels that russia is no longer a reliable supplier .
moscow employs gas as a political weapon .
that should be a constructive shock for the eu .
the bloc 's summit in march will have to come up with an effective counter strategy . moscow is also dependent on the eu the success of the czech eu presidency is a ray of hope .
the czech republic 's prime minister mirek topolanek was able to mediate and get eu inspectors to monitor the gas flow from russia via ukraine .
this could be a beginning in taking action against the corruption in the gas business in russia and ukraine .
for with each cubic meter of gas sold , dubious middlemen also earn money . twenty percent of turnover is allegedly redirected into the pockets of the political and economic elite this way . the european union has to remain unified against russia and push through a new energy agreement .

" test your strength " appears to be a midway favorite at the carnival that is this year 's recession , but the first time the german government swung the hammer , the needle did n't make it past " weakling . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now , government leaders - who admit their earlier tries were insufficient - have stepped right up and bought themselves another chance .
they 've decided to go whole hog , pledging 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 66 billion -rrb- over the next two years to help take the edge off the recession and spark the german economy .
education gets an ' a ' ...
but someone aiming to give the government marks for its various efforts would have to award grades running from an " a " all the way down to a " d. "
the investment program alone , which mainly commands spending in educational institutions , is worth some 18 billion euros .
it is brave , on-the-mark - and worthy of an " a. "
states and municipalities have been putting off investment for ages ; now they can get to work .
all they have to do is pull out their long-finished investment plans and dust them off . which means the plans can be put into effect quickly , thus providing an actual economic boost .
in an effort to give citizens and businesses a break and to boost consumer spending , the state lowered the marginal tax rate and raised the limit for non-taxable income .
it means there will be some nine billion fewer tax euros in government coffers . ... but the ' wrecking premium ' earns a ' d ' but lowering the marginal tax rate , and limiting so-called " cold progression " - an unfortunate system whereby the state increases its percentage claim on income in lockstep with an income increase - was long overdue .
it 's a measure that should have been taken even without an economic crisis , and so it only deserves a " c. "
the planned reduction in insurance contributions is likely to provide immediate relief not only to businesses and taxpayers , but also to retirees and low-income households .
it will cost the state another nine billion euros - and earns an " a " even though it is clear that the state can not continue to prop up the ailing social system at this level .
on the other hand , hotly debated protective measures for businesses are problematic .
in this case , the financial aid is aimed at sluggish bank lending , but not at the capital investments of the state in businesses , thus taking the touchy subject of state investment in business off the table .
but if companies take the government up on its guarantees , it could certainly prove to be expensive for the state .
ultimately , then , it is impossible to assign a grade to this move .
other measures are worthy of a " d " at best .
giving 100 euros per child to each citizen is unlikely to spark much consumer spending , and a " wrecking premium " for cars that are more than nine years old could give a leg up to the car industry - but which one ?
the french and japanese could profit as well as the germans on that account .
bold - or just brash ?
taken all together , though , the whole package can be labeled a courageous effort .
not only because it is the largest economic-stimulus package post-war germany has yet to create , but also because the state is narrowing its tax base - and thereby risks losing some of its negotiating status .
it is courageous because it is the first time germany has been willing to clearly breach the 40-billion-euro debt record set in 1996 , and thereby cross the debt-ratio line set by the maastricht treaty .
it is courageous in its self-confidence and belief in a better future .
but inordinate courage is often shown by those who are desperate .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now , government leaders - who admit their earlier tries were insufficient - have stepped right up and bought themselves another chance .

states and municipalities have been putting off investment for ages ; now they can get to work .
all they have to do is pull out their long-finished investment plans and dust them off . which means the plans can be put into effect quickly , thus providing an actual economic boost .
in an effort to give citizens and businesses a break and to boost consumer spending , the state lowered the marginal tax rate and raised the limit for non-taxable income .
it means there will be some nine billion fewer tax euros in government coffers . ... but the ' wrecking premium ' earns a ' d ' but lowering the marginal tax rate , and limiting so-called " cold progression " - an unfortunate system whereby the state increases its percentage claim on income in lockstep with an income increase - was long overdue .

on the other hand , hotly debated protective measures for businesses are problematic .
in this case , the financial aid is aimed at sluggish bank lending , but not at the capital investments of the state in businesses , thus taking the touchy subject of state investment in business off the table .

ultimately , then , it is impossible to assign a grade to this move .
other measures are worthy of a " d " at best .
giving 100 euros per child to each citizen is unlikely to spark much consumer spending , and a " wrecking premium " for cars that are more than nine years old could give a leg up to the car industry - but which one ?

bold - or just brash ?
taken all together , though , the whole package can be labeled a courageous effort .
not only because it is the largest economic-stimulus package post-war germany has yet to create , but also because the state is narrowing its tax base - and thereby risks losing some of its negotiating status .
it is courageous because it is the first time germany has been willing to clearly breach the 40-billion-euro debt record set in 1996 , and thereby cross the debt-ratio line set by the maastricht treaty .

the former head of deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel , is reportedly ready to confess to tax evasion in return for a suspended sentence .
many ordinary taxpayers are , predictably , not amused . one of germany 's leading financial newspapers , handelsblatt , reported the deal late on monday evening , jan .
12 .
the paper cited an unnamed court official as its source .
zumwinkel was scheduled to go on trial next week for allegedly using the lgt bank in liechtenstein to hide nearly one million euros -lrb- $ 1.32 million -rrb- in income from german tax authorities .
the former ceo of germany 's postal company , deutsche post , was one of the most prominent figures involved in a scandal that broke last year , when it emerged that hundreds of wealthy germans were purportedly using foreign accounts to conceal money from the government .
the news led to many european governments to step up the pressure on so-called tax havens like liechtenstein to change their banking secrecy laws .
zumwinkel subsequently resigned his position at the deutsche post .
under the terms of the reported plea bargain , zumwinkel would admit to wrongdoing in return for receiving a two-year suspended sentence .
when asked by the afp news agency , a spokesperson for the court in bochum , where the trial is scheduled to take place , refused to confirm or deny the deal .
new legislation needed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : llb is another liechtenstein bank to be accused of aiding tax cheats according to handelsblatt , the plea bargain was only possible because the court had ruled that zumwinkel would only have to answer on charges of evading 970,000 euros in taxes from 2002-6 .
further evasion accusations from 2001 were deemed inadmissible because of germany 's statute of limitations - german law prohibits suspended sentences in cases involving more than million euros .
germany 's federal prosecutor monika harms has called in the past for legislation against so-called " back-room deals " in cases of serious economic crimes .
and germany 's bloggers are , not surprisingly , outraged by the news of the zumwinkel arrangement .
" it 's very bitter indeed for an ' average citizen ' to see the state differentiate between classes in applying its laws , " wrote one user of the bild newspaper 's online edition .
" it 's simply disgusting . "
few germans believe that zumwinkel would be able to reach such a deal , if he were not a former top executive .
" here in germany , tax evasion is sometimes prosecuted more vigorously than cases of rape , " wrote a commentator on the blog virtual nights .

the former head of deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel , is reportedly ready to confess to tax evasion in return for a suspended sentence .
many ordinary taxpayers are , predictably , not amused . one of germany 's leading financial newspapers , handelsblatt , reported the deal late on monday evening , jan .
12 .
the paper cited an unnamed court official as its source .
zumwinkel was scheduled to go on trial next week for allegedly using the lgt bank in liechtenstein to hide nearly one million euros -lrb- $ 1.32 million -rrb- in income from german tax authorities .
the former ceo of germany 's postal company , deutsche post , was one of the most prominent figures involved in a scandal that broke last year , when it emerged that hundreds of wealthy germans were purportedly using foreign accounts to conceal money from the government .
the news led to many european governments to step up the pressure on so-called tax havens like liechtenstein to change their banking secrecy laws .
zumwinkel subsequently resigned his position at the deutsche post .
under the terms of the reported plea bargain , zumwinkel would admit to wrongdoing in return for receiving a two-year suspended sentence .
when asked by the afp news agency , a spokesperson for the court in bochum , where the trial is scheduled to take place , refused to confirm or deny the deal .
new legislation needed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : llb is another liechtenstein bank to be accused of aiding tax cheats according to handelsblatt , the plea bargain was only possible because the court had ruled that zumwinkel would only have to answer on charges of evading 970,000 euros in taxes from 2002-6 .
further evasion accusations from 2001 were deemed inadmissible because of germany 's statute of limitations - german law prohibits suspended sentences in cases involving more than million euros .
germany 's federal prosecutor monika harms has called in the past for legislation against so-called " back-room deals " in cases of serious economic crimes .
and germany 's bloggers are , not surprisingly , outraged by the news of the zumwinkel arrangement .
" it 's very bitter indeed for an ' average citizen ' to see the state differentiate between classes in applying its laws , " wrote one user of the bild newspaper 's online edition .
" it 's simply disgusting . "
few germans believe that zumwinkel would be able to reach such a deal , if he were not a former top executive .
" here in germany , tax evasion is sometimes prosecuted more vigorously than cases of rape , " wrote a commentator on the blog virtual nights .
" only if you 're the former boss of the post office , you can emerge from the affair with merely a black eye . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 13.01.2009 opinion : europe should push through a common energy policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should act as a mediator in the russia-ukraine energy row given that large parts of the continent have had their gas supplies cut .
but the basis for successful crisis talks is rather weak , says dw 's bernd riegert . it was a similar situation three years ago .
russia and ukraine fought about gas prices .
the ones to suffer were the eu countries , whose gas supplies became scarce .
at the time , gas volumes were only reduced , the gas taps were n't fully turned off as is the case this winter .
at the time , the eu member states grandly promised to pursue a common energy policy which would lead to more independence from russia .
three years have passed and not a lot has happened .
quite the opposite is the case : russia and ukraine are even more brazenly showing the european union who has more pull when it comes to gas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission determined in its second report on an energy strategy last november that the dependence on russian gas will grow significantly in the next few years .
there is no prospect of this dependence easing before 2020 .
building new gas pipelines and finding suppliers in central asia or north africa was taking longer than they thought . in addition , russia was doing everything possible to torpedo european plans .
russia itself is going shopping for gas reserves in central asia .
russia is trying to form a supplier cartel of gas producing countries .
and russia is successfully attempting to divide the eu .
moscow has made bilateral supply and pipeline agreements with a few eu countries , which moscow considers to be friendly .
others - particularly the baltic states , poland , the czech republic and slovakia - should be thwarted from a russian perspective . the baltic pipeline which will connect russia directly with germany will not lessen the dependency on russian natural gas .
the necessary suppliers for the nabucco pipeline via turkey are still missing .
even iran , which could provide gas supplies one day , would not really be the most reliable partner . european interests differ meanwhile , european solidarity and the common gas market , which eu commission president jose barroso already evoked three years ago , is not far gone .
only now are countries beginning to think about connecting eu nations with each other with pipelines so that there is n't only the one-way street from russia .
no country is really willing to open its gas reserves for another nation .
there is no european storage for gas , only nationally administered ones . within the eu , the dependency on russian gas varies greatly .
finland and poland , for example , get every cubic meter of gas they use from russia .
spain does n't import any russian gas at all .
it 's evident that the interests are very different . it has now become clear to european gas clients and the eu commission in brussels that russia is no longer a reliable supplier .
moscow employs gas as a political weapon .
that should be a constructive shock for the eu .
the bloc 's summit in march will have to come up with an effective counter strategy . moscow is also dependent on the eu the success of the czech eu presidency is a ray of hope .
the czech republic 's prime minister mirek topolanek was able to mediate and get eu inspectors to monitor the gas flow from russia via ukraine .
this could be a beginning in taking action against the corruption in the gas business in russia and ukraine .
for with each cubic meter of gas sold , dubious middlemen also earn money . twenty percent of turnover is allegedly redirected into the pockets of the political and economic elite this way . the european union has to remain unified against russia and push through a new energy agreement .
european companies have to finally be allowed to tap energy sources in russia and build up infrastructure for its transport . russia raked in tons of cash so long as the world economy was booming and energy prices rose . now , russia as a supplier may be noticing that it too is dependent on its customers .
falling prices are likely to make the leadership in moscow see that cooperation with the eu and western investors is better than confrontation . ukraine too is acting just as unreliably as russia is .
it is diverting gas or blocking deliveries from russia .
this disqualifies ukraine both as a candidate for nato and eu membership . bernd riegert -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de ukraine blocks russian gas from getting to europe the eu thought it had reached an agreement to end the six-day stoppage in russian gas supplies .
but early on tuesday , experts said still hardly any was flowing through ukraine pipelines .
ukraine says it 's russia 's fault .
-lrb- 13.01.2009 -rrb- russian gas supplies to resume tuesday , eu says the eu expects gas supplies from russia to resume on tuesday morning , officials in brussels said monday after a pricing row between russia and ukraine disrupted supplies for nearly a week in freezing temperatures .

but the basis for successful crisis talks is rather weak , says dw 's bernd riegert . it was a similar situation three years ago .
russia and ukraine fought about gas prices .
the ones to suffer were the eu countries , whose gas supplies became scarce .
at the time , gas volumes were only reduced , the gas taps were n't fully turned off as is the case this winter .
at the time , the eu member states grandly promised to pursue a common energy policy which would lead to more independence from russia .
three years have passed and not a lot has happened .
quite the opposite is the case : russia and ukraine are even more brazenly showing the european union who has more pull when it comes to gas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission determined in its second report on an energy strategy last november that the dependence on russian gas will grow significantly in the next few years .
there is no prospect of this dependence easing before 2020 .
building new gas pipelines and finding suppliers in central asia or north africa was taking longer than they thought . in addition , russia was doing everything possible to torpedo european plans .
russia itself is going shopping for gas reserves in central asia .
russia is trying to form a supplier cartel of gas producing countries .
and russia is successfully attempting to divide the eu .
moscow has made bilateral supply and pipeline agreements with a few eu countries , which moscow considers to be friendly .
others - particularly the baltic states , poland , the czech republic and slovakia - should be thwarted from a russian perspective . the baltic pipeline which will connect russia directly with germany will not lessen the dependency on russian natural gas .
the necessary suppliers for the nabucco pipeline via turkey are still missing .
even iran , which could provide gas supplies one day , would not really be the most reliable partner . european interests differ meanwhile , european solidarity and the common gas market , which eu commission president jose barroso already evoked three years ago , is not far gone .
only now are countries beginning to think about connecting eu nations with each other with pipelines so that there is n't only the one-way street from russia .
no country is really willing to open its gas reserves for another nation .
there is no european storage for gas , only nationally administered ones . within the eu , the dependency on russian gas varies greatly .
finland and poland , for example , get every cubic meter of gas they use from russia .
spain does n't import any russian gas at all .
it 's evident that the interests are very different . it has now become clear to european gas clients and the eu commission in brussels that russia is no longer a reliable supplier .
moscow employs gas as a political weapon .
that should be a constructive shock for the eu .
the bloc 's summit in march will have to come up with an effective counter strategy . moscow is also dependent on the eu the success of the czech eu presidency is a ray of hope .
the czech republic 's prime minister mirek topolanek was able to mediate and get eu inspectors to monitor the gas flow from russia via ukraine .
this could be a beginning in taking action against the corruption in the gas business in russia and ukraine .

falling prices are likely to make the leadership in moscow see that cooperation with the eu and western investors is better than confrontation . ukraine too is acting just as unreliably as russia is .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 13.01.2009 with fewer germans , working world is changing dramatically großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employers will have to make office environments more attractive in future germany 's population is noticeably shrinking .
by the year 2050 , there will be 10 million fewer people in the country then there are today - with dramatic consequences for the working world . in the future , the classic office swivel chair will be something of a rarity .
instead , those reclining television lounge chairs will be everywhere .
and among the other novelties in the office of the future : more breaks where employees can nibble from fruit platters or have a massage in the company 's own fitness center .
even blue-collar workers will find that their jobs offer more comforts . the reason for these fantastic-sounding benefits is n't a sudden burst of benevolence on the part of employers , rather a necessary bit of calculation , says werner eichhorst from the institute for the study of labor in bonn . " in the future , it 'll be all about making the work load easier - on a daily , weekly , and yearly basis - because with fewer germans , there are fewer employees on the market , and those that are available are growing older , " he said .
" employers can no longer afford to wear out their workforce , and that 's why they have to take better care of them . " tomorrow 's working world if the current estimates from the federal statistics office come to pass , then in the next 30 years , germany will have six million fewer workers .
and the average age of an employee will increase from 42 to 48 . " fewer , older employees means that we wo n't be able to stick to the legal retirement age , " say experts at the bonn-based institute .
they 're predicting a retirement age close to 69 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts predict more german women will enter full-time work fewer people in germany and therefore fewer employees will be able to shoulder more of the daily workload .

but early on tuesday , experts said still hardly any was flowing through ukraine pipelines .
ukraine says it 's russia 's fault . the ukrainian gas company naftogas confirmed tuesday , january 13th that it was blocking gas shipments from russia .
but naftogas said that because russia had pumped the gas into the wrong pipeline , it could not be delivered without cutting off supplies to several regions in the ukraine itself .
the nthinky veiled implication was that russian gas company gazprom may have intentionally misrouted the gas to drive a wedge betwen the eu and ukraine .
the statements came after the eu had complained that little to no gas was on its way through ukrainian pipelines .
" the information we have from our monitors in russia is that little or no gas is currently flowing , eu commission spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde hansen told reporters earlier on tuesday .
ferran tarradellas , the spokesman for the eu 's energy commissioner , said that complaints had been registered with russian prime minister vladimir putin .
putin was reported to have said that ukraine was responsible for the blockage - gazprom said on tuesday that it had sent 76 million cubic meters of gas had been sent through the pipelines at 10 am moscow .
experts say it could take up to three days for gas pumped from siberia to reach europe , where thousands of people have been left without heat in one of the coldest winters the continent has seen in a decade .
russia supplies an average of 350 million cubic meters of gas to europe in the winter months .
and because of the ongoing hostility between russia and ukraine , that supply is in jeopardy .
deal signed twice last wednesday , jan .
7 , gazprom halted all shipments in an attempt to stop what it called ukraine 's theft of gas destined for european clients .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 13.01.2009 opinion : bold stimulus package merits mixed grades großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's rolf wenkel says germany 's uneven economic-stimulus package shows courage despite its flaws . " test your strength " appears to be a midway favorite at the carnival that is this year 's recession , but the first time the german government swung the hammer , the needle did n't make it past " weakling . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now , government leaders - who admit their earlier tries were insufficient - have stepped right up and bought themselves another chance .
they 've decided to go whole hog , pledging 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 66 billion -rrb- over the next two years to help take the edge off the recession and spark the german economy .
education gets an ' a ' ...
but someone aiming to give the government marks for its various efforts would have to award grades running from an " a " all the way down to a " d. "
the investment program alone , which mainly commands spending in educational institutions , is worth some 18 billion euros .
it is brave , on-the-mark - and worthy of an " a. "
states and municipalities have been putting off investment for ages ; now they can get to work .
all they have to do is pull out their long-finished investment plans and dust them off . which means the plans can be put into effect quickly , thus providing an actual economic boost .
in an effort to give citizens and businesses a break and to boost consumer spending , the state lowered the marginal tax rate and raised the limit for non-taxable income .
it means there will be some nine billion fewer tax euros in government coffers . ... but the ' wrecking premium ' earns a ' d ' but lowering the marginal tax rate , and limiting so-called " cold progression " - an unfortunate system whereby the state increases its percentage claim on income in lockstep with an income increase - was long overdue .
it 's a measure that should have been taken even without an economic crisis , and so it only deserves a " c. "
the planned reduction in insurance contributions is likely to provide immediate relief not only to businesses and taxpayers , but also to retirees and low-income households .
it will cost the state another nine billion euros - and earns an " a " even though it is clear that the state can not continue to prop up the ailing social system at this level .
on the other hand , hotly debated protective measures for businesses are problematic .
in this case , the financial aid is aimed at sluggish bank lending , but not at the capital investments of the state in businesses , thus taking the touchy subject of state investment in business off the table .
but if companies take the government up on its guarantees , it could certainly prove to be expensive for the state .
ultimately , then , it is impossible to assign a grade to this move .
other measures are worthy of a " d " at best .
giving 100 euros per child to each citizen is unlikely to spark much consumer spending , and a " wrecking premium " for cars that are more than nine years old could give a leg up to the car industry - but which one ?
the french and japanese could profit as well as the germans on that account .
bold - or just brash ?
taken all together , though , the whole package can be labeled a courageous effort .
not only because it is the largest economic-stimulus package post-war germany has yet to create , but also because the state is narrowing its tax base - and thereby risks losing some of its negotiating status .
it is courageous because it is the first time germany has been willing to clearly breach the 40-billion-euro debt record set in 1996 , and thereby cross the debt-ratio line set by the maastricht treaty .
it is courageous in its self-confidence and belief in a better future .
but inordinate courage is often shown by those who are desperate .
time will tell just what kind of courage it took to strike this deal .

but early on tuesday , experts said still hardly any was flowing through ukraine pipelines .
ukraine says it 's russia 's fault . the ukrainian gas company naftogas confirmed tuesday , january 13th that it was blocking gas shipments from russia .
but naftogas said that because russia had pumped the gas into the wrong pipeline , it could not be delivered without cutting off supplies to several regions in the ukraine itself .
the nthinky veiled implication was that russian gas company gazprom may have intentionally misrouted the gas to drive a wedge betwen the eu and ukraine .
the statements came after the eu had complained that little to no gas was on its way through ukrainian pipelines .
" the information we have from our monitors in russia is that little or no gas is currently flowing , eu commission spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde hansen told reporters earlier on tuesday .
ferran tarradellas , the spokesman for the eu 's energy commissioner , said that complaints had been registered with russian prime minister vladimir putin .
putin was reported to have said that ukraine was responsible for the blockage - gazprom said on tuesday that it had sent 76 million cubic meters of gas had been sent through the pipelines at 10 am moscow .
experts say it could take up to three days for gas pumped from siberia to reach europe , where thousands of people have been left without heat in one of the coldest winters the continent has seen in a decade .
russia supplies an average of 350 million cubic meters of gas to europe in the winter months .
and because of the ongoing hostility between russia and ukraine , that supply is in jeopardy .
deal signed twice last wednesday , jan .
7 , gazprom halted all shipments in an attempt to stop what it called ukraine 's theft of gas destined for european clients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu observers came to this gas-measuring station under a long-awaited deal that had to be signed twice within the space of a few days , 25 experts from the european union , ukraine and russia are to monitor gas flows at five compressor stations in both ukraine and russia and another three stations in slovakia and romania .
europe relies on russia for roughly one quarter of all the natural gas it burns , and 80 percent of that gas arrives in the eu through pipelines crossing ukraine .
russian has discontinued gas supplies to ukraine itself amidst a dispute about the price kyiv should pay for russian gas .
russia , which has traditionally sold ukraine gas as prices far lower than those it asks from western europe , wants to raise its fees to $ 250 per 1000 cubic meters .
kyiv says it ca n't afford to pay any more than $ 201 .
moscow has also accused kyiv of failing to settle old debts and of siphoning off gas from deliveries intended for western europe . dw staff -lrb- jc / jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the former head of deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel , is reportedly ready to confess to tax evasion in return for a suspended sentence .
many ordinary taxpayers are , predictably , not amused . one of germany 's leading financial newspapers , handelsblatt , reported the deal late on monday evening , jan .
12 .
the paper cited an unnamed court official as its source .
zumwinkel was scheduled to go on trial next week for allegedly using the lgt bank in liechtenstein to hide nearly one million euros -lrb- $ 1.32 million -rrb- in income from german tax authorities .
the former ceo of germany 's postal company , deutsche post , was one of the most prominent figures involved in a scandal that broke last year , when it emerged that hundreds of wealthy germans were purportedly using foreign accounts to conceal money from the government .
the news led to many european governments to step up the pressure on so-called tax havens like liechtenstein to change their banking secrecy laws .
zumwinkel subsequently resigned his position at the deutsche post .
under the terms of the reported plea bargain , zumwinkel would admit to wrongdoing in return for receiving a two-year suspended sentence .
when asked by the afp news agency , a spokesperson for the court in bochum , where the trial is scheduled to take place , refused to confirm or deny the deal .
new legislation needed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : llb is another liechtenstein bank to be accused of aiding tax cheats according to handelsblatt , the plea bargain was only possible because the court had ruled that zumwinkel would only have to answer on charges of evading 970,000 euros in taxes from 2002-6 .
further evasion accusations from 2001 were deemed inadmissible because of germany 's statute of limitations - german law prohibits suspended sentences in cases involving more than million euros .
germany 's federal prosecutor monika harms has called in the past for legislation against so-called " back-room deals " in cases of serious economic crimes .
and germany 's bloggers are , not surprisingly , outraged by the news of the zumwinkel arrangement .
" it 's very bitter indeed for an ' average citizen ' to see the state differentiate between classes in applying its laws , " wrote one user of the bild newspaper 's online edition .
" it 's simply disgusting . "
few germans believe that zumwinkel would be able to reach such a deal , if he were not a former top executive .
" here in germany , tax evasion is sometimes prosecuted more vigorously than cases of rape , " wrote a commentator on the blog virtual nights .
" only if you 're the former boss of the post office , you can emerge from the affair with merely a black eye . "
but one user - presumably a former postal employee - took the news with a measure of humor .
" great , " he wrote .
" my ex-boss really knows what he 's doing . "
a number of prominent german executives - including former vw personnel boss and government advisor peter hartz - have received light sentences in criminal cases in recent years , prompting growing public anger and dismay . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" test your strength " appears to be a midway favorite at the carnival that is this year 's recession , but the first time the german government swung the hammer , the needle did n't make it past " weakling . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now , government leaders - who admit their earlier tries were insufficient - have stepped right up and bought themselves another chance .
they 've decided to go whole hog , pledging 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 66 billion -rrb- over the next two years to help take the edge off the recession and spark the german economy .
education gets an ' a ' ...
but someone aiming to give the government marks for its various efforts would have to award grades running from an " a " all the way down to a " d. "
the investment program alone , which mainly commands spending in educational institutions , is worth some 18 billion euros .
it is brave , on-the-mark - and worthy of an " a. "
states and municipalities have been putting off investment for ages ; now they can get to work .
all they have to do is pull out their long-finished investment plans and dust them off . which means the plans can be put into effect quickly , thus providing an actual economic boost .
in an effort to give citizens and businesses a break and to boost consumer spending , the state lowered the marginal tax rate and raised the limit for non-taxable income .
it means there will be some nine billion fewer tax euros in government coffers . ... but the ' wrecking premium ' earns a ' d ' but lowering the marginal tax rate , and limiting so-called " cold progression " - an unfortunate system whereby the state increases its percentage claim on income in lockstep with an income increase - was long overdue .
it 's a measure that should have been taken even without an economic crisis , and so it only deserves a " c. "
the planned reduction in insurance contributions is likely to provide immediate relief not only to businesses and taxpayers , but also to retirees and low-income households .
it will cost the state another nine billion euros - and earns an " a " even though it is clear that the state can not continue to prop up the ailing social system at this level .
on the other hand , hotly debated protective measures for businesses are problematic .
in this case , the financial aid is aimed at sluggish bank lending , but not at the capital investments of the state in businesses , thus taking the touchy subject of state investment in business off the table .
but if companies take the government up on its guarantees , it could certainly prove to be expensive for the state .
ultimately , then , it is impossible to assign a grade to this move .
other measures are worthy of a " d " at best .
giving 100 euros per child to each citizen is unlikely to spark much consumer spending , and a " wrecking premium " for cars that are more than nine years old could give a leg up to the car industry - but which one ?
the french and japanese could profit as well as the germans on that account .
bold - or just brash ?
taken all together , though , the whole package can be labeled a courageous effort .
not only because it is the largest economic-stimulus package post-war germany has yet to create , but also because the state is narrowing its tax base - and thereby risks losing some of its negotiating status .
it is courageous because it is the first time germany has been willing to clearly breach the 40-billion-euro debt record set in 1996 , and thereby cross the debt-ratio line set by the maastricht treaty .
it is courageous in its self-confidence and belief in a better future .
but inordinate courage is often shown by those who are desperate .
time will tell just what kind of courage it took to strike this deal .

the former head of deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel , is reportedly ready to confess to tax evasion in return for a suspended sentence .
many ordinary taxpayers are , predictably , not amused . one of germany 's leading financial newspapers , handelsblatt , reported the deal late on monday evening , jan .
12 .
the paper cited an unnamed court official as its source .
zumwinkel was scheduled to go on trial next week for allegedly using the lgt bank in liechtenstein to hide nearly one million euros -lrb- $ 1.32 million -rrb- in income from german tax authorities .
the former ceo of germany 's postal company , deutsche post , was one of the most prominent figures involved in a scandal that broke last year , when it emerged that hundreds of wealthy germans were purportedly using foreign accounts to conceal money from the government .
the news led to many european governments to step up the pressure on so-called tax havens like liechtenstein to change their banking secrecy laws .
zumwinkel subsequently resigned his position at the deutsche post .
under the terms of the reported plea bargain , zumwinkel would admit to wrongdoing in return for receiving a two-year suspended sentence .
when asked by the afp news agency , a spokesperson for the court in bochum , where the trial is scheduled to take place , refused to confirm or deny the deal .
new legislation needed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : llb is another liechtenstein bank to be accused of aiding tax cheats according to handelsblatt , the plea bargain was only possible because the court had ruled that zumwinkel would only have to answer on charges of evading 970,000 euros in taxes from 2002-6 .
further evasion accusations from 2001 were deemed inadmissible because of germany 's statute of limitations - german law prohibits suspended sentences in cases involving more than million euros .
germany 's federal prosecutor monika harms has called in the past for legislation against so-called " back-room deals " in cases of serious economic crimes .
and germany 's bloggers are , not surprisingly , outraged by the news of the zumwinkel arrangement .
" it 's very bitter indeed for an ' average citizen ' to see the state differentiate between classes in applying its laws , " wrote one user of the bild newspaper 's online edition .
" it 's simply disgusting . "
few germans believe that zumwinkel would be able to reach such a deal , if he were not a former top executive .

the former head of deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel , is reportedly ready to confess to tax evasion in return for a suspended sentence .
many ordinary taxpayers are , predictably , not amused . one of germany 's leading financial newspapers , handelsblatt , reported the deal late on monday evening , jan .
12 .
the paper cited an unnamed court official as its source .
zumwinkel was scheduled to go on trial next week for allegedly using the lgt bank in liechtenstein to hide nearly one million euros -lrb- $ 1.32 million -rrb- in income from german tax authorities .
the former ceo of germany 's postal company , deutsche post , was one of the most prominent figures involved in a scandal that broke last year , when it emerged that hundreds of wealthy germans were purportedly using foreign accounts to conceal money from the government .
the news led to many european governments to step up the pressure on so-called tax havens like liechtenstein to change their banking secrecy laws .
zumwinkel subsequently resigned his position at the deutsche post .
under the terms of the reported plea bargain , zumwinkel would admit to wrongdoing in return for receiving a two-year suspended sentence .
when asked by the afp news agency , a spokesperson for the court in bochum , where the trial is scheduled to take place , refused to confirm or deny the deal .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : llb is another liechtenstein bank to be accused of aiding tax cheats according to handelsblatt , the plea bargain was only possible because the court had ruled that zumwinkel would only have to answer on charges of evading 970,000 euros in taxes from 2002-6 .

the three parties of germany 's grand coalition have agreed on a fresh round of stimulus measures worth billions to protect the weakening economy .
but some already worry the package will not offer the help that 's needed . in talks held late into the night on monday , jan .
12 , the governing parties committed to a huge wave of spending likely to inject up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 66 billion -rrb- into europe 's biggest economy , party officials said . in addition , the federal government would set up a massive fund to give loans and guarantees to struggling industries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : csu 's seehofer got the tax cuts he was wishing for the " credit and guarantee fund " will reportedly be worth 100 billion euros .
officials said its name would be a way of stressing that it would not be a vehicle for taking industries into government ownership . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have been wrangling for weeks with merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- over the package , with each of them eager to include pet policies in the huge surge of state spending . change of heart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel agreed to a ' credit and guarantee ' fund merkel initially resisted vast government spending as an antidote to recession , as advocated by the french and british governments , but a stream of bad economic data and the prospect of a general election this september changed the government 's mind . the round of emergency spending , spread over two years , would be the biggest since modern germany was established in 1949 . the broad terms were jointly announced by the chiefs of the three governing-party caucuses in the bundestag parliament : volker kauder of the cdu , peter ramsauer of the csu and peter struck of the spd . they said the cuts in corporate and income taxes , to take effect on july 1 , would inject 9 billion euros into the german economy , with the income tax scale beginning at 14 instead of 15 percent . a cut in state health-insurance premiums for german workers would cost a further 9 billion euros .
families with children are to receive a one-off bonus benefit of 100 euros per child , they added . " wrecking bonus " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can a " wrecking bonus " spur new-car sales ?
massive new government investment in education , highways and other projects would total 18 billion euros . sources said the six-hour meeting also produced agreement to grant a " wrecking bonus " to new-car buyers who send their old cars to the crusher .
the car industry has been complaining about slumping sales in germany . the agreement also includes cuts in health insurance contributions in order to put more cash in shoppers ' pockets , and simpler rules on creating temporary jobs , the officials said after the meeting .
" all in all this is a package that will help us to get through this economic crisis and keep jobs , " volker kauder , head of the cdu in parliament , told reporters late monday .
but some economists are worried the package will not help germany where it needs it most : its massive , but struggling , export sector .
the global downturn has significantly damaged the foreign demand for german goods . merkel to bring details merkel was scheduled to brief opposition parties early tuesday , jan .
13 .
she will then detail the package at a news conference , joined at the microphone by foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who is the social democratic party 's nominee for the chancellorship at this year 's election , and bavarian premier horst seehofer . the tax cuts marked a victory for the csu , the bavaria-only party that seehofer leads .
it had repeatedly attacked merkel 's insistence on balancing the budget before reforming tax scales . while the three-year-old grand coalition of germany 's main parties has become more fractious as the general election nears , there was broad agreement before the meeting that action against the nation 's economic woes was urgently needed . deepening recession a slew of fresh data has underscored that a deepening recession is taking hold in europe 's biggest economy .
figures last week showed a dramatic 10.6-percent plunge in german exports in november along with a hefty drop in factory orders and a bigger-than-forecast rise in december unemployment . leading german companies have already announced plans for layoffs and production cuts as global economic growth spirals downwards . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but early on tuesday , experts said still hardly any was flowing through ukraine pipelines .
ukraine says it 's russia 's fault . the ukrainian gas company naftogas confirmed tuesday , january 13th that it was blocking gas shipments from russia .
but naftogas said that because russia had pumped the gas into the wrong pipeline , it could not be delivered without cutting off supplies to several regions in the ukraine itself .
the nthinky veiled implication was that russian gas company gazprom may have intentionally misrouted the gas to drive a wedge betwen the eu and ukraine .
the statements came after the eu had complained that little to no gas was on its way through ukrainian pipelines .
" the information we have from our monitors in russia is that little or no gas is currently flowing , eu commission spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde hansen told reporters earlier on tuesday .
ferran tarradellas , the spokesman for the eu 's energy commissioner , said that complaints had been registered with russian prime minister vladimir putin .
putin was reported to have said that ukraine was responsible for the blockage - gazprom said on tuesday that it had sent 76 million cubic meters of gas had been sent through the pipelines at 10 am moscow .
experts say it could take up to three days for gas pumped from siberia to reach europe , where thousands of people have been left without heat in one of the coldest winters the continent has seen in a decade .
russia supplies an average of 350 million cubic meters of gas to europe in the winter months .
and because of the ongoing hostility between russia and ukraine , that supply is in jeopardy .
deal signed twice last wednesday , jan .
7 , gazprom halted all shipments in an attempt to stop what it called ukraine 's theft of gas destined for european clients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu observers came to this gas-measuring station under a long-awaited deal that had to be signed twice within the space of a few days , 25 experts from the european union , ukraine and russia are to monitor gas flows at five compressor stations in both ukraine and russia and another three stations in slovakia and romania .
europe relies on russia for roughly one quarter of all the natural gas it burns , and 80 percent of that gas arrives in the eu through pipelines crossing ukraine .
russian has discontinued gas supplies to ukraine itself amidst a dispute about the price kyiv should pay for russian gas .
russia , which has traditionally sold ukraine gas as prices far lower than those it asks from western europe , wants to raise its fees to $ 250 per 1000 cubic meters .
kyiv says it ca n't afford to pay any more than $ 201 .
moscow has also accused kyiv of failing to settle old debts and of siphoning off gas from deliveries intended for western europe . dw staff -lrb- jc / jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 13.01.2009 former german postal chief could avoid jail with plea bargain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks like zumwinkel wo n't be spending time behind bars .
the former head of deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel , is reportedly ready to confess to tax evasion in return for a suspended sentence .
many ordinary taxpayers are , predictably , not amused . one of germany 's leading financial newspapers , handelsblatt , reported the deal late on monday evening , jan .
12 .
the paper cited an unnamed court official as its source .
zumwinkel was scheduled to go on trial next week for allegedly using the lgt bank in liechtenstein to hide nearly one million euros -lrb- $ 1.32 million -rrb- in income from german tax authorities .
the former ceo of germany 's postal company , deutsche post , was one of the most prominent figures involved in a scandal that broke last year , when it emerged that hundreds of wealthy germans were purportedly using foreign accounts to conceal money from the government .
the news led to many european governments to step up the pressure on so-called tax havens like liechtenstein to change their banking secrecy laws .
zumwinkel subsequently resigned his position at the deutsche post .
under the terms of the reported plea bargain , zumwinkel would admit to wrongdoing in return for receiving a two-year suspended sentence .
when asked by the afp news agency , a spokesperson for the court in bochum , where the trial is scheduled to take place , refused to confirm or deny the deal .
new legislation needed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : llb is another liechtenstein bank to be accused of aiding tax cheats according to handelsblatt , the plea bargain was only possible because the court had ruled that zumwinkel would only have to answer on charges of evading 970,000 euros in taxes from 2002-6 .
further evasion accusations from 2001 were deemed inadmissible because of germany 's statute of limitations - german law prohibits suspended sentences in cases involving more than million euros .
germany 's federal prosecutor monika harms has called in the past for legislation against so-called " back-room deals " in cases of serious economic crimes .
and germany 's bloggers are , not surprisingly , outraged by the news of the zumwinkel arrangement .
" it 's very bitter indeed for an ' average citizen ' to see the state differentiate between classes in applying its laws , " wrote one user of the bild newspaper 's online edition .
" it 's simply disgusting . "
few germans believe that zumwinkel would be able to reach such a deal , if he were not a former top executive .
" here in germany , tax evasion is sometimes prosecuted more vigorously than cases of rape , " wrote a commentator on the blog virtual nights .
" only if you 're the former boss of the post office , you can emerge from the affair with merely a black eye . "
but one user - presumably a former postal employee - took the news with a measure of humor .
" great , " he wrote .
" my ex-boss really knows what he 's doing . "
a number of prominent german executives - including former vw personnel boss and government advisor peter hartz - have received light sentences in criminal cases in recent years , prompting growing public anger and dismay . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but not all experts are convinced it can help beat the downturn . germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel was full of praise for the initiative , being touted as a " pact for germany , " which her coalition passed on tuesday , january 11 . merkel told reporters her government was doing " everything possible so that germany does not just overcome this crisis , but emerges from it stronger . " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier from merkel 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , said the german package of investments , government loans and hand-outs , and tax cuts , compared favorably with stimulus measures taken by other nations . " when i look around europe , i ca n't see anyone else doing more or taking better steps than we are , " he told reporters . the package has come after mounting criticism that the government was being too hesitant in combating the economic decline prompted by the global financial crisis . soon enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " konjunktur " is german for " economic growth , " but not everyone likes this package but leading private-sector economists in germany disagreed about whether the so-called pact was all government ministers were claiming . the chief economist of commerzbank , joerg kraemer , was impressed . " no economic program in the world can stave off a recession , but the measures will no doubt contribute to stabilizing the economy in the second half of the year , " he told dpa news agency . the head economist at the bank of america , holger schmieding , has a different assessment . " this may only kick in late this year and thus do nothing to help us when the recession is at its worst - over the current quarter and the nest , " schmieding told reuters news agency . but others thought that the likely length of the slump would give the package time to work . " the economic downturn will last so long that the full effect of the stimulus measures are bound to be felt , " bhf bank chief economist uwe angenendt told dpa , and deka bank chief economist also offered that agency pretty much the same analysis . debts and more debts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german car sales are currently in a deep freeze the association of german taxpayers is considerable less happy with the package , which will run up the federal deficit . in an official statement , association president karl heinz daeke called the measures a " smokescreen to distract from -lsb- the absence of -rsb- true tax relief . " while greeting the 18 billion euros of investment foreseen in the package , daeke called for increased vigilance to ensure that the money was n't wasted . he criticized the government premium of 2,500 euros to be paid to people who scrap their old cars and buy new ones , saying the auto industry would have benefited more from direct tax cuts . and he reminded germans that the program would come at a high cost . " every taxpayer should be aware that this stimulus package is being financed with debts which the community of tax payers will have to pay off in the future , " daeke said . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but not all experts are convinced it can help beat the downturn . germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel was full of praise for the initiative , being touted as a " pact for germany , " which her coalition passed on tuesday , january 11 . merkel told reporters her government was doing " everything possible so that germany does not just overcome this crisis , but emerges from it stronger . " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier from merkel 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , said the german package of investments , government loans and hand-outs , and tax cuts , compared favorably with stimulus measures taken by other nations . " when i look around europe , i ca n't see anyone else doing more or taking better steps than we are , " he told reporters . the package has come after mounting criticism that the government was being too hesitant in combating the economic decline prompted by the global financial crisis . soon enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " konjunktur " is german for " economic growth , " but not everyone likes this package but leading private-sector economists in germany disagreed about whether the so-called pact was all government ministers were claiming . the chief economist of commerzbank , joerg kraemer , was impressed . " no economic program in the world can stave off a recession , but the measures will no doubt contribute to stabilizing the economy in the second half of the year , " he told dpa news agency . the head economist at the bank of america , holger schmieding , has a different assessment . " this may only kick in late this year and thus do nothing to help us when the recession is at its worst - over the current quarter and the nest , " schmieding told reuters news agency . but others thought that the likely length of the slump would give the package time to work . " the economic downturn will last so long that the full effect of the stimulus measures are bound to be felt , " bhf bank chief economist uwe angenendt told dpa , and deka bank chief economist also offered that agency pretty much the same analysis . debts and more debts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german car sales are currently in a deep freeze the association of german taxpayers is considerable less happy with the package , which will run up the federal deficit . in an official statement , association president karl heinz daeke called the measures a " smokescreen to distract from -lsb- the absence of -rsb- true tax relief . " while greeting the 18 billion euros of investment foreseen in the package , daeke called for increased vigilance to ensure that the money was n't wasted . he criticized the government premium of 2,500 euros to be paid to people who scrap their old cars and buy new ones , saying the auto industry would have benefited more from direct tax cuts . and he reminded germans that the program would come at a high cost . " every taxpayer should be aware that this stimulus package is being financed with debts which the community of tax payers will have to pay off in the future , " daeke said . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his aim is to translate music for his audiences . dw-world.de : mr. metzmacher , the history of dso -lrb- deutsches symphonieorchester berlin -rrb- is closely linked to germany 's history .
however , you are the orchestra 's first german principal conductor .
does that fact have special meaning to you ? ingo metzmacher : actually the orchestra was founded by the americans just after the war in 1946-47 .
it 's also interesting to know that it 's linked to the time just after the war when the americans , english , french and russians really tried to give germany a chance to rebuild .
they founded this orchestra for their radio station . for me , the orchestra represents the newborn germany after the second world war .
they 've had a wonderful line of chief conductors since then , but i 'm the first german .
i 've lived for maybe ten years in belgium and holland , so i think i also have a european or international background .
i feel very german , but within europe and within the world . do you think the orchestra 's unique history has an impact on its role today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metzmacher is also active as a pianist it should have a more important role .
it 's called the german symphony orchestra berlin , so i would like for it to be even more representative of the country and its culture .
also , we have more than 20 nationalities in the orchestra .
it really represents the international germany that we have today - especially in berlin .
there 's been a big change in germany and i think that this very young orchestra can show that to the world . this is your second season with dso .
what are your goals for your time with the orchestra ? i would like to strengthen the role i just described and , on the other hand , i would like to maintain the very high quality of playing .
during my time here , i have a project in mind - to look after the " german soul " in music .
that means : i 'm interested in the special relationship of the german culture to music .
major composers were born in the german-speaking world .
when you look at germany , with all its theaters and orchestras , its cultural landscape is unique in the world .
i think it represents the deep roots , which we have as germans , of music and theater . i think part of the reason is germany 's geographical position in the middle of europe .
it 's always been confronted by influences from all sides .
and the culture was always able to adopt the good parts of what came into the country .
you can see that , during the time when germany decided not to take in anything from outside but just to concentrate on the german roots , it completely failed .
it was a disaster .
i think the richness of the german culture is due to the fact that it always took in what came from outside . you 're known for your interest in modern and contemporary music .
how did this interest develop ? it came when i was maybe 20 years old .
i discovered the world of modern music for me .
i come from a very traditional , classical / romantic background .
my father was a musician and , for him , music was a kind of holy world .
i did n't believe so much in that when i grew up .
and it was very interesting for me to discover that there was a modern world of music - starting , actually , in 1909 .
since then , music for me has been a wide open field which i 've tried to discover for myself . how do you convey that to audiences ? i 've written a book ; i 've done hundreds of introductions before concerts ; i sometimes speak openly on the stage ; i do these casual concerts in berlin where i explain music to people .
after all , i do n't think it 's so difficult to explain music .
i think you just have to find the right words to describe what 's really happening .
you have to find a way to translate it .
that 's something that interests me a lot - trying to translate my understanding of music into a language with words .
that ’ s not easy because when you listen to the music you should forget the words again and try to understand the language that has no words . bildunterschrift : the deutsches symphonieorchester as you mentioned , you 've lived in several countries .
where do you feel at home ? i 've started to feel at home in berlin .
i always thought i would , but it took me longer than i thought .
my head told me berlin was the place i always wanted to be .
since i was young , i have longed for a german capital , which we didn ’ t have at the time .
when i was in london or paris i thought , what a pity that germany does n't have one like that - a real big city where everything comes together .
since reunification , i think berlin is growing into a major international capital .
so i was very thrilled to come here .
but it 's also not easy here .
it takes time to get used to it . what 's not easy about berlin ? it 's tough , especially in my field of music .
we have seven orchestras in this city ; we have three operas ; we have the berlin philharmonic as a major player - not only in germany but in the world .
it 's tough to find your audience , to create your own profile , and to convince the politicians they should give you the money you need . how does the dso try to create its own profile ? we are the only orchestra in town that has a theme .
we have the german soul .
we have 1909 .
we have a programmatic plan - that music has more to say than only to be beautiful .
i strongly believe in the content of music , although it has no words .
and i want to show that . click on the audio link below to hear ingo metzmacher discuss the series " who 's afraid of 20th century music ?

how did this interest develop ? it came when i was maybe 20 years old .
i discovered the world of modern music for me .
i come from a very traditional , classical / romantic background .
my father was a musician and , for him , music was a kind of holy world .
i did n't believe so much in that when i grew up .
and it was very interesting for me to discover that there was a modern world of music - starting , actually , in 1909 .
since then , music for me has been a wide open field which i 've tried to discover for myself . how do you convey that to audiences ? i 've written a book ; i 've done hundreds of introductions before concerts ; i sometimes speak openly on the stage ; i do these casual concerts in berlin where i explain music to people .
after all , i do n't think it 's so difficult to explain music .
i think you just have to find the right words to describe what 's really happening .
you have to find a way to translate it .
that 's something that interests me a lot - trying to translate my understanding of music into a language with words .
that ’ s not easy because when you listen to the music you should forget the words again and try to understand the language that has no words . bildunterschrift : the deutsches symphonieorchester as you mentioned , you 've lived in several countries .
where do you feel at home ? i 've started to feel at home in berlin .
i always thought i would , but it took me longer than i thought .
my head told me berlin was the place i always wanted to be .
since i was young , i have longed for a german capital , which we didn ’ t have at the time .
when i was in london or paris i thought , what a pity that germany does n't have one like that - a real big city where everything comes together .
since reunification , i think berlin is growing into a major international capital .
so i was very thrilled to come here .
but it 's also not easy here .
it takes time to get used to it . what 's not easy about berlin ? it 's tough , especially in my field of music .
we have seven orchestras in this city ; we have three operas ; we have the berlin philharmonic as a major player - not only in germany but in the world .
it 's tough to find your audience , to create your own profile , and to convince the politicians they should give you the money you need . how does the dso try to create its own profile ? we are the only orchestra in town that has a theme .
we have the german soul .
we have 1909 .
we have a programmatic plan - that music has more to say than only to be beautiful .

his aim is to translate music for his audiences . dw-world.de : mr. metzmacher , the history of dso -lrb- deutsches symphonieorchester berlin -rrb- is closely linked to germany 's history .
however , you are the orchestra 's first german principal conductor .
does that fact have special meaning to you ? ingo metzmacher : actually the orchestra was founded by the americans just after the war in 1946-47 .
it 's also interesting to know that it 's linked to the time just after the war when the americans , english , french and russians really tried to give germany a chance to rebuild .
they founded this orchestra for their radio station . for me , the orchestra represents the newborn germany after the second world war .
they 've had a wonderful line of chief conductors since then , but i 'm the first german .
i 've lived for maybe ten years in belgium and holland , so i think i also have a european or international background .
i feel very german , but within europe and within the world . do you think the orchestra 's unique history has an impact on its role today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metzmacher is also active as a pianist it should have a more important role .
it 's called the german symphony orchestra berlin , so i would like for it to be even more representative of the country and its culture .
also , we have more than 20 nationalities in the orchestra .
it really represents the international germany that we have today - especially in berlin .
there 's been a big change in germany and i think that this very young orchestra can show that to the world . this is your second season with dso .
what are your goals for your time with the orchestra ? i would like to strengthen the role i just described and , on the other hand , i would like to maintain the very high quality of playing .
during my time here , i have a project in mind - to look after the " german soul " in music .
that means : i 'm interested in the special relationship of the german culture to music .
major composers were born in the german-speaking world .
when you look at germany , with all its theaters and orchestras , its cultural landscape is unique in the world .
i think it represents the deep roots , which we have as germans , of music and theater . i think part of the reason is germany 's geographical position in the middle of europe .
it 's always been confronted by influences from all sides .
and the culture was always able to adopt the good parts of what came into the country .
you can see that , during the time when germany decided not to take in anything from outside but just to concentrate on the german roots , it completely failed .

his aim is to translate music for his audiences . dw-world.de : mr. metzmacher , the history of dso -lrb- deutsches symphonieorchester berlin -rrb- is closely linked to germany 's history .
however , you are the orchestra 's first german principal conductor .
does that fact have special meaning to you ? ingo metzmacher : actually the orchestra was founded by the americans just after the war in 1946-47 .
it 's also interesting to know that it 's linked to the time just after the war when the americans , english , french and russians really tried to give germany a chance to rebuild .
they founded this orchestra for their radio station . for me , the orchestra represents the newborn germany after the second world war .
they 've had a wonderful line of chief conductors since then , but i 'm the first german .
i 've lived for maybe ten years in belgium and holland , so i think i also have a european or international background .
i feel very german , but within europe and within the world . do you think the orchestra 's unique history has an impact on its role today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metzmacher is also active as a pianist it should have a more important role .
it 's called the german symphony orchestra berlin , so i would like for it to be even more representative of the country and its culture .
also , we have more than 20 nationalities in the orchestra .
it really represents the international germany that we have today - especially in berlin .
there 's been a big change in germany and i think that this very young orchestra can show that to the world . this is your second season with dso .
what are your goals for your time with the orchestra ? i would like to strengthen the role i just described and , on the other hand , i would like to maintain the very high quality of playing .
during my time here , i have a project in mind - to look after the " german soul " in music .
that means : i 'm interested in the special relationship of the german culture to music .
major composers were born in the german-speaking world .
when you look at germany , with all its theaters and orchestras , its cultural landscape is unique in the world .
i think it represents the deep roots , which we have as germans , of music and theater . i think part of the reason is germany 's geographical position in the middle of europe .
it 's always been confronted by influences from all sides .
and the culture was always able to adopt the good parts of what came into the country .
you can see that , during the time when germany decided not to take in anything from outside but just to concentrate on the german roots , it completely failed .
it was a disaster .
i think the richness of the german culture is due to the fact that it always took in what came from outside . you 're known for your interest in modern and contemporary music .
how did this interest develop ? it came when i was maybe 20 years old .
i discovered the world of modern music for me .
i come from a very traditional , classical / romantic background .
my father was a musician and , for him , music was a kind of holy world .
i did n't believe so much in that when i grew up .
and it was very interesting for me to discover that there was a modern world of music - starting , actually , in 1909 .
since then , music for me has been a wide open field which i 've tried to discover for myself . how do you convey that to audiences ? i 've written a book ; i 've done hundreds of introductions before concerts ; i sometimes speak openly on the stage ; i do these casual concerts in berlin where i explain music to people .
after all , i do n't think it 's so difficult to explain music .
i think you just have to find the right words to describe what 's really happening .
you have to find a way to translate it .
that 's something that interests me a lot - trying to translate my understanding of music into a language with words .
that ’ s not easy because when you listen to the music you should forget the words again and try to understand the language that has no words . bildunterschrift : the deutsches symphonieorchester as you mentioned , you 've lived in several countries .
where do you feel at home ? i 've started to feel at home in berlin .
i always thought i would , but it took me longer than i thought .
my head told me berlin was the place i always wanted to be .
since i was young , i have longed for a german capital , which we didn ’ t have at the time .
when i was in london or paris i thought , what a pity that germany does n't have one like that - a real big city where everything comes together .
since reunification , i think berlin is growing into a major international capital .
so i was very thrilled to come here .
but it 's also not easy here .
it takes time to get used to it . what 's not easy about berlin ? it 's tough , especially in my field of music .
we have seven orchestras in this city ; we have three operas ; we have the berlin philharmonic as a major player - not only in germany but in the world .
it 's tough to find your audience , to create your own profile , and to convince the politicians they should give you the money you need . how does the dso try to create its own profile ? we are the only orchestra in town that has a theme .
we have the german soul .
we have 1909 .
we have a programmatic plan - that music has more to say than only to be beautiful .
i strongly believe in the content of music , although it has no words .
and i want to show that . click on the audio link below to hear ingo metzmacher discuss the series " who 's afraid of 20th century music ?

his aim is to translate music for his audiences . dw-world.de : mr. metzmacher , the history of dso -lrb- deutsches symphonieorchester berlin -rrb- is closely linked to germany 's history .
however , you are the orchestra 's first german principal conductor .
does that fact have special meaning to you ? ingo metzmacher : actually the orchestra was founded by the americans just after the war in 1946-47 .
it 's also interesting to know that it 's linked to the time just after the war when the americans , english , french and russians really tried to give germany a chance to rebuild .
they founded this orchestra for their radio station . for me , the orchestra represents the newborn germany after the second world war .
they 've had a wonderful line of chief conductors since then , but i 'm the first german .
i 've lived for maybe ten years in belgium and holland , so i think i also have a european or international background .
i feel very german , but within europe and within the world . do you think the orchestra 's unique history has an impact on its role today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metzmacher is also active as a pianist it should have a more important role .
it 's called the german symphony orchestra berlin , so i would like for it to be even more representative of the country and its culture .
also , we have more than 20 nationalities in the orchestra .
it really represents the international germany that we have today - especially in berlin .
there 's been a big change in germany and i think that this very young orchestra can show that to the world . this is your second season with dso .
what are your goals for your time with the orchestra ? i would like to strengthen the role i just described and , on the other hand , i would like to maintain the very high quality of playing .
during my time here , i have a project in mind - to look after the " german soul " in music .
that means : i 'm interested in the special relationship of the german culture to music .
major composers were born in the german-speaking world .
when you look at germany , with all its theaters and orchestras , its cultural landscape is unique in the world .
i think it represents the deep roots , which we have as germans , of music and theater . i think part of the reason is germany 's geographical position in the middle of europe .
it 's always been confronted by influences from all sides .
and the culture was always able to adopt the good parts of what came into the country .
you can see that , during the time when germany decided not to take in anything from outside but just to concentrate on the german roots , it completely failed .
it was a disaster .
i think the richness of the german culture is due to the fact that it always took in what came from outside . you 're known for your interest in modern and contemporary music .
how did this interest develop ? it came when i was maybe 20 years old .
i discovered the world of modern music for me .
i come from a very traditional , classical / romantic background .
my father was a musician and , for him , music was a kind of holy world .
i did n't believe so much in that when i grew up .
and it was very interesting for me to discover that there was a modern world of music - starting , actually , in 1909 .
since then , music for me has been a wide open field which i 've tried to discover for myself . how do you convey that to audiences ? i 've written a book ; i 've done hundreds of introductions before concerts ; i sometimes speak openly on the stage ; i do these casual concerts in berlin where i explain music to people .
after all , i do n't think it 's so difficult to explain music .
i think you just have to find the right words to describe what 's really happening .
you have to find a way to translate it .
that 's something that interests me a lot - trying to translate my understanding of music into a language with words .
that ’ s not easy because when you listen to the music you should forget the words again and try to understand the language that has no words . bildunterschrift : the deutsches symphonieorchester as you mentioned , you 've lived in several countries .
where do you feel at home ? i 've started to feel at home in berlin .
i always thought i would , but it took me longer than i thought .
my head told me berlin was the place i always wanted to be .
since i was young , i have longed for a german capital , which we didn ’ t have at the time .
when i was in london or paris i thought , what a pity that germany does n't have one like that - a real big city where everything comes together .
since reunification , i think berlin is growing into a major international capital .
so i was very thrilled to come here .
but it 's also not easy here .
it takes time to get used to it . what 's not easy about berlin ? it 's tough , especially in my field of music .
we have seven orchestras in this city ; we have three operas ; we have the berlin philharmonic as a major player - not only in germany but in the world .
it 's tough to find your audience , to create your own profile , and to convince the politicians they should give you the money you need . how does the dso try to create its own profile ? we are the only orchestra in town that has a theme .
we have the german soul .
we have 1909 .
we have a programmatic plan - that music has more to say than only to be beautiful .
i strongly believe in the content of music , although it has no words .

the three parties of germany 's grand coalition have agreed on a fresh round of stimulus measures worth billions to protect the weakening economy .
but some already worry the package will not offer the help that 's needed . in talks held late into the night on monday , jan .
12 , the governing parties committed to a huge wave of spending likely to inject up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 66 billion -rrb- into europe 's biggest economy , party officials said . in addition , the federal government would set up a massive fund to give loans and guarantees to struggling industries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : csu 's seehofer got the tax cuts he was wishing for the " credit and guarantee fund " will reportedly be worth 100 billion euros .
officials said its name would be a way of stressing that it would not be a vehicle for taking industries into government ownership . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have been wrangling for weeks with merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- over the package , with each of them eager to include pet policies in the huge surge of state spending . change of heart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel agreed to a ' credit and guarantee ' fund merkel initially resisted vast government spending as an antidote to recession , as advocated by the french and british governments , but a stream of bad economic data and the prospect of a general election this september changed the government 's mind . the round of emergency spending , spread over two years , would be the biggest since modern germany was established in 1949 . the broad terms were jointly announced by the chiefs of the three governing-party caucuses in the bundestag parliament : volker kauder of the cdu , peter ramsauer of the csu and peter struck of the spd . they said the cuts in corporate and income taxes , to take effect on july 1 , would inject 9 billion euros into the german economy , with the income tax scale beginning at 14 instead of 15 percent . a cut in state health-insurance premiums for german workers would cost a further 9 billion euros .
families with children are to receive a one-off bonus benefit of 100 euros per child , they added . " wrecking bonus " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can a " wrecking bonus " spur new-car sales ?
massive new government investment in education , highways and other projects would total 18 billion euros . sources said the six-hour meeting also produced agreement to grant a " wrecking bonus " to new-car buyers who send their old cars to the crusher .
the car industry has been complaining about slumping sales in germany . the agreement also includes cuts in health insurance contributions in order to put more cash in shoppers ' pockets , and simpler rules on creating temporary jobs , the officials said after the meeting .
" all in all this is a package that will help us to get through this economic crisis and keep jobs , " volker kauder , head of the cdu in parliament , told reporters late monday .
but some economists are worried the package will not help germany where it needs it most : its massive , but struggling , export sector .
the global downturn has significantly damaged the foreign demand for german goods . merkel to bring details merkel was scheduled to brief opposition parties early tuesday , jan .
13 .
she will then detail the package at a news conference , joined at the microphone by foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who is the social democratic party 's nominee for the chancellorship at this year 's election , and bavarian premier horst seehofer . the tax cuts marked a victory for the csu , the bavaria-only party that seehofer leads .
it had repeatedly attacked merkel 's insistence on balancing the budget before reforming tax scales . while the three-year-old grand coalition of germany 's main parties has become more fractious as the general election nears , there was broad agreement before the meeting that action against the nation 's economic woes was urgently needed . deepening recession a slew of fresh data has underscored that a deepening recession is taking hold in europe 's biggest economy .
figures last week showed a dramatic 10.6-percent plunge in german exports in november along with a hefty drop in factory orders and a bigger-than-forecast rise in december unemployment . leading german companies have already announced plans for layoffs and production cuts as global economic growth spirals downwards . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but not all experts are convinced it can help beat the downturn . germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel was full of praise for the initiative , being touted as a " pact for germany , " which her coalition passed on tuesday , january 11 . merkel told reporters her government was doing " everything possible so that germany does not just overcome this crisis , but emerges from it stronger . " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier from merkel 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , said the german package of investments , government loans and hand-outs , and tax cuts , compared favorably with stimulus measures taken by other nations . " when i look around europe , i ca n't see anyone else doing more or taking better steps than we are , " he told reporters . the package has come after mounting criticism that the government was being too hesitant in combating the economic decline prompted by the global financial crisis . soon enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " konjunktur " is german for " economic growth , " but not everyone likes this package but leading private-sector economists in germany disagreed about whether the so-called pact was all government ministers were claiming . the chief economist of commerzbank , joerg kraemer , was impressed . " no economic program in the world can stave off a recession , but the measures will no doubt contribute to stabilizing the economy in the second half of the year , " he told dpa news agency . the head economist at the bank of america , holger schmieding , has a different assessment . " this may only kick in late this year and thus do nothing to help us when the recession is at its worst - over the current quarter and the nest , " schmieding told reuters news agency . but others thought that the likely length of the slump would give the package time to work . " the economic downturn will last so long that the full effect of the stimulus measures are bound to be felt , " bhf bank chief economist uwe angenendt told dpa , and deka bank chief economist also offered that agency pretty much the same analysis . debts and more debts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german car sales are currently in a deep freeze the association of german taxpayers is considerable less happy with the package , which will run up the federal deficit . in an official statement , association president karl heinz daeke called the measures a " smokescreen to distract from -lsb- the absence of -rsb- true tax relief .

" test your strength " appears to be a midway favorite at the carnival that is this year 's recession , but the first time the german government swung the hammer , the needle did n't make it past " weakling . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now , government leaders - who admit their earlier tries were insufficient - have stepped right up and bought themselves another chance .
they 've decided to go whole hog , pledging 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 66 billion -rrb- over the next two years to help take the edge off the recession and spark the german economy .
education gets an ' a ' ...
but someone aiming to give the government marks for its various efforts would have to award grades running from an " a " all the way down to a " d. "
the investment program alone , which mainly commands spending in educational institutions , is worth some 18 billion euros .
it is brave , on-the-mark - and worthy of an " a. "
states and municipalities have been putting off investment for ages ; now they can get to work .
all they have to do is pull out their long-finished investment plans and dust them off . which means the plans can be put into effect quickly , thus providing an actual economic boost .
in an effort to give citizens and businesses a break and to boost consumer spending , the state lowered the marginal tax rate and raised the limit for non-taxable income .
it means there will be some nine billion fewer tax euros in government coffers . ... but the ' wrecking premium ' earns a ' d ' but lowering the marginal tax rate , and limiting so-called " cold progression " - an unfortunate system whereby the state increases its percentage claim on income in lockstep with an income increase - was long overdue .
it 's a measure that should have been taken even without an economic crisis , and so it only deserves a " c. "
the planned reduction in insurance contributions is likely to provide immediate relief not only to businesses and taxpayers , but also to retirees and low-income households .
it will cost the state another nine billion euros - and earns an " a " even though it is clear that the state can not continue to prop up the ailing social system at this level .
on the other hand , hotly debated protective measures for businesses are problematic .
in this case , the financial aid is aimed at sluggish bank lending , but not at the capital investments of the state in businesses , thus taking the touchy subject of state investment in business off the table .
but if companies take the government up on its guarantees , it could certainly prove to be expensive for the state .
ultimately , then , it is impossible to assign a grade to this move .
other measures are worthy of a " d " at best .
giving 100 euros per child to each citizen is unlikely to spark much consumer spending , and a " wrecking premium " for cars that are more than nine years old could give a leg up to the car industry - but which one ?
the french and japanese could profit as well as the germans on that account .
bold - or just brash ?
taken all together , though , the whole package can be labeled a courageous effort .
not only because it is the largest economic-stimulus package post-war germany has yet to create , but also because the state is narrowing its tax base - and thereby risks losing some of its negotiating status .
it is courageous because it is the first time germany has been willing to clearly breach the 40-billion-euro debt record set in 1996 , and thereby cross the debt-ratio line set by the maastricht treaty .
it is courageous in its self-confidence and belief in a better future .
but inordinate courage is often shown by those who are desperate .
time will tell just what kind of courage it took to strike this deal .

the chief prosecutor used his closing arguments to accuse mr fujimori of directing a dirty war against suspected maoist shining path guerrillas .
mr fujimori is accused of authorising the killing of 25 people in two massacres .
he denies the charges .
the former president faces up to 30 years in jail if convicted .
his defence lawyers maintain he was kept in the dark about clandestine killings by a death squad known as la colina , and never approved of the counter-insurgency methods .
autocratic or heroic ?
the televised year-long trial - which has been suspended several times due to mr fujimori 's poor health - has divided peruvians , says the bbc 's dan collyns in lima .

but many others view his 10-year presidency as autocratic and extremely corrupt , says our correspondent .
the leak of videotapes showing his de facto intelligence chief , vladimiro montesinos , bribing opposition politicians and television executives in 2000 threw mr fujimori 's government into disrepute .
he resigned as president while in tokyo and stayed there for the next five years before flying to chile in 2005 where he was arrested .
two years later he was extradited to peru .
summary executions it is alleged la colina was under the direct command of the peruvian president .
in 1991 , the death squad raided a barbecue in a poor suburb of lima known as barrios altos and killed 15 people .
the following year , they kidnapped nine students and a professor .
they were taken away from the campus and summarily executed .
their remains were later found in an unmarked grave .
mr fujimori is also charged with ordering the illegal detention and interrogation of a prominent journalist , gustavo gorriti , and businessman samuel dyer , in 1992 .

home secretary jacqui smith wants anti- gang injunctions , following a legal battle over a similar move last year .
birmingham city council sought to help the police with civil injunctions - but judges ruled them illegal .
the plan emerges as a think tank report says ministers could do more to combat gun and knife violence .
in 2007 , birmingham city council sought injunctions against alleged members of the self-styled " birmingham 's most wanted " gang , in an attempt to curtail violence in the city .
we were able to prevent certain individuals from going in to particular areas or from wearing certain items of clothing which linked them to particular gangs ayoub khan , birmingham city councillor two men , marnie shafi and tyrone ellis , were banned from meeting gang members or entering parts of the city .
they were told they could no longer wear the colour green , used to distinguish the group from rivals .
the council sought the injunctions in the civil courts because it had proved too difficult to gather hard evidence pinning anti-social or criminal behaviour to gang membership .
the case against the men was based on police intelligence , rather than the higher standard of proof required for an anti-social behaviour order -lrb- asbo -rrb- or conviction by a jury .
but the court of appeal overruled the city , saying the council had misused its powers .
judges said the council should have sought asbos based on proper proof of wrongdoing .
a home office spokesman said then home secretary had " long supported local injunctions " and would soon introduce legislation giving police and councils powers to seek them against gang members .
the bbc understands the proposals will be included in the forthcoming policing bill .
dedicated police the legislation is expected to allow councils to seek banning orders on a lower standard of evidence than required for anti-social behaviour orders .
ayoub khan , of birmingham city council , said it had pioneered civil injunctions because officials could not gather evidence to a criminal standard of proof needed for an asbo .
" through these injunctions , we were able to prevent certain individuals from going in to particular areas or from wearing certain items of clothing which linked them to particular gangs , " said mr khan .
" we were able to reduce that and restore some order and reduce gang-related activity in birmingham . "
the announcement comes as policy exchange , a think tank , said the uk should learn from successful moves to combat gang-related activity in the us , canada and the netherlands .
the right-of-centre body said parts of some cities had become virtual " no-go " zones because of gang crime - and that the uk was lacking the joined-up approach seen abroad .
but deputy assistant commissioner alf hitchcock , the association of chief police officer 's lead on knife crime , said that the key policies from abroad cited by the think tank had now been introduced in the uk 's tackling knives action plan .
he said that knife amnesties had not shown to be ineffective by themselves .
but the current wider knives strategy , which included focusing on the background of young offenders , was doing some good .
" there is a perception , by some people , that things are getting worse and that is not wholly born out by the statistics , " said dac hitchcock .
" but that 's clearly people 's perceptions - and that feeling is as important in terms of public confidence and community confidence , as the reality of the numbers . "

the proposals to boost achievement among disadvantaged pupils are part of the government 's white paper on increasing social mobility .
about 6,000 new teachers in 500 of the most challenging secondary schools will be offered the " golden handcuffs " .
prime minister gordon brown promised to help people " make the most of their potential throughout their lives " .
introducing the new opportunities , fair chances for the future proposals , mr brown said that " a downturn is no time to slow down investment " .
he said that the government 's drive to raise standards in schools and to provide support for children in their early years would " lay the foundations of true social mobility and social justice " .
disadvantage the white paper suggests that the lowest achieving schools , often serving the most deprived communities , should have extra money to retain the most effective teachers .
inner-city schools have often suffered from high staff turnover and a reliance on temporary teachers - and the proposals suggest a £ 10,000 loyalty payment in return for three years ' service in the same school .

home secretary jacqui smith wants anti- gang injunctions , following a legal battle over a similar move last year .
birmingham city council sought to help the police with civil injunctions - but judges ruled them illegal .
the plan emerges as a think tank report says ministers could do more to combat gun and knife violence .
in 2007 , birmingham city council sought injunctions against alleged members of the self-styled " birmingham 's most wanted " gang , in an attempt to curtail violence in the city . "
we were able to prevent certain individuals from going in to particular areas or from wearing certain items of clothing which linked them to particular gangs " ayoub khan , birmingham city councillor two men , marnie shafi and tyrone ellis , were banned from meeting gang members or entering parts of the city .
they were told they could no longer wear the colour green , used to distinguish the group from rivals .
the council sought the injunctions in the civil courts because it had proved too difficult to gather hard evidence pinning anti-social or criminal behaviour to gang membership .
the case against the men was based on police intelligence , rather than the higher standard of proof required for an anti-social behaviour order -lrb- asbo -rrb- or conviction by a jury .
but the court of appeal overruled the city , saying the council had misused its powers .
judges said the council should have sought asbos based on proper proof of wrongdoing .
a home office spokesman said then home secretary had " long supported local injunctions " and would soon introduce legislation giving police and councils powers to seek them against gang members .
the bbc understands the proposals will be included in the forthcoming policing bill .
dedicated police the legislation is expected to allow councils to seek banning orders on a lower standard of evidence than required for anti-social behaviour orders .
ayoub khan , of birmingham city council , said it had pioneered civil injunctions because officials could not gather evidence to a criminal standard of proof needed for an asbo .
" through these injunctions , we were able to prevent certain individuals from going in to particular areas or from wearing certain items of clothing which linked them to particular gangs , " said mr khan .
" we were able to reduce that and restore some order and reduce gang-related activity in birmingham . "
the announcement comes as policy exchange , a think tank , said the uk should learn from successful moves to combat gang-related activity in the us , canada and the netherlands .
the right-of-centre body said parts of some cities had become virtual " no-go " zones because of gang crime - and that the uk was lacking the joined-up approach seen abroad .
but deputy assistant commissioner alf hitchcock , the association of chief police officer 's lead on knife crime , said that the key policies from abroad cited by the think tank had now been introduced in the uk 's tackling knives action plan .
he said that knife amnesties had not shown to be ineffective by themselves .
but the current wider knives strategy , which included focusing on the background of young offenders , was doing some good .
" there is a perception , by some people , that things are getting worse and that is not wholly born out by the statistics , " said dac hitchcock .
" but that 's clearly people 's perceptions - and that feeling is as important in terms of public confidence and community confidence , as the reality of the numbers . "

the proposals also emphasise the importance of support for children in their early years - promising £ 57m towards the longer term ambition to " make a free early learning and childcare place available to all two-year-olds " .
there are also measures intended to offer training , against the background of uncertainty about jobs - including 35,000 extra apprenticeship places and a threefold increase in the availability of career development loans , which will be available to 45,000 people .
a £ 500 training allowance will be available for carers wanting to return to work .
the conservatives ' skills spokesman , david willetts , said that a barrier to social mobility was the lack of an effective careers service , which could provide advice to disadvantaged pupils to help them achieve their potential .
" the careers service , which used to be so important , has been dismantled under this government and we are committed to putting it back together , " said mr willetts .
' tinkering ' liberal democrat schools ' spokesman , david laws , dismissed the plans as “ tinkering with a system which is in need of real reform " .
gordon brown launched his plans with businessman levi roots " ministers need to reform the unfair funding system so that schools in the most challenging areas get more cash to attract and , crucially , keep good teachers , " said mr laws .
teachers ' unions also voiced doubts about the effectiveness of the financial incentives being proposed .
the national union of teachers warned that such cash bonuses might only have a " minor effect " .
spending money on cutting class sizes might produce a more long term improvement in performance , said the union 's acting general secretary , christine blower .
association of school and college leaders head dr john dunford said : " while the £ 10,000 golden handcuff will be useful for the most challenging schools to recruit more excellent teachers , research shows that it is intervention at the earliest stage in a child 's life that does most to improve its life chances and so increase social mobility .
" in particular , parenting classes with families most at risk should be the highest priority . "
chris keates , head of the nasuwt teaching union , said : " a £ 10,000 golden handcuffs offer is no substitute for a package of sustained support and reward for all teachers in these schools , particularly those who have already given years of dedicated service and commitment . "

the proposals to boost achievement among disadvantaged pupils are part of the government 's white paper on increasing social mobility .
about 6,000 new teachers in 500 of the most challenging secondary schools will be offered the " golden handcuffs " .
prime minister gordon brown promised to help people " make the most of their potential throughout their lives " .
introducing the new opportunities , fair chances for the future proposals , mr brown said that " a downturn is no time to slow down investment " .
he said that the government 's drive to raise standards in schools and to provide support for children in their early years would " lay the foundations of true social mobility and social justice " .
disadvantage the white paper suggests that the lowest achieving schools , often serving the most deprived communities , should have extra money to retain the most effective teachers .

inner-city schools have often suffered from high staff turnover and a reliance on temporary teachers - and the proposals suggest a £ 10,000 loyalty payment in return for three years ' service in the same school .
this will be available to the " national challenge " schools , identified as those in which less than 30 % of pupils achieve the benchmark of five good gcses including english and maths and those with more than 30 % of pupils on free school meals .
as part of the effort to " break the link between disadvantage and achievement " , the white paper also calls for statutory targets for local authorities to improve the performance of pupils eligible for free school meals .
the proposals also emphasise the importance of support for children in their early years - promising £ 57m towards the longer term ambition to " make a free early learning and childcare place available to all two-year-olds " .
there are also measures intended to offer training , against the background of uncertainty about jobs - including 35,000 extra apprenticeship places and a threefold increase in the availability of career development loans , which will be available to 45,000 people .
a £ 500 training allowance will be available for carers wanting to return to work .
the conservatives ' skills spokesman , david willetts , said that a barrier to social mobility was the lack of an effective careers service , which could provide advice to disadvantaged pupils to help them achieve their potential .
" the careers service , which used to be so important , has been dismantled under this government and we are committed to putting it back together , " said mr willetts .
' tinkering ' liberal democrat schools ' spokesman , david laws , dismissed the plans as “ tinkering with a system which is in need of real reform " .
gordon brown launched his plans with businessman levi roots " ministers need to reform the unfair funding system so that schools in the most challenging areas get more cash to attract and , crucially , keep good teachers , " said mr laws .
teachers ' unions also voiced doubts about the effectiveness of the financial incentives being proposed .
the national union of teachers warned that such cash bonuses might only have a " minor effect " .
spending money on cutting class sizes might produce a more long term improvement in performance , said the union 's acting general secretary , christine blower .
association of school and college leaders head dr john dunford said : " while the £ 10,000 golden handcuff will be useful for the most challenging schools to recruit more excellent teachers , research shows that it is intervention at the earliest stage in a child 's life that does most to improve its life chances and so increase social mobility .
" in particular , parenting classes with families most at risk should be the highest priority . "
chris keates , head of the nasuwt teaching union , said : " a £ 10,000 golden handcuffs offer is no substitute for a package of sustained support and reward for all teachers in these schools , particularly those who have already given years of dedicated service and commitment . "

heritage minister alun ffred jones announced awards ranging from £ 7,500 to £ 100,000 .
the grade ii-listed former british steel offices at ebbw vale were awarded the largest grant of £ 100,000 .
but friends of the newport transporter bridge , which faces a £ 2m repair bill , said they were disappointed with the £ 75,000 the project has been awarded .
from the total of £ 385,247 , £ 75,000 has also been offered to develop land around foley house , a grade ii-listed building in the centre of haverfordwest , pembrokeshire .
i do n't think the people of wales , including the heritage minister , realise what we 've got anne gatehouse , friends of the newport transporter bridge the heritage minister said : " the grant offers are for a wide range of historic buildings across wales , including many important aspects of our industrial heritage , and will ensure that some of our most important buildings are maintained for the enjoyment of future generations . "
newport 's transporter bridge , which celebrated its centenary in 2006 , has been shut since december 2008 .
in august , councillor david atwell , the newport council cabinet member for transport , highways and engineering , estimated that the final bill for the restoration of the bridge would top £ 2m .
the council has said it hopes the bridge will reopen in time for the 2010 ryder cup hosted near the city .
buildings offered grants former british steel offices , ebbw vale - £ 100,000 transporter bridge , newport - £ 75,000 land at foley house , haverfordwest - £ 75,000 the record office , hawarden - £ 42,500 iron bridge , newport - £ 30,000 treberfydd tudor house , llangasty , nr brecon - £ 29,081 bethesda welsh congregational chapel , llangennech , llanelli - £ 14,916 guild house , tenby - £ 11,250 south sea wall , pembroke - £ 7,500 the friends of newport transporter bridge , a registered charity dedicated to preserving the structure , said it was disappointed with the £ 75,000 offered .
chairman anne gatehouse said : " it 's not very much , is it ?
for such an icon as the transporter bridge , the only one of its type in wales .
" i think that the welsh assembly government should be more concerned about it being brought back up to scratch and opened for the thousands of visitors who want to come and see it .
" there are only eight -lsb- such bridges -rsb- left in the world and for wales to have one of them is quite something .
" i do n't think the people of wales , including the heritage minister , realise what we 've got . "
mr jones also announced the appointment of two new members to the historic buildings advisory council for wales , which advises the assembly government on these grants .
julian orbach , an architectural historian who lives in newport , pembrokeshire and michael garner , a conservation architect from llandrindod wells , powys , have already joined the advisory group .
alun ffred jones jones said : " we have a rich and varied built heritage in wales and it is important that the assembly government has advice of the highest quality in assessing our historic buildings and in recommending what steps might be taken to ensure their conservation and restoration .
" julian orbach and michael garner both have extensive and valuable experience and i am sure their expertise will make a vital contribution to the work of the historic buildings advisory council . "

in august , councillor david atwell , the newport council cabinet member for transport , highways and engineering , estimated that the final bill for the restoration of the bridge would top £ 2m .
the council has said it hopes the bridge will reopen in time for the 2010 ryder cup hosted near the city .
buildings offered grants former british steel offices , ebbw vale - £ 100,000 transporter bridge , newport - £ 75,000 land at foley house , haverfordwest - £ 75,000 the record office , hawarden - £ 42,500 iron bridge , newport - £ 30,000 treberfydd tudor house , llangasty , nr brecon - £ 29,081 bethesda welsh congregational chapel , llangennech , llanelli - £ 14,916 guild house , tenby - £ 11,250 south sea wall , pembroke - £ 7,500 the friends of newport transporter bridge , a registered charity dedicated to preserving the structure , said it was disappointed with the £ 75,000 offered .
chairman anne gatehouse said : " it 's not very much , is it ?
for such an icon as the transporter bridge , the only one of its type in wales .
" i think that the welsh assembly government should be more concerned about it being brought back up to scratch and opened for the thousands of visitors who want to come and see it .
" there are only eight -lsb- such bridges -rsb- left in the world and for wales to have one of them is quite something .
" i do n't think the people of wales , including the heritage minister , realise what we 've got . "
mr jones also announced the appointment of two new members to the historic buildings advisory council for wales , which advises the assembly government on these grants .
julian orbach , an architectural historian who lives in newport , pembrokeshire and michael garner , a conservation architect from llandrindod wells , powys , have already joined the advisory group .
alun ffred jones jones said : " we have a rich and varied built heritage in wales and it is important that the assembly government has advice of the highest quality in assessing our historic buildings and in recommending what steps might be taken to ensure their conservation and restoration .
" julian orbach and michael garner both have extensive and valuable experience and i am sure their expertise will make a vital contribution to the work of the historic buildings advisory council . "

exports in december were down 2.8 % from the same time last year , a bigger decline than november 's 2.2 % drop , the china daily said .
the numbers provided fresh evidence of a serious trade slump that has caused a wave of factory closures and staff layoffs , analysts said .
the communist leadership has expressed fears of social unrest as economic problems worsen .
the bbc 's correspondent in shanghai , chris hogg , said that china 's economy relies on domestic demand for its goods and services more than any other country in asia .
only around 30 % of the economic activity here is dependent on exports , suggesting that problems in the export sector are affecting less than a third of the economy .
trade surplus december imports fell even more sharply , declining 21.3 % , the china daily reported .
that was a bigger decline than november 's 17.9 % drop .
the global economic downturn is hitting china 's growth with exports in december worth $ 111.2 billion , and imports worth $ 72.2 billion , that made december 's trade surplus $ 39 billion .
that is the country 's second highest trade surplus ever , just short of november 's record $ 40.1 billion .
our correspondent adds that the huge decline in imports is partly due to the slowdown in exports .
more than half of china 's exports are made up of goods which are simply assembled here with components imported from overseas , so as exports drop , the need for those components falls .
steep falls in world commodity and energy prices make it cheaper for china to import them and that again helps to reduce the overall import total .
taken together these figures are more evidence that economic activity is slowing , but not necessarily that that slowdown was much greater last month than it had been the month before .
according to jp morgan , december 's export decline was the sharpest since april 1999 .
" export growth is likely to be flat in 2009 , with negative year-over-year growth in the near-term , " said jing ulrich , jp morgan 's chairwoman of china equities , in a report .
no immunity when the global financial meltdown began to bite , some commentators looked to the seemingly unstoppable export engine of china for relief .
a series of numbers released in recent months have suggested that china is no more immune to worldwide trade problems than any other large economy , analysts said .
with japan , the us and europe now in recession , china 's heavily trade-dependent economy is expected to harder hit through the coming year .
predictions by the world bank of growth of 7.5 % in 2009 , if proved true , would be the lowest recorded since 1990 .

it was revealed ahead of an assembly debate on keeping rural schools open .
the motion calls for rural school closures to be halted until after a " sustainable schools " policy is agreed and implemented .
caitríona ruane revealed the document 's final draft on monday , something which the sponsors of the debate described as " very strange timing " .
they say it looks like an attempt to pre-empt discussion .
an early draft of the policy was published for consultation in july and , like this one , contained six criteria on which to decide if a school should stay open .
ms ruane said : " these cover the strength of links to the community , educational experience of children , enrolment trends , school leadership and management , accessibility and financial position .
" schools will be reviewed against these criteria on a case-by-case basis to ensure all relevant facts , including local circumstances , are considered in the best interests of the education of our children and young people . "
as in the bain report of 2006 , it sets minimum numbers of pupils at primary and secondary schools , both rural and urban .
ms ruane insisted it was " not an agenda to close small schools " .
however , alarm bells are likely to ring if a school fails to meet a number of the criteria .

it was revealed ahead of an assembly debate on keeping rural schools open .
the motion calls for rural school closures to be halted until after a " sustainable schools " policy is agreed and implemented .
caitríona ruane revealed the document 's final draft on monday , something which the sponsors of the debate described as " very strange timing " .
they say it looks like an attempt to pre-empt discussion .
an early draft of the policy was published for consultation in july and , like this one , contained six criteria on which to decide if a school should stay open .
ms ruane said : " these cover the strength of links to the community , educational experience of children , enrolment trends , school leadership and management , accessibility and financial position .
" schools will be reviewed against these criteria on a case-by-case basis to ensure all relevant facts , including local circumstances , are considered in the best interests of the education of our children and young people . "
as in the bain report of 2006 , it sets minimum numbers of pupils at primary and secondary schools , both rural and urban .
ms ruane insisted it was " not an agenda to close small schools " .
however , alarm bells are likely to ring if a school fails to meet a number of the criteria .

the findings may help explain previous work linking hrt to an increased risk of memory loss and dementia .
a team led by researchers at wake forest university carried out brain scans on 1,400 women aged 71 to 89 who took part in an earlier hrt trial .
but uk experts said the study , published in neurology , had flaws .
our findings suggest that hormone therapy in older post-menopausal women has a negative effect on brain structures important in maintaining normal memory functioning dr susan resnick us national institute on ageing significant numbers of women take hormones to reduce the unpleasant symptoms of the menopause , such as hot flushes , mood changes , and thinning of the bones .
however , research has linked hrt to a raised risk of some forms of cancer .
the latest study found two key areas of the brain involved in thinking and memory were smaller in women who had taken hrt than in those who had been given a " dummy " placebo pill .
brain volume was 2.37 cubic centimetres lower in the frontal lobe and 0.10 cubic centimetres lower in the hippocampus .
limitations however , the researchers admit they were unable to carry out brain scans before the women began taking hrt .
and the results suggest shrinkage was most pronounced in women who may already have started to develop memory problems before they started taking hormones .
lead researcher dr susan resnick , from the us national institute on ageing , said : " our findings suggest that hormone therapy in older post-menopausal women has a negative effect on brain structures important in maintaining normal memory functioning .
" however , this negative effect was most pronounced in women who already may have had some memory problems before using hormone therapy , suggesting that the therapy may have accelerated a neurodegenerative disease process that had already begun . "
older women dr david sturdee , president of the international menopause society , said 49 % of the women in the study were over 70 .
in contrast , women in the uk are typically offered hrt between the ages of 45 and 60 .
he said brain shrinkage among women of a relatively advanced age was not a surprising finding .
" the benefits -lrb- of hrt -rrb- are still way in excess of the risks . "
hrt is known to increase the risk of a stroke , and it had been assumed that women 's memory might be affected by the build up of damage caused by " silent " strokes .
however , researchers found no evidence of an increase in the volume of such damage among women taking hrt .
the forms of hrt examined in the latest study contain a variety of oestrogens referred to as conjugated equine oestrogens .

the findings may help explain previous work linking hrt to an increased risk of memory loss and dementia .
a team led by researchers at wake forest university carried out brain scans on 1,400 women aged 71 to 89 who took part in an earlier hrt trial .
but uk experts said the study , published in neurology , had flaws .
our findings suggest that hormone therapy in older post-menopausal women has a negative effect on brain structures important in maintaining normal memory functioning dr susan resnick us national institute on ageing significant numbers of women take hormones to reduce the unpleasant symptoms of the menopause , such as hot flushes , mood changes , and thinning of the bones .
however , research has linked hrt to a raised risk of some forms of cancer .
the latest study found two key areas of the brain involved in thinking and memory were smaller in women who had taken hrt than in those who had been given a " dummy " placebo pill .
brain volume was 2.37 cubic centimetres lower in the frontal lobe and 0.10 cubic centimetres lower in the hippocampus .
limitations however , the researchers admit they were unable to carry out brain scans before the women began taking hrt .
and the results suggest shrinkage was most pronounced in women who may already have started to develop memory problems before they started taking hormones .
lead researcher dr susan resnick , from the us national institute on ageing , said : " our findings suggest that hormone therapy in older post-menopausal women has a negative effect on brain structures important in maintaining normal memory functioning .
" however , this negative effect was most pronounced in women who already may have had some memory problems before using hormone therapy , suggesting that the therapy may have accelerated a neurodegenerative disease process that had already begun . "
older women dr david sturdee , president of the international menopause society , said 49 % of the women in the study were over 70 .
in contrast , women in the uk are typically offered hrt between the ages of 45 and 60 .
he said brain shrinkage among women of a relatively advanced age was not a surprising finding .
" the benefits -lrb- of hrt -rrb- are still way in excess of the risks . "
hrt is known to increase the risk of a stroke , and it had been assumed that women 's memory might be affected by the build up of damage caused by " silent " strokes .
however , researchers found no evidence of an increase in the volume of such damage among women taking hrt .
the forms of hrt examined in the latest study contain a variety of oestrogens referred to as conjugated equine oestrogens .

brain volume was 2.37 cubic centimetres lower in the frontal lobe and 0.10 cubic centimetres lower in the hippocampus .
limitations however , the researchers admit they were unable to carry out brain scans before the women began taking hrt .
and the results suggest shrinkage was most pronounced in women who may already have started to develop memory problems before they started taking hormones .
lead researcher dr susan resnick , from the us national institute on ageing , said : " our findings suggest that hormone therapy in older post-menopausal women has a negative effect on brain structures important in maintaining normal memory functioning .
" however , this negative effect was most pronounced in women who already may have had some memory problems before using hormone therapy , suggesting that the therapy may have accelerated a neurodegenerative disease process that had already begun . "
older women dr david sturdee , president of the international menopause society , said 49 % of the women in the study were over 70 .
in contrast , women in the uk are typically offered hrt between the ages of 45 and 60 .
he said brain shrinkage among women of a relatively advanced age was not a surprising finding .
" the benefits -lrb- of hrt -rrb- are still way in excess of the risks . "
hrt is known to increase the risk of a stroke , and it had been assumed that women 's memory might be affected by the build up of damage caused by " silent " strokes .
however , researchers found no evidence of an increase in the volume of such damage among women taking hrt .
the forms of hrt examined in the latest study contain a variety of oestrogens referred to as conjugated equine oestrogens .

a team led by researchers at wake forest university carried out brain scans on 1,400 women aged 71 to 89 who took part in an earlier hrt trial .
but uk experts said the study , published in neurology , had flaws . "

nearly 30 rockets or mortars were fired on israel from gaza on monday .
early on tuesday , the 18th day of the conflict , israeli troops advanced in the southern and eastern suburbs of gaza city , backed by artillery and helicopters .
the western areas of the city came under shellfire from israeli gunboats .
the israeli military has denied a hamas claim that it had destroyed two israeli tanks .
an army spokesman told the bbc that " more than 60 targets were targeted by iaf -lsb- israeli air force -rsb- " during the night .
but the israeli military announced a three-hour ceasefire starting at 0900 local time -lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- to allow aid lorries into gaza .
the truce also coincides with visits to the territory by un and red cross officials .
also on tuesday , an israeli army patrol in the west bank came under fire from inside jordan , the army said .
no-one was hurt in the incident and the patrol returned fire .
gaza ' not broken ' prime minister ehud olmert said palestinian militants will keep on feeling israel 's " iron fist " as long as hamas fires rockets at israel .
but a senior hamas leader , ismail haniya , said the group was " approaching victory " .
" after 17 days of this foolish war , gaza has not been broken and gaza will not collapse , " he said in a televised address from a secret location in gaza . "

however un officials say he will not be meeting representatives of hamas , and it is not clear whether he will go to gaza itself during his week-long trip .
meanwhile reports suggest diplomatic efforts between egypt and hamas in cairo are progressing .
after meeting egyptian president hosni mubarak , middle east quartet envoy tony blair said the elements were in place for a ceasefire agreement .
" i am hopeful we can put an agreement together but it 's going to have to be worked on very hard and it 's got to be credible , " he told journalists .

there were reports of fierce fighting around gaza city ahead of the daily three-hour truce to allow aid deliveries to gaza .
some israeli reservists are in action on the ground , but the army denied escalating the war to a " third phase " - an all-out push on gaza city and other towns .

israel hopes the scale of its operation will greatly reduce the number of missiles fired from gaza into southern israel , while eroding support for hamas .
as the fighting continued , a spokesman for the charity save the children said it was impossible for aid workers to do their jobs .
