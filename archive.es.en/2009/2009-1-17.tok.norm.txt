but the palestinian militant group hamas said it would continue fighting until israeli troops withdrawal from the gaza strip . olmert said israel 's offensive in the gaza strip had achieved all its objectives and received promises of support from major european powers to help stop the smuggling of weapons into gaza . he told a news conference after the security cabinet voted to cease fire that some goals had been exceeded , hamas had been hit hard and its ability to fire rockets into israel had been severely limited . " at two o 'clock in the morning -lrb- midnight gmt -rrb- we will cease fire but we will continue to be deployed in gaza and its surroundings , " olmert said in a speech after the vote . " we have reached all the goals of the war , and beyond , " he added .
" if our enemies decide to strike and want to carry on then the israeli army will regard itself as free to respond with force . " under the ceasefire plan , israeli troops will remain in the territory with orders to respond if fired upon by palestinian militants . israel will restart military operations in gaza if needed , defense minister ehud barak added .
reporting on the start of the meeting , israel 's channel 10 television said the military commander had recommended concluding the campaign . the declaration could allow israel to conclude its massive offensive without entering into an agreement with the islamist hamas movement , which has ruled gaza since june 2007 and is sworn to the destruction of the jewish state . bildunterschrift : sections of rafah and other cities in the gaza strip have been destroyed hamas vows to fight on a hamas spokesman criticized israel for its unilateral approach . " it is an attempt to pre-empt the egyptian efforts and any other efforts that seek to achieve a withdrawal of the occupying forces , an end to the siege and a ceasefire , " hamas spokesman fawzi barhoum told reuters news agency . he added that hamas would continue to fight the troops left in the coastal strip until the blockade on the gaza strip was lifted . " a unilateral ceasefire does not mean ending the -lrb- israeli -rrb- aggression and ending the siege , " barhoum said in gaza .
" these constitute acts of war and so this will not mean an end to resistance . " a spokesman for palestinian president mahmud abbas said the ceasefire should be followed by a truce and the withdrawal of troops . international community welcomes plan un secretary-general ban ki-moon said he was relieved by the israeli declaration and also urged the jewish state to withdraw all of its troops as soon as possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in the gaza strip continued for 22 days before the israeli ceasefire announcement " i am relieved that the israeli government has decided to cease hostilities as of midnight gmt , " ban told reporters .
" this should be the first step leading to the full withdrawal of israeli troops from gaza . " olmert said hamas ' actions would determine whether israeli troops pull back . " this operation strengthened the deterrence of the state of israel in the face of all those who threaten us , " he said .
" if hamas completely stops its attacks , we will judge at what moment we will leave the gaza strip . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier welcomed the ceasefire and called on hamas to put a stop to all attacks . " this step finally opens a perspective to an end of violence in and around gaza , " he said on saturday .
" as soon as the weapons are silent , all steps must be taken to create a lasting truce .
i will continue to work to make sure germany and the eu support this process . " us secretary of state condoleezza said the us remained " deeply concerned by the suffering of innocent palestinians " and supported immediate international moves to increase flows of assistance into gaza . the united states " expects that all parties will cease attacks and hostile actions immediately , " rice said in a statement .
she also commended egypt for its efforts in reaching a ceasefire . egypt plans summit for sunday olmert 's announcement came after egyptian president hosni mubarak called for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the gaza strip on saturday . " i ask israel today to end its military operations immediately , " mubarak said in an address on state television .
" i call on its leadership for an immediate unconditional ceasefire and a complete withdrawal of israeli troops from the gaza strip . " egypt has organized an international summit on gaza in sharm el-sheikh on sunday , with un head ban , german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy to attend . merkel and sarkozy are scheduled to go to tel aviv after the talks in egypt to meet with olmert , according to german and french government officials . invitations for the summit in the red sea resort have been sent to britain , france , italy , spain and turkey , several european diplomatic sources told the afp news agency on saturday . eu trio ready to quell smuggling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , sarkozy and brown said they would help curb weapons smuggling into gaza earlier saturday , germany , britain and france offered to send naval vessels to the middle east to monitor and prevent weapons smuggling in gaza . the three eu countries " declared our readiness to take a series of measures that would contribute to the end of weapons smuggling into gaza , " according to a joint statement released saturday by merkel , sarkozy and british prime minister gordon brown . " this offer is now on the table , " brown 's spokesman said .
" one of the key areas and blockages about a ceasefire , outside of the rocket attacks , has been concerns about arms smuggling . " while details of the naval assistance were not provided , the three european leaders also expressed their " hope that a lasting ceasefire in gaza would be followed by a new dynamic for an abiding peace in the middle east . " israel was in the fourth week of a military campaign against the palestinian militant group hamas , which currently rules the gaza strip and is considered a terrorist organization by the united states and european union . israeli attacks have killed more than 1,200 palestinians , according to gaza medical officials .

the security cabinet vote would likely take place in the evening , after the end of the jewish sabbath , giving olmert and defense minister ehud barak time to discuss the proposal with their representatives who returned from two trips to cairo in two days .
there has been speculation that israel might opt for a unilateral cessation of hostilities , a move united nations secretary general ban ki-moon had also called for during his mideast tour .
hamas opposed to israeli stipulations khaled meshaal , hamas ' damascus-based political leader , said in doha , at a summit of arab leaders , that his organization would not accept israeli dictates on the ceasefire , and that the militant group " had not suffered a defeat " in the gaza fighting .
representatives of hamas on saturday were to meet with egyptian negotiators to discuss israel 's response to their stipulations .
hamas has offered a renewable one-year truce , on the condition that all israeli troops withdraw within one week and that border crossings between israel and egypt are opened .

foreign minister tzipi livni said friday that an end to the war " does n't have to be in agreement with hamas but rather in arrangements against hamas . "
she was in washington to sign a deal for us help in ensuring hamas no longer smuggles arms to gaza via egypt .
on saturday , hamas official osama abu hemdan warned that the islamist group would fight on if israel orders a unilateral ceasefire in gaza .
attacks continued in the early morning hours .
israeli warplanes reportedly hit about 50 targets during the night , including rocket-launching sites , tunnels under the gaza-egypt border as well as mosques used as points from where militants fired at israel .
israeli security council considers ceasefire olmert 's office on friday said there had been " significant progress " in talks in cairo , where an israeli delegation had been in discussions with egypt 's intelligence chief .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us pledged to help prevent hamas from smuggling arms israel and hamas , the islamist group which rules gaza , do not talk to each other directly but go through cairo , which has been pushing for a ceasefire based on a short-term humanitarian truce , followed by negotiations on a longer-term ceasefire that would include the israeli security concerns and the militants ' demand that the borders be opened .
the security cabinet vote would likely take place in the evening , after the end of the jewish sabbath , giving olmert and defense minister ehud barak time to discuss the proposal with their representatives who returned from two trips to cairo in two days .
there has been speculation that israel might opt for a unilateral cessation of hostilities , a move united nations secretary general ban ki-moon had also called for during his mideast tour .
hamas opposed to israeli stipulations khaled meshaal , hamas ' damascus-based political leader , said in doha , at a summit of arab leaders , that his organization would not accept israeli dictates on the ceasefire , and that the militant group " had not suffered a defeat " in the gaza fighting .
representatives of hamas on saturday were to meet with egyptian negotiators to discuss israel 's response to their stipulations .
hamas has offered a renewable one-year truce , on the condition that all israeli troops withdraw within one week and that border crossings between israel and egypt are opened .

18 , voters in hesse will go to the polls for the second time in 12 months to elect a new parliament .
opinion polls give merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- a comfortable lead over the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , junior partner in an uneasy coalition with the chancellor 's party in berlin .
the election comes as the country finds itself mired in recession , with unemployment rising , production declining and the government forced to pump tens of billions of euros into shoring up the economy .
replacing hesse 's caretaker government it also kicks off what germans are calling a super election year , with voting for five of the country 's 16 regional parliaments as well as elections for a new president in may and a general election on sept .
27 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch has toned down his rhetoric this time around hesse , one of germany 's most prosperous states where the banking center of frankfurt is located , has been administered by a caretaker government under cdu prime minister roland koch since inconclusive elections in january 2008 .
in that vote , the spd , led by andrea ypsilanti , narrowly failed to unseat koch , whose hard-hitting campaign targeting young criminals from ethnic minorities alienated many voters .
ypsilanti , 51 , then tried to topple the premier by forming a parliamentary alliance with the greens , backed by tacit support from the radical left party .
in so doing , she broke a campaign promise not to work with the left , an alliance of former east german communists and disgruntled social democrats from the west .
eroding support for spd this proved too much for four spd rebels , who withdrew their support a day before a crucial vote in parliament on nov .
4 , leaving their party leader without a majority .
ypsilanti was forced to make an embarrassing climbdown and agree to early elections .
since then , voter support for the spd has steadily eroded .
latest opinion polls show its ratings down to between 24 and 25 percent from 36.7 percent in the 2009 election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti came very close ... but lost her support the cdu , on the other hand , has seen its popularity grow to 41-42 percent from 36.8 percent last january .
with its preferred partner the free democrats tipped to win 13 percent , the two would have a comfortable majority in the 110-seat legislature in wiesbaden .
surveys show the greens also running at 13 percent , with the left hovering around the 5 percent needed to gain parliamentary representation , but not enough to from a workable majority with the spd .
koch 's challenger is thorsten schaefer-guembel , 39 , an spd back-bencher who was plucked from obscurity by ypsilanti to fight the election while she remained behind the scenes as party leader .
" he 's just the figure on the car radiator grille while ypsilanti remains firmly in the driving seat , " quipped koch , who has been premier for nearly a decade .
difference in platforms schaefer-guembel has sought to distance himself from his mentor and has put on a brave face when confronted with jokes about his double-barrelled name and thick spectacles .
both the cdu and the spd have pledged to invest more in education and infrastructure projects , but differ on energy policy and an expansion of frankfurt airport , one of europe 's busiest , a move which the spd opposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer-guembel : competitor or puppet ?
koch , 50 , has toned down his fiery rhetoric , concentrating instead on selling himself as a crisis manager at a time of growing economic uncertainty , a move that could make the cdu palatable to the greens if a broader-based coalition is necessary .
a victory for the cdu would give it a boost in confidence in the run-up to the general election after the setback it suffered in a state election in bavaria last september when its christian social union sister party lost its absolute majority .
test for general election ?
while the hesse vote might prove a reliable gauge of the mood of the electorate , leading politicians caution against viewing it as a test for the general election in eight months time .
" voters often leave it until the last moment before deciding which party to support , " said interior minister wolfgang schaeuble . dpa news agency -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the palestinian militant group hamas said it would continue fighting until israeli troops withdrawal from the gaza strip . olmert said israel 's offensive in the gaza strip had achieved all its objectives and received promises of support from major european powers to help stop the smuggling of weapons into gaza . he told a news conference after the security cabinet voted to cease fire that some goals had been exceeded , hamas had been hit hard and its ability to fire rockets into israel had been severely limited . " at two o 'clock in the morning -lrb- midnight gmt -rrb- we will cease fire but we will continue to be deployed in gaza and its surroundings , " olmert said in a speech after the vote . " we have reached all the goals of the war , and beyond , " he added .
" if our enemies decide to strike and want to carry on then the israeli army will regard itself as free to respond with force . " under the ceasefire plan , israeli troops will remain in the territory with orders to respond if fired upon by palestinian militants . israel will restart military operations in gaza if needed , defense minister ehud barak added .
reporting on the start of the meeting , israel 's channel 10 television said the military commander had recommended concluding the campaign . the declaration could allow israel to conclude its massive offensive without entering into an agreement with the islamist hamas movement , which has ruled gaza since june 2007 and is sworn to the destruction of the jewish state . bildunterschrift : sections of rafah and other cities in the gaza strip have been destroyed hamas vows to fight on a hamas spokesman criticized israel for its unilateral approach . " it is an attempt to pre-empt the egyptian efforts and any other efforts that seek to achieve a withdrawal of the occupying forces , an end to the siege and a ceasefire , " hamas spokesman fawzi barhoum told reuters news agency . he added that hamas would continue to fight the troops left in the coastal strip until the blockade on the gaza strip was lifted . " a unilateral ceasefire does not mean ending the -lrb- israeli -rrb- aggression and ending the siege , " barhoum said in gaza .
" these constitute acts of war and so this will not mean an end to resistance . " a spokesman for palestinian president mahmud abbas said the ceasefire should be followed by a truce and the withdrawal of troops . international community welcomes plan un secretary-general ban ki-moon said he was relieved by the israeli declaration and also urged the jewish state to withdraw all of its troops as soon as possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in the gaza strip continued for 22 days before the israeli ceasefire announcement " i am relieved that the israeli government has decided to cease hostilities as of midnight gmt , " ban told reporters .
" this should be the first step leading to the full withdrawal of israeli troops from gaza . " olmert said hamas ' actions would determine whether israeli troops pull back . " this operation strengthened the deterrence of the state of israel in the face of all those who threaten us , " he said .
" if hamas completely stops its attacks , we will judge at what moment we will leave the gaza strip . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier welcomed the ceasefire and called on hamas to put a stop to all attacks . " this step finally opens a perspective to an end of violence in and around gaza , " he said on saturday .
" as soon as the weapons are silent , all steps must be taken to create a lasting truce .
i will continue to work to make sure germany and the eu support this process . " us secretary of state condoleezza said the us remained " deeply concerned by the suffering of innocent palestinians " and supported immediate international moves to increase flows of assistance into gaza . the united states " expects that all parties will cease attacks and hostile actions immediately , " rice said in a statement .
she also commended egypt for its efforts in reaching a ceasefire . egypt plans summit for sunday olmert 's announcement came after egyptian president hosni mubarak called for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the gaza strip on saturday . " i ask israel today to end its military operations immediately , " mubarak said in an address on state television .
" i call on its leadership for an immediate unconditional ceasefire and a complete withdrawal of israeli troops from the gaza strip .

the company says it will focus more on hybrid models , as well as smaller and more efficient engines . luxury german car manufacturing group daimler is increasing its work on energy-efficient automobiles .
chief executive dieter zetsche said at the north american international auto show in detroit this week that the company planned to roll out at least one new hybrid vehicle per year . " despite the enormous pressures that our entire industry is under these days , we are facing the year 2009 with measured confidence , " zetsche said . the first hybrid - which combines electric and internal combustion engines - will be the top-of-the-line s400 bluehybrid executive sedan in 2009 .
it is reported to be the first mainstream hybrid car to use a lithium-ion battery pack . according to the german economic news weekly magazine wirtschaftswoche , daimler aims to have reduced its cars ' exhaust emissions by 2012 to 136-138 milligrams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by using hybrid models , as well as smaller and more efficient engines .
this would nearly achieve the european union commission target of 130 mg / kilometer . in late 2007 , daimler 's mercedes and smart cars ' average carbon dioxide emissions were at 180 mg / kilometer , the dusseldorf-based magazine said . taking advantage of a growth opportunity " from 2012 , we will offer our customers all standard series from the c-class up with optional hybrid technology , " thomas weber , daimler 's director of research and development , told the business daily handelsblatt earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi also presented a hybrid model in detroit this also included the popular full-size model e-class , which was re-launched this year and unveiled at the detroit show .
it will be available with a hybrid engine starting in 2011 , wirtschaftswoche said .
the next generation of the s-class mercedes , due to be introduced in 2013 , is to be exclusively hybrid-powered , it said . " whoever does n't invest in alternative engines is missing a growth opportunity , " weber said . affordable electric cars pose a challenge daimler also introduced the prototype for an electric vehicle called bluezero at the detroit auto show .
the three bluezero versions are based on the sandwich-floor architecture which the carmaker initially introduced for the a-class . the vehicles will utilize lithium-ion batteries , which are already widely used in consumer electronics but are being adapted to meet automotive requirements .
the car will be able to drive 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- on a single charge , or 400 kilometers for a hybrid version that relies on a small combustion engine to recharge its battery .
all three variants accelerate from 0 to 100 km / h in less than 11 seconds .
the top speed is electronically limited to 150 km / h . but mass production is " a few years " away , said weber .
daimler still faced two challenges in manufacturing electric vehicles : making it affordable , and building up public infrastructure to charge the car 's batteries . daimler last month took a 49 percent stake in the lithium-ion battery unit of essen-based industrial group evonik . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that means it no longer qualifies as a masters series event . the qatari tennis federation gave no reason for selling its stake in the berlin women 's event . held in berlin each may , the tournament was an important lead-up event to the french open and a favorite of former german tennis great steffi graf , who was a nine-time winner of the meet . the german tennis federation -lrb- dtb -rrb- said it would fight the cancellation of the women ’ s tournament and demotion of the men 's event .

obviously it helps to have major tournaments or a world number one player to promote the sport , " said quante . " but we have talented players with lots of potential coming up .

18 , voters in hesse will go to the polls for the second time in 12 months to elect a new parliament .
opinion polls give merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- a comfortable lead over the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , junior partner in an uneasy coalition with the chancellor 's party in berlin .
the election comes as the country finds itself mired in recession , with unemployment rising , production declining and the government forced to pump tens of billions of euros into shoring up the economy .
replacing hesse 's caretaker government it also kicks off what germans are calling a super election year , with voting for five of the country 's 16 regional parliaments as well as elections for a new president in may and a general election on sept .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch has toned down his rhetoric this time around hesse , one of germany 's most prosperous states where the banking center of frankfurt is located , has been administered by a caretaker government under cdu prime minister roland koch since inconclusive elections in january 2008 .
in that vote , the spd , led by andrea ypsilanti , narrowly failed to unseat koch , whose hard-hitting campaign targeting young criminals from ethnic minorities alienated many voters .
ypsilanti , 51 , then tried to topple the premier by forming a parliamentary alliance with the greens , backed by tacit support from the radical left party .
in so doing , she broke a campaign promise not to work with the left , an alliance of former east german communists and disgruntled social democrats from the west .
eroding support for spd this proved too much for four spd rebels , who withdrew their support a day before a crucial vote in parliament on nov .
4 , leaving their party leader without a majority .
ypsilanti was forced to make an embarrassing climbdown and agree to early elections .
since then , voter support for the spd has steadily eroded .
latest opinion polls show its ratings down to between 24 and 25 percent from 36.7 percent in the 2009 election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti came very close ... but lost her support the cdu , on the other hand , has seen its popularity grow to 41-42 percent from 36.8 percent last january .
with its preferred partner the free democrats tipped to win 13 percent , the two would have a comfortable majority in the 110-seat legislature in wiesbaden .
surveys show the greens also running at 13 percent , with the left hovering around the 5 percent needed to gain parliamentary representation , but not enough to from a workable majority with the spd .
koch 's challenger is thorsten schaefer-guembel , 39 , an spd back-bencher who was plucked from obscurity by ypsilanti to fight the election while she remained behind the scenes as party leader .
" he 's just the figure on the car radiator grille while ypsilanti remains firmly in the driving seat , " quipped koch , who has been premier for nearly a decade .
difference in platforms schaefer-guembel has sought to distance himself from his mentor and has put on a brave face when confronted with jokes about his double-barrelled name and thick spectacles .
both the cdu and the spd have pledged to invest more in education and infrastructure projects , but differ on energy policy and an expansion of frankfurt airport , one of europe 's busiest , a move which the spd opposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer-guembel : competitor or puppet ?
koch , 50 , has toned down his fiery rhetoric , concentrating instead on selling himself as a crisis manager at a time of growing economic uncertainty , a move that could make the cdu palatable to the greens if a broader-based coalition is necessary .
a victory for the cdu would give it a boost in confidence in the run-up to the general election after the setback it suffered in a state election in bavaria last september when its christian social union sister party lost its absolute majority .
test for general election ?
while the hesse vote might prove a reliable gauge of the mood of the electorate , leading politicians caution against viewing it as a test for the general election in eight months time .

18 , voters in hesse will go to the polls for the second time in 12 months to elect a new parliament .
opinion polls give merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- a comfortable lead over the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , junior partner in an uneasy coalition with the chancellor 's party in berlin .
the election comes as the country finds itself mired in recession , with unemployment rising , production declining and the government forced to pump tens of billions of euros into shoring up the economy .
replacing hesse 's caretaker government it also kicks off what germans are calling a super election year , with voting for five of the country 's 16 regional parliaments as well as elections for a new president in may and a general election on sept .
27 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch has toned down his rhetoric this time around hesse , one of germany 's most prosperous states where the banking center of frankfurt is located , has been administered by a caretaker government under cdu prime minister roland koch since inconclusive elections in january 2008 .
in that vote , the spd , led by andrea ypsilanti , narrowly failed to unseat koch , whose hard-hitting campaign targeting young criminals from ethnic minorities alienated many voters .
ypsilanti , 51 , then tried to topple the premier by forming a parliamentary alliance with the greens , backed by tacit support from the radical left party .
in so doing , she broke a campaign promise not to work with the left , an alliance of former east german communists and disgruntled social democrats from the west .
eroding support for spd this proved too much for four spd rebels , who withdrew their support a day before a crucial vote in parliament on nov .
4 , leaving their party leader without a majority .
ypsilanti was forced to make an embarrassing climbdown and agree to early elections .
since then , voter support for the spd has steadily eroded .
latest opinion polls show its ratings down to between 24 and 25 percent from 36.7 percent in the 2009 election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti came very close ... but lost her support the cdu , on the other hand , has seen its popularity grow to 41-42 percent from 36.8 percent last january .
with its preferred partner the free democrats tipped to win 13 percent , the two would have a comfortable majority in the 110-seat legislature in wiesbaden .
surveys show the greens also running at 13 percent , with the left hovering around the 5 percent needed to gain parliamentary representation , but not enough to from a workable majority with the spd .
koch 's challenger is thorsten schaefer-guembel , 39 , an spd back-bencher who was plucked from obscurity by ypsilanti to fight the election while she remained behind the scenes as party leader .
" he 's just the figure on the car radiator grille while ypsilanti remains firmly in the driving seat , " quipped koch , who has been premier for nearly a decade .
difference in platforms schaefer-guembel has sought to distance himself from his mentor and has put on a brave face when confronted with jokes about his double-barrelled name and thick spectacles .
both the cdu and the spd have pledged to invest more in education and infrastructure projects , but differ on energy policy and an expansion of frankfurt airport , one of europe 's busiest , a move which the spd opposes .

but the palestinian militant group hamas said it would continue fighting until israeli troops withdrawal from the gaza strip . olmert said israel 's offensive in the gaza strip had achieved all its objectives and received promises of support from major european powers to help stop the smuggling of weapons into gaza . he told a news conference after the security cabinet voted to cease fire that some goals had been exceeded , hamas had been hit hard and its ability to fire rockets into israel had been severely limited . " at two o 'clock in the morning -lrb- midnight gmt -rrb- we will cease fire but we will continue to be deployed in gaza and its surroundings , " olmert said in a speech after the vote . " we have reached all the goals of the war , and beyond , " he added .
" if our enemies decide to strike and want to carry on then the israeli army will regard itself as free to respond with force . " under the ceasefire plan , israeli troops will remain in the territory with orders to respond if fired upon by palestinian militants . israel will restart military operations in gaza if needed , defense minister ehud barak added .
reporting on the start of the meeting , israel 's channel 10 television said the military commander had recommended concluding the campaign . the declaration could allow israel to conclude its massive offensive without entering into an agreement with the islamist hamas movement , which has ruled gaza since june 2007 and is sworn to the destruction of the jewish state . bildunterschrift : sections of rafah and other cities in the gaza strip have been destroyed hamas vows to fight on a hamas spokesman criticized israel for its unilateral approach . " it is an attempt to pre-empt the egyptian efforts and any other efforts that seek to achieve a withdrawal of the occupying forces , an end to the siege and a ceasefire , " hamas spokesman fawzi barhoum told reuters news agency . he added that hamas would continue to fight the troops left in the coastal strip until the blockade on the gaza strip was lifted . " a unilateral ceasefire does not mean ending the -lrb- israeli -rrb- aggression and ending the siege , " barhoum said in gaza .
" these constitute acts of war and so this will not mean an end to resistance . " a spokesman for palestinian president mahmud abbas said the ceasefire should be followed by a truce and the withdrawal of troops . international community welcomes plan un secretary-general ban ki-moon said he was relieved by the israeli declaration and also urged the jewish state to withdraw all of its troops as soon as possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in the gaza strip continued for 22 days before the israeli ceasefire announcement " i am relieved that the israeli government has decided to cease hostilities as of midnight gmt , " ban told reporters .
" this should be the first step leading to the full withdrawal of israeli troops from gaza . " olmert said hamas ' actions would determine whether israeli troops pull back . " this operation strengthened the deterrence of the state of israel in the face of all those who threaten us , " he said .
" if hamas completely stops its attacks , we will judge at what moment we will leave the gaza strip . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier welcomed the ceasefire and called on hamas to put a stop to all attacks . " this step finally opens a perspective to an end of violence in and around gaza , " he said on saturday .
" as soon as the weapons are silent , all steps must be taken to create a lasting truce .
i will continue to work to make sure germany and the eu support this process . " us secretary of state condoleezza said the us remained " deeply concerned by the suffering of innocent palestinians " and supported immediate international moves to increase flows of assistance into gaza . the united states " expects that all parties will cease attacks and hostile actions immediately , " rice said in a statement .
she also commended egypt for its efforts in reaching a ceasefire . egypt plans summit for sunday olmert 's announcement came after egyptian president hosni mubarak called for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the gaza strip on saturday . " i ask israel today to end its military operations immediately , " mubarak said in an address on state television .
" i call on its leadership for an immediate unconditional ceasefire and a complete withdrawal of israeli troops from the gaza strip . " egypt has organized an international summit on gaza in sharm el-sheikh on sunday , with un head ban , german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy to attend . merkel and sarkozy are scheduled to go to tel aviv after the talks in egypt to meet with olmert , according to german and french government officials . invitations for the summit in the red sea resort have been sent to britain , france , italy , spain and turkey , several european diplomatic sources told the afp news agency on saturday . eu trio ready to quell smuggling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , sarkozy and brown said they would help curb weapons smuggling into gaza earlier saturday , germany , britain and france offered to send naval vessels to the middle east to monitor and prevent weapons smuggling in gaza . the three eu countries " declared our readiness to take a series of measures that would contribute to the end of weapons smuggling into gaza , " according to a joint statement released saturday by merkel , sarkozy and british prime minister gordon brown . " this offer is now on the table , " brown 's spokesman said .
" one of the key areas and blockages about a ceasefire , outside of the rocket attacks , has been concerns about arms smuggling . " while details of the naval assistance were not provided , the three european leaders also expressed their " hope that a lasting ceasefire in gaza would be followed by a new dynamic for an abiding peace in the middle east . " israel was in the fourth week of a military campaign against the palestinian militant group hamas , which currently rules the gaza strip and is considered a terrorist organization by the united states and european union . israeli attacks have killed more than 1,200 palestinians , according to gaza medical officials .

but the palestinian militant group hamas said it would continue fighting until israeli troops withdrawal from the gaza strip . olmert said israel 's offensive in the gaza strip had achieved all its objectives and received promises of support from major european powers to help stop the smuggling of weapons into gaza . he told a news conference after the security cabinet voted to cease fire that some goals had been exceeded , hamas had been hit hard and its ability to fire rockets into israel had been severely limited . " at two o 'clock in the morning -lrb- midnight gmt -rrb- we will cease fire but we will continue to be deployed in gaza and its surroundings , " olmert said in a speech after the vote . " we have reached all the goals of the war , and beyond , " he added .
" if our enemies decide to strike and want to carry on then the israeli army will regard itself as free to respond with force . " under the ceasefire plan , israeli troops will remain in the territory with orders to respond if fired upon by palestinian militants . israel will restart military operations in gaza if needed , defense minister ehud barak added .
reporting on the start of the meeting , israel 's channel 10 television said the military commander had recommended concluding the campaign . the declaration could allow israel to conclude its massive offensive without entering into an agreement with the islamist hamas movement , which has ruled gaza since june 2007 and is sworn to the destruction of the jewish state . bildunterschrift : sections of rafah and other cities in the gaza strip have been destroyed hamas vows to fight on a hamas spokesman criticized israel for its unilateral approach . " it is an attempt to pre-empt the egyptian efforts and any other efforts that seek to achieve a withdrawal of the occupying forces , an end to the siege and a ceasefire , " hamas spokesman fawzi barhoum told reuters news agency . he added that hamas would continue to fight the troops left in the coastal strip until the blockade on the gaza strip was lifted . " a unilateral ceasefire does not mean ending the -lrb- israeli -rrb- aggression and ending the siege , " barhoum said in gaza .
" these constitute acts of war and so this will not mean an end to resistance . " a spokesman for palestinian president mahmud abbas said the ceasefire should be followed by a truce and the withdrawal of troops . international community welcomes plan un secretary-general ban ki-moon said he was relieved by the israeli declaration and also urged the jewish state to withdraw all of its troops as soon as possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in the gaza strip continued for 22 days before the israeli ceasefire announcement " i am relieved that the israeli government has decided to cease hostilities as of midnight gmt , " ban told reporters .
" this should be the first step leading to the full withdrawal of israeli troops from gaza . " olmert said hamas ' actions would determine whether israeli troops pull back . " this operation strengthened the deterrence of the state of israel in the face of all those who threaten us , " he said .
" if hamas completely stops its attacks , we will judge at what moment we will leave the gaza strip . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier welcomed the ceasefire and called on hamas to put a stop to all attacks . " this step finally opens a perspective to an end of violence in and around gaza , " he said on saturday .
" as soon as the weapons are silent , all steps must be taken to create a lasting truce .
i will continue to work to make sure germany and the eu support this process . " us secretary of state condoleezza said the us remained " deeply concerned by the suffering of innocent palestinians " and supported immediate international moves to increase flows of assistance into gaza . the united states " expects that all parties will cease attacks and hostile actions immediately , " rice said in a statement .
she also commended egypt for its efforts in reaching a ceasefire . egypt plans summit for sunday olmert 's announcement came after egyptian president hosni mubarak called for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the gaza strip on saturday . " i ask israel today to end its military operations immediately , " mubarak said in an address on state television .
" i call on its leadership for an immediate unconditional ceasefire and a complete withdrawal of israeli troops from the gaza strip . " egypt has organized an international summit on gaza in sharm el-sheikh on sunday , with un head ban , german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy to attend . merkel and sarkozy are scheduled to go to tel aviv after the talks in egypt to meet with olmert , according to german and french government officials . invitations for the summit in the red sea resort have been sent to britain , france , italy , spain and turkey , several european diplomatic sources told the afp news agency on saturday . eu trio ready to quell smuggling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , sarkozy and brown said they would help curb weapons smuggling into gaza earlier saturday , germany , britain and france offered to send naval vessels to the middle east to monitor and prevent weapons smuggling in gaza . the three eu countries " declared our readiness to take a series of measures that would contribute to the end of weapons smuggling into gaza , " according to a joint statement released saturday by merkel , sarkozy and british prime minister gordon brown . " this offer is now on the table , " brown 's spokesman said .
" one of the key areas and blockages about a ceasefire , outside of the rocket attacks , has been concerns about arms smuggling . " while details of the naval assistance were not provided , the three european leaders also expressed their " hope that a lasting ceasefire in gaza would be followed by a new dynamic for an abiding peace in the middle east . " israel was in the fourth week of a military campaign against the palestinian militant group hamas , which currently rules the gaza strip and is considered a terrorist organization by the united states and european union . israeli attacks have killed more than 1,200 palestinians , according to gaza medical officials .

protesters highlighted the numbers of palestinian women and children killed in the war entering its fourth week . several thousand people , many carrying palestinian and lebanese flags , marched through the center of paris behind a banner declaring " palestinian resistance : stop the french-israeli collaboration . " about 1,200 people took the streets of the western german city of duisburg to protest against violence in the gaza strip and to call for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire .
smaller demonstrations were also held in several other german cities , including cologne and bochum . british police estimated that 3,500 rallied in trafalgar square for a protest billed as a " demonstration against israel 's barbarity and war crimes . " in athens , more than 1,000 demonstrators gathered in central syntagma square and marched to the israeli embassy , led by some 30 palestinian immigrants and holding banners reading " free palestine " and " stop the massacre now . " children brought to protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty built mock graves in turkey for children killed in the gaza strip the un european headquarters was the rallying point in geneva for hundreds to protest israel 's attacks on gaza which have left at least 1,200 palestinians dead including 410 children . the demonstrators , many of whom were wearing white t-shirts or were draped in white cloth marked with " gaza " in red , chanted " israel , terrorist " and " stop the massacre of palestinian people . " many children were also present at the geneva protest , some carrying " stop the massacre " placards and marching within the circle of protesters . israel 's main ally the united states was a target of protesters ' anger in turkey , where around 400 activists from a pro-islamic group rallied across from the us embassy in ankara . they held banners reading " down with the great satan ! " and " usa : you are shareholders of the crime organization israel " as riot police prevented them from approaching the embassy building . some support for israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while most protests , this one included , criticized israel , a few supported the jewish state on istanbul 's main commercial street , activists from amnesty international erected mock gravestones marked with " killed while helping the injured " and " died because of lack of medicines " to protest the deaths of civilians in gaza . no major incidents were reported in the european demonstrations .
in paris the window of a mcdonald 's restaurant was broken along the protesters ' march route . though europeans have displayed chiefly pro-palestinian sentiment in most demonstrations , support for israel could be seen saturday in duisburg as well as the swiss capital bern at a rally that drew some 1,500 people . karl-hartmut moerschel , who heads the bern section of the swiss-israel association , called for a minute of silence for all the victims of the war , israeli and palestinians alike . he told the gathering that the current offensive in gaza was " necessary and fair . " on the israeli side , 10 soldiers and three civilians have been killed in combat or in rocket strikes by militants in gaza , who have fired more than 700 rockets and mortar rounds into israel since the start of the war , according to the israeli army . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

foreign minister tzipi livni said friday that an end to the war " does n't have to be in agreement with hamas but rather in arrangements against hamas . "
she was in washington to sign a deal for us help in ensuring hamas no longer smuggles arms to gaza via egypt .
on saturday , hamas official osama abu hemdan warned that the islamist group would fight on if israel orders a unilateral ceasefire in gaza .
attacks continued in the early morning hours .
israeli warplanes reportedly hit about 50 targets during the night , including rocket-launching sites , tunnels under the gaza-egypt border as well as mosques used as points from where militants fired at israel .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us pledged to help prevent hamas from smuggling arms israel and hamas , the islamist group which rules gaza , do not talk to each other directly but go through cairo , which has been pushing for a ceasefire based on a short-term humanitarian truce , followed by negotiations on a longer-term ceasefire that would include the israeli security concerns and the militants ' demand that the borders be opened .
the security cabinet vote would likely take place in the evening , after the end of the jewish sabbath , giving olmert and defense minister ehud barak time to discuss the proposal with their representatives who returned from two trips to cairo in two days .
there has been speculation that israel might opt for a unilateral cessation of hostilities , a move united nations secretary general ban ki-moon had also called for during his mideast tour .
hamas opposed to israeli stipulations khaled meshaal , hamas ' damascus-based political leader , said in doha , at a summit of arab leaders , that his organization would not accept israeli dictates on the ceasefire , and that the militant group " had not suffered a defeat " in the gaza fighting .
representatives of hamas on saturday were to meet with egyptian negotiators to discuss israel 's response to their stipulations .
hamas has offered a renewable one-year truce , on the condition that all israeli troops withdraw within one week and that border crossings between israel and egypt are opened .
over 1,150 palestinians , largely civilians , have been killed and some 5,100 injured since israel began operation cast lead on dec .

but the palestinian militant group hamas said it would continue fighting until israeli troops withdrawal from the gaza strip . olmert said israel 's offensive in the gaza strip had achieved all its objectives and received promises of support from major european powers to help stop the smuggling of weapons into gaza . he told a news conference after the security cabinet voted to cease fire that some goals had been exceeded , hamas had been hit hard and its ability to fire rockets into israel had been severely limited . " at two o 'clock in the morning -lrb- midnight gmt -rrb- we will cease fire but we will continue to be deployed in gaza and its surroundings , " olmert said in a speech after the vote . " we have reached all the goals of the war , and beyond , " he added .
" if our enemies decide to strike and want to carry on then the israeli army will regard itself as free to respond with force . " under the ceasefire plan , israeli troops will remain in the territory with orders to respond if fired upon by palestinian militants . israel will restart military operations in gaza if needed , defense minister ehud barak added .
reporting on the start of the meeting , israel 's channel 10 television said the military commander had recommended concluding the campaign . the declaration could allow israel to conclude its massive offensive without entering into an agreement with the islamist hamas movement , which has ruled gaza since june 2007 and is sworn to the destruction of the jewish state . bildunterschrift : sections of rafah and other cities in the gaza strip have been destroyed hamas vows to fight on a hamas spokesman criticized israel for its unilateral approach . " it is an attempt to pre-empt the egyptian efforts and any other efforts that seek to achieve a withdrawal of the occupying forces , an end to the siege and a ceasefire , " hamas spokesman fawzi barhoum told reuters news agency . he added that hamas would continue to fight the troops left in the coastal strip until the blockade on the gaza strip was lifted . " a unilateral ceasefire does not mean ending the -lrb- israeli -rrb- aggression and ending the siege , " barhoum said in gaza .
" these constitute acts of war and so this will not mean an end to resistance . " a spokesman for palestinian president mahmud abbas said the ceasefire should be followed by a truce and the withdrawal of troops . international community welcomes plan un secretary-general ban ki-moon said he was relieved by the israeli declaration and also urged the jewish state to withdraw all of its troops as soon as possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in the gaza strip continued for 22 days before the israeli ceasefire announcement " i am relieved that the israeli government has decided to cease hostilities as of midnight gmt , " ban told reporters .
" this should be the first step leading to the full withdrawal of israeli troops from gaza . " olmert said hamas ' actions would determine whether israeli troops pull back . " this operation strengthened the deterrence of the state of israel in the face of all those who threaten us , " he said .
" if hamas completely stops its attacks , we will judge at what moment we will leave the gaza strip . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier welcomed the ceasefire and called on hamas to put a stop to all attacks . " this step finally opens a perspective to an end of violence in and around gaza , " he said on saturday .
" as soon as the weapons are silent , all steps must be taken to create a lasting truce .
i will continue to work to make sure germany and the eu support this process . " us secretary of state condoleezza said the us remained " deeply concerned by the suffering of innocent palestinians " and supported immediate international moves to increase flows of assistance into gaza . the united states " expects that all parties will cease attacks and hostile actions immediately , " rice said in a statement .
she also commended egypt for its efforts in reaching a ceasefire . egypt plans summit for sunday olmert 's announcement came after egyptian president hosni mubarak called for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the gaza strip on saturday . " i ask israel today to end its military operations immediately , " mubarak said in an address on state television .
" i call on its leadership for an immediate unconditional ceasefire and a complete withdrawal of israeli troops from the gaza strip . " egypt has organized an international summit on gaza in sharm el-sheikh on sunday , with un head ban , german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy to attend . merkel and sarkozy are scheduled to go to tel aviv after the talks in egypt to meet with olmert , according to german and french government officials . invitations for the summit in the red sea resort have been sent to britain , france , italy , spain and turkey , several european diplomatic sources told the afp news agency on saturday . eu trio ready to quell smuggling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , sarkozy and brown said they would help curb weapons smuggling into gaza earlier saturday , germany , britain and france offered to send naval vessels to the middle east to monitor and prevent weapons smuggling in gaza . the three eu countries " declared our readiness to take a series of measures that would contribute to the end of weapons smuggling into gaza , " according to a joint statement released saturday by merkel , sarkozy and british prime minister gordon brown . " this offer is now on the table , " brown 's spokesman said .
" one of the key areas and blockages about a ceasefire , outside of the rocket attacks , has been concerns about arms smuggling . " while details of the naval assistance were not provided , the three european leaders also expressed their " hope that a lasting ceasefire in gaza would be followed by a new dynamic for an abiding peace in the middle east . " israel was in the fourth week of a military campaign against the palestinian militant group hamas , which currently rules the gaza strip and is considered a terrorist organization by the united states and european union . israeli attacks have killed more than 1,200 palestinians , according to gaza medical officials .

18 , voters in hesse will go to the polls for the second time in 12 months to elect a new parliament .
opinion polls give merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- a comfortable lead over the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , junior partner in an uneasy coalition with the chancellor 's party in berlin .
the election comes as the country finds itself mired in recession , with unemployment rising , production declining and the government forced to pump tens of billions of euros into shoring up the economy .
replacing hesse 's caretaker government it also kicks off what germans are calling a super election year , with voting for five of the country 's 16 regional parliaments as well as elections for a new president in may and a general election on sept .
27 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch has toned down his rhetoric this time around hesse , one of germany 's most prosperous states where the banking center of frankfurt is located , has been administered by a caretaker government under cdu prime minister roland koch since inconclusive elections in january 2008 .
in that vote , the spd , led by andrea ypsilanti , narrowly failed to unseat koch , whose hard-hitting campaign targeting young criminals from ethnic minorities alienated many voters .
ypsilanti , 51 , then tried to topple the premier by forming a parliamentary alliance with the greens , backed by tacit support from the radical left party .
in so doing , she broke a campaign promise not to work with the left , an alliance of former east german communists and disgruntled social democrats from the west .
eroding support for spd this proved too much for four spd rebels , who withdrew their support a day before a crucial vote in parliament on nov .
4 , leaving their party leader without a majority .
ypsilanti was forced to make an embarrassing climbdown and agree to early elections .
since then , voter support for the spd has steadily eroded .
latest opinion polls show its ratings down to between 24 and 25 percent from 36.7 percent in the 2009 election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti came very close ... but lost her support the cdu , on the other hand , has seen its popularity grow to 41-42 percent from 36.8 percent last january .
with its preferred partner the free democrats tipped to win 13 percent , the two would have a comfortable majority in the 110-seat legislature in wiesbaden .
surveys show the greens also running at 13 percent , with the left hovering around the 5 percent needed to gain parliamentary representation , but not enough to from a workable majority with the spd .
koch 's challenger is thorsten schaefer-guembel , 39 , an spd back-bencher who was plucked from obscurity by ypsilanti to fight the election while she remained behind the scenes as party leader .
" he 's just the figure on the car radiator grille while ypsilanti remains firmly in the driving seat , " quipped koch , who has been premier for nearly a decade .
difference in platforms schaefer-guembel has sought to distance himself from his mentor and has put on a brave face when confronted with jokes about his double-barrelled name and thick spectacles .
both the cdu and the spd have pledged to invest more in education and infrastructure projects , but differ on energy policy and an expansion of frankfurt airport , one of europe 's busiest , a move which the spd opposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer-guembel : competitor or puppet ?
koch , 50 , has toned down his fiery rhetoric , concentrating instead on selling himself as a crisis manager at a time of growing economic uncertainty , a move that could make the cdu palatable to the greens if a broader-based coalition is necessary .
a victory for the cdu would give it a boost in confidence in the run-up to the general election after the setback it suffered in a state election in bavaria last september when its christian social union sister party lost its absolute majority .
test for general election ?
while the hesse vote might prove a reliable gauge of the mood of the electorate , leading politicians caution against viewing it as a test for the general election in eight months time .
" voters often leave it until the last moment before deciding which party to support , " said interior minister wolfgang schaeuble . dpa news agency -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

foreign minister tzipi livni said friday that an end to the war " does n't have to be in agreement with hamas but rather in arrangements against hamas . "
she was in washington to sign a deal for us help in ensuring hamas no longer smuggles arms to gaza via egypt .
on saturday , hamas official osama abu hemdan warned that the islamist group would fight on if israel orders a unilateral ceasefire in gaza .
attacks continued in the early morning hours .
israeli warplanes reportedly hit about 50 targets during the night , including rocket-launching sites , tunnels under the gaza-egypt border as well as mosques used as points from where militants fired at israel .
israeli security council considers ceasefire olmert 's office on friday said there had been " significant progress " in talks in cairo , where an israeli delegation had been in discussions with egypt 's intelligence chief .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us pledged to help prevent hamas from smuggling arms israel and hamas , the islamist group which rules gaza , do not talk to each other directly but go through cairo , which has been pushing for a ceasefire based on a short-term humanitarian truce , followed by negotiations on a longer-term ceasefire that would include the israeli security concerns and the militants ' demand that the borders be opened .
the security cabinet vote would likely take place in the evening , after the end of the jewish sabbath , giving olmert and defense minister ehud barak time to discuss the proposal with their representatives who returned from two trips to cairo in two days .
there has been speculation that israel might opt for a unilateral cessation of hostilities , a move united nations secretary general ban ki-moon had also called for during his mideast tour .
hamas opposed to israeli stipulations khaled meshaal , hamas ' damascus-based political leader , said in doha , at a summit of arab leaders , that his organization would not accept israeli dictates on the ceasefire , and that the militant group " had not suffered a defeat " in the gaza fighting .
representatives of hamas on saturday were to meet with egyptian negotiators to discuss israel 's response to their stipulations .
hamas has offered a renewable one-year truce , on the condition that all israeli troops withdraw within one week and that border crossings between israel and egypt are opened .

but the palestinian militant group hamas said it would continue fighting until israeli troops withdrawal from the gaza strip . olmert said israel 's offensive in the gaza strip had achieved all its objectives and received promises of support from major european powers to help stop the smuggling of weapons into gaza . he told a news conference after the security cabinet voted to cease fire that some goals had been exceeded , hamas had been hit hard and its ability to fire rockets into israel had been severely limited . " at two o 'clock in the morning -lrb- midnight gmt -rrb- we will cease fire but we will continue to be deployed in gaza and its surroundings , " olmert said in a speech after the vote . " we have reached all the goals of the war , and beyond , " he added .
" if our enemies decide to strike and want to carry on then the israeli army will regard itself as free to respond with force . " under the ceasefire plan , israeli troops will remain in the territory with orders to respond if fired upon by palestinian militants . israel will restart military operations in gaza if needed , defense minister ehud barak added .
reporting on the start of the meeting , israel 's channel 10 television said the military commander had recommended concluding the campaign . the declaration could allow israel to conclude its massive offensive without entering into an agreement with the islamist hamas movement , which has ruled gaza since june 2007 and is sworn to the destruction of the jewish state . bildunterschrift : sections of rafah and other cities in the gaza strip have been destroyed hamas vows to fight on a hamas spokesman criticized israel for its unilateral approach . " it is an attempt to pre-empt the egyptian efforts and any other efforts that seek to achieve a withdrawal of the occupying forces , an end to the siege and a ceasefire , " hamas spokesman fawzi barhoum told reuters news agency . he added that hamas would continue to fight the troops left in the coastal strip until the blockade on the gaza strip was lifted . " a unilateral ceasefire does not mean ending the -lrb- israeli -rrb- aggression and ending the siege , " barhoum said in gaza .
" these constitute acts of war and so this will not mean an end to resistance . " a spokesman for palestinian president mahmud abbas said the ceasefire should be followed by a truce and the withdrawal of troops . international community welcomes plan un secretary-general ban ki-moon said he was relieved by the israeli declaration and also urged the jewish state to withdraw all of its troops as soon as possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in the gaza strip continued for 22 days before the israeli ceasefire announcement " i am relieved that the israeli government has decided to cease hostilities as of midnight gmt , " ban told reporters .
" this should be the first step leading to the full withdrawal of israeli troops from gaza . " olmert said hamas ' actions would determine whether israeli troops pull back . " this operation strengthened the deterrence of the state of israel in the face of all those who threaten us , " he said .
" if hamas completely stops its attacks , we will judge at what moment we will leave the gaza strip . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier welcomed the ceasefire and called on hamas to put a stop to all attacks . " this step finally opens a perspective to an end of violence in and around gaza , " he said on saturday .
" as soon as the weapons are silent , all steps must be taken to create a lasting truce .
i will continue to work to make sure germany and the eu support this process . " us secretary of state condoleezza said the us remained " deeply concerned by the suffering of innocent palestinians " and supported immediate international moves to increase flows of assistance into gaza . the united states " expects that all parties will cease attacks and hostile actions immediately , " rice said in a statement .
she also commended egypt for its efforts in reaching a ceasefire . egypt plans summit for sunday olmert 's announcement came after egyptian president hosni mubarak called for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the gaza strip on saturday . " i ask israel today to end its military operations immediately , " mubarak said in an address on state television .
" i call on its leadership for an immediate unconditional ceasefire and a complete withdrawal of israeli troops from the gaza strip . " egypt has organized an international summit on gaza in sharm el-sheikh on sunday , with un head ban , german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy to attend . merkel and sarkozy are scheduled to go to tel aviv after the talks in egypt to meet with olmert , according to german and french government officials . invitations for the summit in the red sea resort have been sent to britain , france , italy , spain and turkey , several european diplomatic sources told the afp news agency on saturday . eu trio ready to quell smuggling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , sarkozy and brown said they would help curb weapons smuggling into gaza earlier saturday , germany , britain and france offered to send naval vessels to the middle east to monitor and prevent weapons smuggling in gaza . the three eu countries " declared our readiness to take a series of measures that would contribute to the end of weapons smuggling into gaza , " according to a joint statement released saturday by merkel , sarkozy and british prime minister gordon brown . " this offer is now on the table , " brown 's spokesman said .
" one of the key areas and blockages about a ceasefire , outside of the rocket attacks , has been concerns about arms smuggling . " while details of the naval assistance were not provided , the three european leaders also expressed their " hope that a lasting ceasefire in gaza would be followed by a new dynamic for an abiding peace in the middle east . " israel was in the fourth week of a military campaign against the palestinian militant group hamas , which currently rules the gaza strip and is considered a terrorist organization by the united states and european union . israeli attacks have killed more than 1,200 palestinians , according to gaza medical officials .

18 , voters in hesse will go to the polls for the second time in 12 months to elect a new parliament .
opinion polls give merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- a comfortable lead over the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , junior partner in an uneasy coalition with the chancellor 's party in berlin .
the election comes as the country finds itself mired in recession , with unemployment rising , production declining and the government forced to pump tens of billions of euros into shoring up the economy .
replacing hesse 's caretaker government it also kicks off what germans are calling a super election year , with voting for five of the country 's 16 regional parliaments as well as elections for a new president in may and a general election on sept .
27 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch has toned down his rhetoric this time around hesse , one of germany 's most prosperous states where the banking center of frankfurt is located , has been administered by a caretaker government under cdu prime minister roland koch since inconclusive elections in january 2008 .
in that vote , the spd , led by andrea ypsilanti , narrowly failed to unseat koch , whose hard-hitting campaign targeting young criminals from ethnic minorities alienated many voters .
ypsilanti , 51 , then tried to topple the premier by forming a parliamentary alliance with the greens , backed by tacit support from the radical left party .
in so doing , she broke a campaign promise not to work with the left , an alliance of former east german communists and disgruntled social democrats from the west .
eroding support for spd this proved too much for four spd rebels , who withdrew their support a day before a crucial vote in parliament on nov .
4 , leaving their party leader without a majority .
ypsilanti was forced to make an embarrassing climbdown and agree to early elections .
since then , voter support for the spd has steadily eroded .
latest opinion polls show its ratings down to between 24 and 25 percent from 36.7 percent in the 2009 election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti came very close ... but lost her support the cdu , on the other hand , has seen its popularity grow to 41-42 percent from 36.8 percent last january .
with its preferred partner the free democrats tipped to win 13 percent , the two would have a comfortable majority in the 110-seat legislature in wiesbaden .
surveys show the greens also running at 13 percent , with the left hovering around the 5 percent needed to gain parliamentary representation , but not enough to from a workable majority with the spd .
koch 's challenger is thorsten schaefer-guembel , 39 , an spd back-bencher who was plucked from obscurity by ypsilanti to fight the election while she remained behind the scenes as party leader .
" he 's just the figure on the car radiator grille while ypsilanti remains firmly in the driving seat , " quipped koch , who has been premier for nearly a decade .
difference in platforms schaefer-guembel has sought to distance himself from his mentor and has put on a brave face when confronted with jokes about his double-barrelled name and thick spectacles .
both the cdu and the spd have pledged to invest more in education and infrastructure projects , but differ on energy policy and an expansion of frankfurt airport , one of europe 's busiest , a move which the spd opposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer-guembel : competitor or puppet ?
koch , 50 , has toned down his fiery rhetoric , concentrating instead on selling himself as a crisis manager at a time of growing economic uncertainty , a move that could make the cdu palatable to the greens if a broader-based coalition is necessary .
a victory for the cdu would give it a boost in confidence in the run-up to the general election after the setback it suffered in a state election in bavaria last september when its christian social union sister party lost its absolute majority .
test for general election ?
while the hesse vote might prove a reliable gauge of the mood of the electorate , leading politicians caution against viewing it as a test for the general election in eight months time .
" voters often leave it until the last moment before deciding which party to support , " said interior minister wolfgang schaeuble . dpa news agency -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

foreign minister tzipi livni said friday that an end to the war " does n't have to be in agreement with hamas but rather in arrangements against hamas . "
she was in washington to sign a deal for us help in ensuring hamas no longer smuggles arms to gaza via egypt .
on saturday , hamas official osama abu hemdan warned that the islamist group would fight on if israel orders a unilateral ceasefire in gaza .
attacks continued in the early morning hours .
israeli warplanes reportedly hit about 50 targets during the night , including rocket-launching sites , tunnels under the gaza-egypt border as well as mosques used as points from where militants fired at israel .
israeli security council considers ceasefire olmert 's office on friday said there had been " significant progress " in talks in cairo , where an israeli delegation had been in discussions with egypt 's intelligence chief .

but the palestinian militant group hamas said it would continue fighting until israeli troops withdrawal from the gaza strip . olmert said israel 's offensive in the gaza strip had achieved all its objectives and received promises of support from major european powers to help stop the smuggling of weapons into gaza . he told a news conference after the security cabinet voted to cease fire that some goals had been exceeded , hamas had been hit hard and its ability to fire rockets into israel had been severely limited . " at two o 'clock in the morning -lrb- midnight gmt -rrb- we will cease fire but we will continue to be deployed in gaza and its surroundings , " olmert said in a speech after the vote . " we have reached all the goals of the war , and beyond , " he added .
" if our enemies decide to strike and want to carry on then the israeli army will regard itself as free to respond with force . " under the ceasefire plan , israeli troops will remain in the territory with orders to respond if fired upon by palestinian militants . israel will restart military operations in gaza if needed , defense minister ehud barak added .
reporting on the start of the meeting , israel 's channel 10 television said the military commander had recommended concluding the campaign . the declaration could allow israel to conclude its massive offensive without entering into an agreement with the islamist hamas movement , which has ruled gaza since june 2007 and is sworn to the destruction of the jewish state . bildunterschrift : sections of rafah and other cities in the gaza strip have been destroyed hamas vows to fight on a hamas spokesman criticized israel for its unilateral approach . " it is an attempt to pre-empt the egyptian efforts and any other efforts that seek to achieve a withdrawal of the occupying forces , an end to the siege and a ceasefire , " hamas spokesman fawzi barhoum told reuters news agency . he added that hamas would continue to fight the troops left in the coastal strip until the blockade on the gaza strip was lifted . " a unilateral ceasefire does not mean ending the -lrb- israeli -rrb- aggression and ending the siege , " barhoum said in gaza .
" these constitute acts of war and so this will not mean an end to resistance . " a spokesman for palestinian president mahmud abbas said the ceasefire should be followed by a truce and the withdrawal of troops . international community welcomes plan un secretary-general ban ki-moon said he was relieved by the israeli declaration and also urged the jewish state to withdraw all of its troops as soon as possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in the gaza strip continued for 22 days before the israeli ceasefire announcement " i am relieved that the israeli government has decided to cease hostilities as of midnight gmt , " ban told reporters .
" this should be the first step leading to the full withdrawal of israeli troops from gaza . " olmert said hamas ' actions would determine whether israeli troops pull back . " this operation strengthened the deterrence of the state of israel in the face of all those who threaten us , " he said .
" if hamas completely stops its attacks , we will judge at what moment we will leave the gaza strip . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier welcomed the ceasefire and called on hamas to put a stop to all attacks . " this step finally opens a perspective to an end of violence in and around gaza , " he said on saturday .
" as soon as the weapons are silent , all steps must be taken to create a lasting truce .
i will continue to work to make sure germany and the eu support this process . " us secretary of state condoleezza said the us remained " deeply concerned by the suffering of innocent palestinians " and supported immediate international moves to increase flows of assistance into gaza . the united states " expects that all parties will cease attacks and hostile actions immediately , " rice said in a statement .
she also commended egypt for its efforts in reaching a ceasefire . egypt plans summit for sunday olmert 's announcement came after egyptian president hosni mubarak called for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the gaza strip on saturday . " i ask israel today to end its military operations immediately , " mubarak said in an address on state television .
" i call on its leadership for an immediate unconditional ceasefire and a complete withdrawal of israeli troops from the gaza strip . " egypt has organized an international summit on gaza in sharm el-sheikh on sunday , with un head ban , german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy to attend . merkel and sarkozy are scheduled to go to tel aviv after the talks in egypt to meet with olmert , according to german and french government officials . invitations for the summit in the red sea resort have been sent to britain , france , italy , spain and turkey , several european diplomatic sources told the afp news agency on saturday . eu trio ready to quell smuggling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , sarkozy and brown said they would help curb weapons smuggling into gaza earlier saturday , germany , britain and france offered to send naval vessels to the middle east to monitor and prevent weapons smuggling in gaza . the three eu countries " declared our readiness to take a series of measures that would contribute to the end of weapons smuggling into gaza , " according to a joint statement released saturday by merkel , sarkozy and british prime minister gordon brown . " this offer is now on the table , " brown 's spokesman said .
" one of the key areas and blockages about a ceasefire , outside of the rocket attacks , has been concerns about arms smuggling . " while details of the naval assistance were not provided , the three european leaders also expressed their " hope that a lasting ceasefire in gaza would be followed by a new dynamic for an abiding peace in the middle east . " israel was in the fourth week of a military campaign against the palestinian militant group hamas , which currently rules the gaza strip and is considered a terrorist organization by the united states and european union . israeli attacks have killed more than 1,200 palestinians , according to gaza medical officials .

"
she also said germany " would continue to maintain its commitment in afghanistan , " according to a statement . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also condemned the bombing as a " cowardly and barbaric act . " " we are not going to be deterred by terror from continuing our aid to the afghan people , " he said .
" it is not terrorism and violence that are the future of afghanistan but security and democracy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over a dozen civilians were injured in the attack the attack happened on a well-travelled civilian road , according to us military spokesman col. jerry o 'hara . " this incident will only strengthen our collective resolve to aggressively pursue enemy networks before they can hurt innocent afghans and coalition forces , " he added . taliban claims responsibility the taliban took responsibility for saturday 's bombing in a statement posted on the rebel web site and said that one of their bombers , named sham-ul-rahman , carried out the attack using a toyota corolla car filled with explosives . the statement claimed that eight german soldiers were killed in the attack , while several german diplomats were among the casualties .
the blast destroyed part of the german embassy building , according to the taliban 's statement . the blast blew out windows at the nearby us base , but military spokesman lt. col. christian kubik told the afp news agency there was no significant damage . the taliban are known to provide different accounts of their operations , which are often proven to be exaggerated or falsified . several vehicles including a passenger van and tanker in front of the embassy 's gate were ablaze and thick smoke was billowing from the area on saturday .
tolo , a private tv channel , showed several afghan municipal workers soaked in blood being rushed from the scene . the area , which is one of the city 's main intersections , was cordoned off by afghan and us military soldiers . taliban militants , who were driven out of power in a us-led invasion in late 2001 , have carried out hundreds of suicide attacks in the past seven years . the militants were responsible for more than 120 suicide bombings in 2008 in afghanistan .
more than 50 people including two indian diplomats were killed in a suicide attack against the indian embassy in july last year . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , voters in hesse will go to the polls for the second time in 12 months to elect a new parliament .
opinion polls give merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- a comfortable lead over the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , junior partner in an uneasy coalition with the chancellor 's party in berlin .
the election comes as the country finds itself mired in recession , with unemployment rising , production declining and the government forced to pump tens of billions of euros into shoring up the economy .
replacing hesse 's caretaker government it also kicks off what germans are calling a super election year , with voting for five of the country 's 16 regional parliaments as well as elections for a new president in may and a general election on sept .
27 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch has toned down his rhetoric this time around hesse , one of germany 's most prosperous states where the banking center of frankfurt is located , has been administered by a caretaker government under cdu prime minister roland koch since inconclusive elections in january 2008 .
in that vote , the spd , led by andrea ypsilanti , narrowly failed to unseat koch , whose hard-hitting campaign targeting young criminals from ethnic minorities alienated many voters .
ypsilanti , 51 , then tried to topple the premier by forming a parliamentary alliance with the greens , backed by tacit support from the radical left party .
in so doing , she broke a campaign promise not to work with the left , an alliance of former east german communists and disgruntled social democrats from the west .
eroding support for spd this proved too much for four spd rebels , who withdrew their support a day before a crucial vote in parliament on nov .
4 , leaving their party leader without a majority .
ypsilanti was forced to make an embarrassing climbdown and agree to early elections .
since then , voter support for the spd has steadily eroded .
latest opinion polls show its ratings down to between 24 and 25 percent from 36.7 percent in the 2009 election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti came very close ... but lost her support the cdu , on the other hand , has seen its popularity grow to 41-42 percent from 36.8 percent last january .
with its preferred partner the free democrats tipped to win 13 percent , the two would have a comfortable majority in the 110-seat legislature in wiesbaden .
surveys show the greens also running at 13 percent , with the left hovering around the 5 percent needed to gain parliamentary representation , but not enough to from a workable majority with the spd .
koch 's challenger is thorsten schaefer-guembel , 39 , an spd back-bencher who was plucked from obscurity by ypsilanti to fight the election while she remained behind the scenes as party leader .
" he 's just the figure on the car radiator grille while ypsilanti remains firmly in the driving seat , " quipped koch , who has been premier for nearly a decade .
difference in platforms schaefer-guembel has sought to distance himself from his mentor and has put on a brave face when confronted with jokes about his double-barrelled name and thick spectacles .
both the cdu and the spd have pledged to invest more in education and infrastructure projects , but differ on energy policy and an expansion of frankfurt airport , one of europe 's busiest , a move which the spd opposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer-guembel : competitor or puppet ?
koch , 50 , has toned down his fiery rhetoric , concentrating instead on selling himself as a crisis manager at a time of growing economic uncertainty , a move that could make the cdu palatable to the greens if a broader-based coalition is necessary .
a victory for the cdu would give it a boost in confidence in the run-up to the general election after the setback it suffered in a state election in bavaria last september when its christian social union sister party lost its absolute majority .
test for general election ?
while the hesse vote might prove a reliable gauge of the mood of the electorate , leading politicians caution against viewing it as a test for the general election in eight months time .
" voters often leave it until the last moment before deciding which party to support , " said interior minister wolfgang schaeuble . dpa news agency -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the palestinian militant group hamas said it would continue fighting until israeli troops withdrawal from the gaza strip . olmert said israel 's offensive in the gaza strip had achieved all its objectives and received promises of support from major european powers to help stop the smuggling of weapons into gaza . he told a news conference after the security cabinet voted to cease fire that some goals had been exceeded , hamas had been hit hard and its ability to fire rockets into israel had been severely limited . " at two o 'clock in the morning -lrb- midnight gmt -rrb- we will cease fire but we will continue to be deployed in gaza and its surroundings , " olmert said in a speech after the vote . " we have reached all the goals of the war , and beyond , " he added .
" if our enemies decide to strike and want to carry on then the israeli army will regard itself as free to respond with force . " under the ceasefire plan , israeli troops will remain in the territory with orders to respond if fired upon by palestinian militants . israel will restart military operations in gaza if needed , defense minister ehud barak added .
reporting on the start of the meeting , israel 's channel 10 television said the military commander had recommended concluding the campaign . the declaration could allow israel to conclude its massive offensive without entering into an agreement with the islamist hamas movement , which has ruled gaza since june 2007 and is sworn to the destruction of the jewish state . bildunterschrift : sections of rafah and other cities in the gaza strip have been destroyed hamas vows to fight on a hamas spokesman criticized israel for its unilateral approach . " it is an attempt to pre-empt the egyptian efforts and any other efforts that seek to achieve a withdrawal of the occupying forces , an end to the siege and a ceasefire , " hamas spokesman fawzi barhoum told reuters news agency . he added that hamas would continue to fight the troops left in the coastal strip until the blockade on the gaza strip was lifted . " a unilateral ceasefire does not mean ending the -lrb- israeli -rrb- aggression and ending the siege , " barhoum said in gaza .
" these constitute acts of war and so this will not mean an end to resistance . " a spokesman for palestinian president mahmud abbas said the ceasefire should be followed by a truce and the withdrawal of troops . international community welcomes plan un secretary-general ban ki-moon said he was relieved by the israeli declaration and also urged the jewish state to withdraw all of its troops as soon as possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in the gaza strip continued for 22 days before the israeli ceasefire announcement " i am relieved that the israeli government has decided to cease hostilities as of midnight gmt , " ban told reporters .
" this should be the first step leading to the full withdrawal of israeli troops from gaza . " olmert said hamas ' actions would determine whether israeli troops pull back . " this operation strengthened the deterrence of the state of israel in the face of all those who threaten us , " he said .
" if hamas completely stops its attacks , we will judge at what moment we will leave the gaza strip . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier welcomed the ceasefire and called on hamas to put a stop to all attacks . " this step finally opens a perspective to an end of violence in and around gaza , " he said on saturday .
" as soon as the weapons are silent , all steps must be taken to create a lasting truce .
i will continue to work to make sure germany and the eu support this process . " us secretary of state condoleezza said the us remained " deeply concerned by the suffering of innocent palestinians " and supported immediate international moves to increase flows of assistance into gaza . the united states " expects that all parties will cease attacks and hostile actions immediately , " rice said in a statement .
she also commended egypt for its efforts in reaching a ceasefire . egypt plans summit for sunday olmert 's announcement came after egyptian president hosni mubarak called for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the gaza strip on saturday .

but the palestinian militant group hamas said it would continue fighting until israeli troops withdrawal from the gaza strip . olmert said israel 's offensive in the gaza strip had achieved all its objectives and received promises of support from major european powers to help stop the smuggling of weapons into gaza . he told a news conference after the security cabinet voted to cease fire that some goals had been exceeded , hamas had been hit hard and its ability to fire rockets into israel had been severely limited . " at two o 'clock in the morning -lrb- midnight gmt -rrb- we will cease fire but we will continue to be deployed in gaza and its surroundings , " olmert said in a speech after the vote . " we have reached all the goals of the war , and beyond , " he added .
" if our enemies decide to strike and want to carry on then the israeli army will regard itself as free to respond with force . " under the ceasefire plan , israeli troops will remain in the territory with orders to respond if fired upon by palestinian militants . israel will restart military operations in gaza if needed , defense minister ehud barak added .
reporting on the start of the meeting , israel 's channel 10 television said the military commander had recommended concluding the campaign . the declaration could allow israel to conclude its massive offensive without entering into an agreement with the islamist hamas movement , which has ruled gaza since june 2007 and is sworn to the destruction of the jewish state . bildunterschrift : sections of rafah and other cities in the gaza strip have been destroyed hamas vows to fight on a hamas spokesman criticized israel for its unilateral approach . " it is an attempt to pre-empt the egyptian efforts and any other efforts that seek to achieve a withdrawal of the occupying forces , an end to the siege and a ceasefire , " hamas spokesman fawzi barhoum told reuters news agency . he added that hamas would continue to fight the troops left in the coastal strip until the blockade on the gaza strip was lifted . " a unilateral ceasefire does not mean ending the -lrb- israeli -rrb- aggression and ending the siege , " barhoum said in gaza .
" these constitute acts of war and so this will not mean an end to resistance . " a spokesman for palestinian president mahmud abbas said the ceasefire should be followed by a truce and the withdrawal of troops . international community welcomes plan un secretary-general ban ki-moon said he was relieved by the israeli declaration and also urged the jewish state to withdraw all of its troops as soon as possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in the gaza strip continued for 22 days before the israeli ceasefire announcement " i am relieved that the israeli government has decided to cease hostilities as of midnight gmt , " ban told reporters .
" this should be the first step leading to the full withdrawal of israeli troops from gaza . " olmert said hamas ' actions would determine whether israeli troops pull back . " this operation strengthened the deterrence of the state of israel in the face of all those who threaten us , " he said .
" if hamas completely stops its attacks , we will judge at what moment we will leave the gaza strip . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier welcomed the ceasefire and called on hamas to put a stop to all attacks . " this step finally opens a perspective to an end of violence in and around gaza , " he said on saturday .
" as soon as the weapons are silent , all steps must be taken to create a lasting truce .
i will continue to work to make sure germany and the eu support this process . " us secretary of state condoleezza said the us remained " deeply concerned by the suffering of innocent palestinians " and supported immediate international moves to increase flows of assistance into gaza . the united states " expects that all parties will cease attacks and hostile actions immediately , " rice said in a statement .
she also commended egypt for its efforts in reaching a ceasefire . egypt plans summit for sunday olmert 's announcement came after egyptian president hosni mubarak called for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the gaza strip on saturday .

foreign minister tzipi livni said friday that an end to the war " does n't have to be in agreement with hamas but rather in arrangements against hamas . "
she was in washington to sign a deal for us help in ensuring hamas no longer smuggles arms to gaza via egypt .
on saturday , hamas official osama abu hemdan warned that the islamist group would fight on if israel orders a unilateral ceasefire in gaza .
attacks continued in the early morning hours .
israeli warplanes reportedly hit about 50 targets during the night , including rocket-launching sites , tunnels under the gaza-egypt border as well as mosques used as points from where militants fired at israel .
israeli security council considers ceasefire olmert 's office on friday said there had been " significant progress " in talks in cairo , where an israeli delegation had been in discussions with egypt 's intelligence chief .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us pledged to help prevent hamas from smuggling arms israel and hamas , the islamist group which rules gaza , do not talk to each other directly but go through cairo , which has been pushing for a ceasefire based on a short-term humanitarian truce , followed by negotiations on a longer-term ceasefire that would include the israeli security concerns and the militants ' demand that the borders be opened .
the security cabinet vote would likely take place in the evening , after the end of the jewish sabbath , giving olmert and defense minister ehud barak time to discuss the proposal with their representatives who returned from two trips to cairo in two days .
there has been speculation that israel might opt for a unilateral cessation of hostilities , a move united nations secretary general ban ki-moon had also called for during his mideast tour .
hamas opposed to israeli stipulations khaled meshaal , hamas ' damascus-based political leader , said in doha , at a summit of arab leaders , that his organization would not accept israeli dictates on the ceasefire , and that the militant group " had not suffered a defeat " in the gaza fighting .
representatives of hamas on saturday were to meet with egyptian negotiators to discuss israel 's response to their stipulations .
hamas has offered a renewable one-year truce , on the condition that all israeli troops withdraw within one week and that border crossings between israel and egypt are opened .

18 , voters in hesse will go to the polls for the second time in 12 months to elect a new parliament .
opinion polls give merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- a comfortable lead over the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , junior partner in an uneasy coalition with the chancellor 's party in berlin .
the election comes as the country finds itself mired in recession , with unemployment rising , production declining and the government forced to pump tens of billions of euros into shoring up the economy .
replacing hesse 's caretaker government it also kicks off what germans are calling a super election year , with voting for five of the country 's 16 regional parliaments as well as elections for a new president in may and a general election on sept .
27 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch has toned down his rhetoric this time around hesse , one of germany 's most prosperous states where the banking center of frankfurt is located , has been administered by a caretaker government under cdu prime minister roland koch since inconclusive elections in january 2008 .
in that vote , the spd , led by andrea ypsilanti , narrowly failed to unseat koch , whose hard-hitting campaign targeting young criminals from ethnic minorities alienated many voters .
ypsilanti , 51 , then tried to topple the premier by forming a parliamentary alliance with the greens , backed by tacit support from the radical left party .
in so doing , she broke a campaign promise not to work with the left , an alliance of former east german communists and disgruntled social democrats from the west .
eroding support for spd this proved too much for four spd rebels , who withdrew their support a day before a crucial vote in parliament on nov .
4 , leaving their party leader without a majority .
ypsilanti was forced to make an embarrassing climbdown and agree to early elections .
since then , voter support for the spd has steadily eroded .
latest opinion polls show its ratings down to between 24 and 25 percent from 36.7 percent in the 2009 election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti came very close ... but lost her support the cdu , on the other hand , has seen its popularity grow to 41-42 percent from 36.8 percent last january .
with its preferred partner the free democrats tipped to win 13 percent , the two would have a comfortable majority in the 110-seat legislature in wiesbaden .
surveys show the greens also running at 13 percent , with the left hovering around the 5 percent needed to gain parliamentary representation , but not enough to from a workable majority with the spd .
koch 's challenger is thorsten schaefer-guembel , 39 , an spd back-bencher who was plucked from obscurity by ypsilanti to fight the election while she remained behind the scenes as party leader .
" he 's just the figure on the car radiator grille while ypsilanti remains firmly in the driving seat , " quipped koch , who has been premier for nearly a decade .
difference in platforms schaefer-guembel has sought to distance himself from his mentor and has put on a brave face when confronted with jokes about his double-barrelled name and thick spectacles .
both the cdu and the spd have pledged to invest more in education and infrastructure projects , but differ on energy policy and an expansion of frankfurt airport , one of europe 's busiest , a move which the spd opposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer-guembel : competitor or puppet ?
koch , 50 , has toned down his fiery rhetoric , concentrating instead on selling himself as a crisis manager at a time of growing economic uncertainty , a move that could make the cdu palatable to the greens if a broader-based coalition is necessary .
a victory for the cdu would give it a boost in confidence in the run-up to the general election after the setback it suffered in a state election in bavaria last september when its christian social union sister party lost its absolute majority .
test for general election ?
while the hesse vote might prove a reliable gauge of the mood of the electorate , leading politicians caution against viewing it as a test for the general election in eight months time .
" voters often leave it until the last moment before deciding which party to support , " said interior minister wolfgang schaeuble . dpa news agency -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sainz escaped unhurt and could have continued but navigator michel perin sustained a shoulder fracture . sainz had been in a tussle in the first week with qatari nassar al-attiyah of the x-raid team in a bmw who was disqualified for missing checkpoints while leading overall following the sixth stage . although a first dakar win at the sixth attempt for the volkswagen team , the 1980 paris-dakar rally was won by private competitors freddy kottulinsky and gerd loeffelmann in a vw iltis prepared by audi . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
she also said germany " would continue to maintain its commitment in afghanistan , " according to a statement . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also condemned the bombing as a " cowardly and barbaric act . " " we are not going to be deterred by terror from continuing our aid to the afghan people , " he said .
" it is not terrorism and violence that are the future of afghanistan but security and democracy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over a dozen civilians were injured in the attack the attack happened on a well-travelled civilian road , according to us military spokesman col. jerry o 'hara . " this incident will only strengthen our collective resolve to aggressively pursue enemy networks before they can hurt innocent afghans and coalition forces , " he added . taliban claims responsibility the taliban took responsibility for saturday 's bombing in a statement posted on the rebel web site and said that one of their bombers , named sham-ul-rahman , carried out the attack using a toyota corolla car filled with explosives . the statement claimed that eight german soldiers were killed in the attack , while several german diplomats were among the casualties .
the blast destroyed part of the german embassy building , according to the taliban 's statement . the blast blew out windows at the nearby us base , but military spokesman lt. col. christian kubik told the afp news agency there was no significant damage . the taliban are known to provide different accounts of their operations , which are often proven to be exaggerated or falsified . several vehicles including a passenger van and tanker in front of the embassy 's gate were ablaze and thick smoke was billowing from the area on saturday .
tolo , a private tv channel , showed several afghan municipal workers soaked in blood being rushed from the scene . the area , which is one of the city 's main intersections , was cordoned off by afghan and us military soldiers . taliban militants , who were driven out of power in a us-led invasion in late 2001 , have carried out hundreds of suicide attacks in the past seven years . the militants were responsible for more than 120 suicide bombings in 2008 in afghanistan .
more than 50 people including two indian diplomats were killed in a suicide attack against the indian embassy in july last year . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the company says it will focus more on hybrid models , as well as smaller and more efficient engines . luxury german car manufacturing group daimler is increasing its work on energy-efficient automobiles .
chief executive dieter zetsche said at the north american international auto show in detroit this week that the company planned to roll out at least one new hybrid vehicle per year . " despite the enormous pressures that our entire industry is under these days , we are facing the year 2009 with measured confidence , " zetsche said . the first hybrid - which combines electric and internal combustion engines - will be the top-of-the-line s400 bluehybrid executive sedan in 2009 .
it is reported to be the first mainstream hybrid car to use a lithium-ion battery pack . according to the german economic news weekly magazine wirtschaftswoche , daimler aims to have reduced its cars ' exhaust emissions by 2012 to 136-138 milligrams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by using hybrid models , as well as smaller and more efficient engines .
this would nearly achieve the european union commission target of 130 mg / kilometer . in late 2007 , daimler 's mercedes and smart cars ' average carbon dioxide emissions were at 180 mg / kilometer , the dusseldorf-based magazine said . taking advantage of a growth opportunity " from 2012 , we will offer our customers all standard series from the c-class up with optional hybrid technology , " thomas weber , daimler 's director of research and development , told the business daily handelsblatt earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi also presented a hybrid model in detroit this also included the popular full-size model e-class , which was re-launched this year and unveiled at the detroit show .

the next generation of the s-class mercedes , due to be introduced in 2013 , is to be exclusively hybrid-powered , it said . " whoever does n't invest in alternative engines is missing a growth opportunity , " weber said . affordable electric cars pose a challenge daimler also introduced the prototype for an electric vehicle called bluezero at the detroit auto show .
the three bluezero versions are based on the sandwich-floor architecture which the carmaker initially introduced for the a-class . the vehicles will utilize lithium-ion batteries , which are already widely used in consumer electronics but are being adapted to meet automotive requirements .
the car will be able to drive 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- on a single charge , or 400 kilometers for a hybrid version that relies on a small combustion engine to recharge its battery .
all three variants accelerate from 0 to 100 km / h in less than 11 seconds .
the top speed is electronically limited to 150 km / h . but mass production is " a few years " away , said weber .
daimler still faced two challenges in manufacturing electric vehicles : making it affordable , and building up public infrastructure to charge the car 's batteries . daimler last month took a 49 percent stake in the lithium-ion battery unit of essen-based industrial group evonik . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this would nearly achieve the european union commission target of 130 mg / kilometer . in late 2007 , daimler 's mercedes and smart cars ' average carbon dioxide emissions were at 180 mg / kilometer , the dusseldorf-based magazine said . taking advantage of a growth opportunity " from 2012 , we will offer our customers all standard series from the c-class up with optional hybrid technology , " thomas weber , daimler 's director of research and development , told the business daily handelsblatt earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi also presented a hybrid model in detroit this also included the popular full-size model e-class , which was re-launched this year and unveiled at the detroit show .
it will be available with a hybrid engine starting in 2011 , wirtschaftswoche said .
the next generation of the s-class mercedes , due to be introduced in 2013 , is to be exclusively hybrid-powered , it said . " whoever does n't invest in alternative engines is missing a growth opportunity , " weber said . affordable electric cars pose a challenge daimler also introduced the prototype for an electric vehicle called bluezero at the detroit auto show .
the three bluezero versions are based on the sandwich-floor architecture which the carmaker initially introduced for the a-class . the vehicles will utilize lithium-ion batteries , which are already widely used in consumer electronics but are being adapted to meet automotive requirements .
the car will be able to drive 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- on a single charge , or 400 kilometers for a hybrid version that relies on a small combustion engine to recharge its battery .
all three variants accelerate from 0 to 100 km / h in less than 11 seconds .
the top speed is electronically limited to 150 km / h . but mass production is " a few years " away , said weber .
daimler still faced two challenges in manufacturing electric vehicles : making it affordable , and building up public infrastructure to charge the car 's batteries . daimler last month took a 49 percent stake in the lithium-ion battery unit of essen-based industrial group evonik . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the company says it will focus more on hybrid models , as well as smaller and more efficient engines . luxury german car manufacturing group daimler is increasing its work on energy-efficient automobiles .
chief executive dieter zetsche said at the north american international auto show in detroit this week that the company planned to roll out at least one new hybrid vehicle per year . " despite the enormous pressures that our entire industry is under these days , we are facing the year 2009 with measured confidence , " zetsche said . the first hybrid - which combines electric and internal combustion engines - will be the top-of-the-line s400 bluehybrid executive sedan in 2009 .
it is reported to be the first mainstream hybrid car to use a lithium-ion battery pack . according to the german economic news weekly magazine wirtschaftswoche , daimler aims to have reduced its cars ' exhaust emissions by 2012 to 136-138 milligrams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by using hybrid models , as well as smaller and more efficient engines .
this would nearly achieve the european union commission target of 130 mg / kilometer . in late 2007 , daimler 's mercedes and smart cars ' average carbon dioxide emissions were at 180 mg / kilometer , the dusseldorf-based magazine said . taking advantage of a growth opportunity " from 2012 , we will offer our customers all standard series from the c-class up with optional hybrid technology , " thomas weber , daimler 's director of research and development , told the business daily handelsblatt earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi also presented a hybrid model in detroit this also included the popular full-size model e-class , which was re-launched this year and unveiled at the detroit show .
it will be available with a hybrid engine starting in 2011 , wirtschaftswoche said .
the next generation of the s-class mercedes , due to be introduced in 2013 , is to be exclusively hybrid-powered , it said . " whoever does n't invest in alternative engines is missing a growth opportunity , " weber said . affordable electric cars pose a challenge daimler also introduced the prototype for an electric vehicle called bluezero at the detroit auto show .
the three bluezero versions are based on the sandwich-floor architecture which the carmaker initially introduced for the a-class . the vehicles will utilize lithium-ion batteries , which are already widely used in consumer electronics but are being adapted to meet automotive requirements .
the car will be able to drive 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- on a single charge , or 400 kilometers for a hybrid version that relies on a small combustion engine to recharge its battery .
all three variants accelerate from 0 to 100 km / h in less than 11 seconds .
the top speed is electronically limited to 150 km / h . but mass production is " a few years " away , said weber .
daimler still faced two challenges in manufacturing electric vehicles : making it affordable , and building up public infrastructure to charge the car 's batteries . daimler last month took a 49 percent stake in the lithium-ion battery unit of essen-based industrial group evonik . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , voters in hesse will go to the polls for the second time in 12 months to elect a new parliament .
opinion polls give merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- a comfortable lead over the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , junior partner in an uneasy coalition with the chancellor 's party in berlin .
the election comes as the country finds itself mired in recession , with unemployment rising , production declining and the government forced to pump tens of billions of euros into shoring up the economy .
replacing hesse 's caretaker government it also kicks off what germans are calling a super election year , with voting for five of the country 's 16 regional parliaments as well as elections for a new president in may and a general election on sept .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch has toned down his rhetoric this time around hesse , one of germany 's most prosperous states where the banking center of frankfurt is located , has been administered by a caretaker government under cdu prime minister roland koch since inconclusive elections in january 2008 .
in that vote , the spd , led by andrea ypsilanti , narrowly failed to unseat koch , whose hard-hitting campaign targeting young criminals from ethnic minorities alienated many voters .
ypsilanti , 51 , then tried to topple the premier by forming a parliamentary alliance with the greens , backed by tacit support from the radical left party .
in so doing , she broke a campaign promise not to work with the left , an alliance of former east german communists and disgruntled social democrats from the west .
eroding support for spd this proved too much for four spd rebels , who withdrew their support a day before a crucial vote in parliament on nov .
4 , leaving their party leader without a majority .
ypsilanti was forced to make an embarrassing climbdown and agree to early elections .
since then , voter support for the spd has steadily eroded .
latest opinion polls show its ratings down to between 24 and 25 percent from 36.7 percent in the 2009 election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti came very close ... but lost her support the cdu , on the other hand , has seen its popularity grow to 41-42 percent from 36.8 percent last january .
with its preferred partner the free democrats tipped to win 13 percent , the two would have a comfortable majority in the 110-seat legislature in wiesbaden .
surveys show the greens also running at 13 percent , with the left hovering around the 5 percent needed to gain parliamentary representation , but not enough to from a workable majority with the spd .
koch 's challenger is thorsten schaefer-guembel , 39 , an spd back-bencher who was plucked from obscurity by ypsilanti to fight the election while she remained behind the scenes as party leader .
" he 's just the figure on the car radiator grille while ypsilanti remains firmly in the driving seat , " quipped koch , who has been premier for nearly a decade .
difference in platforms schaefer-guembel has sought to distance himself from his mentor and has put on a brave face when confronted with jokes about his double-barrelled name and thick spectacles .
both the cdu and the spd have pledged to invest more in education and infrastructure projects , but differ on energy policy and an expansion of frankfurt airport , one of europe 's busiest , a move which the spd opposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer-guembel : competitor or puppet ?
koch , 50 , has toned down his fiery rhetoric , concentrating instead on selling himself as a crisis manager at a time of growing economic uncertainty , a move that could make the cdu palatable to the greens if a broader-based coalition is necessary .
a victory for the cdu would give it a boost in confidence in the run-up to the general election after the setback it suffered in a state election in bavaria last september when its christian social union sister party lost its absolute majority .
test for general election ?
while the hesse vote might prove a reliable gauge of the mood of the electorate , leading politicians caution against viewing it as a test for the general election in eight months time .
" voters often leave it until the last moment before deciding which party to support , " said interior minister wolfgang schaeuble . dpa news agency -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch has toned down his rhetoric this time around hesse , one of germany 's most prosperous states where the banking center of frankfurt is located , has been administered by a caretaker government under cdu prime minister roland koch since inconclusive elections in january 2008 .
in that vote , the spd , led by andrea ypsilanti , narrowly failed to unseat koch , whose hard-hitting campaign targeting young criminals from ethnic minorities alienated many voters .
ypsilanti , 51 , then tried to topple the premier by forming a parliamentary alliance with the greens , backed by tacit support from the radical left party .
in so doing , she broke a campaign promise not to work with the left , an alliance of former east german communists and disgruntled social democrats from the west .
eroding support for spd this proved too much for four spd rebels , who withdrew their support a day before a crucial vote in parliament on nov .
4 , leaving their party leader without a majority .
ypsilanti was forced to make an embarrassing climbdown and agree to early elections .
since then , voter support for the spd has steadily eroded .
latest opinion polls show its ratings down to between 24 and 25 percent from 36.7 percent in the 2009 election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti came very close ... but lost her support the cdu , on the other hand , has seen its popularity grow to 41-42 percent from 36.8 percent last january .
with its preferred partner the free democrats tipped to win 13 percent , the two would have a comfortable majority in the 110-seat legislature in wiesbaden .
surveys show the greens also running at 13 percent , with the left hovering around the 5 percent needed to gain parliamentary representation , but not enough to from a workable majority with the spd .
koch 's challenger is thorsten schaefer-guembel , 39 , an spd back-bencher who was plucked from obscurity by ypsilanti to fight the election while she remained behind the scenes as party leader .
" he 's just the figure on the car radiator grille while ypsilanti remains firmly in the driving seat , " quipped koch , who has been premier for nearly a decade .
difference in platforms schaefer-guembel has sought to distance himself from his mentor and has put on a brave face when confronted with jokes about his double-barrelled name and thick spectacles .
both the cdu and the spd have pledged to invest more in education and infrastructure projects , but differ on energy policy and an expansion of frankfurt airport , one of europe 's busiest , a move which the spd opposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer-guembel : competitor or puppet ?
koch , 50 , has toned down his fiery rhetoric , concentrating instead on selling himself as a crisis manager at a time of growing economic uncertainty , a move that could make the cdu palatable to the greens if a broader-based coalition is necessary .
a victory for the cdu would give it a boost in confidence in the run-up to the general election after the setback it suffered in a state election in bavaria last september when its christian social union sister party lost its absolute majority .
test for general election ?
while the hesse vote might prove a reliable gauge of the mood of the electorate , leading politicians caution against viewing it as a test for the general election in eight months time .

surveys show the greens also running at 13 percent , with the left hovering around the 5 percent needed to gain parliamentary representation , but not enough to from a workable majority with the spd .
koch 's challenger is thorsten schaefer-guembel , 39 , an spd back-bencher who was plucked from obscurity by ypsilanti to fight the election while she remained behind the scenes as party leader .
" he 's just the figure on the car radiator grille while ypsilanti remains firmly in the driving seat , " quipped koch , who has been premier for nearly a decade .
difference in platforms schaefer-guembel has sought to distance himself from his mentor and has put on a brave face when confronted with jokes about his double-barrelled name and thick spectacles .
both the cdu and the spd have pledged to invest more in education and infrastructure projects , but differ on energy policy and an expansion of frankfurt airport , one of europe 's busiest , a move which the spd opposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer-guembel : competitor or puppet ?
koch , 50 , has toned down his fiery rhetoric , concentrating instead on selling himself as a crisis manager at a time of growing economic uncertainty , a move that could make the cdu palatable to the greens if a broader-based coalition is necessary .
a victory for the cdu would give it a boost in confidence in the run-up to the general election after the setback it suffered in a state election in bavaria last september when its christian social union sister party lost its absolute majority .
test for general election ?
while the hesse vote might prove a reliable gauge of the mood of the electorate , leading politicians caution against viewing it as a test for the general election in eight months time .
" voters often leave it until the last moment before deciding which party to support , " said interior minister wolfgang schaeuble . dpa news agency -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the palestinian militant group hamas said it would continue fighting until israeli troops withdrawal from the gaza strip . olmert said israel 's offensive in the gaza strip had achieved all its objectives and received promises of support from major european powers to help stop the smuggling of weapons into gaza . he told a news conference after the security cabinet voted to cease fire that some goals had been exceeded , hamas had been hit hard and its ability to fire rockets into israel had been severely limited . " at two o 'clock in the morning -lrb- midnight gmt -rrb- we will cease fire but we will continue to be deployed in gaza and its surroundings , " olmert said in a speech after the vote . " we have reached all the goals of the war , and beyond , " he added .
" if our enemies decide to strike and want to carry on then the israeli army will regard itself as free to respond with force . " under the ceasefire plan , israeli troops will remain in the territory with orders to respond if fired upon by palestinian militants . israel will restart military operations in gaza if needed , defense minister ehud barak added .
reporting on the start of the meeting , israel 's channel 10 television said the military commander had recommended concluding the campaign . the declaration could allow israel to conclude its massive offensive without entering into an agreement with the islamist hamas movement , which has ruled gaza since june 2007 and is sworn to the destruction of the jewish state . bildunterschrift : sections of rafah and other cities in the gaza strip have been destroyed hamas vows to fight on a hamas spokesman criticized israel for its unilateral approach . " it is an attempt to pre-empt the egyptian efforts and any other efforts that seek to achieve a withdrawal of the occupying forces , an end to the siege and a ceasefire , " hamas spokesman fawzi barhoum told reuters news agency . he added that hamas would continue to fight the troops left in the coastal strip until the blockade on the gaza strip was lifted . " a unilateral ceasefire does not mean ending the -lrb- israeli -rrb- aggression and ending the siege , " barhoum said in gaza .
" these constitute acts of war and so this will not mean an end to resistance . " a spokesman for palestinian president mahmud abbas said the ceasefire should be followed by a truce and the withdrawal of troops . international community welcomes plan un secretary-general ban ki-moon said he was relieved by the israeli declaration and also urged the jewish state to withdraw all of its troops as soon as possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in the gaza strip continued for 22 days before the israeli ceasefire announcement " i am relieved that the israeli government has decided to cease hostilities as of midnight gmt , " ban told reporters .
" this should be the first step leading to the full withdrawal of israeli troops from gaza . " olmert said hamas ' actions would determine whether israeli troops pull back . " this operation strengthened the deterrence of the state of israel in the face of all those who threaten us , " he said .
" if hamas completely stops its attacks , we will judge at what moment we will leave the gaza strip . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier welcomed the ceasefire and called on hamas to put a stop to all attacks . " this step finally opens a perspective to an end of violence in and around gaza , " he said on saturday .
" as soon as the weapons are silent , all steps must be taken to create a lasting truce .
i will continue to work to make sure germany and the eu support this process . " us secretary of state condoleezza said the us remained " deeply concerned by the suffering of innocent palestinians " and supported immediate international moves to increase flows of assistance into gaza . the united states " expects that all parties will cease attacks and hostile actions immediately , " rice said in a statement .
she also commended egypt for its efforts in reaching a ceasefire . egypt plans summit for sunday olmert 's announcement came after egyptian president hosni mubarak called for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the gaza strip on saturday . " i ask israel today to end its military operations immediately , " mubarak said in an address on state television .

the company says it will focus more on hybrid models , as well as smaller and more efficient engines . luxury german car manufacturing group daimler is increasing its work on energy-efficient automobiles .
chief executive dieter zetsche said at the north american international auto show in detroit this week that the company planned to roll out at least one new hybrid vehicle per year . " despite the enormous pressures that our entire industry is under these days , we are facing the year 2009 with measured confidence , " zetsche said . the first hybrid - which combines electric and internal combustion engines - will be the top-of-the-line s400 bluehybrid executive sedan in 2009 .
it is reported to be the first mainstream hybrid car to use a lithium-ion battery pack . according to the german economic news weekly magazine wirtschaftswoche , daimler aims to have reduced its cars ' exhaust emissions by 2012 to 136-138 milligrams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by using hybrid models , as well as smaller and more efficient engines .
this would nearly achieve the european union commission target of 130 mg / kilometer . in late 2007 , daimler 's mercedes and smart cars ' average carbon dioxide emissions were at 180 mg / kilometer , the dusseldorf-based magazine said . taking advantage of a growth opportunity " from 2012 , we will offer our customers all standard series from the c-class up with optional hybrid technology , " thomas weber , daimler 's director of research and development , told the business daily handelsblatt earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi also presented a hybrid model in detroit this also included the popular full-size model e-class , which was re-launched this year and unveiled at the detroit show .
it will be available with a hybrid engine starting in 2011 , wirtschaftswoche said .
the next generation of the s-class mercedes , due to be introduced in 2013 , is to be exclusively hybrid-powered , it said . " whoever does n't invest in alternative engines is missing a growth opportunity , " weber said . affordable electric cars pose a challenge daimler also introduced the prototype for an electric vehicle called bluezero at the detroit auto show .
the three bluezero versions are based on the sandwich-floor architecture which the carmaker initially introduced for the a-class . the vehicles will utilize lithium-ion batteries , which are already widely used in consumer electronics but are being adapted to meet automotive requirements .
the car will be able to drive 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- on a single charge , or 400 kilometers for a hybrid version that relies on a small combustion engine to recharge its battery .
all three variants accelerate from 0 to 100 km / h in less than 11 seconds .
the top speed is electronically limited to 150 km / h . but mass production is " a few years " away , said weber .
daimler still faced two challenges in manufacturing electric vehicles : making it affordable , and building up public infrastructure to charge the car 's batteries . daimler last month took a 49 percent stake in the lithium-ion battery unit of essen-based industrial group evonik . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the company says it will focus more on hybrid models , as well as smaller and more efficient engines . luxury german car manufacturing group daimler is increasing its work on energy-efficient automobiles .
chief executive dieter zetsche said at the north american international auto show in detroit this week that the company planned to roll out at least one new hybrid vehicle per year . " despite the enormous pressures that our entire industry is under these days , we are facing the year 2009 with measured confidence , " zetsche said . the first hybrid - which combines electric and internal combustion engines - will be the top-of-the-line s400 bluehybrid executive sedan in 2009 .
it is reported to be the first mainstream hybrid car to use a lithium-ion battery pack . according to the german economic news weekly magazine wirtschaftswoche , daimler aims to have reduced its cars ' exhaust emissions by 2012 to 136-138 milligrams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by using hybrid models , as well as smaller and more efficient engines .
this would nearly achieve the european union commission target of 130 mg / kilometer . in late 2007 , daimler 's mercedes and smart cars ' average carbon dioxide emissions were at 180 mg / kilometer , the dusseldorf-based magazine said . taking advantage of a growth opportunity " from 2012 , we will offer our customers all standard series from the c-class up with optional hybrid technology , " thomas weber , daimler 's director of research and development , told the business daily handelsblatt earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi also presented a hybrid model in detroit this also included the popular full-size model e-class , which was re-launched this year and unveiled at the detroit show .
it will be available with a hybrid engine starting in 2011 , wirtschaftswoche said .
the next generation of the s-class mercedes , due to be introduced in 2013 , is to be exclusively hybrid-powered , it said . " whoever does n't invest in alternative engines is missing a growth opportunity , " weber said . affordable electric cars pose a challenge daimler also introduced the prototype for an electric vehicle called bluezero at the detroit auto show .
the three bluezero versions are based on the sandwich-floor architecture which the carmaker initially introduced for the a-class . the vehicles will utilize lithium-ion batteries , which are already widely used in consumer electronics but are being adapted to meet automotive requirements .
the car will be able to drive 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- on a single charge , or 400 kilometers for a hybrid version that relies on a small combustion engine to recharge its battery .
all three variants accelerate from 0 to 100 km / h in less than 11 seconds .
the top speed is electronically limited to 150 km / h . but mass production is " a few years " away , said weber .
daimler still faced two challenges in manufacturing electric vehicles : making it affordable , and building up public infrastructure to charge the car 's batteries . daimler last month took a 49 percent stake in the lithium-ion battery unit of essen-based industrial group evonik . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the palestinian militant group hamas said it would continue fighting until israeli troops withdrawal from the gaza strip . olmert said israel 's offensive in the gaza strip had achieved all its objectives and received promises of support from major european powers to help stop the smuggling of weapons into gaza . he told a news conference after the security cabinet voted to cease fire that some goals had been exceeded , hamas had been hit hard and its ability to fire rockets into israel had been severely limited . " at two o 'clock in the morning -lrb- midnight gmt -rrb- we will cease fire but we will continue to be deployed in gaza and its surroundings , " olmert said in a speech after the vote . " we have reached all the goals of the war , and beyond , " he added .
" if our enemies decide to strike and want to carry on then the israeli army will regard itself as free to respond with force . " under the ceasefire plan , israeli troops will remain in the territory with orders to respond if fired upon by palestinian militants . israel will restart military operations in gaza if needed , defense minister ehud barak added .
reporting on the start of the meeting , israel 's channel 10 television said the military commander had recommended concluding the campaign . the declaration could allow israel to conclude its massive offensive without entering into an agreement with the islamist hamas movement , which has ruled gaza since june 2007 and is sworn to the destruction of the jewish state . bildunterschrift : sections of rafah and other cities in the gaza strip have been destroyed hamas vows to fight on a hamas spokesman criticized israel for its unilateral approach . " it is an attempt to pre-empt the egyptian efforts and any other efforts that seek to achieve a withdrawal of the occupying forces , an end to the siege and a ceasefire , " hamas spokesman fawzi barhoum told reuters news agency . he added that hamas would continue to fight the troops left in the coastal strip until the blockade on the gaza strip was lifted .

the security cabinet vote would likely take place in the evening , after the end of the jewish sabbath , giving olmert and defense minister ehud barak time to discuss the proposal with their representatives who returned from two trips to cairo in two days .

"
she also said germany " would continue to maintain its commitment in afghanistan , " according to a statement . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also condemned the bombing as a " cowardly and barbaric act . " " we are not going to be deterred by terror from continuing our aid to the afghan people , " he said .
" it is not terrorism and violence that are the future of afghanistan but security and democracy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over a dozen civilians were injured in the attack the attack happened on a well-travelled civilian road , according to us military spokesman col. jerry o 'hara . " this incident will only strengthen our collective resolve to aggressively pursue enemy networks before they can hurt innocent afghans and coalition forces , " he added . taliban claims responsibility the taliban took responsibility for saturday 's bombing in a statement posted on the rebel web site and said that one of their bombers , named sham-ul-rahman , carried out the attack using a toyota corolla car filled with explosives . the statement claimed that eight german soldiers were killed in the attack , while several german diplomats were among the casualties .
the blast destroyed part of the german embassy building , according to the taliban 's statement . the blast blew out windows at the nearby us base , but military spokesman lt. col. christian kubik told the afp news agency there was no significant damage . the taliban are known to provide different accounts of their operations , which are often proven to be exaggerated or falsified . several vehicles including a passenger van and tanker in front of the embassy 's gate were ablaze and thick smoke was billowing from the area on saturday .
tolo , a private tv channel , showed several afghan municipal workers soaked in blood being rushed from the scene . the area , which is one of the city 's main intersections , was cordoned off by afghan and us military soldiers . taliban militants , who were driven out of power in a us-led invasion in late 2001 , have carried out hundreds of suicide attacks in the past seven years . the militants were responsible for more than 120 suicide bombings in 2008 in afghanistan .
more than 50 people including two indian diplomats were killed in a suicide attack against the indian embassy in july last year . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the company says it will focus more on hybrid models , as well as smaller and more efficient engines . luxury german car manufacturing group daimler is increasing its work on energy-efficient automobiles .
chief executive dieter zetsche said at the north american international auto show in detroit this week that the company planned to roll out at least one new hybrid vehicle per year . " despite the enormous pressures that our entire industry is under these days , we are facing the year 2009 with measured confidence , " zetsche said . the first hybrid - which combines electric and internal combustion engines - will be the top-of-the-line s400 bluehybrid executive sedan in 2009 .
it is reported to be the first mainstream hybrid car to use a lithium-ion battery pack . according to the german economic news weekly magazine wirtschaftswoche , daimler aims to have reduced its cars ' exhaust emissions by 2012 to 136-138 milligrams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by using hybrid models , as well as smaller and more efficient engines .
this would nearly achieve the european union commission target of 130 mg / kilometer . in late 2007 , daimler 's mercedes and smart cars ' average carbon dioxide emissions were at 180 mg / kilometer , the dusseldorf-based magazine said . taking advantage of a growth opportunity " from 2012 , we will offer our customers all standard series from the c-class up with optional hybrid technology , " thomas weber , daimler 's director of research and development , told the business daily handelsblatt earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi also presented a hybrid model in detroit this also included the popular full-size model e-class , which was re-launched this year and unveiled at the detroit show .
it will be available with a hybrid engine starting in 2011 , wirtschaftswoche said .
the next generation of the s-class mercedes , due to be introduced in 2013 , is to be exclusively hybrid-powered , it said . " whoever does n't invest in alternative engines is missing a growth opportunity , " weber said . affordable electric cars pose a challenge daimler also introduced the prototype for an electric vehicle called bluezero at the detroit auto show .
the three bluezero versions are based on the sandwich-floor architecture which the carmaker initially introduced for the a-class . the vehicles will utilize lithium-ion batteries , which are already widely used in consumer electronics but are being adapted to meet automotive requirements .
the car will be able to drive 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- on a single charge , or 400 kilometers for a hybrid version that relies on a small combustion engine to recharge its battery .
all three variants accelerate from 0 to 100 km / h in less than 11 seconds .
the top speed is electronically limited to 150 km / h . but mass production is " a few years " away , said weber .
daimler still faced two challenges in manufacturing electric vehicles : making it affordable , and building up public infrastructure to charge the car 's batteries . daimler last month took a 49 percent stake in the lithium-ion battery unit of essen-based industrial group evonik . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the company says it will focus more on hybrid models , as well as smaller and more efficient engines . luxury german car manufacturing group daimler is increasing its work on energy-efficient automobiles .
chief executive dieter zetsche said at the north american international auto show in detroit this week that the company planned to roll out at least one new hybrid vehicle per year . " despite the enormous pressures that our entire industry is under these days , we are facing the year 2009 with measured confidence , " zetsche said . the first hybrid - which combines electric and internal combustion engines - will be the top-of-the-line s400 bluehybrid executive sedan in 2009 .
it is reported to be the first mainstream hybrid car to use a lithium-ion battery pack . according to the german economic news weekly magazine wirtschaftswoche , daimler aims to have reduced its cars ' exhaust emissions by 2012 to 136-138 milligrams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by using hybrid models , as well as smaller and more efficient engines .
this would nearly achieve the european union commission target of 130 mg / kilometer . in late 2007 , daimler 's mercedes and smart cars ' average carbon dioxide emissions were at 180 mg / kilometer , the dusseldorf-based magazine said . taking advantage of a growth opportunity " from 2012 , we will offer our customers all standard series from the c-class up with optional hybrid technology , " thomas weber , daimler 's director of research and development , told the business daily handelsblatt earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi also presented a hybrid model in detroit this also included the popular full-size model e-class , which was re-launched this year and unveiled at the detroit show .
it will be available with a hybrid engine starting in 2011 , wirtschaftswoche said .
the next generation of the s-class mercedes , due to be introduced in 2013 , is to be exclusively hybrid-powered , it said . " whoever does n't invest in alternative engines is missing a growth opportunity , " weber said . affordable electric cars pose a challenge daimler also introduced the prototype for an electric vehicle called bluezero at the detroit auto show .
the three bluezero versions are based on the sandwich-floor architecture which the carmaker initially introduced for the a-class . the vehicles will utilize lithium-ion batteries , which are already widely used in consumer electronics but are being adapted to meet automotive requirements .
the car will be able to drive 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- on a single charge , or 400 kilometers for a hybrid version that relies on a small combustion engine to recharge its battery .
all three variants accelerate from 0 to 100 km / h in less than 11 seconds .
the top speed is electronically limited to 150 km / h . but mass production is " a few years " away , said weber .
daimler still faced two challenges in manufacturing electric vehicles : making it affordable , and building up public infrastructure to charge the car 's batteries . daimler last month took a 49 percent stake in the lithium-ion battery unit of essen-based industrial group evonik . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the company says it will focus more on hybrid models , as well as smaller and more efficient engines . luxury german car manufacturing group daimler is increasing its work on energy-efficient automobiles .
chief executive dieter zetsche said at the north american international auto show in detroit this week that the company planned to roll out at least one new hybrid vehicle per year . " despite the enormous pressures that our entire industry is under these days , we are facing the year 2009 with measured confidence , " zetsche said . the first hybrid - which combines electric and internal combustion engines - will be the top-of-the-line s400 bluehybrid executive sedan in 2009 .
it is reported to be the first mainstream hybrid car to use a lithium-ion battery pack . according to the german economic news weekly magazine wirtschaftswoche , daimler aims to have reduced its cars ' exhaust emissions by 2012 to 136-138 milligrams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by using hybrid models , as well as smaller and more efficient engines .
this would nearly achieve the european union commission target of 130 mg / kilometer . in late 2007 , daimler 's mercedes and smart cars ' average carbon dioxide emissions were at 180 mg / kilometer , the dusseldorf-based magazine said . taking advantage of a growth opportunity " from 2012 , we will offer our customers all standard series from the c-class up with optional hybrid technology , " thomas weber , daimler 's director of research and development , told the business daily handelsblatt earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi also presented a hybrid model in detroit this also included the popular full-size model e-class , which was re-launched this year and unveiled at the detroit show .
it will be available with a hybrid engine starting in 2011 , wirtschaftswoche said .
the next generation of the s-class mercedes , due to be introduced in 2013 , is to be exclusively hybrid-powered , it said . " whoever does n't invest in alternative engines is missing a growth opportunity , " weber said . affordable electric cars pose a challenge daimler also introduced the prototype for an electric vehicle called bluezero at the detroit auto show .
the three bluezero versions are based on the sandwich-floor architecture which the carmaker initially introduced for the a-class . the vehicles will utilize lithium-ion batteries , which are already widely used in consumer electronics but are being adapted to meet automotive requirements .
the car will be able to drive 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- on a single charge , or 400 kilometers for a hybrid version that relies on a small combustion engine to recharge its battery .
all three variants accelerate from 0 to 100 km / h in less than 11 seconds .
the top speed is electronically limited to 150 km / h . but mass production is " a few years " away , said weber .
daimler still faced two challenges in manufacturing electric vehicles : making it affordable , and building up public infrastructure to charge the car 's batteries . daimler last month took a 49 percent stake in the lithium-ion battery unit of essen-based industrial group evonik . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
she also said germany " would continue to maintain its commitment in afghanistan , " according to a statement . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also condemned the bombing as a " cowardly and barbaric act . " " we are not going to be deterred by terror from continuing our aid to the afghan people , " he said .
" it is not terrorism and violence that are the future of afghanistan but security and democracy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over a dozen civilians were injured in the attack the attack happened on a well-travelled civilian road , according to us military spokesman col. jerry o 'hara . " this incident will only strengthen our collective resolve to aggressively pursue enemy networks before they can hurt innocent afghans and coalition forces , " he added . taliban claims responsibility the taliban took responsibility for saturday 's bombing in a statement posted on the rebel web site and said that one of their bombers , named sham-ul-rahman , carried out the attack using a toyota corolla car filled with explosives . the statement claimed that eight german soldiers were killed in the attack , while several german diplomats were among the casualties .
the blast destroyed part of the german embassy building , according to the taliban 's statement . the blast blew out windows at the nearby us base , but military spokesman lt. col. christian kubik told the afp news agency there was no significant damage . the taliban are known to provide different accounts of their operations , which are often proven to be exaggerated or falsified . several vehicles including a passenger van and tanker in front of the embassy 's gate were ablaze and thick smoke was billowing from the area on saturday .
tolo , a private tv channel , showed several afghan municipal workers soaked in blood being rushed from the scene . the area , which is one of the city 's main intersections , was cordoned off by afghan and us military soldiers . taliban militants , who were driven out of power in a us-led invasion in late 2001 , have carried out hundreds of suicide attacks in the past seven years . the militants were responsible for more than 120 suicide bombings in 2008 in afghanistan .

foreign minister tzipi livni said friday that an end to the war " does n't have to be in agreement with hamas but rather in arrangements against hamas . "
she was in washington to sign a deal for us help in ensuring hamas no longer smuggles arms to gaza via egypt .
on saturday , hamas official osama abu hemdan warned that the islamist group would fight on if israel orders a unilateral ceasefire in gaza .
attacks continued in the early morning hours .
israeli warplanes reportedly hit about 50 targets during the night , including rocket-launching sites , tunnels under the gaza-egypt border as well as mosques used as points from where militants fired at israel .

the security cabinet vote would likely take place in the evening , after the end of the jewish sabbath , giving olmert and defense minister ehud barak time to discuss the proposal with their representatives who returned from two trips to cairo in two days .
there has been speculation that israel might opt for a unilateral cessation of hostilities , a move united nations secretary general ban ki-moon had also called for during his mideast tour .
hamas opposed to israeli stipulations khaled meshaal , hamas ' damascus-based political leader , said in doha , at a summit of arab leaders , that his organization would not accept israeli dictates on the ceasefire , and that the militant group " had not suffered a defeat " in the gaza fighting .
representatives of hamas on saturday were to meet with egyptian negotiators to discuss israel 's response to their stipulations .
hamas has offered a renewable one-year truce , on the condition that all israeli troops withdraw within one week and that border crossings between israel and egypt are opened .

but the palestinian militant group hamas said it would continue fighting until israeli troops withdrawal from the gaza strip . olmert said israel 's offensive in the gaza strip had achieved all its objectives and received promises of support from major european powers to help stop the smuggling of weapons into gaza . he told a news conference after the security cabinet voted to cease fire that some goals had been exceeded , hamas had been hit hard and its ability to fire rockets into israel had been severely limited . " at two o 'clock in the morning -lrb- midnight gmt -rrb- we will cease fire but we will continue to be deployed in gaza and its surroundings , " olmert said in a speech after the vote . " we have reached all the goals of the war , and beyond , " he added .
" if our enemies decide to strike and want to carry on then the israeli army will regard itself as free to respond with force . " under the ceasefire plan , israeli troops will remain in the territory with orders to respond if fired upon by palestinian militants . israel will restart military operations in gaza if needed , defense minister ehud barak added .
reporting on the start of the meeting , israel 's channel 10 television said the military commander had recommended concluding the campaign . the declaration could allow israel to conclude its massive offensive without entering into an agreement with the islamist hamas movement , which has ruled gaza since june 2007 and is sworn to the destruction of the jewish state . bildunterschrift : sections of rafah and other cities in the gaza strip have been destroyed hamas vows to fight on a hamas spokesman criticized israel for its unilateral approach . " it is an attempt to pre-empt the egyptian efforts and any other efforts that seek to achieve a withdrawal of the occupying forces , an end to the siege and a ceasefire , " hamas spokesman fawzi barhoum told reuters news agency . he added that hamas would continue to fight the troops left in the coastal strip until the blockade on the gaza strip was lifted . " a unilateral ceasefire does not mean ending the -lrb- israeli -rrb- aggression and ending the siege , " barhoum said in gaza .
" these constitute acts of war and so this will not mean an end to resistance . " a spokesman for palestinian president mahmud abbas said the ceasefire should be followed by a truce and the withdrawal of troops . international community welcomes plan un secretary-general ban ki-moon said he was relieved by the israeli declaration and also urged the jewish state to withdraw all of its troops as soon as possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in the gaza strip continued for 22 days before the israeli ceasefire announcement " i am relieved that the israeli government has decided to cease hostilities as of midnight gmt , " ban told reporters .
" this should be the first step leading to the full withdrawal of israeli troops from gaza . " olmert said hamas ' actions would determine whether israeli troops pull back . " this operation strengthened the deterrence of the state of israel in the face of all those who threaten us , " he said .
" if hamas completely stops its attacks , we will judge at what moment we will leave the gaza strip . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier welcomed the ceasefire and called on hamas to put a stop to all attacks . " this step finally opens a perspective to an end of violence in and around gaza , " he said on saturday .
" as soon as the weapons are silent , all steps must be taken to create a lasting truce .
i will continue to work to make sure germany and the eu support this process . " us secretary of state condoleezza said the us remained " deeply concerned by the suffering of innocent palestinians " and supported immediate international moves to increase flows of assistance into gaza . the united states " expects that all parties will cease attacks and hostile actions immediately , " rice said in a statement .
she also commended egypt for its efforts in reaching a ceasefire . egypt plans summit for sunday olmert 's announcement came after egyptian president hosni mubarak called for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the gaza strip on saturday . " i ask israel today to end its military operations immediately , " mubarak said in an address on state television .
" i call on its leadership for an immediate unconditional ceasefire and a complete withdrawal of israeli troops from the gaza strip . " egypt has organized an international summit on gaza in sharm el-sheikh on sunday , with un head ban , german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy to attend . merkel and sarkozy are scheduled to go to tel aviv after the talks in egypt to meet with olmert , according to german and french government officials . invitations for the summit in the red sea resort have been sent to britain , france , italy , spain and turkey , several european diplomatic sources told the afp news agency on saturday . eu trio ready to quell smuggling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , sarkozy and brown said they would help curb weapons smuggling into gaza earlier saturday , germany , britain and france offered to send naval vessels to the middle east to monitor and prevent weapons smuggling in gaza . the three eu countries " declared our readiness to take a series of measures that would contribute to the end of weapons smuggling into gaza , " according to a joint statement released saturday by merkel , sarkozy and british prime minister gordon brown . " this offer is now on the table , " brown 's spokesman said .
" one of the key areas and blockages about a ceasefire , outside of the rocket attacks , has been concerns about arms smuggling . " while details of the naval assistance were not provided , the three european leaders also expressed their " hope that a lasting ceasefire in gaza would be followed by a new dynamic for an abiding peace in the middle east . " israel was in the fourth week of a military campaign against the palestinian militant group hamas , which currently rules the gaza strip and is considered a terrorist organization by the united states and european union . israeli attacks have killed more than 1,200 palestinians , according to gaza medical officials .

but the palestinian militant group hamas said it would continue fighting until israeli troops withdrawal from the gaza strip . olmert said israel 's offensive in the gaza strip had achieved all its objectives and received promises of support from major european powers to help stop the smuggling of weapons into gaza . he told a news conference after the security cabinet voted to cease fire that some goals had been exceeded , hamas had been hit hard and its ability to fire rockets into israel had been severely limited . " at two o 'clock in the morning -lrb- midnight gmt -rrb- we will cease fire but we will continue to be deployed in gaza and its surroundings , " olmert said in a speech after the vote . " we have reached all the goals of the war , and beyond , " he added .
" if our enemies decide to strike and want to carry on then the israeli army will regard itself as free to respond with force . " under the ceasefire plan , israeli troops will remain in the territory with orders to respond if fired upon by palestinian militants . israel will restart military operations in gaza if needed , defense minister ehud barak added .
reporting on the start of the meeting , israel 's channel 10 television said the military commander had recommended concluding the campaign . the declaration could allow israel to conclude its massive offensive without entering into an agreement with the islamist hamas movement , which has ruled gaza since june 2007 and is sworn to the destruction of the jewish state . bildunterschrift : sections of rafah and other cities in the gaza strip have been destroyed hamas vows to fight on a hamas spokesman criticized israel for its unilateral approach . " it is an attempt to pre-empt the egyptian efforts and any other efforts that seek to achieve a withdrawal of the occupying forces , an end to the siege and a ceasefire , " hamas spokesman fawzi barhoum told reuters news agency . he added that hamas would continue to fight the troops left in the coastal strip until the blockade on the gaza strip was lifted . " a unilateral ceasefire does not mean ending the -lrb- israeli -rrb- aggression and ending the siege , " barhoum said in gaza .
" these constitute acts of war and so this will not mean an end to resistance . " a spokesman for palestinian president mahmud abbas said the ceasefire should be followed by a truce and the withdrawal of troops . international community welcomes plan un secretary-general ban ki-moon said he was relieved by the israeli declaration and also urged the jewish state to withdraw all of its troops as soon as possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in the gaza strip continued for 22 days before the israeli ceasefire announcement " i am relieved that the israeli government has decided to cease hostilities as of midnight gmt , " ban told reporters .
" this should be the first step leading to the full withdrawal of israeli troops from gaza . " olmert said hamas ' actions would determine whether israeli troops pull back . " this operation strengthened the deterrence of the state of israel in the face of all those who threaten us , " he said .
" if hamas completely stops its attacks , we will judge at what moment we will leave the gaza strip . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier welcomed the ceasefire and called on hamas to put a stop to all attacks . " this step finally opens a perspective to an end of violence in and around gaza , " he said on saturday .
" as soon as the weapons are silent , all steps must be taken to create a lasting truce .
i will continue to work to make sure germany and the eu support this process . " us secretary of state condoleezza said the us remained " deeply concerned by the suffering of innocent palestinians " and supported immediate international moves to increase flows of assistance into gaza . the united states " expects that all parties will cease attacks and hostile actions immediately , " rice said in a statement .
she also commended egypt for its efforts in reaching a ceasefire . egypt plans summit for sunday olmert 's announcement came after egyptian president hosni mubarak called for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the gaza strip on saturday . " i ask israel today to end its military operations immediately , " mubarak said in an address on state television .
" i call on its leadership for an immediate unconditional ceasefire and a complete withdrawal of israeli troops from the gaza strip . " egypt has organized an international summit on gaza in sharm el-sheikh on sunday , with un head ban , german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy to attend . merkel and sarkozy are scheduled to go to tel aviv after the talks in egypt to meet with olmert , according to german and french government officials . invitations for the summit in the red sea resort have been sent to britain , france , italy , spain and turkey , several european diplomatic sources told the afp news agency on saturday . eu trio ready to quell smuggling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , sarkozy and brown said they would help curb weapons smuggling into gaza earlier saturday , germany , britain and france offered to send naval vessels to the middle east to monitor and prevent weapons smuggling in gaza . the three eu countries " declared our readiness to take a series of measures that would contribute to the end of weapons smuggling into gaza , " according to a joint statement released saturday by merkel , sarkozy and british prime minister gordon brown . " this offer is now on the table , " brown 's spokesman said .
" one of the key areas and blockages about a ceasefire , outside of the rocket attacks , has been concerns about arms smuggling . " while details of the naval assistance were not provided , the three european leaders also expressed their " hope that a lasting ceasefire in gaza would be followed by a new dynamic for an abiding peace in the middle east . " israel was in the fourth week of a military campaign against the palestinian militant group hamas , which currently rules the gaza strip and is considered a terrorist organization by the united states and european union . israeli attacks have killed more than 1,200 palestinians , according to gaza medical officials .

" about 1,200 people took the streets of the western german city of duisburg to protest against violence in the gaza strip and to call for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire .
smaller demonstrations were also held in several other german cities , including cologne and bochum . british police estimated that 3,500 rallied in trafalgar square for a protest billed as a " demonstration against israel 's barbarity and war crimes .

foreign minister tzipi livni said friday that an end to the war " does n't have to be in agreement with hamas but rather in arrangements against hamas . "
she was in washington to sign a deal for us help in ensuring hamas no longer smuggles arms to gaza via egypt .
on saturday , hamas official osama abu hemdan warned that the islamist group would fight on if israel orders a unilateral ceasefire in gaza .
attacks continued in the early morning hours .

18 , voters in hesse will go to the polls for the second time in 12 months to elect a new parliament .
opinion polls give merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- a comfortable lead over the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , junior partner in an uneasy coalition with the chancellor 's party in berlin .
the election comes as the country finds itself mired in recession , with unemployment rising , production declining and the government forced to pump tens of billions of euros into shoring up the economy .
replacing hesse 's caretaker government it also kicks off what germans are calling a super election year , with voting for five of the country 's 16 regional parliaments as well as elections for a new president in may and a general election on sept .
27 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch has toned down his rhetoric this time around hesse , one of germany 's most prosperous states where the banking center of frankfurt is located , has been administered by a caretaker government under cdu prime minister roland koch since inconclusive elections in january 2008 .
in that vote , the spd , led by andrea ypsilanti , narrowly failed to unseat koch , whose hard-hitting campaign targeting young criminals from ethnic minorities alienated many voters .
ypsilanti , 51 , then tried to topple the premier by forming a parliamentary alliance with the greens , backed by tacit support from the radical left party .
in so doing , she broke a campaign promise not to work with the left , an alliance of former east german communists and disgruntled social democrats from the west .
eroding support for spd this proved too much for four spd rebels , who withdrew their support a day before a crucial vote in parliament on nov .
4 , leaving their party leader without a majority .
ypsilanti was forced to make an embarrassing climbdown and agree to early elections .
since then , voter support for the spd has steadily eroded .
latest opinion polls show its ratings down to between 24 and 25 percent from 36.7 percent in the 2009 election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti came very close ... but lost her support the cdu , on the other hand , has seen its popularity grow to 41-42 percent from 36.8 percent last january .
with its preferred partner the free democrats tipped to win 13 percent , the two would have a comfortable majority in the 110-seat legislature in wiesbaden .
surveys show the greens also running at 13 percent , with the left hovering around the 5 percent needed to gain parliamentary representation , but not enough to from a workable majority with the spd .
koch 's challenger is thorsten schaefer-guembel , 39 , an spd back-bencher who was plucked from obscurity by ypsilanti to fight the election while she remained behind the scenes as party leader .
" he 's just the figure on the car radiator grille while ypsilanti remains firmly in the driving seat , " quipped koch , who has been premier for nearly a decade .
difference in platforms schaefer-guembel has sought to distance himself from his mentor and has put on a brave face when confronted with jokes about his double-barrelled name and thick spectacles .
both the cdu and the spd have pledged to invest more in education and infrastructure projects , but differ on energy policy and an expansion of frankfurt airport , one of europe 's busiest , a move which the spd opposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer-guembel : competitor or puppet ?
koch , 50 , has toned down his fiery rhetoric , concentrating instead on selling himself as a crisis manager at a time of growing economic uncertainty , a move that could make the cdu palatable to the greens if a broader-based coalition is necessary .
a victory for the cdu would give it a boost in confidence in the run-up to the general election after the setback it suffered in a state election in bavaria last september when its christian social union sister party lost its absolute majority .
test for general election ?
while the hesse vote might prove a reliable gauge of the mood of the electorate , leading politicians caution against viewing it as a test for the general election in eight months time .
" voters often leave it until the last moment before deciding which party to support , " said interior minister wolfgang schaeuble . dpa news agency -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that means it no longer qualifies as a masters series event . the qatari tennis federation gave no reason for selling its stake in the berlin women 's event . held in berlin each may , the tournament was an important lead-up event to the french open and a favorite of former german tennis great steffi graf , who was a nine-time winner of the meet . the german tennis federation -lrb- dtb -rrb- said it would fight the cancellation of the women ’ s tournament and demotion of the men 's event . " scrapping the germen open -lrb- in berlin -rrb- would be a very big loss for the german tennis scene , " dtb spokesperson oliver quante told news agency reuters on thursday , jan .

obviously it helps to have major tournaments or a world number one player to promote the sport , " said quante . " but we have talented players with lots of potential coming up .

that means it no longer qualifies as a masters series event . the qatari tennis federation gave no reason for selling its stake in the berlin women 's event . held in berlin each may , the tournament was an important lead-up event to the french open and a favorite of former german tennis great steffi graf , who was a nine-time winner of the meet . the german tennis federation -lrb- dtb -rrb- said it would fight the cancellation of the women ’ s tournament and demotion of the men 's event . " scrapping the germen open -lrb- in berlin -rrb- would be a very big loss for the german tennis scene , " dtb spokesperson oliver quante told news agency reuters on thursday , jan .

" we will make efforts to keep this tournament in berlin because it would be sad to see this long-standing event die . " german tennis to fight for events bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafael nadal of spain was the last to win the hamburg tournament the event was one of the oldest women 's events still in existence . " we have still not accepted the downgrading of hamburg .
berlin and hamburg are two different issues .
germany is still a major market for tennis , " quante said . but he added that the dtb was optimistic the twin blows would not impact the popularity of tennis in germany . " tennis is still a popular sport in germany .
obviously it helps to have major tournaments or a world number one player to promote the sport , " said quante . " but we have talented players with lots of potential coming up .
we will also fight to keep the berlin tournament going .

18 , voters in hesse will go to the polls for the second time in 12 months to elect a new parliament .
opinion polls give merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- a comfortable lead over the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , junior partner in an uneasy coalition with the chancellor 's party in berlin .
the election comes as the country finds itself mired in recession , with unemployment rising , production declining and the government forced to pump tens of billions of euros into shoring up the economy .
replacing hesse 's caretaker government it also kicks off what germans are calling a super election year , with voting for five of the country 's 16 regional parliaments as well as elections for a new president in may and a general election on sept .
27 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch has toned down his rhetoric this time around hesse , one of germany 's most prosperous states where the banking center of frankfurt is located , has been administered by a caretaker government under cdu prime minister roland koch since inconclusive elections in january 2008 .
in that vote , the spd , led by andrea ypsilanti , narrowly failed to unseat koch , whose hard-hitting campaign targeting young criminals from ethnic minorities alienated many voters .
ypsilanti , 51 , then tried to topple the premier by forming a parliamentary alliance with the greens , backed by tacit support from the radical left party .
in so doing , she broke a campaign promise not to work with the left , an alliance of former east german communists and disgruntled social democrats from the west .
eroding support for spd this proved too much for four spd rebels , who withdrew their support a day before a crucial vote in parliament on nov .
4 , leaving their party leader without a majority .
ypsilanti was forced to make an embarrassing climbdown and agree to early elections .
since then , voter support for the spd has steadily eroded .

the security cabinet vote would likely take place in the evening , after the end of the jewish sabbath , giving olmert and defense minister ehud barak time to discuss the proposal with their representatives who returned from two trips to cairo in two days .
there has been speculation that israel might opt for a unilateral cessation of hostilities , a move united nations secretary general ban ki-moon had also called for during his mideast tour .

representatives of hamas on saturday were to meet with egyptian negotiators to discuss israel 's response to their stipulations .
hamas has offered a renewable one-year truce , on the condition that all israeli troops withdraw within one week and that border crossings between israel and egypt are opened .

18 , voters in hesse will go to the polls for the second time in 12 months to elect a new parliament .
opinion polls give merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- a comfortable lead over the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , junior partner in an uneasy coalition with the chancellor 's party in berlin .
the election comes as the country finds itself mired in recession , with unemployment rising , production declining and the government forced to pump tens of billions of euros into shoring up the economy .
replacing hesse 's caretaker government it also kicks off what germans are calling a super election year , with voting for five of the country 's 16 regional parliaments as well as elections for a new president in may and a general election on sept .
27 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch has toned down his rhetoric this time around hesse , one of germany 's most prosperous states where the banking center of frankfurt is located , has been administered by a caretaker government under cdu prime minister roland koch since inconclusive elections in january 2008 .
in that vote , the spd , led by andrea ypsilanti , narrowly failed to unseat koch , whose hard-hitting campaign targeting young criminals from ethnic minorities alienated many voters .
ypsilanti , 51 , then tried to topple the premier by forming a parliamentary alliance with the greens , backed by tacit support from the radical left party .
in so doing , she broke a campaign promise not to work with the left , an alliance of former east german communists and disgruntled social democrats from the west .
eroding support for spd this proved too much for four spd rebels , who withdrew their support a day before a crucial vote in parliament on nov .
4 , leaving their party leader without a majority .
ypsilanti was forced to make an embarrassing climbdown and agree to early elections .
since then , voter support for the spd has steadily eroded .
latest opinion polls show its ratings down to between 24 and 25 percent from 36.7 percent in the 2009 election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti came very close ... but lost her support the cdu , on the other hand , has seen its popularity grow to 41-42 percent from 36.8 percent last january .
with its preferred partner the free democrats tipped to win 13 percent , the two would have a comfortable majority in the 110-seat legislature in wiesbaden .
surveys show the greens also running at 13 percent , with the left hovering around the 5 percent needed to gain parliamentary representation , but not enough to from a workable majority with the spd .
koch 's challenger is thorsten schaefer-guembel , 39 , an spd back-bencher who was plucked from obscurity by ypsilanti to fight the election while she remained behind the scenes as party leader .
" he 's just the figure on the car radiator grille while ypsilanti remains firmly in the driving seat , " quipped koch , who has been premier for nearly a decade .
difference in platforms schaefer-guembel has sought to distance himself from his mentor and has put on a brave face when confronted with jokes about his double-barrelled name and thick spectacles .
both the cdu and the spd have pledged to invest more in education and infrastructure projects , but differ on energy policy and an expansion of frankfurt airport , one of europe 's busiest , a move which the spd opposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer-guembel : competitor or puppet ?
koch , 50 , has toned down his fiery rhetoric , concentrating instead on selling himself as a crisis manager at a time of growing economic uncertainty , a move that could make the cdu palatable to the greens if a broader-based coalition is necessary .
a victory for the cdu would give it a boost in confidence in the run-up to the general election after the setback it suffered in a state election in bavaria last september when its christian social union sister party lost its absolute majority .
test for general election ?
while the hesse vote might prove a reliable gauge of the mood of the electorate , leading politicians caution against viewing it as a test for the general election in eight months time .
" voters often leave it until the last moment before deciding which party to support , " said interior minister wolfgang schaeuble . dpa news agency -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
she also said germany " would continue to maintain its commitment in afghanistan , " according to a statement . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also condemned the bombing as a " cowardly and barbaric act . " " we are not going to be deterred by terror from continuing our aid to the afghan people , " he said .
" it is not terrorism and violence that are the future of afghanistan but security and democracy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over a dozen civilians were injured in the attack the attack happened on a well-travelled civilian road , according to us military spokesman col. jerry o 'hara . " this incident will only strengthen our collective resolve to aggressively pursue enemy networks before they can hurt innocent afghans and coalition forces , " he added . taliban claims responsibility the taliban took responsibility for saturday 's bombing in a statement posted on the rebel web site and said that one of their bombers , named sham-ul-rahman , carried out the attack using a toyota corolla car filled with explosives . the statement claimed that eight german soldiers were killed in the attack , while several german diplomats were among the casualties .
the blast destroyed part of the german embassy building , according to the taliban 's statement . the blast blew out windows at the nearby us base , but military spokesman lt. col. christian kubik told the afp news agency there was no significant damage . the taliban are known to provide different accounts of their operations , which are often proven to be exaggerated or falsified . several vehicles including a passenger van and tanker in front of the embassy 's gate were ablaze and thick smoke was billowing from the area on saturday .
tolo , a private tv channel , showed several afghan municipal workers soaked in blood being rushed from the scene . the area , which is one of the city 's main intersections , was cordoned off by afghan and us military soldiers . taliban militants , who were driven out of power in a us-led invasion in late 2001 , have carried out hundreds of suicide attacks in the past seven years . the militants were responsible for more than 120 suicide bombings in 2008 in afghanistan .

foreign minister tzipi livni said friday that an end to the war " does n't have to be in agreement with hamas but rather in arrangements against hamas . "
she was in washington to sign a deal for us help in ensuring hamas no longer smuggles arms to gaza via egypt .
on saturday , hamas official osama abu hemdan warned that the islamist group would fight on if israel orders a unilateral ceasefire in gaza .
attacks continued in the early morning hours .
israeli warplanes reportedly hit about 50 targets during the night , including rocket-launching sites , tunnels under the gaza-egypt border as well as mosques used as points from where militants fired at israel .

the security cabinet vote would likely take place in the evening , after the end of the jewish sabbath , giving olmert and defense minister ehud barak time to discuss the proposal with their representatives who returned from two trips to cairo in two days .
there has been speculation that israel might opt for a unilateral cessation of hostilities , a move united nations secretary general ban ki-moon had also called for during his mideast tour .
hamas opposed to israeli stipulations khaled meshaal , hamas ' damascus-based political leader , said in doha , at a summit of arab leaders , that his organization would not accept israeli dictates on the ceasefire , and that the militant group " had not suffered a defeat " in the gaza fighting .
representatives of hamas on saturday were to meet with egyptian negotiators to discuss israel 's response to their stipulations .
hamas has offered a renewable one-year truce , on the condition that all israeli troops withdraw within one week and that border crossings between israel and egypt are opened .

the company says it will focus more on hybrid models , as well as smaller and more efficient engines . luxury german car manufacturing group daimler is increasing its work on energy-efficient automobiles .
chief executive dieter zetsche said at the north american international auto show in detroit this week that the company planned to roll out at least one new hybrid vehicle per year . " despite the enormous pressures that our entire industry is under these days , we are facing the year 2009 with measured confidence , " zetsche said . the first hybrid - which combines electric and internal combustion engines - will be the top-of-the-line s400 bluehybrid executive sedan in 2009 .
it is reported to be the first mainstream hybrid car to use a lithium-ion battery pack . according to the german economic news weekly magazine wirtschaftswoche , daimler aims to have reduced its cars ' exhaust emissions by 2012 to 136-138 milligrams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by using hybrid models , as well as smaller and more efficient engines .
this would nearly achieve the european union commission target of 130 mg / kilometer . in late 2007 , daimler 's mercedes and smart cars ' average carbon dioxide emissions were at 180 mg / kilometer , the dusseldorf-based magazine said . taking advantage of a growth opportunity " from 2012 , we will offer our customers all standard series from the c-class up with optional hybrid technology , " thomas weber , daimler 's director of research and development , told the business daily handelsblatt earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi also presented a hybrid model in detroit this also included the popular full-size model e-class , which was re-launched this year and unveiled at the detroit show .
it will be available with a hybrid engine starting in 2011 , wirtschaftswoche said .
the next generation of the s-class mercedes , due to be introduced in 2013 , is to be exclusively hybrid-powered , it said . " whoever does n't invest in alternative engines is missing a growth opportunity , " weber said . affordable electric cars pose a challenge daimler also introduced the prototype for an electric vehicle called bluezero at the detroit auto show .
the three bluezero versions are based on the sandwich-floor architecture which the carmaker initially introduced for the a-class . the vehicles will utilize lithium-ion batteries , which are already widely used in consumer electronics but are being adapted to meet automotive requirements .
the car will be able to drive 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- on a single charge , or 400 kilometers for a hybrid version that relies on a small combustion engine to recharge its battery .
all three variants accelerate from 0 to 100 km / h in less than 11 seconds .
the top speed is electronically limited to 150 km / h . but mass production is " a few years " away , said weber .
daimler still faced two challenges in manufacturing electric vehicles : making it affordable , and building up public infrastructure to charge the car 's batteries . daimler last month took a 49 percent stake in the lithium-ion battery unit of essen-based industrial group evonik . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" imams carrying out their work here lack the requirements needed for the future of islam in germany , " said ayhan cosgun , deputy chairman of institut buhara . if all goes according to plan , the first 35 students could begin their six-year training course next month .
in all , the school has the capacity for 68 students .

the company says it will focus more on hybrid models , as well as smaller and more efficient engines . luxury german car manufacturing group daimler is increasing its work on energy-efficient automobiles .
chief executive dieter zetsche said at the north american international auto show in detroit this week that the company planned to roll out at least one new hybrid vehicle per year . " despite the enormous pressures that our entire industry is under these days , we are facing the year 2009 with measured confidence , " zetsche said . the first hybrid - which combines electric and internal combustion engines - will be the top-of-the-line s400 bluehybrid executive sedan in 2009 .
it is reported to be the first mainstream hybrid car to use a lithium-ion battery pack . according to the german economic news weekly magazine wirtschaftswoche , daimler aims to have reduced its cars ' exhaust emissions by 2012 to 136-138 milligrams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by using hybrid models , as well as smaller and more efficient engines .
this would nearly achieve the european union commission target of 130 mg / kilometer . in late 2007 , daimler 's mercedes and smart cars ' average carbon dioxide emissions were at 180 mg / kilometer , the dusseldorf-based magazine said . taking advantage of a growth opportunity " from 2012 , we will offer our customers all standard series from the c-class up with optional hybrid technology , " thomas weber , daimler 's director of research and development , told the business daily handelsblatt earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi also presented a hybrid model in detroit this also included the popular full-size model e-class , which was re-launched this year and unveiled at the detroit show .
it will be available with a hybrid engine starting in 2011 , wirtschaftswoche said .

chief executive dieter zetsche said at the north american international auto show in detroit this week that the company planned to roll out at least one new hybrid vehicle per year .

it is reported to be the first mainstream hybrid car to use a lithium-ion battery pack . according to the german economic news weekly magazine wirtschaftswoche , daimler aims to have reduced its cars ' exhaust emissions by 2012 to 136-138 milligrams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by using hybrid models , as well as smaller and more efficient engines .
this would nearly achieve the european union commission target of 130 mg / kilometer . in late 2007 , daimler 's mercedes and smart cars ' average carbon dioxide emissions were at 180 mg / kilometer , the dusseldorf-based magazine said . taking advantage of a growth opportunity " from 2012 , we will offer our customers all standard series from the c-class up with optional hybrid technology , " thomas weber , daimler 's director of research and development , told the business daily handelsblatt earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi also presented a hybrid model in detroit this also included the popular full-size model e-class , which was re-launched this year and unveiled at the detroit show .
it will be available with a hybrid engine starting in 2011 , wirtschaftswoche said .
the next generation of the s-class mercedes , due to be introduced in 2013 , is to be exclusively hybrid-powered , it said . " whoever does n't invest in alternative engines is missing a growth opportunity , " weber said . affordable electric cars pose a challenge daimler also introduced the prototype for an electric vehicle called bluezero at the detroit auto show .
the three bluezero versions are based on the sandwich-floor architecture which the carmaker initially introduced for the a-class . the vehicles will utilize lithium-ion batteries , which are already widely used in consumer electronics but are being adapted to meet automotive requirements .
the car will be able to drive 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- on a single charge , or 400 kilometers for a hybrid version that relies on a small combustion engine to recharge its battery .
all three variants accelerate from 0 to 100 km / h in less than 11 seconds .
the top speed is electronically limited to 150 km / h . but mass production is " a few years " away , said weber .
daimler still faced two challenges in manufacturing electric vehicles : making it affordable , and building up public infrastructure to charge the car 's batteries . daimler last month took a 49 percent stake in the lithium-ion battery unit of essen-based industrial group evonik . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , voters in hesse will go to the polls for the second time in 12 months to elect a new parliament .
opinion polls give merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- a comfortable lead over the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , junior partner in an uneasy coalition with the chancellor 's party in berlin .
the election comes as the country finds itself mired in recession , with unemployment rising , production declining and the government forced to pump tens of billions of euros into shoring up the economy .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch has toned down his rhetoric this time around hesse , one of germany 's most prosperous states where the banking center of frankfurt is located , has been administered by a caretaker government under cdu prime minister roland koch since inconclusive elections in january 2008 .
in that vote , the spd , led by andrea ypsilanti , narrowly failed to unseat koch , whose hard-hitting campaign targeting young criminals from ethnic minorities alienated many voters .
ypsilanti , 51 , then tried to topple the premier by forming a parliamentary alliance with the greens , backed by tacit support from the radical left party .
in so doing , she broke a campaign promise not to work with the left , an alliance of former east german communists and disgruntled social democrats from the west .
eroding support for spd this proved too much for four spd rebels , who withdrew their support a day before a crucial vote in parliament on nov .
4 , leaving their party leader without a majority .
ypsilanti was forced to make an embarrassing climbdown and agree to early elections .
since then , voter support for the spd has steadily eroded .
latest opinion polls show its ratings down to between 24 and 25 percent from 36.7 percent in the 2009 election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti came very close ... but lost her support the cdu , on the other hand , has seen its popularity grow to 41-42 percent from 36.8 percent last january .
with its preferred partner the free democrats tipped to win 13 percent , the two would have a comfortable majority in the 110-seat legislature in wiesbaden .
surveys show the greens also running at 13 percent , with the left hovering around the 5 percent needed to gain parliamentary representation , but not enough to from a workable majority with the spd .
koch 's challenger is thorsten schaefer-guembel , 39 , an spd back-bencher who was plucked from obscurity by ypsilanti to fight the election while she remained behind the scenes as party leader .
" he 's just the figure on the car radiator grille while ypsilanti remains firmly in the driving seat , " quipped koch , who has been premier for nearly a decade .
difference in platforms schaefer-guembel has sought to distance himself from his mentor and has put on a brave face when confronted with jokes about his double-barrelled name and thick spectacles .
both the cdu and the spd have pledged to invest more in education and infrastructure projects , but differ on energy policy and an expansion of frankfurt airport , one of europe 's busiest , a move which the spd opposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer-guembel : competitor or puppet ?
koch , 50 , has toned down his fiery rhetoric , concentrating instead on selling himself as a crisis manager at a time of growing economic uncertainty , a move that could make the cdu palatable to the greens if a broader-based coalition is necessary .
a victory for the cdu would give it a boost in confidence in the run-up to the general election after the setback it suffered in a state election in bavaria last september when its christian social union sister party lost its absolute majority .

18 , voters in hesse will go to the polls for the second time in 12 months to elect a new parliament .
opinion polls give merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- a comfortable lead over the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , junior partner in an uneasy coalition with the chancellor 's party in berlin .
the election comes as the country finds itself mired in recession , with unemployment rising , production declining and the government forced to pump tens of billions of euros into shoring up the economy .
replacing hesse 's caretaker government it also kicks off what germans are calling a super election year , with voting for five of the country 's 16 regional parliaments as well as elections for a new president in may and a general election on sept .
27 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch has toned down his rhetoric this time around hesse , one of germany 's most prosperous states where the banking center of frankfurt is located , has been administered by a caretaker government under cdu prime minister roland koch since inconclusive elections in january 2008 .
in that vote , the spd , led by andrea ypsilanti , narrowly failed to unseat koch , whose hard-hitting campaign targeting young criminals from ethnic minorities alienated many voters .
ypsilanti , 51 , then tried to topple the premier by forming a parliamentary alliance with the greens , backed by tacit support from the radical left party .
in so doing , she broke a campaign promise not to work with the left , an alliance of former east german communists and disgruntled social democrats from the west .
eroding support for spd this proved too much for four spd rebels , who withdrew their support a day before a crucial vote in parliament on nov .
4 , leaving their party leader without a majority .
ypsilanti was forced to make an embarrassing climbdown and agree to early elections .
since then , voter support for the spd has steadily eroded .
latest opinion polls show its ratings down to between 24 and 25 percent from 36.7 percent in the 2009 election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti came very close ... but lost her support the cdu , on the other hand , has seen its popularity grow to 41-42 percent from 36.8 percent last january .
with its preferred partner the free democrats tipped to win 13 percent , the two would have a comfortable majority in the 110-seat legislature in wiesbaden .
surveys show the greens also running at 13 percent , with the left hovering around the 5 percent needed to gain parliamentary representation , but not enough to from a workable majority with the spd .
koch 's challenger is thorsten schaefer-guembel , 39 , an spd back-bencher who was plucked from obscurity by ypsilanti to fight the election while she remained behind the scenes as party leader .
" he 's just the figure on the car radiator grille while ypsilanti remains firmly in the driving seat , " quipped koch , who has been premier for nearly a decade .
difference in platforms schaefer-guembel has sought to distance himself from his mentor and has put on a brave face when confronted with jokes about his double-barrelled name and thick spectacles .

"
she also said germany " would continue to maintain its commitment in afghanistan , " according to a statement . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also condemned the bombing as a " cowardly and barbaric act . " " we are not going to be deterred by terror from continuing our aid to the afghan people , " he said .
" it is not terrorism and violence that are the future of afghanistan but security and democracy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over a dozen civilians were injured in the attack the attack happened on a well-travelled civilian road , according to us military spokesman col. jerry o 'hara . " this incident will only strengthen our collective resolve to aggressively pursue enemy networks before they can hurt innocent afghans and coalition forces , " he added . taliban claims responsibility the taliban took responsibility for saturday 's bombing in a statement posted on the rebel web site and said that one of their bombers , named sham-ul-rahman , carried out the attack using a toyota corolla car filled with explosives . the statement claimed that eight german soldiers were killed in the attack , while several german diplomats were among the casualties .
the blast destroyed part of the german embassy building , according to the taliban 's statement . the blast blew out windows at the nearby us base , but military spokesman lt. col. christian kubik told the afp news agency there was no significant damage . the taliban are known to provide different accounts of their operations , which are often proven to be exaggerated or falsified . several vehicles including a passenger van and tanker in front of the embassy 's gate were ablaze and thick smoke was billowing from the area on saturday .
tolo , a private tv channel , showed several afghan municipal workers soaked in blood being rushed from the scene . the area , which is one of the city 's main intersections , was cordoned off by afghan and us military soldiers . taliban militants , who were driven out of power in a us-led invasion in late 2001 , have carried out hundreds of suicide attacks in the past seven years . the militants were responsible for more than 120 suicide bombings in 2008 in afghanistan .
more than 50 people including two indian diplomats were killed in a suicide attack against the indian embassy in july last year . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , voters in hesse will go to the polls for the second time in 12 months to elect a new parliament .
opinion polls give merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- a comfortable lead over the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , junior partner in an uneasy coalition with the chancellor 's party in berlin .
the election comes as the country finds itself mired in recession , with unemployment rising , production declining and the government forced to pump tens of billions of euros into shoring up the economy .
replacing hesse 's caretaker government it also kicks off what germans are calling a super election year , with voting for five of the country 's 16 regional parliaments as well as elections for a new president in may and a general election on sept .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch has toned down his rhetoric this time around hesse , one of germany 's most prosperous states where the banking center of frankfurt is located , has been administered by a caretaker government under cdu prime minister roland koch since inconclusive elections in january 2008 .
in that vote , the spd , led by andrea ypsilanti , narrowly failed to unseat koch , whose hard-hitting campaign targeting young criminals from ethnic minorities alienated many voters .
ypsilanti , 51 , then tried to topple the premier by forming a parliamentary alliance with the greens , backed by tacit support from the radical left party .
in so doing , she broke a campaign promise not to work with the left , an alliance of former east german communists and disgruntled social democrats from the west .
eroding support for spd this proved too much for four spd rebels , who withdrew their support a day before a crucial vote in parliament on nov .
4 , leaving their party leader without a majority .
ypsilanti was forced to make an embarrassing climbdown and agree to early elections .
since then , voter support for the spd has steadily eroded .
latest opinion polls show its ratings down to between 24 and 25 percent from 36.7 percent in the 2009 election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti came very close ... but lost her support the cdu , on the other hand , has seen its popularity grow to 41-42 percent from 36.8 percent last january .
with its preferred partner the free democrats tipped to win 13 percent , the two would have a comfortable majority in the 110-seat legislature in wiesbaden .
surveys show the greens also running at 13 percent , with the left hovering around the 5 percent needed to gain parliamentary representation , but not enough to from a workable majority with the spd .
koch 's challenger is thorsten schaefer-guembel , 39 , an spd back-bencher who was plucked from obscurity by ypsilanti to fight the election while she remained behind the scenes as party leader .
" he 's just the figure on the car radiator grille while ypsilanti remains firmly in the driving seat , " quipped koch , who has been premier for nearly a decade .
difference in platforms schaefer-guembel has sought to distance himself from his mentor and has put on a brave face when confronted with jokes about his double-barrelled name and thick spectacles .
both the cdu and the spd have pledged to invest more in education and infrastructure projects , but differ on energy policy and an expansion of frankfurt airport , one of europe 's busiest , a move which the spd opposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer-guembel : competitor or puppet ?
koch , 50 , has toned down his fiery rhetoric , concentrating instead on selling himself as a crisis manager at a time of growing economic uncertainty , a move that could make the cdu palatable to the greens if a broader-based coalition is necessary .
a victory for the cdu would give it a boost in confidence in the run-up to the general election after the setback it suffered in a state election in bavaria last september when its christian social union sister party lost its absolute majority .
test for general election ?
while the hesse vote might prove a reliable gauge of the mood of the electorate , leading politicians caution against viewing it as a test for the general election in eight months time .

the blast destroyed part of the german embassy building , according to the taliban 's statement . the blast blew out windows at the nearby us base , but military spokesman lt. col. christian kubik told the afp news agency there was no significant damage . the taliban are known to provide different accounts of their operations , which are often proven to be exaggerated or falsified . several vehicles including a passenger van and tanker in front of the embassy 's gate were ablaze and thick smoke was billowing from the area on saturday .
tolo , a private tv channel , showed several afghan municipal workers soaked in blood being rushed from the scene . the area , which is one of the city 's main intersections , was cordoned off by afghan and us military soldiers . taliban militants , who were driven out of power in a us-led invasion in late 2001 , have carried out hundreds of suicide attacks in the past seven years . the militants were responsible for more than 120 suicide bombings in 2008 in afghanistan .
more than 50 people including two indian diplomats were killed in a suicide attack against the indian embassy in july last year . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , voters in hesse will go to the polls for the second time in 12 months to elect a new parliament .
opinion polls give merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- a comfortable lead over the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , junior partner in an uneasy coalition with the chancellor 's party in berlin .
the election comes as the country finds itself mired in recession , with unemployment rising , production declining and the government forced to pump tens of billions of euros into shoring up the economy .
replacing hesse 's caretaker government it also kicks off what germans are calling a super election year , with voting for five of the country 's 16 regional parliaments as well as elections for a new president in may and a general election on sept .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch has toned down his rhetoric this time around hesse , one of germany 's most prosperous states where the banking center of frankfurt is located , has been administered by a caretaker government under cdu prime minister roland koch since inconclusive elections in january 2008 .
in that vote , the spd , led by andrea ypsilanti , narrowly failed to unseat koch , whose hard-hitting campaign targeting young criminals from ethnic minorities alienated many voters .
ypsilanti , 51 , then tried to topple the premier by forming a parliamentary alliance with the greens , backed by tacit support from the radical left party .
in so doing , she broke a campaign promise not to work with the left , an alliance of former east german communists and disgruntled social democrats from the west .
eroding support for spd this proved too much for four spd rebels , who withdrew their support a day before a crucial vote in parliament on nov .
4 , leaving their party leader without a majority .
ypsilanti was forced to make an embarrassing climbdown and agree to early elections .
since then , voter support for the spd has steadily eroded .
latest opinion polls show its ratings down to between 24 and 25 percent from 36.7 percent in the 2009 election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti came very close ... but lost her support the cdu , on the other hand , has seen its popularity grow to 41-42 percent from 36.8 percent last january .
with its preferred partner the free democrats tipped to win 13 percent , the two would have a comfortable majority in the 110-seat legislature in wiesbaden .
surveys show the greens also running at 13 percent , with the left hovering around the 5 percent needed to gain parliamentary representation , but not enough to from a workable majority with the spd .
koch 's challenger is thorsten schaefer-guembel , 39 , an spd back-bencher who was plucked from obscurity by ypsilanti to fight the election while she remained behind the scenes as party leader .
" he 's just the figure on the car radiator grille while ypsilanti remains firmly in the driving seat , " quipped koch , who has been premier for nearly a decade .
difference in platforms schaefer-guembel has sought to distance himself from his mentor and has put on a brave face when confronted with jokes about his double-barrelled name and thick spectacles .
both the cdu and the spd have pledged to invest more in education and infrastructure projects , but differ on energy policy and an expansion of frankfurt airport , one of europe 's busiest , a move which the spd opposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer-guembel : competitor or puppet ?
koch , 50 , has toned down his fiery rhetoric , concentrating instead on selling himself as a crisis manager at a time of growing economic uncertainty , a move that could make the cdu palatable to the greens if a broader-based coalition is necessary .
a victory for the cdu would give it a boost in confidence in the run-up to the general election after the setback it suffered in a state election in bavaria last september when its christian social union sister party lost its absolute majority .
test for general election ?

the security cabinet vote would likely take place in the evening , after the end of the jewish sabbath , giving olmert and defense minister ehud barak time to discuss the proposal with their representatives who returned from two trips to cairo in two days .
there has been speculation that israel might opt for a unilateral cessation of hostilities , a move united nations secretary general ban ki-moon had also called for during his mideast tour .
hamas opposed to israeli stipulations khaled meshaal , hamas ' damascus-based political leader , said in doha , at a summit of arab leaders , that his organization would not accept israeli dictates on the ceasefire , and that the militant group " had not suffered a defeat " in the gaza fighting .
representatives of hamas on saturday were to meet with egyptian negotiators to discuss israel 's response to their stipulations .
hamas has offered a renewable one-year truce , on the condition that all israeli troops withdraw within one week and that border crossings between israel and egypt are opened .

18 , voters in hesse will go to the polls for the second time in 12 months to elect a new parliament .
opinion polls give merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- a comfortable lead over the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , junior partner in an uneasy coalition with the chancellor 's party in berlin .
the election comes as the country finds itself mired in recession , with unemployment rising , production declining and the government forced to pump tens of billions of euros into shoring up the economy .
replacing hesse 's caretaker government it also kicks off what germans are calling a super election year , with voting for five of the country 's 16 regional parliaments as well as elections for a new president in may and a general election on sept .
27 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch has toned down his rhetoric this time around hesse , one of germany 's most prosperous states where the banking center of frankfurt is located , has been administered by a caretaker government under cdu prime minister roland koch since inconclusive elections in january 2008 .
in that vote , the spd , led by andrea ypsilanti , narrowly failed to unseat koch , whose hard-hitting campaign targeting young criminals from ethnic minorities alienated many voters .
ypsilanti , 51 , then tried to topple the premier by forming a parliamentary alliance with the greens , backed by tacit support from the radical left party .
in so doing , she broke a campaign promise not to work with the left , an alliance of former east german communists and disgruntled social democrats from the west .
eroding support for spd this proved too much for four spd rebels , who withdrew their support a day before a crucial vote in parliament on nov .
4 , leaving their party leader without a majority .
ypsilanti was forced to make an embarrassing climbdown and agree to early elections .
since then , voter support for the spd has steadily eroded .
latest opinion polls show its ratings down to between 24 and 25 percent from 36.7 percent in the 2009 election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti came very close ... but lost her support the cdu , on the other hand , has seen its popularity grow to 41-42 percent from 36.8 percent last january .
with its preferred partner the free democrats tipped to win 13 percent , the two would have a comfortable majority in the 110-seat legislature in wiesbaden .
surveys show the greens also running at 13 percent , with the left hovering around the 5 percent needed to gain parliamentary representation , but not enough to from a workable majority with the spd .
koch 's challenger is thorsten schaefer-guembel , 39 , an spd back-bencher who was plucked from obscurity by ypsilanti to fight the election while she remained behind the scenes as party leader .
" he 's just the figure on the car radiator grille while ypsilanti remains firmly in the driving seat , " quipped koch , who has been premier for nearly a decade .
difference in platforms schaefer-guembel has sought to distance himself from his mentor and has put on a brave face when confronted with jokes about his double-barrelled name and thick spectacles .
both the cdu and the spd have pledged to invest more in education and infrastructure projects , but differ on energy policy and an expansion of frankfurt airport , one of europe 's busiest , a move which the spd opposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer-guembel : competitor or puppet ?
koch , 50 , has toned down his fiery rhetoric , concentrating instead on selling himself as a crisis manager at a time of growing economic uncertainty , a move that could make the cdu palatable to the greens if a broader-based coalition is necessary .
a victory for the cdu would give it a boost in confidence in the run-up to the general election after the setback it suffered in a state election in bavaria last september when its christian social union sister party lost its absolute majority .
test for general election ?
while the hesse vote might prove a reliable gauge of the mood of the electorate , leading politicians caution against viewing it as a test for the general election in eight months time .
" voters often leave it until the last moment before deciding which party to support , " said interior minister wolfgang schaeuble . dpa news agency -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the company says it will focus more on hybrid models , as well as smaller and more efficient engines . luxury german car manufacturing group daimler is increasing its work on energy-efficient automobiles .
chief executive dieter zetsche said at the north american international auto show in detroit this week that the company planned to roll out at least one new hybrid vehicle per year . " despite the enormous pressures that our entire industry is under these days , we are facing the year 2009 with measured confidence , " zetsche said . the first hybrid - which combines electric and internal combustion engines - will be the top-of-the-line s400 bluehybrid executive sedan in 2009 .
it is reported to be the first mainstream hybrid car to use a lithium-ion battery pack . according to the german economic news weekly magazine wirtschaftswoche , daimler aims to have reduced its cars ' exhaust emissions by 2012 to 136-138 milligrams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by using hybrid models , as well as smaller and more efficient engines .
this would nearly achieve the european union commission target of 130 mg / kilometer . in late 2007 , daimler 's mercedes and smart cars ' average carbon dioxide emissions were at 180 mg / kilometer , the dusseldorf-based magazine said . taking advantage of a growth opportunity " from 2012 , we will offer our customers all standard series from the c-class up with optional hybrid technology , " thomas weber , daimler 's director of research and development , told the business daily handelsblatt earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi also presented a hybrid model in detroit this also included the popular full-size model e-class , which was re-launched this year and unveiled at the detroit show .
it will be available with a hybrid engine starting in 2011 , wirtschaftswoche said .
the next generation of the s-class mercedes , due to be introduced in 2013 , is to be exclusively hybrid-powered , it said . " whoever does n't invest in alternative engines is missing a growth opportunity , " weber said . affordable electric cars pose a challenge daimler also introduced the prototype for an electric vehicle called bluezero at the detroit auto show .
the three bluezero versions are based on the sandwich-floor architecture which the carmaker initially introduced for the a-class . the vehicles will utilize lithium-ion batteries , which are already widely used in consumer electronics but are being adapted to meet automotive requirements .
the car will be able to drive 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- on a single charge , or 400 kilometers for a hybrid version that relies on a small combustion engine to recharge its battery .
all three variants accelerate from 0 to 100 km / h in less than 11 seconds .
the top speed is electronically limited to 150 km / h . but mass production is " a few years " away , said weber .
daimler still faced two challenges in manufacturing electric vehicles : making it affordable , and building up public infrastructure to charge the car 's batteries . daimler last month took a 49 percent stake in the lithium-ion battery unit of essen-based industrial group evonik . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the company says it will focus more on hybrid models , as well as smaller and more efficient engines . luxury german car manufacturing group daimler is increasing its work on energy-efficient automobiles .
chief executive dieter zetsche said at the north american international auto show in detroit this week that the company planned to roll out at least one new hybrid vehicle per year . " despite the enormous pressures that our entire industry is under these days , we are facing the year 2009 with measured confidence , " zetsche said . the first hybrid - which combines electric and internal combustion engines - will be the top-of-the-line s400 bluehybrid executive sedan in 2009 .
it is reported to be the first mainstream hybrid car to use a lithium-ion battery pack . according to the german economic news weekly magazine wirtschaftswoche , daimler aims to have reduced its cars ' exhaust emissions by 2012 to 136-138 milligrams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by using hybrid models , as well as smaller and more efficient engines .
this would nearly achieve the european union commission target of 130 mg / kilometer . in late 2007 , daimler 's mercedes and smart cars ' average carbon dioxide emissions were at 180 mg / kilometer , the dusseldorf-based magazine said . taking advantage of a growth opportunity " from 2012 , we will offer our customers all standard series from the c-class up with optional hybrid technology , " thomas weber , daimler 's director of research and development , told the business daily handelsblatt earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi also presented a hybrid model in detroit this also included the popular full-size model e-class , which was re-launched this year and unveiled at the detroit show .
it will be available with a hybrid engine starting in 2011 , wirtschaftswoche said .
the next generation of the s-class mercedes , due to be introduced in 2013 , is to be exclusively hybrid-powered , it said . " whoever does n't invest in alternative engines is missing a growth opportunity , " weber said . affordable electric cars pose a challenge daimler also introduced the prototype for an electric vehicle called bluezero at the detroit auto show .
the three bluezero versions are based on the sandwich-floor architecture which the carmaker initially introduced for the a-class . the vehicles will utilize lithium-ion batteries , which are already widely used in consumer electronics but are being adapted to meet automotive requirements .
the car will be able to drive 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- on a single charge , or 400 kilometers for a hybrid version that relies on a small combustion engine to recharge its battery .
all three variants accelerate from 0 to 100 km / h in less than 11 seconds .

the car will be able to drive 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- on a single charge , or 400 kilometers for a hybrid version that relies on a small combustion engine to recharge its battery .
all three variants accelerate from 0 to 100 km / h in less than 11 seconds .
the top speed is electronically limited to 150 km / h . but mass production is " a few years " away , said weber .
daimler still faced two challenges in manufacturing electric vehicles : making it affordable , and building up public infrastructure to charge the car 's batteries . daimler last month took a 49 percent stake in the lithium-ion battery unit of essen-based industrial group evonik . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that means it no longer qualifies as a masters series event . the qatari tennis federation gave no reason for selling its stake in the berlin women 's event . held in berlin each may , the tournament was an important lead-up event to the french open and a favorite of former german tennis great steffi graf , who was a nine-time winner of the meet . the german tennis federation -lrb- dtb -rrb- said it would fight the cancellation of the women ’ s tournament and demotion of the men 's event .

"
she also said germany " would continue to maintain its commitment in afghanistan , " according to a statement . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also condemned the bombing as a " cowardly and barbaric act . " " we are not going to be deterred by terror from continuing our aid to the afghan people , " he said .
" it is not terrorism and violence that are the future of afghanistan but security and democracy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over a dozen civilians were injured in the attack the attack happened on a well-travelled civilian road , according to us military spokesman col. jerry o 'hara . " this incident will only strengthen our collective resolve to aggressively pursue enemy networks before they can hurt innocent afghans and coalition forces , " he added . taliban claims responsibility the taliban took responsibility for saturday 's bombing in a statement posted on the rebel web site and said that one of their bombers , named sham-ul-rahman , carried out the attack using a toyota corolla car filled with explosives . the statement claimed that eight german soldiers were killed in the attack , while several german diplomats were among the casualties .
the blast destroyed part of the german embassy building , according to the taliban 's statement . the blast blew out windows at the nearby us base , but military spokesman lt. col. christian kubik told the afp news agency there was no significant damage . the taliban are known to provide different accounts of their operations , which are often proven to be exaggerated or falsified . several vehicles including a passenger van and tanker in front of the embassy 's gate were ablaze and thick smoke was billowing from the area on saturday .
tolo , a private tv channel , showed several afghan municipal workers soaked in blood being rushed from the scene . the area , which is one of the city 's main intersections , was cordoned off by afghan and us military soldiers . taliban militants , who were driven out of power in a us-led invasion in late 2001 , have carried out hundreds of suicide attacks in the past seven years . the militants were responsible for more than 120 suicide bombings in 2008 in afghanistan .
more than 50 people including two indian diplomats were killed in a suicide attack against the indian embassy in july last year . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
she also said germany " would continue to maintain its commitment in afghanistan , " according to a statement . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also condemned the bombing as a " cowardly and barbaric act . " " we are not going to be deterred by terror from continuing our aid to the afghan people , " he said .
" it is not terrorism and violence that are the future of afghanistan but security and democracy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over a dozen civilians were injured in the attack the attack happened on a well-travelled civilian road , according to us military spokesman col. jerry o 'hara . " this incident will only strengthen our collective resolve to aggressively pursue enemy networks before they can hurt innocent afghans and coalition forces , " he added . taliban claims responsibility the taliban took responsibility for saturday 's bombing in a statement posted on the rebel web site and said that one of their bombers , named sham-ul-rahman , carried out the attack using a toyota corolla car filled with explosives . the statement claimed that eight german soldiers were killed in the attack , while several german diplomats were among the casualties .
the blast destroyed part of the german embassy building , according to the taliban 's statement . the blast blew out windows at the nearby us base , but military spokesman lt. col. christian kubik told the afp news agency there was no significant damage . the taliban are known to provide different accounts of their operations , which are often proven to be exaggerated or falsified . several vehicles including a passenger van and tanker in front of the embassy 's gate were ablaze and thick smoke was billowing from the area on saturday .
tolo , a private tv channel , showed several afghan municipal workers soaked in blood being rushed from the scene . the area , which is one of the city 's main intersections , was cordoned off by afghan and us military soldiers . taliban militants , who were driven out of power in a us-led invasion in late 2001 , have carried out hundreds of suicide attacks in the past seven years . the militants were responsible for more than 120 suicide bombings in 2008 in afghanistan .
more than 50 people including two indian diplomats were killed in a suicide attack against the indian embassy in july last year . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" imams carrying out their work here lack the requirements needed for the future of islam in germany , " said ayhan cosgun , deputy chairman of institut buhara . if all goes according to plan , the first 35 students could begin their six-year training course next month .

travellers are being advised to take several different payment methods , including cash , credit cards and travellers ' cheques when they go abroad . "

'
people are putting up statues of eric morecambe and brian clough and all sorts of modern celebrities like that ... certainly mr stanley ranks up with them ann thomas , art expert the birthplace of victorian explorer henry morton stanley is being asked if it wants to honour him with a memorial .
stanley was born in denbigh , denbighshire , and also lived as a child in a workhouse in nearby st asaph .
he is best known for finding the missing explorer david livingstone in east africa in 1871 , greeting him with the words , " dr livingstone , i presume ? "
art expert ann thomas , who is leading a consultation on a memorial , called him one of britain 's foremost explorers .
despite his denbighshire connections , stanley has never been commemorated in the area , apart from some local exhibitions .
denbighshire council is now carrying out a feasibility study in the area to see what kind of memorial , if any , people would like to see .
stanley was illegitimate and born john rowlands in 1841 .
he grew up in asaph union workhouse , which is now called hm stanley hospital , before he became a teacher and emigrated to the united states .
he changed his name to stanley , fought in the civil war and became a journalist and eventually an explorer .
one option is to take a mould of an existing statue , which is currently in a state of disrepair in kinshasa , capital of the democratic republic of congo .
ms thomas said stanley deserved to be remembered .
" there are also lots of modern , contemporary statues rather than this victorian gentleman stuck up on a plinth - like the john lennon statue in liverpool that you just come across leaning against a wall , " ms thomas said .
" if you look around various towns in great britain , people are putting up statues of eric morecambe and brian clough and all sorts of modern celebrities like that , " she added .

people are putting up statues of eric morecambe and brian clough and all sorts of modern celebrities like that ... certainly mr stanley ranks up with them ann thomas , art expert the birthplace of victorian explorer henry morton stanley is being asked if it wants to honour him with a memorial .
stanley was born in denbigh , denbighshire , and also lived as a child in a workhouse in nearby st asaph .
he is best known for finding the missing explorer david livingstone in east africa in 1871 , greeting him with the words , " dr livingstone , i presume ? "
art expert ann thomas , who is leading a consultation on a memorial , called him one of britain 's foremost explorers .
despite his denbighshire connections , stanley has never been commemorated in the area , apart from some local exhibitions .
denbighshire council is now carrying out a feasibility study in the area to see what kind of memorial , if any , people would like to see .
stanley was illegitimate and born john rowlands in 1841 .
he grew up in asaph union workhouse , which is now called hm stanley hospital , before he became a teacher and emigrated to the united states .
he changed his name to stanley , fought in the civil war and became a journalist and eventually an explorer .
one option is to take a mould of an existing statue , which is currently in a state of disrepair in kinshasa , capital of the democratic republic of congo .
ms thomas said stanley deserved to be remembered .
" there are also lots of modern , contemporary statues rather than this victorian gentleman stuck up on a plinth - like the john lennon statue in liverpool that you just come across leaning against a wall , " ms thomas said .
" if you look around various towns in great britain , people are putting up statues of eric morecambe and brian clough and all sorts of modern celebrities like that , " she added .

the future of channel 4 is to be decided in the next few weeks .
discussions have been held between its management , regulators and the government over how to replace falling revenues from advertising .
c4 's andy duncan said he believed a merger with the bbc 's commercial arm , bbc worldwide , could be the answer .
it is thought a possible merger with five is just one of the options for channel 4 in the upcoming government report on ways to overhaul public service television .
a draft report by communications minister lord carter will offer a number of proposals for the broadcaster , which said it could need as much as £ 150m invested by 2012 .
the options also include offering it some of the bbc 's licence fee .
andy duncan told bbc radio 4 's today programme that a merger with five was not the answer .
" mixing us with five - who are a for-profit company , they want to maximise money to go back to their foreign owners - is very difficult .
i think it is like mixing oil and water . "
he believes a tie-in with bbc worldwide could offer the best solution for channel 4 , which is a publicly-owned and not-for-profit .
" we believe and i think the bbc believe - there is just a difference as to how much money might be there - but we both believe that by working more closely together these two public organisations can make those public assets work harder , create more money to put back into the system to spend on content , " he said .
" we think that is a very interesting part of the solution , possibly the whole solution . "
merger talks between channel 4 and five were held in 2004 , then called off because of the complexity of combining the public and commercial stations .
discussions were started under channel 4 's former chief executive mark thompson , who then left to become director general of the bbc .

it is thought a possible merger with five is just one of the options for channel 4 in the upcoming government report on ways to overhaul public service television .
a draft report by communications minister lord carter will offer a number of proposals for the broadcaster , which said it could need as much as £ 150m invested by 2012 .
the options also include offering it some of the bbc 's licence fee .
andy duncan told bbc radio 4 's today programme that a merger with five was not the answer .
" mixing us with five - who are a for-profit company , they want to maximise money to go back to their foreign owners - is very difficult .
i think it is like mixing oil and water . "
he believes a tie-in with bbc worldwide could offer the best solution for channel 4 , which is a publicly-owned and not-for-profit .
" we believe and i think the bbc believe - there is just a difference as to how much money might be there - but we both believe that by working more closely together these two public organisations can make those public assets work harder , create more money to put back into the system to spend on content , " he said .
" we think that is a very interesting part of the solution , possibly the whole solution . "
merger talks between channel 4 and five were held in 2004 , then called off because of the complexity of combining the public and commercial stations .
discussions were started under channel 4 's former chief executive mark thompson , who then left to become director general of the bbc .

washington children 's hospital could easily be part of the british national health system .
the staff are helpful enough , but brusque and overworked .
there is a lot of waiting .
the lifts do not all function .
there are signs scribbled on paper and stuck on doors .
and there are doctors trying , amid the hurly-burly , to do what they want to do - to treat patients , to ease suffering .
i was there , traumatised as any parent would be , with my eight-year-old son who had just been diagnosed with a chronic and life-changing illness : type one diabetes .
it was just before christmas .
a piece of paper on the bed informed us that we were entitled to select a present for sam , free of charge , from a room in another part of the hospital .
i imagine the nhs has similar kindnesses at that time of year and i imagine the parents ' tears and the doctors ' efficiency are also much the same .
but there the similarity ends .
mounting bills late on christmas eve - with sam out of hospital - i went to the chemist to pick up the kit : the syringes and emergency injections that will now be part of our life .
we are very well insured but i still paid more than $ 200 -lrb- £ 134 -rrb- in so-called co-pays ... amounts for each medicine that an individual is expected to fork out for , even when the recipient is a child . "
fifteen percent of americans - including eight million children - have no insurance " for a person with no insurance or inadequate cover , amid the sadness and the stress of the diagnosis , this would have been a further blow .
to be followed by more .
days after christmas , as we were still struggling with our syringes and sam was still wondering innocently if his disease might soon be cured , the real bills started arriving : $ 2,700 -lrb- £ 1,815 -rrb- ... then another $ 800 -lrb- £ 538 -rrb- .
" urology " , it says starkly .
i assume that was a urine sample .
it seems a bit pricey but there is no way of challenging this tsunami of reckoning .
the insurers wrote as well to say they had decided to pay the first bill .
on the other - urology - they are so far silent .
fifteen percent of americans - including eight million children - have no insurance .
diagnosed with diabetes , as sam was , they would have been treated at washington children 's hospital - it insists proudly that it turns no-one away - but probably only after collapsing , because uninsured people tend not to go to the doctor to investigate symptoms .

the research project is designed to investigate the effects of zero gravity on the body 's muscle development and its physiology .
the worms caenorhabditis elegans will spend about two weeks on the space station in october .
worms suffer from muscle atrophy or muscle loss under many of the same conditions as humans .
dr nathaniel szewczyk from the institute of clinical research in derby studies the signals which control muscle protein degradation .
he said : " worms are an excellent model to study the genetic basis of muscle atrophy .
this flight should allow us to continue to uncover new ways muscle atrophy is controlled .
" our current results suggest that our findings from this space flight mission may be of particular interest not only to astronauts but also to individuals who are bed-ridden , immobilized in casts , aged or who suffer from diabetes . "
dr szewczyk wants to explain why astronauts can experience dramatic muscle degradation , with some losing up to 60 % of their muscle density in a single mission .
