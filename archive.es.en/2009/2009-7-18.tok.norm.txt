merkel is relying on bavarian conservative horst seehofer to help put her back in office . with only a few short months to go before germany 's federal elections , chancellor angela merkel is leaving no stone unturned as she strives to get her party , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , returned to government .
this time , she wants to rule without having to form a coalition with the left-wing social democrats .
current polls suggest that she will be able to achieve that goal .
to do so , the cdu and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - the cdu 's sister party in the southern state of bavaria - would then form a coalition with the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
yet relations between the conservative cdu and csu , which form a single parliamentary bloc in berlin , have been strained of late .
the csu has challenged merkel 's position on two major issues : the european union 's lisbon treaty and taxes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer told merkel that the csu had " bite " merkel wants germany to ratify the lisbon treaty before the election on september 27 but the csu – traditionally more euro-skeptic than the cdu – wants german law to be changed first , which would likely delay ratification of the treaty until after the election .
the csu is also demanding a timetable for tax cuts .
but at the csu 's party convention in nuremberg on friday , chancellor merkel and csu leader horst seehofer were all smiles – although it may have just had something to do with the fact that friday was also merkel 's 55th birthday .
seehofer presented merkel with a dictionary that translates bavarian dialect into standard german .
" i can imagine that you sometimes have difficulty understanding us , " he said – and seehofer was surely not just referring to language differences .
on saturday , seehofer was re-elected to head the csu with 88 percent of votes from party members .
merkel called on the two parties to work together .
" dear horst seehofer , we will march in one direction , arm in arm , " she said .
iran called on to allow demonstrations while in nuremberg , merkel also addressed several global issues , including the recent unrest in iran and the economic crisis .
she called on authorities in iran to allow citizens there to express their opinions freely , and to be able to demonstrate .
merkel also criticized the financial industries in new york and london , and said she would push for tougher financial market regulation at the g20 forum .
" we are not going to allow wall street and the city of london dictate to us again about how to earn money , only to leave others to foot the bill , " she said. ca / dpa / afp / reuters editor : trinity hartmann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

italy , for one , is shaking in its boot . the sight of water swishing around craggy rocks and wooden fishing boats in vernazza 's tiny harbor is postcard perfect .
the village is just one of several in italy 's cinque terre region that are strung along the coastline like gems on a necklace . in vernazza , vineyards perch on the cliffs above and the harbor is rimmed with pastel-colored homes and restaurants - a perfect setting for a romantic getaway . the problem is , fewer are deciding to get away to this picturesque region as the world stumbles through the global economic crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.07.2009 german pirates plot course for general elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the pirate party politely hopes to burn the opposition 's ships " while germany 's larger parties are stepping up their campaigns , there is a host of less established parties joining the race .
the pirate party is one of them . fabio reinhardt , 28 , has just graduated from braunschweig in history and political science .
as the pirate party 's new media liaison officer , he has decided to devote the next two months to getting the pirates into parliament .
" for me it started two years ago when i was looking for ways to bring civil rights more into german politics , " he said .
the pirate party was founded in 2006 by 50 technically savvy 20-somethings who champion the internet as a foundation of freedom of expression and democracy .
perceived as something of a single-issue party fighting for freedom from lobbyists , the right to legally download music for free and total freedom from government web censorship , it is the german government 's recently enacted legislation against online child pornography that has truly put the wind into the party 's sails .
' censursula ' the new law , drafted by the federal ministry of family affairs was officially legislated to contain child pornography on the internet .
disparaged by experts as being almost totally ineffective , the law – which gives the federal criminal police office the right to block certain websites - generated a storm on the internet with over 150,000 people signing an internet petition against family minister ursula von der leyen 's censorship legislation .
" it is a hoax ; it does n't deal with the problem of child porn being distributed .
it makes it possible for the german police force to ban internet sites .
and this is the beginning of censorship .
it is a problem with the balance of power in germany and this is a very severe problem , " reinhardt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tauss denies child pornography accusations child pornography has become something of a party issue after former social democrat joerg tauss , the pirates ' only member with mainstream political experience , was accused of downloading child pornography .
tauss has denied the accusations and so far the pirate party is standing behind him .
reinhardt says tauss was in fact researching how child pornography is distributed , claiming that as most trade happens by telephone or by mail , an internet censorship law is irrelevant .
while reinhardt agrees that tauss may have overstepped his authority , he is clear that no one in the party believes he was a user of child pornography .
reinhardt says child pornography is one of the points that forces a necessary discussion on the remit of the state in protecting its citizens .
" on the one side you have to have a state that is limiting the rights of its citizens for their own good .
but we think that the state right now is crossing the line and is breaching civil rights in a very harmful way .
so right now we are trying to restore the balance because we think that we have lost this balance in europe , " he said .
claims pertaining to an attempt to readjust the balance in power in europe would , not so long ago , have sounded absurd .
but since the party 's largest convention in hamburg two weeks ago business is booming .
membership has shot up from 750 to 4,000 in under a month and reinhardt claims as many as 100 new members are joining every day .
in june , the pirate party 's swedish counterparts took an astonishing seven percent of the national vote in the european parliamentary elections .
and with a surge in media interest and a general political malaise among 20- to 30-somethings , the german party , under the chairmanship of jens seipenbusch , is now a presence on the scene .
another small glitch for the pirates comes in the form of party member bodo thiesen , who allegedly made comments denying the holocaust and other dubious right-wing extremist comments .
" nobody in our party believes that he is actually denying the holocaust , " reinhardt said .
" but thiesen is a very strong proponent of freedom of opinion in every sense .
we are struggling with how to deal with thiesen 's opinions .
we as a very young party have still to find a way to deal with this , " reinhardt said .
thiesen has since apologized for generating trouble for the party and explicitly denied any comments about holocaust denial .
a further critique , and one that is some ways tied in with media stereotyping of the party , is the lack of female members .
a party of young male computer nerds – that is the perception .
at a recruitment night in berlin , of the 50 participants there were , at least , seven women .
twenty-four year-old lena simon feels comfortable as one of the few women in the party but does want the topic raised .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg greeted the largest number of pirates yet at the annual party convention " i think a lot of the men here would like to see more women in the party .
we need more women .
computers are becoming more important every day and women should not stay in the background .
women should take part in this , " she said .
pirates are more than just a single-issue party with the media content to put some emphasis onto the party 's inexperience and the pale , slightly spotty , young man emerging from behind his mac to take on the world , the party ' cadres ' say they do n't really care as long as their message gets across .
martin hecker is on the berlin pirates committee .
" this is really about the rights of people in the internet age .
and there are people who get it and people who do n't .
i think , go for it and see what happens .
europe is very intransparent and so laws are passed and we need to act on that .
the best that could happen is that we get a lot of media interest and that people start to see what we are doing and that there is a lot of interest and people start to copy what we are doing .
because we are about copying the good stuff i just want this stupid legislation not to pass , " he said .
the idea of copying , or ' piracy ' is a strong theme of the party 's ideology .
reinhardt vehemently denies that they are a single-issue party .
education is a big theme as well as how to use the net to further co-operative democracy .
the party has no central planning committee , rather they gather ideas – sent in online by members – which are then distributed and put into policy suggestions .
as with the concept of ' piracy ' reinhardt and hecker are clear that they have no problem with other parties taking their ideas .
it is not about power , or personally sitting in parliament they say .
it is about getting policies through – and if that means the greens adopting a pirate idea , then why not .
despite some good humored language and piracy tomfoolery – reinhardt even manages a straight face as he says the pirates are ready to board the opposition 's ships and sail into the open sea of politics – the party does not want to be seen as a joke .
aron koenig , at 45 , the biblical father of the group and committee representative says the party is not a one-hit wonder .
" the name ' pirate party ' is unconventional and it might make people think that we are a joke but we are definitely not .
we have a funny name but we are serious .
civil rights and freedom are not a joke issue .
we are the fastest growing party in german democracy and i think we can do a lot with that vote .
we will stay .
it is not a one hit wonder , we are here to stay , " says koenig .

and with a surge in media interest and a general political malaise among 20- to 30-somethings , the german party , under the chairmanship of jens seipenbusch , is now a presence on the scene .
another small glitch for the pirates comes in the form of party member bodo thiesen , who allegedly made comments denying the holocaust and other dubious right-wing extremist comments .
" nobody in our party believes that he is actually denying the holocaust , " reinhardt said .
" but thiesen is a very strong proponent of freedom of opinion in every sense .
we are struggling with how to deal with thiesen 's opinions .
we as a very young party have still to find a way to deal with this , " reinhardt said .
thiesen has since apologized for generating trouble for the party and explicitly denied any comments about holocaust denial .
a further critique , and one that is some ways tied in with media stereotyping of the party , is the lack of female members .
a party of young male computer nerds – that is the perception .
at a recruitment night in berlin , of the 50 participants there were , at least , seven women .
twenty-four year-old lena simon feels comfortable as one of the few women in the party but does want the topic raised .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg greeted the largest number of pirates yet at the annual party convention " i think a lot of the men here would like to see more women in the party .
we need more women .
computers are becoming more important every day and women should not stay in the background .
women should take part in this , " she said .
pirates are more than just a single-issue party with the media content to put some emphasis onto the party 's inexperience and the pale , slightly spotty , young man emerging from behind his mac to take on the world , the party ' cadres ' say they do n't really care as long as their message gets across .
martin hecker is on the berlin pirates committee .
" this is really about the rights of people in the internet age .
and there are people who get it and people who do n't .
i think , go for it and see what happens .
europe is very intransparent and so laws are passed and we need to act on that .
the best that could happen is that we get a lot of media interest and that people start to see what we are doing and that there is a lot of interest and people start to copy what we are doing .
because we are about copying the good stuff i just want this stupid legislation not to pass , " he said .
the idea of copying , or ' piracy ' is a strong theme of the party 's ideology .
reinhardt vehemently denies that they are a single-issue party .
education is a big theme as well as how to use the net to further co-operative democracy .
the party has no central planning committee , rather they gather ideas – sent in online by members – which are then distributed and put into policy suggestions .
as with the concept of ' piracy ' reinhardt and hecker are clear that they have no problem with other parties taking their ideas .
it is not about power , or personally sitting in parliament they say .
it is about getting policies through – and if that means the greens adopting a pirate idea , then why not .
despite some good humored language and piracy tomfoolery – reinhardt even manages a straight face as he says the pirates are ready to board the opposition 's ships and sail into the open sea of politics – the party does not want to be seen as a joke .
aron koenig , at 45 , the biblical father of the group and committee representative says the party is not a one-hit wonder .
" the name ' pirate party ' is unconventional and it might make people think that we are a joke but we are definitely not .
we have a funny name but we are serious .
civil rights and freedom are not a joke issue .
we are the fastest growing party in german democracy and i think we can do a lot with that vote .
we will stay .
it is not a one hit wonder , we are here to stay , " says koenig .

the pirate party is one of them . fabio reinhardt , 28 , has just graduated from braunschweig in history and political science .
as the pirate party 's new media liaison officer , he has decided to devote the next two months to getting the pirates into parliament .
" for me it started two years ago when i was looking for ways to bring civil rights more into german politics , " he said .
the pirate party was founded in 2006 by 50 technically savvy 20-somethings who champion the internet as a foundation of freedom of expression and democracy .
perceived as something of a single-issue party fighting for freedom from lobbyists , the right to legally download music for free and total freedom from government web censorship , it is the german government 's recently enacted legislation against online child pornography that has truly put the wind into the party 's sails .
' censursula ' the new law , drafted by the federal ministry of family affairs was officially legislated to contain child pornography on the internet .
disparaged by experts as being almost totally ineffective , the law – which gives the federal criminal police office the right to block certain websites - generated a storm on the internet with over 150,000 people signing an internet petition against family minister ursula von der leyen 's censorship legislation .
" it is a hoax ; it does n't deal with the problem of child porn being distributed .
it makes it possible for the german police force to ban internet sites .
and this is the beginning of censorship .
it is a problem with the balance of power in germany and this is a very severe problem , " reinhardt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tauss denies child pornography accusations child pornography has become something of a party issue after former social democrat joerg tauss , the pirates ' only member with mainstream political experience , was accused of downloading child pornography .
tauss has denied the accusations and so far the pirate party is standing behind him .
reinhardt says tauss was in fact researching how child pornography is distributed , claiming that as most trade happens by telephone or by mail , an internet censorship law is irrelevant .
while reinhardt agrees that tauss may have overstepped his authority , he is clear that no one in the party believes he was a user of child pornography .
reinhardt says child pornography is one of the points that forces a necessary discussion on the remit of the state in protecting its citizens .
" on the one side you have to have a state that is limiting the rights of its citizens for their own good .
but we think that the state right now is crossing the line and is breaching civil rights in a very harmful way .
so right now we are trying to restore the balance because we think that we have lost this balance in europe , " he said .
claims pertaining to an attempt to readjust the balance in power in europe would , not so long ago , have sounded absurd .
but since the party 's largest convention in hamburg two weeks ago business is booming .
membership has shot up from 750 to 4,000 in under a month and reinhardt claims as many as 100 new members are joining every day .
in june , the pirate party 's swedish counterparts took an astonishing seven percent of the national vote in the european parliamentary elections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.07.2009 german pirates plot course for general elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the pirate party politely hopes to burn the opposition 's ships " while germany 's larger parties are stepping up their campaigns , there is a host of less established parties joining the race .
the pirate party is one of them . fabio reinhardt , 28 , has just graduated from braunschweig in history and political science .
as the pirate party 's new media liaison officer , he has decided to devote the next two months to getting the pirates into parliament .
" for me it started two years ago when i was looking for ways to bring civil rights more into german politics , " he said .
the pirate party was founded in 2006 by 50 technically savvy 20-somethings who champion the internet as a foundation of freedom of expression and democracy .
perceived as something of a single-issue party fighting for freedom from lobbyists , the right to legally download music for free and total freedom from government web censorship , it is the german government 's recently enacted legislation against online child pornography that has truly put the wind into the party 's sails .
' censursula ' the new law , drafted by the federal ministry of family affairs was officially legislated to contain child pornography on the internet .
disparaged by experts as being almost totally ineffective , the law – which gives the federal criminal police office the right to block certain websites - generated a storm on the internet with over 150,000 people signing an internet petition against family minister ursula von der leyen 's censorship legislation .
" it is a hoax ; it does n't deal with the problem of child porn being distributed .
it makes it possible for the german police force to ban internet sites .
and this is the beginning of censorship .
it is a problem with the balance of power in germany and this is a very severe problem , " reinhardt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tauss denies child pornography accusations child pornography has become something of a party issue after former social democrat joerg tauss , the pirates ' only member with mainstream political experience , was accused of downloading child pornography .
tauss has denied the accusations and so far the pirate party is standing behind him .
reinhardt says tauss was in fact researching how child pornography is distributed , claiming that as most trade happens by telephone or by mail , an internet censorship law is irrelevant .
while reinhardt agrees that tauss may have overstepped his authority , he is clear that no one in the party believes he was a user of child pornography .
reinhardt says child pornography is one of the points that forces a necessary discussion on the remit of the state in protecting its citizens .
" on the one side you have to have a state that is limiting the rights of its citizens for their own good .
but we think that the state right now is crossing the line and is breaching civil rights in a very harmful way .
so right now we are trying to restore the balance because we think that we have lost this balance in europe , " he said .
claims pertaining to an attempt to readjust the balance in power in europe would , not so long ago , have sounded absurd .
but since the party 's largest convention in hamburg two weeks ago business is booming .
membership has shot up from 750 to 4,000 in under a month and reinhardt claims as many as 100 new members are joining every day .
in june , the pirate party 's swedish counterparts took an astonishing seven percent of the national vote in the european parliamentary elections .
and with a surge in media interest and a general political malaise among 20- to 30-somethings , the german party , under the chairmanship of jens seipenbusch , is now a presence on the scene .
another small glitch for the pirates comes in the form of party member bodo thiesen , who allegedly made comments denying the holocaust and other dubious right-wing extremist comments .
" nobody in our party believes that he is actually denying the holocaust , " reinhardt said .
" but thiesen is a very strong proponent of freedom of opinion in every sense .
we are struggling with how to deal with thiesen 's opinions .
we as a very young party have still to find a way to deal with this , " reinhardt said .
thiesen has since apologized for generating trouble for the party and explicitly denied any comments about holocaust denial .
a further critique , and one that is some ways tied in with media stereotyping of the party , is the lack of female members .
a party of young male computer nerds – that is the perception .
at a recruitment night in berlin , of the 50 participants there were , at least , seven women .
twenty-four year-old lena simon feels comfortable as one of the few women in the party but does want the topic raised .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg greeted the largest number of pirates yet at the annual party convention " i think a lot of the men here would like to see more women in the party .
we need more women .
computers are becoming more important every day and women should not stay in the background .
women should take part in this , " she said .
pirates are more than just a single-issue party with the media content to put some emphasis onto the party 's inexperience and the pale , slightly spotty , young man emerging from behind his mac to take on the world , the party ' cadres ' say they do n't really care as long as their message gets across .
martin hecker is on the berlin pirates committee .
" this is really about the rights of people in the internet age .
and there are people who get it and people who do n't .
i think , go for it and see what happens .
europe is very intransparent and so laws are passed and we need to act on that .
the best that could happen is that we get a lot of media interest and that people start to see what we are doing and that there is a lot of interest and people start to copy what we are doing .
because we are about copying the good stuff i just want this stupid legislation not to pass , " he said .
the idea of copying , or ' piracy ' is a strong theme of the party 's ideology .
reinhardt vehemently denies that they are a single-issue party .
education is a big theme as well as how to use the net to further co-operative democracy .
the party has no central planning committee , rather they gather ideas – sent in online by members – which are then distributed and put into policy suggestions .
as with the concept of ' piracy ' reinhardt and hecker are clear that they have no problem with other parties taking their ideas .
it is not about power , or personally sitting in parliament they say .
it is about getting policies through – and if that means the greens adopting a pirate idea , then why not .
despite some good humored language and piracy tomfoolery – reinhardt even manages a straight face as he says the pirates are ready to board the opposition 's ships and sail into the open sea of politics – the party does not want to be seen as a joke .
aron koenig , at 45 , the biblical father of the group and committee representative says the party is not a one-hit wonder .
" the name ' pirate party ' is unconventional and it might make people think that we are a joke but we are definitely not .
we have a funny name but we are serious .

so whose fault is it ? after protracted negotiations and with the situation in the darfur region of sudan deteriorating , the international community finally agreed to set up a joint peace operation .
a year and half ago , the united nations and the african union deployed troops to darfur as part of the unamid mission to establish peace and protect the people in the troubled province in western sudan .
according to un estimates , the conflict there has claimed more than 300,000 lives since 2003 .
to carry out its operation , unamid requested 24 helicopters to support its 17,000 troops .
but a year and a half after the launch of the mission , unamid is still without choppers .
since unamid itself does n't possess airlift capabilities , it is dependent on contributions from individual countries .
so far , no country has provided any helicopters to the darfur mission .
susana malcorra , the head of the department of field support at the un in new york , thinks the reason why darfur has n't received any choppers is because they have been deployed to other international hotspots .
" it seems like the need of helicopters has become a big ticket item in afghanistan and iraq " , she says and adds that other un missions in africa are also lacking airlift capabilities .
" it 's not only unamid that is short of helicopters .
we are also behind in chad and now we have a question for additional helicopters in the democratic republic of congo . "
other priorities lauren gelfand , africa editor with jane 's defence weekly in london , argues that there actually are plenty of choppers available around the world , but africa is simply not a high priority for the un member states that own them . " i think that there is a misconception about helicopters " , gelfand says .
" they are assets of the individual countries .
there is not a big pool of helicopters , like a lending library , where you can just get and keep them then for a couple of months for your operation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : choppers could benefit unamid soldiers greatly malcorra and gelfand both do agree that choppers would make an important contribution , especially in a vast area like darfur .
" the helicopters , " says malcorra , " give us the possibility to move our forces at a speed that otherwise is not possible .
this is critical for the mandate unamid has . "
what 's more , says gelfand : " a helicopter flies low enough that you can have a look outside the window and see what 's really going on .
in an area as remote , as large and as difficult as darfur , that 's very useful . " help from ethiopia while it is clear that helicopters would greatly enhance the mission in darfur , it 's uncertain whether countries will finally come forward and supply them to unamid .
just how cumbersome it is to get choppers to darfur is highlighted by the fact that then us-senator joe biden introduced a resolution to the us senate urging the international community to dispatch helicopters to darfur .
biden 's bill had 33 co-sponsors and was passed unanimously .
that was back in february of 2008 .
since then joe biden has become us vice president , but neither the united states nor any other country have sent helicopters to darfur . ethiopia so far is the only country that has vowed to provide helicopters .
it pledged to sent five choppers to darfur in october . " it will make a difference , " says susana malcorra .
" but we need more . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de peacekeeping -pipe- 18.07.2009 lack of helicopters hurts darfur peace mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helicopters are desperately needed in darfur after its launch a year and half ago the international peace mission in darfur , still lacks an important asset to carry out its operation - helicopters .
so whose fault is it ? after protracted negotiations and with the situation in the darfur region of sudan deteriorating , the international community finally agreed to set up a joint peace operation .
a year and half ago , the united nations and the african union deployed troops to darfur as part of the unamid mission to establish peace and protect the people in the troubled province in western sudan .
according to un estimates , the conflict there has claimed more than 300,000 lives since 2003 .
to carry out its operation , unamid requested 24 helicopters to support its 17,000 troops .
but a year and a half after the launch of the mission , unamid is still without choppers .
since unamid itself does n't possess airlift capabilities , it is dependent on contributions from individual countries .
so far , no country has provided any helicopters to the darfur mission .
susana malcorra , the head of the department of field support at the un in new york , thinks the reason why darfur has n't received any choppers is because they have been deployed to other international hotspots .
" it seems like the need of helicopters has become a big ticket item in afghanistan and iraq " , she says and adds that other un missions in africa are also lacking airlift capabilities .
" it 's not only unamid that is short of helicopters .
we are also behind in chad and now we have a question for additional helicopters in the democratic republic of congo . "
other priorities lauren gelfand , africa editor with jane 's defence weekly in london , argues that there actually are plenty of choppers available around the world , but africa is simply not a high priority for the un member states that own them . " i think that there is a misconception about helicopters " , gelfand says .
" they are assets of the individual countries .
there is not a big pool of helicopters , like a lending library , where you can just get and keep them then for a couple of months for your operation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : choppers could benefit unamid soldiers greatly malcorra and gelfand both do agree that choppers would make an important contribution , especially in a vast area like darfur .
" the helicopters , " says malcorra , " give us the possibility to move our forces at a speed that otherwise is not possible .
this is critical for the mandate unamid has . "
what 's more , says gelfand : " a helicopter flies low enough that you can have a look outside the window and see what 's really going on .
in an area as remote , as large and as difficult as darfur , that 's very useful . " help from ethiopia while it is clear that helicopters would greatly enhance the mission in darfur , it 's uncertain whether countries will finally come forward and supply them to unamid .
just how cumbersome it is to get choppers to darfur is highlighted by the fact that then us-senator joe biden introduced a resolution to the us senate urging the international community to dispatch helicopters to darfur .
biden 's bill had 33 co-sponsors and was passed unanimously .
that was back in february of 2008 .
since then joe biden has become us vice president , but neither the united states nor any other country have sent helicopters to darfur . ethiopia so far is the only country that has vowed to provide helicopters .
it pledged to sent five choppers to darfur in october . " it will make a difference , " says susana malcorra .
" but we need more . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : election 2009 economic , environmental issues top election agenda poll : most germans expect angela merkel will continue as chancellor steinmeier defends plan to create 4 million jobs by 2020 german conservatives gear up for fall elections politics -pipe- 18.07.2009 merkel calls for unity ahead of national elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel called on conservatives to be " friendly and amicable " german chancellor angela merkel has called for unity among squabbling conservatives in the lead-up to september 's elections .
merkel is relying on bavarian conservative horst seehofer to help put her back in office . with only a few short months to go before germany 's federal elections , chancellor angela merkel is leaving no stone unturned as she strives to get her party , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , returned to government .
this time , she wants to rule without having to form a coalition with the left-wing social democrats .
current polls suggest that she will be able to achieve that goal .
to do so , the cdu and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - the cdu 's sister party in the southern state of bavaria - would then form a coalition with the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
yet relations between the conservative cdu and csu , which form a single parliamentary bloc in berlin , have been strained of late .
the csu has challenged merkel 's position on two major issues : the european union 's lisbon treaty and taxes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.07.2009 german pirates plot course for general elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the pirate party politely hopes to burn the opposition 's ships " while germany 's larger parties are stepping up their campaigns , there is a host of less established parties joining the race .
the pirate party is one of them . fabio reinhardt , 28 , has just graduated from braunschweig in history and political science .
as the pirate party 's new media liaison officer , he has decided to devote the next two months to getting the pirates into parliament .
" for me it started two years ago when i was looking for ways to bring civil rights more into german politics , " he said .
the pirate party was founded in 2006 by 50 technically savvy 20-somethings who champion the internet as a foundation of freedom of expression and democracy .
perceived as something of a single-issue party fighting for freedom from lobbyists , the right to legally download music for free and total freedom from government web censorship , it is the german government 's recently enacted legislation against online child pornography that has truly put the wind into the party 's sails .
' censursula ' the new law , drafted by the federal ministry of family affairs was officially legislated to contain child pornography on the internet .
disparaged by experts as being almost totally ineffective , the law – which gives the federal criminal police office the right to block certain websites - generated a storm on the internet with over 150,000 people signing an internet petition against family minister ursula von der leyen 's censorship legislation .
" it is a hoax ; it does n't deal with the problem of child porn being distributed .
it makes it possible for the german police force to ban internet sites .
and this is the beginning of censorship .
it is a problem with the balance of power in germany and this is a very severe problem , " reinhardt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tauss denies child pornography accusations child pornography has become something of a party issue after former social democrat joerg tauss , the pirates ' only member with mainstream political experience , was accused of downloading child pornography .
tauss has denied the accusations and so far the pirate party is standing behind him .
reinhardt says tauss was in fact researching how child pornography is distributed , claiming that as most trade happens by telephone or by mail , an internet censorship law is irrelevant .
while reinhardt agrees that tauss may have overstepped his authority , he is clear that no one in the party believes he was a user of child pornography .
reinhardt says child pornography is one of the points that forces a necessary discussion on the remit of the state in protecting its citizens .
" on the one side you have to have a state that is limiting the rights of its citizens for their own good .
but we think that the state right now is crossing the line and is breaching civil rights in a very harmful way .
so right now we are trying to restore the balance because we think that we have lost this balance in europe , " he said .
claims pertaining to an attempt to readjust the balance in power in europe would , not so long ago , have sounded absurd .
but since the party 's largest convention in hamburg two weeks ago business is booming .
membership has shot up from 750 to 4,000 in under a month and reinhardt claims as many as 100 new members are joining every day .
in june , the pirate party 's swedish counterparts took an astonishing seven percent of the national vote in the european parliamentary elections .
and with a surge in media interest and a general political malaise among 20- to 30-somethings , the german party , under the chairmanship of jens seipenbusch , is now a presence on the scene .
another small glitch for the pirates comes in the form of party member bodo thiesen , who allegedly made comments denying the holocaust and other dubious right-wing extremist comments .
" nobody in our party believes that he is actually denying the holocaust , " reinhardt said .
" but thiesen is a very strong proponent of freedom of opinion in every sense .
we are struggling with how to deal with thiesen 's opinions .
we as a very young party have still to find a way to deal with this , " reinhardt said .
thiesen has since apologized for generating trouble for the party and explicitly denied any comments about holocaust denial .
a further critique , and one that is some ways tied in with media stereotyping of the party , is the lack of female members .
a party of young male computer nerds – that is the perception .
at a recruitment night in berlin , of the 50 participants there were , at least , seven women .
twenty-four year-old lena simon feels comfortable as one of the few women in the party but does want the topic raised .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg greeted the largest number of pirates yet at the annual party convention " i think a lot of the men here would like to see more women in the party .
we need more women .
computers are becoming more important every day and women should not stay in the background .
women should take part in this , " she said .
pirates are more than just a single-issue party with the media content to put some emphasis onto the party 's inexperience and the pale , slightly spotty , young man emerging from behind his mac to take on the world , the party ' cadres ' say they do n't really care as long as their message gets across .
martin hecker is on the berlin pirates committee .
" this is really about the rights of people in the internet age .
and there are people who get it and people who do n't .
i think , go for it and see what happens .
europe is very intransparent and so laws are passed and we need to act on that .
the best that could happen is that we get a lot of media interest and that people start to see what we are doing and that there is a lot of interest and people start to copy what we are doing .
because we are about copying the good stuff i just want this stupid legislation not to pass , " he said .
the idea of copying , or ' piracy ' is a strong theme of the party 's ideology .
reinhardt vehemently denies that they are a single-issue party .
education is a big theme as well as how to use the net to further co-operative democracy .
the party has no central planning committee , rather they gather ideas – sent in online by members – which are then distributed and put into policy suggestions .
as with the concept of ' piracy ' reinhardt and hecker are clear that they have no problem with other parties taking their ideas .
it is not about power , or personally sitting in parliament they say .
it is about getting policies through – and if that means the greens adopting a pirate idea , then why not .
despite some good humored language and piracy tomfoolery – reinhardt even manages a straight face as he says the pirates are ready to board the opposition 's ships and sail into the open sea of politics – the party does not want to be seen as a joke .
aron koenig , at 45 , the biblical father of the group and committee representative says the party is not a one-hit wonder .
" the name ' pirate party ' is unconventional and it might make people think that we are a joke but we are definitely not .
we have a funny name but we are serious .
civil rights and freedom are not a joke issue .
we are the fastest growing party in german democracy and i think we can do a lot with that vote .
we will stay .
it is not a one hit wonder , we are here to stay , " says koenig .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.07.2009 german pirates plot course for general elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the pirate party politely hopes to burn the opposition 's ships " while germany 's larger parties are stepping up their campaigns , there is a host of less established parties joining the race .
the pirate party is one of them . fabio reinhardt , 28 , has just graduated from braunschweig in history and political science .
as the pirate party 's new media liaison officer , he has decided to devote the next two months to getting the pirates into parliament .
" for me it started two years ago when i was looking for ways to bring civil rights more into german politics , " he said .
the pirate party was founded in 2006 by 50 technically savvy 20-somethings who champion the internet as a foundation of freedom of expression and democracy .
perceived as something of a single-issue party fighting for freedom from lobbyists , the right to legally download music for free and total freedom from government web censorship , it is the german government 's recently enacted legislation against online child pornography that has truly put the wind into the party 's sails .
' censursula ' the new law , drafted by the federal ministry of family affairs was officially legislated to contain child pornography on the internet .
disparaged by experts as being almost totally ineffective , the law – which gives the federal criminal police office the right to block certain websites - generated a storm on the internet with over 150,000 people signing an internet petition against family minister ursula von der leyen 's censorship legislation .
" it is a hoax ; it does n't deal with the problem of child porn being distributed .
it makes it possible for the german police force to ban internet sites .
and this is the beginning of censorship .
it is a problem with the balance of power in germany and this is a very severe problem , " reinhardt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tauss denies child pornography accusations child pornography has become something of a party issue after former social democrat joerg tauss , the pirates ' only member with mainstream political experience , was accused of downloading child pornography .
tauss has denied the accusations and so far the pirate party is standing behind him .
reinhardt says tauss was in fact researching how child pornography is distributed , claiming that as most trade happens by telephone or by mail , an internet censorship law is irrelevant .
while reinhardt agrees that tauss may have overstepped his authority , he is clear that no one in the party believes he was a user of child pornography .
reinhardt says child pornography is one of the points that forces a necessary discussion on the remit of the state in protecting its citizens .
" on the one side you have to have a state that is limiting the rights of its citizens for their own good .
but we think that the state right now is crossing the line and is breaching civil rights in a very harmful way .
so right now we are trying to restore the balance because we think that we have lost this balance in europe , " he said .
claims pertaining to an attempt to readjust the balance in power in europe would , not so long ago , have sounded absurd .
but since the party 's largest convention in hamburg two weeks ago business is booming .
membership has shot up from 750 to 4,000 in under a month and reinhardt claims as many as 100 new members are joining every day .
in june , the pirate party 's swedish counterparts took an astonishing seven percent of the national vote in the european parliamentary elections .
and with a surge in media interest and a general political malaise among 20- to 30-somethings , the german party , under the chairmanship of jens seipenbusch , is now a presence on the scene .
another small glitch for the pirates comes in the form of party member bodo thiesen , who allegedly made comments denying the holocaust and other dubious right-wing extremist comments .
" nobody in our party believes that he is actually denying the holocaust , " reinhardt said .
" but thiesen is a very strong proponent of freedom of opinion in every sense .
we are struggling with how to deal with thiesen 's opinions .
we as a very young party have still to find a way to deal with this , " reinhardt said .
thiesen has since apologized for generating trouble for the party and explicitly denied any comments about holocaust denial .
a further critique , and one that is some ways tied in with media stereotyping of the party , is the lack of female members .
a party of young male computer nerds – that is the perception .
at a recruitment night in berlin , of the 50 participants there were , at least , seven women .
twenty-four year-old lena simon feels comfortable as one of the few women in the party but does want the topic raised .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg greeted the largest number of pirates yet at the annual party convention " i think a lot of the men here would like to see more women in the party .
we need more women .
computers are becoming more important every day and women should not stay in the background .
women should take part in this , " she said .
pirates are more than just a single-issue party with the media content to put some emphasis onto the party 's inexperience and the pale , slightly spotty , young man emerging from behind his mac to take on the world , the party ' cadres ' say they do n't really care as long as their message gets across .
martin hecker is on the berlin pirates committee .
" this is really about the rights of people in the internet age .
and there are people who get it and people who do n't .
i think , go for it and see what happens .
europe is very intransparent and so laws are passed and we need to act on that .
the best that could happen is that we get a lot of media interest and that people start to see what we are doing and that there is a lot of interest and people start to copy what we are doing .
because we are about copying the good stuff i just want this stupid legislation not to pass , " he said .
the idea of copying , or ' piracy ' is a strong theme of the party 's ideology .
reinhardt vehemently denies that they are a single-issue party .
education is a big theme as well as how to use the net to further co-operative democracy .
the party has no central planning committee , rather they gather ideas – sent in online by members – which are then distributed and put into policy suggestions .
as with the concept of ' piracy ' reinhardt and hecker are clear that they have no problem with other parties taking their ideas .
it is not about power , or personally sitting in parliament they say .
it is about getting policies through – and if that means the greens adopting a pirate idea , then why not .
despite some good humored language and piracy tomfoolery – reinhardt even manages a straight face as he says the pirates are ready to board the opposition 's ships and sail into the open sea of politics – the party does not want to be seen as a joke .
aron koenig , at 45 , the biblical father of the group and committee representative says the party is not a one-hit wonder .
" the name ' pirate party ' is unconventional and it might make people think that we are a joke but we are definitely not .
we have a funny name but we are serious .
civil rights and freedom are not a joke issue .
we are the fastest growing party in german democracy and i think we can do a lot with that vote .
we will stay .
it is not a one hit wonder , we are here to stay , " says koenig .

" it is a hoax ; it does n't deal with the problem of child porn being distributed .
it makes it possible for the german police force to ban internet sites .
and this is the beginning of censorship .
it is a problem with the balance of power in germany and this is a very severe problem , " reinhardt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tauss denies child pornography accusations child pornography has become something of a party issue after former social democrat joerg tauss , the pirates ' only member with mainstream political experience , was accused of downloading child pornography .
tauss has denied the accusations and so far the pirate party is standing behind him .
reinhardt says tauss was in fact researching how child pornography is distributed , claiming that as most trade happens by telephone or by mail , an internet censorship law is irrelevant .
while reinhardt agrees that tauss may have overstepped his authority , he is clear that no one in the party believes he was a user of child pornography .
reinhardt says child pornography is one of the points that forces a necessary discussion on the remit of the state in protecting its citizens .
" on the one side you have to have a state that is limiting the rights of its citizens for their own good .
but we think that the state right now is crossing the line and is breaching civil rights in a very harmful way .
so right now we are trying to restore the balance because we think that we have lost this balance in europe , " he said .
claims pertaining to an attempt to readjust the balance in power in europe would , not so long ago , have sounded absurd .
but since the party 's largest convention in hamburg two weeks ago business is booming .
membership has shot up from 750 to 4,000 in under a month and reinhardt claims as many as 100 new members are joining every day .
in june , the pirate party 's swedish counterparts took an astonishing seven percent of the national vote in the european parliamentary elections .
and with a surge in media interest and a general political malaise among 20- to 30-somethings , the german party , under the chairmanship of jens seipenbusch , is now a presence on the scene .
another small glitch for the pirates comes in the form of party member bodo thiesen , who allegedly made comments denying the holocaust and other dubious right-wing extremist comments .
" nobody in our party believes that he is actually denying the holocaust , " reinhardt said .
" but thiesen is a very strong proponent of freedom of opinion in every sense .
we are struggling with how to deal with thiesen 's opinions .
we as a very young party have still to find a way to deal with this , " reinhardt said .
thiesen has since apologized for generating trouble for the party and explicitly denied any comments about holocaust denial .
a further critique , and one that is some ways tied in with media stereotyping of the party , is the lack of female members .
a party of young male computer nerds – that is the perception .
at a recruitment night in berlin , of the 50 participants there were , at least , seven women .
twenty-four year-old lena simon feels comfortable as one of the few women in the party but does want the topic raised .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg greeted the largest number of pirates yet at the annual party convention " i think a lot of the men here would like to see more women in the party .
we need more women .
computers are becoming more important every day and women should not stay in the background .
women should take part in this , " she said .
pirates are more than just a single-issue party with the media content to put some emphasis onto the party 's inexperience and the pale , slightly spotty , young man emerging from behind his mac to take on the world , the party ' cadres ' say they do n't really care as long as their message gets across .
martin hecker is on the berlin pirates committee .
" this is really about the rights of people in the internet age .
and there are people who get it and people who do n't .
i think , go for it and see what happens .
europe is very intransparent and so laws are passed and we need to act on that .
the best that could happen is that we get a lot of media interest and that people start to see what we are doing and that there is a lot of interest and people start to copy what we are doing .
because we are about copying the good stuff i just want this stupid legislation not to pass , " he said .
the idea of copying , or ' piracy ' is a strong theme of the party 's ideology .
reinhardt vehemently denies that they are a single-issue party .
education is a big theme as well as how to use the net to further co-operative democracy .
the party has no central planning committee , rather they gather ideas – sent in online by members – which are then distributed and put into policy suggestions .
as with the concept of ' piracy ' reinhardt and hecker are clear that they have no problem with other parties taking their ideas .
it is not about power , or personally sitting in parliament they say .
it is about getting policies through – and if that means the greens adopting a pirate idea , then why not .
despite some good humored language and piracy tomfoolery – reinhardt even manages a straight face as he says the pirates are ready to board the opposition 's ships and sail into the open sea of politics – the party does not want to be seen as a joke .
aron koenig , at 45 , the biblical father of the group and committee representative says the party is not a one-hit wonder .
" the name ' pirate party ' is unconventional and it might make people think that we are a joke but we are definitely not .
we have a funny name but we are serious .
civil rights and freedom are not a joke issue .
we are the fastest growing party in german democracy and i think we can do a lot with that vote .
we will stay .
it is not a one hit wonder , we are here to stay , " says koenig .

so whose fault is it ? after protracted negotiations and with the situation in the darfur region of sudan deteriorating , the international community finally agreed to set up a joint peace operation .
a year and half ago , the united nations and the african union deployed troops to darfur as part of the unamid mission to establish peace and protect the people in the troubled province in western sudan .
according to un estimates , the conflict there has claimed more than 300,000 lives since 2003 .
to carry out its operation , unamid requested 24 helicopters to support its 17,000 troops .
but a year and a half after the launch of the mission , unamid is still without choppers .
since unamid itself does n't possess airlift capabilities , it is dependent on contributions from individual countries .
so far , no country has provided any helicopters to the darfur mission .
susana malcorra , the head of the department of field support at the un in new york , thinks the reason why darfur has n't received any choppers is because they have been deployed to other international hotspots .
" it seems like the need of helicopters has become a big ticket item in afghanistan and iraq " , she says and adds that other un missions in africa are also lacking airlift capabilities .
" it 's not only unamid that is short of helicopters .
we are also behind in chad and now we have a question for additional helicopters in the democratic republic of congo . "
other priorities lauren gelfand , africa editor with jane 's defence weekly in london , argues that there actually are plenty of choppers available around the world , but africa is simply not a high priority for the un member states that own them . " i think that there is a misconception about helicopters " , gelfand says .
" they are assets of the individual countries .
there is not a big pool of helicopters , like a lending library , where you can just get and keep them then for a couple of months for your operation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : choppers could benefit unamid soldiers greatly malcorra and gelfand both do agree that choppers would make an important contribution , especially in a vast area like darfur .
" the helicopters , " says malcorra , " give us the possibility to move our forces at a speed that otherwise is not possible .
this is critical for the mandate unamid has . "
what 's more , says gelfand : " a helicopter flies low enough that you can have a look outside the window and see what 's really going on .
in an area as remote , as large and as difficult as darfur , that 's very useful . " help from ethiopia while it is clear that helicopters would greatly enhance the mission in darfur , it 's uncertain whether countries will finally come forward and supply them to unamid .
just how cumbersome it is to get choppers to darfur is highlighted by the fact that then us-senator joe biden introduced a resolution to the us senate urging the international community to dispatch helicopters to darfur .
biden 's bill had 33 co-sponsors and was passed unanimously .
that was back in february of 2008 .
since then joe biden has become us vice president , but neither the united states nor any other country have sent helicopters to darfur . ethiopia so far is the only country that has vowed to provide helicopters .
it pledged to sent five choppers to darfur in october . " it will make a difference , " says susana malcorra .
" but we need more . "

so whose fault is it ? after protracted negotiations and with the situation in the darfur region of sudan deteriorating , the international community finally agreed to set up a joint peace operation .
a year and half ago , the united nations and the african union deployed troops to darfur as part of the unamid mission to establish peace and protect the people in the troubled province in western sudan .
according to un estimates , the conflict there has claimed more than 300,000 lives since 2003 .
to carry out its operation , unamid requested 24 helicopters to support its 17,000 troops .
but a year and a half after the launch of the mission , unamid is still without choppers .
since unamid itself does n't possess airlift capabilities , it is dependent on contributions from individual countries .
so far , no country has provided any helicopters to the darfur mission .
susana malcorra , the head of the department of field support at the un in new york , thinks the reason why darfur has n't received any choppers is because they have been deployed to other international hotspots .
" it seems like the need of helicopters has become a big ticket item in afghanistan and iraq " , she says and adds that other un missions in africa are also lacking airlift capabilities .
" it 's not only unamid that is short of helicopters .
we are also behind in chad and now we have a question for additional helicopters in the democratic republic of congo . "
other priorities lauren gelfand , africa editor with jane 's defence weekly in london , argues that there actually are plenty of choppers available around the world , but africa is simply not a high priority for the un member states that own them . " i think that there is a misconception about helicopters " , gelfand says .
" they are assets of the individual countries .
there is not a big pool of helicopters , like a lending library , where you can just get and keep them then for a couple of months for your operation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : choppers could benefit unamid soldiers greatly malcorra and gelfand both do agree that choppers would make an important contribution , especially in a vast area like darfur .
" the helicopters , " says malcorra , " give us the possibility to move our forces at a speed that otherwise is not possible .
this is critical for the mandate unamid has . "
what 's more , says gelfand : " a helicopter flies low enough that you can have a look outside the window and see what 's really going on .
in an area as remote , as large and as difficult as darfur , that 's very useful . " help from ethiopia while it is clear that helicopters would greatly enhance the mission in darfur , it 's uncertain whether countries will finally come forward and supply them to unamid .
just how cumbersome it is to get choppers to darfur is highlighted by the fact that then us-senator joe biden introduced a resolution to the us senate urging the international community to dispatch helicopters to darfur .
biden 's bill had 33 co-sponsors and was passed unanimously .
that was back in february of 2008 .
since then joe biden has become us vice president , but neither the united states nor any other country have sent helicopters to darfur . ethiopia so far is the only country that has vowed to provide helicopters .
it pledged to sent five choppers to darfur in october . " it will make a difference , " says susana malcorra .
" but we need more . "

the call , made public in berlin , also has the support of nobel peace prize winner and iranian shirin ebadi .
the organizations are demanding , among other things , that iran respect human rights , a un investigation into the more serious and systematic human rights violations , the release of all non-violent political prisoners and an end to state-supported violence .
opposition answers back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafsanjani is considered the main rival of president ahmadinejad following friday prayers given by influential cleric and government critic akbar hashemi rafsanjani , up to one hundred thousand people took to the streets in iran in the first mass demonstration against the government in weeks , clashing with police .
eyewitnesses reported countless arrests and instances where police used tear gas .
rafsanjani , a former president of iran , has often criticized the government and has warned the current situation could turn into a real crisis .
" our main task is to regain the trust of the people , " said rafsanjani , who is often considered the main rival of president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
that would only happen if the government released those taken into custody while protesting the presidential election on june 12 .
" we have to learn to tolerate each other , " added the 75 year old cleric , who is a supporter of the opposition leader mir-hossein mussavi .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de travel -pipe- 18.07.2009 financial crisis has italy 's tourist regions getting nervous großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crowds are a bit thinner this year as more people decide to forgo vacations abroad due to the state of the global economy , regions dependent on tourism are worried , especially during the critical summer season .
italy , for one , is shaking in its boot . the sight of water swishing around craggy rocks and wooden fishing boats in vernazza 's tiny harbor is postcard perfect .
the village is just one of several in italy 's cinque terre region that are strung along the coastline like gems on a necklace . in vernazza , vineyards perch on the cliffs above and the harbor is rimmed with pastel-colored homes and restaurants - a perfect setting for a romantic getaway . the problem is , fewer are deciding to get away to this picturesque region as the world stumbles through the global economic crisis .
" vernazza and tourism are like husband and wife , " said edoardo basso , restaurateur at the taverna del capitano .
" and if the wife leaves ?
now is a problem in the house , there 's a crisis . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the crisis , some tourists are still making it to cinque terre for views such as this , of vernazza basso estimates that his restaurant 's business is down 25 percent .
those who do come to gobble up local delicacies , like twisted pasta with basil , are skipping that second course and after-dinner drink . fewer euros as the financial downturn continues to drag on the global economy and people 's pocketbooks , more europeans and others are choosing their backyard hammock or the local beach as holiday destinations .
those decisions are exacerbating an already worrisome situation for italy , where tourism is the number-one industry .
spending in early 2009 has declined nearly nine percent from the previous year . the fall-off has been even worse for sonia d 'ambra , owner of a gelateria , or ice-cream shop .
she watched business in march plummet by 50 percent over the previous year , although she thinks the weather and a late easter holiday contributed to the decline .
she is trying to remain optimistic about the rest of the summer season , although she might find herself praying to the statue of the virgin mary next to the gelateria 's door for a little outside help .
" a family with little kids will buy a cone for them , at least i hope , " she said .
" they wo n't buy souvenir tee-shirts but a gelato , a pizza , one has to eat .
i 'm crossing my fingers ! "
two japanese tourists come into her shop and she takes their order - only one cone for the two of them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ice cream sellers hope that no matter what the situation , people will still want gelato " of course , before , they 'd have bought two cones , " she said .
" now they 're careful about what they spend their money on and how much they spend . " american numbers down tourists who come to the region still spend their time hiking the cliffside paths linking the five villages and they often rent apartments by the week .
but apartment owners say visitors are shortening their stays .
most now hail from europe whereas americans used to be the majority . americans are especially feeling the pinch of the financial crisis and a weak dollar .
even though , those who are traveling , like vicory and doug barton from seattle , washington , are getting a little more bang for their buck over last year .
hotel prices have fallen by as much as a third .
" it seemed like such a bargain , " said vicory .
" airfare-wise , it was less than half . "
but , she added , people back home are thinking hard about finances and to many , european vacations seem like a luxury they ca n't afford .
in fact , people are putting off buying a lot of things , like new cars , flat-screen televisions or new furniture .
" your furniture can last a while longer but maybe our legs wo n't , so we better go hike this year , " she said .
survival strategy to offset the drop-off in numbers , merchants are keeping their prices competitive and for many , they hope the bargains attract more people like the bartons .
andrea leonardino of the baia saracena pizza parlor has cut his prices and is keeping his head up , trying not to succumb to fear as the news of economic gloom continues its steady beat .
" i am not so afraid , we have to wait , " he said , slicing into a cheese pizza the size of a manhole cover .
" if people talk all the time about the crisis , crisis , crisis .
i think the crisis is big but it 's bigger in our minds . " he and others say they are following a simple strategy : smile – and make everyone feel it was worthwhile to leave home for the cinque terre , even during a financial crisis . " they like to hear , ' oh ciao , ciao bella ! " ' he said .
" it 's like a joke but it 's true . " author : nancy greenleese -lrb- jam -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.07.2009 german pirates plot course for general elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the pirate party politely hopes to burn the opposition 's ships " while germany 's larger parties are stepping up their campaigns , there is a host of less established parties joining the race .
the pirate party is one of them . fabio reinhardt , 28 , has just graduated from braunschweig in history and political science .
as the pirate party 's new media liaison officer , he has decided to devote the next two months to getting the pirates into parliament .
" for me it started two years ago when i was looking for ways to bring civil rights more into german politics , " he said .
the pirate party was founded in 2006 by 50 technically savvy 20-somethings who champion the internet as a foundation of freedom of expression and democracy .
perceived as something of a single-issue party fighting for freedom from lobbyists , the right to legally download music for free and total freedom from government web censorship , it is the german government 's recently enacted legislation against online child pornography that has truly put the wind into the party 's sails .
' censursula ' the new law , drafted by the federal ministry of family affairs was officially legislated to contain child pornography on the internet .
disparaged by experts as being almost totally ineffective , the law – which gives the federal criminal police office the right to block certain websites - generated a storm on the internet with over 150,000 people signing an internet petition against family minister ursula von der leyen 's censorship legislation .
" it is a hoax ; it does n't deal with the problem of child porn being distributed .
it makes it possible for the german police force to ban internet sites .
and this is the beginning of censorship .
it is a problem with the balance of power in germany and this is a very severe problem , " reinhardt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tauss denies child pornography accusations child pornography has become something of a party issue after former social democrat joerg tauss , the pirates ' only member with mainstream political experience , was accused of downloading child pornography .
tauss has denied the accusations and so far the pirate party is standing behind him .
reinhardt says tauss was in fact researching how child pornography is distributed , claiming that as most trade happens by telephone or by mail , an internet censorship law is irrelevant .
while reinhardt agrees that tauss may have overstepped his authority , he is clear that no one in the party believes he was a user of child pornography .
reinhardt says child pornography is one of the points that forces a necessary discussion on the remit of the state in protecting its citizens .
" on the one side you have to have a state that is limiting the rights of its citizens for their own good .
but we think that the state right now is crossing the line and is breaching civil rights in a very harmful way .
so right now we are trying to restore the balance because we think that we have lost this balance in europe , " he said .
claims pertaining to an attempt to readjust the balance in power in europe would , not so long ago , have sounded absurd .
but since the party 's largest convention in hamburg two weeks ago business is booming .
membership has shot up from 750 to 4,000 in under a month and reinhardt claims as many as 100 new members are joining every day .
in june , the pirate party 's swedish counterparts took an astonishing seven percent of the national vote in the european parliamentary elections .
and with a surge in media interest and a general political malaise among 20- to 30-somethings , the german party , under the chairmanship of jens seipenbusch , is now a presence on the scene .
another small glitch for the pirates comes in the form of party member bodo thiesen , who allegedly made comments denying the holocaust and other dubious right-wing extremist comments .
" nobody in our party believes that he is actually denying the holocaust , " reinhardt said .
" but thiesen is a very strong proponent of freedom of opinion in every sense .
we are struggling with how to deal with thiesen 's opinions .
we as a very young party have still to find a way to deal with this , " reinhardt said .
thiesen has since apologized for generating trouble for the party and explicitly denied any comments about holocaust denial .
a further critique , and one that is some ways tied in with media stereotyping of the party , is the lack of female members .
a party of young male computer nerds – that is the perception .
at a recruitment night in berlin , of the 50 participants there were , at least , seven women .
twenty-four year-old lena simon feels comfortable as one of the few women in the party but does want the topic raised .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg greeted the largest number of pirates yet at the annual party convention " i think a lot of the men here would like to see more women in the party .
we need more women .
computers are becoming more important every day and women should not stay in the background .
women should take part in this , " she said .
pirates are more than just a single-issue party with the media content to put some emphasis onto the party 's inexperience and the pale , slightly spotty , young man emerging from behind his mac to take on the world , the party ' cadres ' say they do n't really care as long as their message gets across .
martin hecker is on the berlin pirates committee .
" this is really about the rights of people in the internet age .
and there are people who get it and people who do n't .
i think , go for it and see what happens .
europe is very intransparent and so laws are passed and we need to act on that .
the best that could happen is that we get a lot of media interest and that people start to see what we are doing and that there is a lot of interest and people start to copy what we are doing .
because we are about copying the good stuff i just want this stupid legislation not to pass , " he said .
the idea of copying , or ' piracy ' is a strong theme of the party 's ideology .
reinhardt vehemently denies that they are a single-issue party .
education is a big theme as well as how to use the net to further co-operative democracy .
the party has no central planning committee , rather they gather ideas – sent in online by members – which are then distributed and put into policy suggestions .
as with the concept of ' piracy ' reinhardt and hecker are clear that they have no problem with other parties taking their ideas .
it is not about power , or personally sitting in parliament they say .
it is about getting policies through – and if that means the greens adopting a pirate idea , then why not .
despite some good humored language and piracy tomfoolery – reinhardt even manages a straight face as he says the pirates are ready to board the opposition 's ships and sail into the open sea of politics – the party does not want to be seen as a joke .
aron koenig , at 45 , the biblical father of the group and committee representative says the party is not a one-hit wonder .
" the name ' pirate party ' is unconventional and it might make people think that we are a joke but we are definitely not .
we have a funny name but we are serious .
civil rights and freedom are not a joke issue .
we are the fastest growing party in german democracy and i think we can do a lot with that vote .
we will stay .
it is not a one hit wonder , we are here to stay , " says koenig .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de travel -pipe- 18.07.2009 financial crisis has italy 's tourist regions getting nervous großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crowds are a bit thinner this year as more people decide to forgo vacations abroad due to the state of the global economy , regions dependent on tourism are worried , especially during the critical summer season .
italy , for one , is shaking in its boot . the sight of water swishing around craggy rocks and wooden fishing boats in vernazza 's tiny harbor is postcard perfect .
the village is just one of several in italy 's cinque terre region that are strung along the coastline like gems on a necklace . in vernazza , vineyards perch on the cliffs above and the harbor is rimmed with pastel-colored homes and restaurants - a perfect setting for a romantic getaway . the problem is , fewer are deciding to get away to this picturesque region as the world stumbles through the global economic crisis .
" vernazza and tourism are like husband and wife , " said edoardo basso , restaurateur at the taverna del capitano .
" and if the wife leaves ?
now is a problem in the house , there 's a crisis . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the crisis , some tourists are still making it to cinque terre for views such as this , of vernazza basso estimates that his restaurant 's business is down 25 percent .
those who do come to gobble up local delicacies , like twisted pasta with basil , are skipping that second course and after-dinner drink . fewer euros as the financial downturn continues to drag on the global economy and people 's pocketbooks , more europeans and others are choosing their backyard hammock or the local beach as holiday destinations .
those decisions are exacerbating an already worrisome situation for italy , where tourism is the number-one industry .
spending in early 2009 has declined nearly nine percent from the previous year . the fall-off has been even worse for sonia d 'ambra , owner of a gelateria , or ice-cream shop .
she watched business in march plummet by 50 percent over the previous year , although she thinks the weather and a late easter holiday contributed to the decline .
she is trying to remain optimistic about the rest of the summer season , although she might find herself praying to the statue of the virgin mary next to the gelateria 's door for a little outside help .
" a family with little kids will buy a cone for them , at least i hope , " she said .
" they wo n't buy souvenir tee-shirts but a gelato , a pizza , one has to eat .
i 'm crossing my fingers ! "
two japanese tourists come into her shop and she takes their order - only one cone for the two of them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ice cream sellers hope that no matter what the situation , people will still want gelato " of course , before , they 'd have bought two cones , " she said .
" now they 're careful about what they spend their money on and how much they spend . " american numbers down tourists who come to the region still spend their time hiking the cliffside paths linking the five villages and they often rent apartments by the week .
but apartment owners say visitors are shortening their stays .
most now hail from europe whereas americans used to be the majority . americans are especially feeling the pinch of the financial crisis and a weak dollar .
even though , those who are traveling , like vicory and doug barton from seattle , washington , are getting a little more bang for their buck over last year .
hotel prices have fallen by as much as a third .
" it seemed like such a bargain , " said vicory .
" airfare-wise , it was less than half . "
but , she added , people back home are thinking hard about finances and to many , european vacations seem like a luxury they ca n't afford .
in fact , people are putting off buying a lot of things , like new cars , flat-screen televisions or new furniture .
" your furniture can last a while longer but maybe our legs wo n't , so we better go hike this year , " she said .
survival strategy to offset the drop-off in numbers , merchants are keeping their prices competitive and for many , they hope the bargains attract more people like the bartons .
andrea leonardino of the baia saracena pizza parlor has cut his prices and is keeping his head up , trying not to succumb to fear as the news of economic gloom continues its steady beat .
" i am not so afraid , we have to wait , " he said , slicing into a cheese pizza the size of a manhole cover .
" if people talk all the time about the crisis , crisis , crisis .
i think the crisis is big but it 's bigger in our minds . " he and others say they are following a simple strategy : smile – and make everyone feel it was worthwhile to leave home for the cinque terre , even during a financial crisis . " they like to hear , ' oh ciao , ciao bella ! " ' he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.07.2009 german pirates plot course for general elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the pirate party politely hopes to burn the opposition 's ships " while germany 's larger parties are stepping up their campaigns , there is a host of less established parties joining the race .
the pirate party is one of them . fabio reinhardt , 28 , has just graduated from braunschweig in history and political science .
as the pirate party 's new media liaison officer , he has decided to devote the next two months to getting the pirates into parliament .
" for me it started two years ago when i was looking for ways to bring civil rights more into german politics , " he said .
the pirate party was founded in 2006 by 50 technically savvy 20-somethings who champion the internet as a foundation of freedom of expression and democracy .
perceived as something of a single-issue party fighting for freedom from lobbyists , the right to legally download music for free and total freedom from government web censorship , it is the german government 's recently enacted legislation against online child pornography that has truly put the wind into the party 's sails .
' censursula ' the new law , drafted by the federal ministry of family affairs was officially legislated to contain child pornography on the internet .
disparaged by experts as being almost totally ineffective , the law – which gives the federal criminal police office the right to block certain websites - generated a storm on the internet with over 150,000 people signing an internet petition against family minister ursula von der leyen 's censorship legislation .
" it is a hoax ; it does n't deal with the problem of child porn being distributed .
it makes it possible for the german police force to ban internet sites .
and this is the beginning of censorship .
it is a problem with the balance of power in germany and this is a very severe problem , " reinhardt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tauss denies child pornography accusations child pornography has become something of a party issue after former social democrat joerg tauss , the pirates ' only member with mainstream political experience , was accused of downloading child pornography .
tauss has denied the accusations and so far the pirate party is standing behind him .
reinhardt says tauss was in fact researching how child pornography is distributed , claiming that as most trade happens by telephone or by mail , an internet censorship law is irrelevant .
while reinhardt agrees that tauss may have overstepped his authority , he is clear that no one in the party believes he was a user of child pornography .
reinhardt says child pornography is one of the points that forces a necessary discussion on the remit of the state in protecting its citizens .
" on the one side you have to have a state that is limiting the rights of its citizens for their own good .
but we think that the state right now is crossing the line and is breaching civil rights in a very harmful way .
so right now we are trying to restore the balance because we think that we have lost this balance in europe , " he said .
claims pertaining to an attempt to readjust the balance in power in europe would , not so long ago , have sounded absurd .
but since the party 's largest convention in hamburg two weeks ago business is booming .
membership has shot up from 750 to 4,000 in under a month and reinhardt claims as many as 100 new members are joining every day .
in june , the pirate party 's swedish counterparts took an astonishing seven percent of the national vote in the european parliamentary elections .
and with a surge in media interest and a general political malaise among 20- to 30-somethings , the german party , under the chairmanship of jens seipenbusch , is now a presence on the scene .
another small glitch for the pirates comes in the form of party member bodo thiesen , who allegedly made comments denying the holocaust and other dubious right-wing extremist comments .
" nobody in our party believes that he is actually denying the holocaust , " reinhardt said .
" but thiesen is a very strong proponent of freedom of opinion in every sense .
we are struggling with how to deal with thiesen 's opinions .
we as a very young party have still to find a way to deal with this , " reinhardt said .
thiesen has since apologized for generating trouble for the party and explicitly denied any comments about holocaust denial .
a further critique , and one that is some ways tied in with media stereotyping of the party , is the lack of female members .
a party of young male computer nerds – that is the perception .
at a recruitment night in berlin , of the 50 participants there were , at least , seven women .
twenty-four year-old lena simon feels comfortable as one of the few women in the party but does want the topic raised .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg greeted the largest number of pirates yet at the annual party convention " i think a lot of the men here would like to see more women in the party .
we need more women .
computers are becoming more important every day and women should not stay in the background .
women should take part in this , " she said .
pirates are more than just a single-issue party with the media content to put some emphasis onto the party 's inexperience and the pale , slightly spotty , young man emerging from behind his mac to take on the world , the party ' cadres ' say they do n't really care as long as their message gets across .
martin hecker is on the berlin pirates committee .
" this is really about the rights of people in the internet age .
and there are people who get it and people who do n't .
i think , go for it and see what happens .
europe is very intransparent and so laws are passed and we need to act on that .
the best that could happen is that we get a lot of media interest and that people start to see what we are doing and that there is a lot of interest and people start to copy what we are doing .
because we are about copying the good stuff i just want this stupid legislation not to pass , " he said .
the idea of copying , or ' piracy ' is a strong theme of the party 's ideology .
reinhardt vehemently denies that they are a single-issue party .
education is a big theme as well as how to use the net to further co-operative democracy .
the party has no central planning committee , rather they gather ideas – sent in online by members – which are then distributed and put into policy suggestions .
as with the concept of ' piracy ' reinhardt and hecker are clear that they have no problem with other parties taking their ideas .
it is not about power , or personally sitting in parliament they say .
it is about getting policies through – and if that means the greens adopting a pirate idea , then why not .
despite some good humored language and piracy tomfoolery – reinhardt even manages a straight face as he says the pirates are ready to board the opposition 's ships and sail into the open sea of politics – the party does not want to be seen as a joke .
aron koenig , at 45 , the biblical father of the group and committee representative says the party is not a one-hit wonder .
" the name ' pirate party ' is unconventional and it might make people think that we are a joke but we are definitely not .
we have a funny name but we are serious .
civil rights and freedom are not a joke issue .
we are the fastest growing party in german democracy and i think we can do a lot with that vote .
we will stay .
it is not a one hit wonder , we are here to stay , " says koenig .

aron koenig , at 45 , the biblical father of the group and committee representative says the party is not a one-hit wonder .
" the name ' pirate party ' is unconventional and it might make people think that we are a joke but we are definitely not .
we have a funny name but we are serious .
civil rights and freedom are not a joke issue .
we are the fastest growing party in german democracy and i think we can do a lot with that vote .
we will stay .
it is not a one hit wonder , we are here to stay , " says koenig .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de travel -pipe- 18.07.2009 financial crisis has italy 's tourist regions getting nervous großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crowds are a bit thinner this year as more people decide to forgo vacations abroad due to the state of the global economy , regions dependent on tourism are worried , especially during the critical summer season .
italy , for one , is shaking in its boot . the sight of water swishing around craggy rocks and wooden fishing boats in vernazza 's tiny harbor is postcard perfect .
the village is just one of several in italy 's cinque terre region that are strung along the coastline like gems on a necklace . in vernazza , vineyards perch on the cliffs above and the harbor is rimmed with pastel-colored homes and restaurants - a perfect setting for a romantic getaway . the problem is , fewer are deciding to get away to this picturesque region as the world stumbles through the global economic crisis .
" vernazza and tourism are like husband and wife , " said edoardo basso , restaurateur at the taverna del capitano .
" and if the wife leaves ?
now is a problem in the house , there 's a crisis . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the crisis , some tourists are still making it to cinque terre for views such as this , of vernazza basso estimates that his restaurant 's business is down 25 percent .
those who do come to gobble up local delicacies , like twisted pasta with basil , are skipping that second course and after-dinner drink . fewer euros as the financial downturn continues to drag on the global economy and people 's pocketbooks , more europeans and others are choosing their backyard hammock or the local beach as holiday destinations .
those decisions are exacerbating an already worrisome situation for italy , where tourism is the number-one industry .
spending in early 2009 has declined nearly nine percent from the previous year . the fall-off has been even worse for sonia d 'ambra , owner of a gelateria , or ice-cream shop .
she watched business in march plummet by 50 percent over the previous year , although she thinks the weather and a late easter holiday contributed to the decline .
she is trying to remain optimistic about the rest of the summer season , although she might find herself praying to the statue of the virgin mary next to the gelateria 's door for a little outside help .
" a family with little kids will buy a cone for them , at least i hope , " she said .
" they wo n't buy souvenir tee-shirts but a gelato , a pizza , one has to eat .
i 'm crossing my fingers ! "
two japanese tourists come into her shop and she takes their order - only one cone for the two of them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ice cream sellers hope that no matter what the situation , people will still want gelato " of course , before , they 'd have bought two cones , " she said .
" now they 're careful about what they spend their money on and how much they spend . " american numbers down tourists who come to the region still spend their time hiking the cliffside paths linking the five villages and they often rent apartments by the week .
but apartment owners say visitors are shortening their stays .
most now hail from europe whereas americans used to be the majority . americans are especially feeling the pinch of the financial crisis and a weak dollar .
even though , those who are traveling , like vicory and doug barton from seattle , washington , are getting a little more bang for their buck over last year .
hotel prices have fallen by as much as a third .
" it seemed like such a bargain , " said vicory .
" airfare-wise , it was less than half . "
but , she added , people back home are thinking hard about finances and to many , european vacations seem like a luxury they ca n't afford .
in fact , people are putting off buying a lot of things , like new cars , flat-screen televisions or new furniture .
" your furniture can last a while longer but maybe our legs wo n't , so we better go hike this year , " she said .
survival strategy to offset the drop-off in numbers , merchants are keeping their prices competitive and for many , they hope the bargains attract more people like the bartons .
andrea leonardino of the baia saracena pizza parlor has cut his prices and is keeping his head up , trying not to succumb to fear as the news of economic gloom continues its steady beat .
" i am not so afraid , we have to wait , " he said , slicing into a cheese pizza the size of a manhole cover .
" if people talk all the time about the crisis , crisis , crisis .
i think the crisis is big but it 's bigger in our minds . " he and others say they are following a simple strategy : smile – and make everyone feel it was worthwhile to leave home for the cinque terre , even during a financial crisis . " they like to hear , ' oh ciao , ciao bella ! " ' he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : election 2009 economic , environmental issues top election agenda poll : most germans expect angela merkel will continue as chancellor steinmeier defends plan to create 4 million jobs by 2020 german conservatives gear up for fall elections politics -pipe- 18.07.2009 merkel calls for unity ahead of national elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel called on conservatives to be " friendly and amicable " german chancellor angela merkel has called for unity among squabbling conservatives in the lead-up to september 's elections .
merkel is relying on bavarian conservative horst seehofer to help put her back in office . with only a few short months to go before germany 's federal elections , chancellor angela merkel is leaving no stone unturned as she strives to get her party , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , returned to government .
this time , she wants to rule without having to form a coalition with the left-wing social democrats .
current polls suggest that she will be able to achieve that goal .
to do so , the cdu and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - the cdu 's sister party in the southern state of bavaria - would then form a coalition with the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
yet relations between the conservative cdu and csu , which form a single parliamentary bloc in berlin , have been strained of late .
the csu has challenged merkel 's position on two major issues : the european union 's lisbon treaty and taxes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer told merkel that the csu had " bite " merkel wants germany to ratify the lisbon treaty before the election on september 27 but the csu – traditionally more euro-skeptic than the cdu – wants german law to be changed first , which would likely delay ratification of the treaty until after the election .
the csu is also demanding a timetable for tax cuts .
but at the csu 's party convention in nuremberg on friday , chancellor merkel and csu leader horst seehofer were all smiles – although it may have just had something to do with the fact that friday was also merkel 's 55th birthday .
seehofer presented merkel with a dictionary that translates bavarian dialect into standard german .
" i can imagine that you sometimes have difficulty understanding us , " he said – and seehofer was surely not just referring to language differences .
on saturday , seehofer was re-elected to head the csu with 88 percent of votes from party members .
merkel called on the two parties to work together .
" dear horst seehofer , we will march in one direction , arm in arm , " she said .
iran called on to allow demonstrations while in nuremberg , merkel also addressed several global issues , including the recent unrest in iran and the economic crisis .
she called on authorities in iran to allow citizens there to express their opinions freely , and to be able to demonstrate .
merkel also criticized the financial industries in new york and london , and said she would push for tougher financial market regulation at the g20 forum .
" we are not going to allow wall street and the city of london dictate to us again about how to earn money , only to leave others to foot the bill , " she said. ca / dpa / afp / reuters editor : trinity hartmann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have taken a $ 1.8 million ransom and released the german ship , " a pirate named ahmed told reuters from his hideout in the town of eyl on the somali coast .
the 146-meter ship , which belongs to a german shipping firm , was initially seized 75 kilometers -lrb- 45 miles -rrb- south of the yemeni port of al -mukalla while on its way to the red sea port of jeddah .
the german foreign ministry in berlin confirmed the release of the ship which is being operated with a romanian crew and flying the antigua and barbuda flag .
pirates are still holding hostage one other german ship , the hansa stavanger , which was seized on april 4 in the indian ocean .
ship hijackings are at an all time high , with nearly 130 merchant ships being attacked last year according to the international maritime bureau 's piracy reporting center in kuala lumpur .
that is an increase of more than 200 percent over 2007 .
jung unwilling to place soldiers aboard ships the rise in hijackings have brought calls from german shipowners for more security and even the stationing of german troops on board vessels , a notion that was rejected by the german government .
" this is not a sensible proposal , " said german defense minister franz josef jung .
" the bundeswehr is already involved in the european anti-piracy mission known as ' atalanta ' which is directed at the somali pirates . "
there are currently dozens of warships deployed in the area by the world 's naval powers to thwart somali pirates , but they have a very large area to cover and not enough resources to do so. av / reuters / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.07.2009 german pirates plot course for general elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the pirate party politely hopes to burn the opposition 's ships " while germany 's larger parties are stepping up their campaigns , there is a host of less established parties joining the race .
the pirate party is one of them . fabio reinhardt , 28 , has just graduated from braunschweig in history and political science .
as the pirate party 's new media liaison officer , he has decided to devote the next two months to getting the pirates into parliament .
" for me it started two years ago when i was looking for ways to bring civil rights more into german politics , " he said .
the pirate party was founded in 2006 by 50 technically savvy 20-somethings who champion the internet as a foundation of freedom of expression and democracy .
perceived as something of a single-issue party fighting for freedom from lobbyists , the right to legally download music for free and total freedom from government web censorship , it is the german government 's recently enacted legislation against online child pornography that has truly put the wind into the party 's sails .
' censursula ' the new law , drafted by the federal ministry of family affairs was officially legislated to contain child pornography on the internet .
disparaged by experts as being almost totally ineffective , the law – which gives the federal criminal police office the right to block certain websites - generated a storm on the internet with over 150,000 people signing an internet petition against family minister ursula von der leyen 's censorship legislation .
" it is a hoax ; it does n't deal with the problem of child porn being distributed .
it makes it possible for the german police force to ban internet sites .
and this is the beginning of censorship .
it is a problem with the balance of power in germany and this is a very severe problem , " reinhardt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tauss denies child pornography accusations child pornography has become something of a party issue after former social democrat joerg tauss , the pirates ' only member with mainstream political experience , was accused of downloading child pornography .
tauss has denied the accusations and so far the pirate party is standing behind him .
reinhardt says tauss was in fact researching how child pornography is distributed , claiming that as most trade happens by telephone or by mail , an internet censorship law is irrelevant .
while reinhardt agrees that tauss may have overstepped his authority , he is clear that no one in the party believes he was a user of child pornography .
reinhardt says child pornography is one of the points that forces a necessary discussion on the remit of the state in protecting its citizens .
" on the one side you have to have a state that is limiting the rights of its citizens for their own good .
but we think that the state right now is crossing the line and is breaching civil rights in a very harmful way .
so right now we are trying to restore the balance because we think that we have lost this balance in europe , " he said .
claims pertaining to an attempt to readjust the balance in power in europe would , not so long ago , have sounded absurd .
but since the party 's largest convention in hamburg two weeks ago business is booming .
membership has shot up from 750 to 4,000 in under a month and reinhardt claims as many as 100 new members are joining every day .
in june , the pirate party 's swedish counterparts took an astonishing seven percent of the national vote in the european parliamentary elections .
and with a surge in media interest and a general political malaise among 20- to 30-somethings , the german party , under the chairmanship of jens seipenbusch , is now a presence on the scene .
another small glitch for the pirates comes in the form of party member bodo thiesen , who allegedly made comments denying the holocaust and other dubious right-wing extremist comments .
" nobody in our party believes that he is actually denying the holocaust , " reinhardt said .
" but thiesen is a very strong proponent of freedom of opinion in every sense .
we are struggling with how to deal with thiesen 's opinions .
we as a very young party have still to find a way to deal with this , " reinhardt said .
thiesen has since apologized for generating trouble for the party and explicitly denied any comments about holocaust denial .
a further critique , and one that is some ways tied in with media stereotyping of the party , is the lack of female members .

the pirate party is one of them . fabio reinhardt , 28 , has just graduated from braunschweig in history and political science .
as the pirate party 's new media liaison officer , he has decided to devote the next two months to getting the pirates into parliament .
" for me it started two years ago when i was looking for ways to bring civil rights more into german politics , " he said .
the pirate party was founded in 2006 by 50 technically savvy 20-somethings who champion the internet as a foundation of freedom of expression and democracy .
perceived as something of a single-issue party fighting for freedom from lobbyists , the right to legally download music for free and total freedom from government web censorship , it is the german government 's recently enacted legislation against online child pornography that has truly put the wind into the party 's sails .
' censursula ' the new law , drafted by the federal ministry of family affairs was officially legislated to contain child pornography on the internet .
disparaged by experts as being almost totally ineffective , the law – which gives the federal criminal police office the right to block certain websites - generated a storm on the internet with over 150,000 people signing an internet petition against family minister ursula von der leyen 's censorship legislation .
" it is a hoax ; it does n't deal with the problem of child porn being distributed .
it makes it possible for the german police force to ban internet sites .
and this is the beginning of censorship .
it is a problem with the balance of power in germany and this is a very severe problem , " reinhardt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tauss denies child pornography accusations child pornography has become something of a party issue after former social democrat joerg tauss , the pirates ' only member with mainstream political experience , was accused of downloading child pornography .
tauss has denied the accusations and so far the pirate party is standing behind him .
reinhardt says tauss was in fact researching how child pornography is distributed , claiming that as most trade happens by telephone or by mail , an internet censorship law is irrelevant .
while reinhardt agrees that tauss may have overstepped his authority , he is clear that no one in the party believes he was a user of child pornography .
reinhardt says child pornography is one of the points that forces a necessary discussion on the remit of the state in protecting its citizens .
" on the one side you have to have a state that is limiting the rights of its citizens for their own good .
but we think that the state right now is crossing the line and is breaching civil rights in a very harmful way .
so right now we are trying to restore the balance because we think that we have lost this balance in europe , " he said .
claims pertaining to an attempt to readjust the balance in power in europe would , not so long ago , have sounded absurd .
but since the party 's largest convention in hamburg two weeks ago business is booming .
membership has shot up from 750 to 4,000 in under a month and reinhardt claims as many as 100 new members are joining every day .
in june , the pirate party 's swedish counterparts took an astonishing seven percent of the national vote in the european parliamentary elections .
and with a surge in media interest and a general political malaise among 20- to 30-somethings , the german party , under the chairmanship of jens seipenbusch , is now a presence on the scene .
another small glitch for the pirates comes in the form of party member bodo thiesen , who allegedly made comments denying the holocaust and other dubious right-wing extremist comments .
" nobody in our party believes that he is actually denying the holocaust , " reinhardt said .
" but thiesen is a very strong proponent of freedom of opinion in every sense .
we are struggling with how to deal with thiesen 's opinions .
we as a very young party have still to find a way to deal with this , " reinhardt said .
thiesen has since apologized for generating trouble for the party and explicitly denied any comments about holocaust denial .
a further critique , and one that is some ways tied in with media stereotyping of the party , is the lack of female members .

at a recruitment night in berlin , of the 50 participants there were , at least , seven women .

sarkozy is in new york to attend a concert honoring nelson mandela . french president nicolas sarkozy made the call for a global environmental organization after a working lunch at the french consulate in new york city with united nations secretary general ban ki-moon , where the two took part in wide-ranging discussions on global issues , with climate change topping the agenda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy did n't explain the specifics of his idea during talks with ban speaking on french television after the meeting , sarkozy called for new action on environmental issues , which were a major part of discussions at this month 's g8 summit in italy .
sarkozy did n't give any indication of how he thought this new global organization should be laid out .
" we will fight , hand in hand , a battle against the consequences of climate change .
we must create a global organization on the environment , " he added .
the key decision of the g8 summit was an agreement that world efforts should be directed towards limiting global warming to 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- above eighteenth-century levels , to prevent catastrophic climate and weather changes around the world .
ban said he was grateful for sarkozy 's " full commitment to work together to seal the deal in copenhagen on a globally acceptable " climate change agreement .
unep left out ?
the world already has a global environmental organization .
it 's called the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- , established in june1972 as a result of the un conference on the human environment .
part of the mandate of the unep is " to promote international co-operation in the field of the environment and to recommend , as appropriate , policies to this end . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruni-sarkozy said she would n't take the stage again after becoming first lady of france almost every international agreement on the environment has come under the auspices of the unep , including the kyoto protocol . it is unclear how a new global environmental organization would really be different .
at an international conference on climate change in copenhagen in december , governments are to agree on goals to fight climate change under a new kyoto protocol .
the current protocol will expire in 2012 .

" the christian social union can once again be confident , " seehofer told some 1000 party delegates at their annual rally in the southern german city of nuremberg .
in his speech , seehofer pledged his support to merkel 's cdu , but , at the same time , stressed the independence of his party . on saturday , it was announced that seehofer won re-election as csu party chief with an almost 90 percent majority . coalition plans seehofer reiterated the conservatives ' desire to build a federal coalition with the liberal free democrats .
at federal elections on the 27th of september , seehofer and merkel are keen on a " black-yellow " coaltion , which represents a union of the conservatives and the liberals . bildunterschrift : seehofer and merkel are looking to the liberals to form a coalition seehofer warned the head of the free democrats , guido westerwelle , against not joining the conservatives on the " black-yellow " ticket ahead of the elections , saying it would n't be wise to pursue another alliance . election campaign the csu is pursuing an election campaign that diverges in key issues from that of merkel 's cdu .
the central element of the csu campaign is the lowering of income tax , which it has said it wo n't back down on . despite the ongoing crisis and the flurry of negative economic prognoses , the csu believes significant tax cuts are necessary and feasible .
the tax cuts , said seehofer , would take effect by 2011 . merkel 's cdu , meanwhile , has rejected such ambitious plans . another controversial issue seehofer addressed on saturday was the csu stance on the ratification of the european union 's lisbon treaty . the csu has called for the german parliament , the bundestag , to have more of a say in european affairs .
seehofer says the csu is not against ratifying the treaty , but rather for strengthening the national parliament on the european level . " we 're not about destruction ; we do n't want to blockade the treaty .
we want to give germany 's houses of parliament a stronger presence .
we want europe to recognize what it is made of - and we want that our national parliament to have responsibility and be taken seriously .

so whose fault is it ? after protracted negotiations and with the situation in the darfur region of sudan deteriorating , the international community finally agreed to set up a joint peace operation .
a year and half ago , the united nations and the african union deployed troops to darfur as part of the unamid mission to establish peace and protect the people in the troubled province in western sudan .
according to un estimates , the conflict there has claimed more than 300,000 lives since 2003 .
to carry out its operation , unamid requested 24 helicopters to support its 17,000 troops .
but a year and a half after the launch of the mission , unamid is still without choppers .
since unamid itself does n't possess airlift capabilities , it is dependent on contributions from individual countries .
so far , no country has provided any helicopters to the darfur mission .
susana malcorra , the head of the department of field support at the un in new york , thinks the reason why darfur has n't received any choppers is because they have been deployed to other international hotspots .
" it seems like the need of helicopters has become a big ticket item in afghanistan and iraq " , she says and adds that other un missions in africa are also lacking airlift capabilities .
" it 's not only unamid that is short of helicopters .
we are also behind in chad and now we have a question for additional helicopters in the democratic republic of congo . "
other priorities lauren gelfand , africa editor with jane 's defence weekly in london , argues that there actually are plenty of choppers available around the world , but africa is simply not a high priority for the un member states that own them . " i think that there is a misconception about helicopters " , gelfand says .
" they are assets of the individual countries .
there is not a big pool of helicopters , like a lending library , where you can just get and keep them then for a couple of months for your operation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : choppers could benefit unamid soldiers greatly malcorra and gelfand both do agree that choppers would make an important contribution , especially in a vast area like darfur .
" the helicopters , " says malcorra , " give us the possibility to move our forces at a speed that otherwise is not possible .
this is critical for the mandate unamid has . "
what 's more , says gelfand : " a helicopter flies low enough that you can have a look outside the window and see what 's really going on .
in an area as remote , as large and as difficult as darfur , that 's very useful . " help from ethiopia while it is clear that helicopters would greatly enhance the mission in darfur , it 's uncertain whether countries will finally come forward and supply them to unamid .
just how cumbersome it is to get choppers to darfur is highlighted by the fact that then us-senator joe biden introduced a resolution to the us senate urging the international community to dispatch helicopters to darfur .
biden 's bill had 33 co-sponsors and was passed unanimously .
that was back in february of 2008 .
since then joe biden has become us vice president , but neither the united states nor any other country have sent helicopters to darfur . ethiopia so far is the only country that has vowed to provide helicopters .
it pledged to sent five choppers to darfur in october . " it will make a difference , " says susana malcorra .
" but we need more . "

so whose fault is it ? after protracted negotiations and with the situation in the darfur region of sudan deteriorating , the international community finally agreed to set up a joint peace operation .
a year and half ago , the united nations and the african union deployed troops to darfur as part of the unamid mission to establish peace and protect the people in the troubled province in western sudan .
according to un estimates , the conflict there has claimed more than 300,000 lives since 2003 .
to carry out its operation , unamid requested 24 helicopters to support its 17,000 troops .
but a year and a half after the launch of the mission , unamid is still without choppers .
since unamid itself does n't possess airlift capabilities , it is dependent on contributions from individual countries .
so far , no country has provided any helicopters to the darfur mission .
susana malcorra , the head of the department of field support at the un in new york , thinks the reason why darfur has n't received any choppers is because they have been deployed to other international hotspots .
" it seems like the need of helicopters has become a big ticket item in afghanistan and iraq " , she says and adds that other un missions in africa are also lacking airlift capabilities .
" it 's not only unamid that is short of helicopters .
we are also behind in chad and now we have a question for additional helicopters in the democratic republic of congo . "
other priorities lauren gelfand , africa editor with jane 's defence weekly in london , argues that there actually are plenty of choppers available around the world , but africa is simply not a high priority for the un member states that own them . " i think that there is a misconception about helicopters " , gelfand says .
" they are assets of the individual countries .
there is not a big pool of helicopters , like a lending library , where you can just get and keep them then for a couple of months for your operation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : choppers could benefit unamid soldiers greatly malcorra and gelfand both do agree that choppers would make an important contribution , especially in a vast area like darfur .
" the helicopters , " says malcorra , " give us the possibility to move our forces at a speed that otherwise is not possible .
this is critical for the mandate unamid has . "
what 's more , says gelfand : " a helicopter flies low enough that you can have a look outside the window and see what 's really going on .
in an area as remote , as large and as difficult as darfur , that 's very useful . " help from ethiopia while it is clear that helicopters would greatly enhance the mission in darfur , it 's uncertain whether countries will finally come forward and supply them to unamid .
just how cumbersome it is to get choppers to darfur is highlighted by the fact that then us-senator joe biden introduced a resolution to the us senate urging the international community to dispatch helicopters to darfur .
biden 's bill had 33 co-sponsors and was passed unanimously .
that was back in february of 2008 .
since then joe biden has become us vice president , but neither the united states nor any other country have sent helicopters to darfur . ethiopia so far is the only country that has vowed to provide helicopters .
it pledged to sent five choppers to darfur in october . " it will make a difference , " says susana malcorra .
" but we need more . "

the call , made public in berlin , also has the support of nobel peace prize winner and iranian shirin ebadi .
the organizations are demanding , among other things , that iran respect human rights , a un investigation into the more serious and systematic human rights violations , the release of all non-violent political prisoners and an end to state-supported violence .
opposition answers back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafsanjani is considered the main rival of president ahmadinejad following friday prayers given by influential cleric and government critic akbar hashemi rafsanjani , up to one hundred thousand people took to the streets in iran in the first mass demonstration against the government in weeks , clashing with police .
eyewitnesses reported countless arrests and instances where police used tear gas .
rafsanjani , a former president of iran , has often criticized the government and has warned the current situation could turn into a real crisis .
" our main task is to regain the trust of the people , " said rafsanjani , who is often considered the main rival of president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
that would only happen if the government released those taken into custody while protesting the presidential election on june 12 .
" we have to learn to tolerate each other , " added the 75 year old cleric , who is a supporter of the opposition leader mir-hossein mussavi .
rafsanjani is the head of two of the most powerful bodies in the islamic republic .
he is the chairman of both the assembly of experts , which elects and removes the supreme leader of iran , and the expediency discernment council of iran , an unelected administrative assembly that resolves legislative conflicts between the majlis and the council of guardians .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.07.2009 german pirates plot course for general elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the pirate party politely hopes to burn the opposition 's ships " while germany 's larger parties are stepping up their campaigns , there is a host of less established parties joining the race .
the pirate party is one of them . fabio reinhardt , 28 , has just graduated from braunschweig in history and political science .
as the pirate party 's new media liaison officer , he has decided to devote the next two months to getting the pirates into parliament .
" for me it started two years ago when i was looking for ways to bring civil rights more into german politics , " he said .
the pirate party was founded in 2006 by 50 technically savvy 20-somethings who champion the internet as a foundation of freedom of expression and democracy .
perceived as something of a single-issue party fighting for freedom from lobbyists , the right to legally download music for free and total freedom from government web censorship , it is the german government 's recently enacted legislation against online child pornography that has truly put the wind into the party 's sails .
' censursula ' the new law , drafted by the federal ministry of family affairs was officially legislated to contain child pornography on the internet .
disparaged by experts as being almost totally ineffective , the law – which gives the federal criminal police office the right to block certain websites - generated a storm on the internet with over 150,000 people signing an internet petition against family minister ursula von der leyen 's censorship legislation .
" it is a hoax ; it does n't deal with the problem of child porn being distributed .
it makes it possible for the german police force to ban internet sites .
and this is the beginning of censorship .
it is a problem with the balance of power in germany and this is a very severe problem , " reinhardt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tauss denies child pornography accusations child pornography has become something of a party issue after former social democrat joerg tauss , the pirates ' only member with mainstream political experience , was accused of downloading child pornography .
tauss has denied the accusations and so far the pirate party is standing behind him .
reinhardt says tauss was in fact researching how child pornography is distributed , claiming that as most trade happens by telephone or by mail , an internet censorship law is irrelevant .
while reinhardt agrees that tauss may have overstepped his authority , he is clear that no one in the party believes he was a user of child pornography .
reinhardt says child pornography is one of the points that forces a necessary discussion on the remit of the state in protecting its citizens .
" on the one side you have to have a state that is limiting the rights of its citizens for their own good .
but we think that the state right now is crossing the line and is breaching civil rights in a very harmful way .
so right now we are trying to restore the balance because we think that we have lost this balance in europe , " he said .
claims pertaining to an attempt to readjust the balance in power in europe would , not so long ago , have sounded absurd .
but since the party 's largest convention in hamburg two weeks ago business is booming .
membership has shot up from 750 to 4,000 in under a month and reinhardt claims as many as 100 new members are joining every day .
in june , the pirate party 's swedish counterparts took an astonishing seven percent of the national vote in the european parliamentary elections .
and with a surge in media interest and a general political malaise among 20- to 30-somethings , the german party , under the chairmanship of jens seipenbusch , is now a presence on the scene .
another small glitch for the pirates comes in the form of party member bodo thiesen , who allegedly made comments denying the holocaust and other dubious right-wing extremist comments .
" nobody in our party believes that he is actually denying the holocaust , " reinhardt said .
" but thiesen is a very strong proponent of freedom of opinion in every sense .
we are struggling with how to deal with thiesen 's opinions .
we as a very young party have still to find a way to deal with this , " reinhardt said .
thiesen has since apologized for generating trouble for the party and explicitly denied any comments about holocaust denial .
a further critique , and one that is some ways tied in with media stereotyping of the party , is the lack of female members .
a party of young male computer nerds – that is the perception .
at a recruitment night in berlin , of the 50 participants there were , at least , seven women .
twenty-four year-old lena simon feels comfortable as one of the few women in the party but does want the topic raised .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg greeted the largest number of pirates yet at the annual party convention " i think a lot of the men here would like to see more women in the party .
we need more women .
computers are becoming more important every day and women should not stay in the background .
women should take part in this , " she said .
pirates are more than just a single-issue party with the media content to put some emphasis onto the party 's inexperience and the pale , slightly spotty , young man emerging from behind his mac to take on the world , the party ' cadres ' say they do n't really care as long as their message gets across .
martin hecker is on the berlin pirates committee .
" this is really about the rights of people in the internet age .
and there are people who get it and people who do n't .
i think , go for it and see what happens .
europe is very intransparent and so laws are passed and we need to act on that .
the best that could happen is that we get a lot of media interest and that people start to see what we are doing and that there is a lot of interest and people start to copy what we are doing .
because we are about copying the good stuff i just want this stupid legislation not to pass , " he said .
the idea of copying , or ' piracy ' is a strong theme of the party 's ideology .
reinhardt vehemently denies that they are a single-issue party .
education is a big theme as well as how to use the net to further co-operative democracy .
the party has no central planning committee , rather they gather ideas – sent in online by members – which are then distributed and put into policy suggestions .
as with the concept of ' piracy ' reinhardt and hecker are clear that they have no problem with other parties taking their ideas .
it is not about power , or personally sitting in parliament they say .
it is about getting policies through – and if that means the greens adopting a pirate idea , then why not .
despite some good humored language and piracy tomfoolery – reinhardt even manages a straight face as he says the pirates are ready to board the opposition 's ships and sail into the open sea of politics – the party does not want to be seen as a joke .
aron koenig , at 45 , the biblical father of the group and committee representative says the party is not a one-hit wonder .
" the name ' pirate party ' is unconventional and it might make people think that we are a joke but we are definitely not .
we have a funny name but we are serious .
civil rights and freedom are not a joke issue .
we are the fastest growing party in german democracy and i think we can do a lot with that vote .
we will stay .
it is not a one hit wonder , we are here to stay , " says koenig .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.07.2009 german pirates plot course for general elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the pirate party politely hopes to burn the opposition 's ships " while germany 's larger parties are stepping up their campaigns , there is a host of less established parties joining the race .
the pirate party is one of them . fabio reinhardt , 28 , has just graduated from braunschweig in history and political science .
as the pirate party 's new media liaison officer , he has decided to devote the next two months to getting the pirates into parliament .
" for me it started two years ago when i was looking for ways to bring civil rights more into german politics , " he said .
the pirate party was founded in 2006 by 50 technically savvy 20-somethings who champion the internet as a foundation of freedom of expression and democracy .
perceived as something of a single-issue party fighting for freedom from lobbyists , the right to legally download music for free and total freedom from government web censorship , it is the german government 's recently enacted legislation against online child pornography that has truly put the wind into the party 's sails .
' censursula ' the new law , drafted by the federal ministry of family affairs was officially legislated to contain child pornography on the internet .
disparaged by experts as being almost totally ineffective , the law – which gives the federal criminal police office the right to block certain websites - generated a storm on the internet with over 150,000 people signing an internet petition against family minister ursula von der leyen 's censorship legislation .
" it is a hoax ; it does n't deal with the problem of child porn being distributed .
it makes it possible for the german police force to ban internet sites .
and this is the beginning of censorship .
it is a problem with the balance of power in germany and this is a very severe problem , " reinhardt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tauss denies child pornography accusations child pornography has become something of a party issue after former social democrat joerg tauss , the pirates ' only member with mainstream political experience , was accused of downloading child pornography .
tauss has denied the accusations and so far the pirate party is standing behind him .
reinhardt says tauss was in fact researching how child pornography is distributed , claiming that as most trade happens by telephone or by mail , an internet censorship law is irrelevant .
while reinhardt agrees that tauss may have overstepped his authority , he is clear that no one in the party believes he was a user of child pornography .
reinhardt says child pornography is one of the points that forces a necessary discussion on the remit of the state in protecting its citizens .
" on the one side you have to have a state that is limiting the rights of its citizens for their own good .
but we think that the state right now is crossing the line and is breaching civil rights in a very harmful way .
so right now we are trying to restore the balance because we think that we have lost this balance in europe , " he said .
claims pertaining to an attempt to readjust the balance in power in europe would , not so long ago , have sounded absurd .
but since the party 's largest convention in hamburg two weeks ago business is booming .
membership has shot up from 750 to 4,000 in under a month and reinhardt claims as many as 100 new members are joining every day .
in june , the pirate party 's swedish counterparts took an astonishing seven percent of the national vote in the european parliamentary elections .
and with a surge in media interest and a general political malaise among 20- to 30-somethings , the german party , under the chairmanship of jens seipenbusch , is now a presence on the scene .
another small glitch for the pirates comes in the form of party member bodo thiesen , who allegedly made comments denying the holocaust and other dubious right-wing extremist comments .
" nobody in our party believes that he is actually denying the holocaust , " reinhardt said .
" but thiesen is a very strong proponent of freedom of opinion in every sense .
we are struggling with how to deal with thiesen 's opinions .
we as a very young party have still to find a way to deal with this , " reinhardt said .
thiesen has since apologized for generating trouble for the party and explicitly denied any comments about holocaust denial .
a further critique , and one that is some ways tied in with media stereotyping of the party , is the lack of female members .
a party of young male computer nerds – that is the perception .
at a recruitment night in berlin , of the 50 participants there were , at least , seven women .
twenty-four year-old lena simon feels comfortable as one of the few women in the party but does want the topic raised .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg greeted the largest number of pirates yet at the annual party convention " i think a lot of the men here would like to see more women in the party .
we need more women .
computers are becoming more important every day and women should not stay in the background .
women should take part in this , " she said .
pirates are more than just a single-issue party with the media content to put some emphasis onto the party 's inexperience and the pale , slightly spotty , young man emerging from behind his mac to take on the world , the party ' cadres ' say they do n't really care as long as their message gets across .
martin hecker is on the berlin pirates committee .
" this is really about the rights of people in the internet age .
and there are people who get it and people who do n't .
i think , go for it and see what happens .
europe is very intransparent and so laws are passed and we need to act on that .
the best that could happen is that we get a lot of media interest and that people start to see what we are doing and that there is a lot of interest and people start to copy what we are doing .
because we are about copying the good stuff i just want this stupid legislation not to pass , " he said .
the idea of copying , or ' piracy ' is a strong theme of the party 's ideology .
reinhardt vehemently denies that they are a single-issue party .
education is a big theme as well as how to use the net to further co-operative democracy .
the party has no central planning committee , rather they gather ideas – sent in online by members – which are then distributed and put into policy suggestions .
as with the concept of ' piracy ' reinhardt and hecker are clear that they have no problem with other parties taking their ideas .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.07.2009 german pirates plot course for general elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the pirate party politely hopes to burn the opposition 's ships " while germany 's larger parties are stepping up their campaigns , there is a host of less established parties joining the race .
the pirate party is one of them . fabio reinhardt , 28 , has just graduated from braunschweig in history and political science .
as the pirate party 's new media liaison officer , he has decided to devote the next two months to getting the pirates into parliament .
" for me it started two years ago when i was looking for ways to bring civil rights more into german politics , " he said .
the pirate party was founded in 2006 by 50 technically savvy 20-somethings who champion the internet as a foundation of freedom of expression and democracy .
perceived as something of a single-issue party fighting for freedom from lobbyists , the right to legally download music for free and total freedom from government web censorship , it is the german government 's recently enacted legislation against online child pornography that has truly put the wind into the party 's sails .
' censursula ' the new law , drafted by the federal ministry of family affairs was officially legislated to contain child pornography on the internet .
disparaged by experts as being almost totally ineffective , the law – which gives the federal criminal police office the right to block certain websites - generated a storm on the internet with over 150,000 people signing an internet petition against family minister ursula von der leyen 's censorship legislation .
" it is a hoax ; it does n't deal with the problem of child porn being distributed .
it makes it possible for the german police force to ban internet sites .
and this is the beginning of censorship .
it is a problem with the balance of power in germany and this is a very severe problem , " reinhardt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tauss denies child pornography accusations child pornography has become something of a party issue after former social democrat joerg tauss , the pirates ' only member with mainstream political experience , was accused of downloading child pornography .
tauss has denied the accusations and so far the pirate party is standing behind him .
reinhardt says tauss was in fact researching how child pornography is distributed , claiming that as most trade happens by telephone or by mail , an internet censorship law is irrelevant .
while reinhardt agrees that tauss may have overstepped his authority , he is clear that no one in the party believes he was a user of child pornography .
reinhardt says child pornography is one of the points that forces a necessary discussion on the remit of the state in protecting its citizens .
" on the one side you have to have a state that is limiting the rights of its citizens for their own good .
but we think that the state right now is crossing the line and is breaching civil rights in a very harmful way .
so right now we are trying to restore the balance because we think that we have lost this balance in europe , " he said .
claims pertaining to an attempt to readjust the balance in power in europe would , not so long ago , have sounded absurd .
but since the party 's largest convention in hamburg two weeks ago business is booming .
membership has shot up from 750 to 4,000 in under a month and reinhardt claims as many as 100 new members are joining every day .
in june , the pirate party 's swedish counterparts took an astonishing seven percent of the national vote in the european parliamentary elections .
and with a surge in media interest and a general political malaise among 20- to 30-somethings , the german party , under the chairmanship of jens seipenbusch , is now a presence on the scene .
another small glitch for the pirates comes in the form of party member bodo thiesen , who allegedly made comments denying the holocaust and other dubious right-wing extremist comments .
" nobody in our party believes that he is actually denying the holocaust , " reinhardt said .
" but thiesen is a very strong proponent of freedom of opinion in every sense .
we are struggling with how to deal with thiesen 's opinions .
we as a very young party have still to find a way to deal with this , " reinhardt said .
thiesen has since apologized for generating trouble for the party and explicitly denied any comments about holocaust denial .
a further critique , and one that is some ways tied in with media stereotyping of the party , is the lack of female members .
a party of young male computer nerds – that is the perception .
at a recruitment night in berlin , of the 50 participants there were , at least , seven women .
twenty-four year-old lena simon feels comfortable as one of the few women in the party but does want the topic raised .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg greeted the largest number of pirates yet at the annual party convention " i think a lot of the men here would like to see more women in the party .
we need more women .
computers are becoming more important every day and women should not stay in the background .
women should take part in this , " she said .
pirates are more than just a single-issue party with the media content to put some emphasis onto the party 's inexperience and the pale , slightly spotty , young man emerging from behind his mac to take on the world , the party ' cadres ' say they do n't really care as long as their message gets across .
martin hecker is on the berlin pirates committee .
" this is really about the rights of people in the internet age .
and there are people who get it and people who do n't .
i think , go for it and see what happens .
europe is very intransparent and so laws are passed and we need to act on that .
the best that could happen is that we get a lot of media interest and that people start to see what we are doing and that there is a lot of interest and people start to copy what we are doing .
because we are about copying the good stuff i just want this stupid legislation not to pass , " he said .
the idea of copying , or ' piracy ' is a strong theme of the party 's ideology .
reinhardt vehemently denies that they are a single-issue party .
education is a big theme as well as how to use the net to further co-operative democracy .
the party has no central planning committee , rather they gather ideas – sent in online by members – which are then distributed and put into policy suggestions .
as with the concept of ' piracy ' reinhardt and hecker are clear that they have no problem with other parties taking their ideas .
it is not about power , or personally sitting in parliament they say .
it is about getting policies through – and if that means the greens adopting a pirate idea , then why not .
despite some good humored language and piracy tomfoolery – reinhardt even manages a straight face as he says the pirates are ready to board the opposition 's ships and sail into the open sea of politics – the party does not want to be seen as a joke .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.07.2009 german pirates plot course for general elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the pirate party politely hopes to burn the opposition 's ships " while germany 's larger parties are stepping up their campaigns , there is a host of less established parties joining the race .
the pirate party is one of them . fabio reinhardt , 28 , has just graduated from braunschweig in history and political science .
as the pirate party 's new media liaison officer , he has decided to devote the next two months to getting the pirates into parliament .
" for me it started two years ago when i was looking for ways to bring civil rights more into german politics , " he said .
the pirate party was founded in 2006 by 50 technically savvy 20-somethings who champion the internet as a foundation of freedom of expression and democracy .
perceived as something of a single-issue party fighting for freedom from lobbyists , the right to legally download music for free and total freedom from government web censorship , it is the german government 's recently enacted legislation against online child pornography that has truly put the wind into the party 's sails .
' censursula ' the new law , drafted by the federal ministry of family affairs was officially legislated to contain child pornography on the internet .
disparaged by experts as being almost totally ineffective , the law – which gives the federal criminal police office the right to block certain websites - generated a storm on the internet with over 150,000 people signing an internet petition against family minister ursula von der leyen 's censorship legislation .
" it is a hoax ; it does n't deal with the problem of child porn being distributed .
it makes it possible for the german police force to ban internet sites .
and this is the beginning of censorship .
it is a problem with the balance of power in germany and this is a very severe problem , " reinhardt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tauss denies child pornography accusations child pornography has become something of a party issue after former social democrat joerg tauss , the pirates ' only member with mainstream political experience , was accused of downloading child pornography .
tauss has denied the accusations and so far the pirate party is standing behind him .
reinhardt says tauss was in fact researching how child pornography is distributed , claiming that as most trade happens by telephone or by mail , an internet censorship law is irrelevant .
while reinhardt agrees that tauss may have overstepped his authority , he is clear that no one in the party believes he was a user of child pornography .
reinhardt says child pornography is one of the points that forces a necessary discussion on the remit of the state in protecting its citizens .
" on the one side you have to have a state that is limiting the rights of its citizens for their own good .
but we think that the state right now is crossing the line and is breaching civil rights in a very harmful way .
so right now we are trying to restore the balance because we think that we have lost this balance in europe , " he said .
claims pertaining to an attempt to readjust the balance in power in europe would , not so long ago , have sounded absurd .
but since the party 's largest convention in hamburg two weeks ago business is booming .
membership has shot up from 750 to 4,000 in under a month and reinhardt claims as many as 100 new members are joining every day .
in june , the pirate party 's swedish counterparts took an astonishing seven percent of the national vote in the european parliamentary elections .
and with a surge in media interest and a general political malaise among 20- to 30-somethings , the german party , under the chairmanship of jens seipenbusch , is now a presence on the scene .
another small glitch for the pirates comes in the form of party member bodo thiesen , who allegedly made comments denying the holocaust and other dubious right-wing extremist comments .
" nobody in our party believes that he is actually denying the holocaust , " reinhardt said .
" but thiesen is a very strong proponent of freedom of opinion in every sense .
we are struggling with how to deal with thiesen 's opinions .
we as a very young party have still to find a way to deal with this , " reinhardt said .
thiesen has since apologized for generating trouble for the party and explicitly denied any comments about holocaust denial .
a further critique , and one that is some ways tied in with media stereotyping of the party , is the lack of female members .
a party of young male computer nerds – that is the perception .
at a recruitment night in berlin , of the 50 participants there were , at least , seven women .
twenty-four year-old lena simon feels comfortable as one of the few women in the party but does want the topic raised .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg greeted the largest number of pirates yet at the annual party convention " i think a lot of the men here would like to see more women in the party .
we need more women .
computers are becoming more important every day and women should not stay in the background .
women should take part in this , " she said .
pirates are more than just a single-issue party with the media content to put some emphasis onto the party 's inexperience and the pale , slightly spotty , young man emerging from behind his mac to take on the world , the party ' cadres ' say they do n't really care as long as their message gets across .
martin hecker is on the berlin pirates committee .
" this is really about the rights of people in the internet age .
and there are people who get it and people who do n't .
i think , go for it and see what happens .
europe is very intransparent and so laws are passed and we need to act on that .
the best that could happen is that we get a lot of media interest and that people start to see what we are doing and that there is a lot of interest and people start to copy what we are doing .
because we are about copying the good stuff i just want this stupid legislation not to pass , " he said .
the idea of copying , or ' piracy ' is a strong theme of the party 's ideology .
reinhardt vehemently denies that they are a single-issue party .
education is a big theme as well as how to use the net to further co-operative democracy .
the party has no central planning committee , rather they gather ideas – sent in online by members – which are then distributed and put into policy suggestions .
as with the concept of ' piracy ' reinhardt and hecker are clear that they have no problem with other parties taking their ideas .
it is not about power , or personally sitting in parliament they say .
it is about getting policies through – and if that means the greens adopting a pirate idea , then why not .
despite some good humored language and piracy tomfoolery – reinhardt even manages a straight face as he says the pirates are ready to board the opposition 's ships and sail into the open sea of politics – the party does not want to be seen as a joke .
aron koenig , at 45 , the biblical father of the group and committee representative says the party is not a one-hit wonder .
" the name ' pirate party ' is unconventional and it might make people think that we are a joke but we are definitely not .
we have a funny name but we are serious .
civil rights and freedom are not a joke issue .
we are the fastest growing party in german democracy and i think we can do a lot with that vote .
we will stay .
it is not a one hit wonder , we are here to stay , " says koenig .

so whose fault is it ? after protracted negotiations and with the situation in the darfur region of sudan deteriorating , the international community finally agreed to set up a joint peace operation .
a year and half ago , the united nations and the african union deployed troops to darfur as part of the unamid mission to establish peace and protect the people in the troubled province in western sudan .
according to un estimates , the conflict there has claimed more than 300,000 lives since 2003 .
to carry out its operation , unamid requested 24 helicopters to support its 17,000 troops .
but a year and a half after the launch of the mission , unamid is still without choppers .
since unamid itself does n't possess airlift capabilities , it is dependent on contributions from individual countries .
so far , no country has provided any helicopters to the darfur mission .
susana malcorra , the head of the department of field support at the un in new york , thinks the reason why darfur has n't received any choppers is because they have been deployed to other international hotspots .
" it seems like the need of helicopters has become a big ticket item in afghanistan and iraq " , she says and adds that other un missions in africa are also lacking airlift capabilities .
" it 's not only unamid that is short of helicopters .
we are also behind in chad and now we have a question for additional helicopters in the democratic republic of congo . "
other priorities lauren gelfand , africa editor with jane 's defence weekly in london , argues that there actually are plenty of choppers available around the world , but africa is simply not a high priority for the un member states that own them . " i think that there is a misconception about helicopters " , gelfand says .
" they are assets of the individual countries .
there is not a big pool of helicopters , like a lending library , where you can just get and keep them then for a couple of months for your operation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : choppers could benefit unamid soldiers greatly malcorra and gelfand both do agree that choppers would make an important contribution , especially in a vast area like darfur .
" the helicopters , " says malcorra , " give us the possibility to move our forces at a speed that otherwise is not possible .
this is critical for the mandate unamid has . "
what 's more , says gelfand : " a helicopter flies low enough that you can have a look outside the window and see what 's really going on .
in an area as remote , as large and as difficult as darfur , that 's very useful . " help from ethiopia while it is clear that helicopters would greatly enhance the mission in darfur , it 's uncertain whether countries will finally come forward and supply them to unamid .
just how cumbersome it is to get choppers to darfur is highlighted by the fact that then us-senator joe biden introduced a resolution to the us senate urging the international community to dispatch helicopters to darfur .
biden 's bill had 33 co-sponsors and was passed unanimously .
that was back in february of 2008 .
since then joe biden has become us vice president , but neither the united states nor any other country have sent helicopters to darfur . ethiopia so far is the only country that has vowed to provide helicopters .
it pledged to sent five choppers to darfur in october . " it will make a difference , " says susana malcorra .
" but we need more . "

" the christian social union can once again be confident , " seehofer told some 1000 party delegates at their annual rally in the southern german city of nuremberg .
in his speech , seehofer pledged his support to merkel 's cdu , but , at the same time , stressed the independence of his party . on saturday , it was announced that seehofer won re-election as csu party chief with an almost 90 percent majority . coalition plans seehofer reiterated the conservatives ' desire to build a federal coalition with the liberal free democrats .
at federal elections on the 27th of september , seehofer and merkel are keen on a " black-yellow " coaltion , which represents a union of the conservatives and the liberals . bildunterschrift : seehofer and merkel are looking to the liberals to form a coalition seehofer warned the head of the free democrats , guido westerwelle , against not joining the conservatives on the " black-yellow " ticket ahead of the elections , saying it would n't be wise to pursue another alliance . election campaign the csu is pursuing an election campaign that diverges in key issues from that of merkel 's cdu .
the central element of the csu campaign is the lowering of income tax , which it has said it wo n't back down on . despite the ongoing crisis and the flurry of negative economic prognoses , the csu believes significant tax cuts are necessary and feasible .
the tax cuts , said seehofer , would take effect by 2011 . merkel 's cdu , meanwhile , has rejected such ambitious plans . another controversial issue seehofer addressed on saturday was the csu stance on the ratification of the european union 's lisbon treaty . the csu has called for the german parliament , the bundestag , to have more of a say in european affairs .
seehofer says the csu is not against ratifying the treaty , but rather for strengthening the national parliament on the european level . " we 're not about destruction ; we do n't want to blockade the treaty .
we want to give germany 's houses of parliament a stronger presence .
we want europe to recognize what it is made of - and we want that our national parliament to have responsibility and be taken seriously .

merkel is relying on bavarian conservative horst seehofer to help put her back in office . with only a few short months to go before germany 's federal elections , chancellor angela merkel is leaving no stone unturned as she strives to get her party , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , returned to government .
this time , she wants to rule without having to form a coalition with the left-wing social democrats .
current polls suggest that she will be able to achieve that goal .
to do so , the cdu and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - the cdu 's sister party in the southern state of bavaria - would then form a coalition with the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .

the csu is also demanding a timetable for tax cuts .
but at the csu 's party convention in nuremberg on friday , chancellor merkel and csu leader horst seehofer were all smiles – although it may have just had something to do with the fact that friday was also merkel 's 55th birthday .
seehofer presented merkel with a dictionary that translates bavarian dialect into standard german .
" i can imagine that you sometimes have difficulty understanding us , " he said – and seehofer was surely not just referring to language differences .
on saturday , seehofer was re-elected to head the csu with 88 percent of votes from party members .
merkel called on the two parties to work together .

iran called on to allow demonstrations while in nuremberg , merkel also addressed several global issues , including the recent unrest in iran and the economic crisis .
she called on authorities in iran to allow citizens there to express their opinions freely , and to be able to demonstrate .
merkel also criticized the financial industries in new york and london , and said she would push for tougher financial market regulation at the g20 forum .

" we will fight , hand in hand , a battle against the consequences of climate change .
we must create a global organization on the environment , " he added .
the key decision of the g8 summit was an agreement that world efforts should be directed towards limiting global warming to 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- above eighteenth-century levels , to prevent catastrophic climate and weather changes around the world .

" we have taken a $ 1.8 million ransom and released the german ship , " a pirate named ahmed told reuters from his hideout in the town of eyl on the somali coast .
the 146-meter ship , which belongs to a german shipping firm , was initially seized 75 kilometers -lrb- 45 miles -rrb- south of the yemeni port of al -mukalla while on its way to the red sea port of jeddah .
the german foreign ministry in berlin confirmed the release of the ship which is being operated with a romanian crew and flying the antigua and barbuda flag .
pirates are still holding hostage one other german ship , the hansa stavanger , which was seized on april 4 in the indian ocean .
ship hijackings are at an all time high , with nearly 130 merchant ships being attacked last year according to the international maritime bureau 's piracy reporting center in kuala lumpur .
that is an increase of more than 200 percent over 2007 .
jung unwilling to place soldiers aboard ships the rise in hijackings have brought calls from german shipowners for more security and even the stationing of german troops on board vessels , a notion that was rejected by the german government .

" the christian social union can once again be confident , " seehofer told some 1000 party delegates at their annual rally in the southern german city of nuremberg .
in his speech , seehofer pledged his support to merkel 's cdu , but , at the same time , stressed the independence of his party . on saturday , it was announced that seehofer won re-election as csu party chief with an almost 90 percent majority . coalition plans seehofer reiterated the conservatives ' desire to build a federal coalition with the liberal free democrats .
at federal elections on the 27th of september , seehofer and merkel are keen on a " black-yellow " coaltion , which represents a union of the conservatives and the liberals . bildunterschrift : seehofer and merkel are looking to the liberals to form a coalition seehofer warned the head of the free democrats , guido westerwelle , against not joining the conservatives on the " black-yellow " ticket ahead of the elections , saying it would n't be wise to pursue another alliance . election campaign the csu is pursuing an election campaign that diverges in key issues from that of merkel 's cdu .
the central element of the csu campaign is the lowering of income tax , which it has said it wo n't back down on . despite the ongoing crisis and the flurry of negative economic prognoses , the csu believes significant tax cuts are necessary and feasible .
the tax cuts , said seehofer , would take effect by 2011 . merkel 's cdu , meanwhile , has rejected such ambitious plans . another controversial issue seehofer addressed on saturday was the csu stance on the ratification of the european union 's lisbon treaty . the csu has called for the german parliament , the bundestag , to have more of a say in european affairs .
seehofer says the csu is not against ratifying the treaty , but rather for strengthening the national parliament on the european level . " we 're not about destruction ; we do n't want to blockade the treaty .
we want to give germany 's houses of parliament a stronger presence .
we want europe to recognize what it is made of - and we want that our national parliament to have responsibility and be taken seriously .

sarkozy is in new york to attend a concert honoring nelson mandela . french president nicolas sarkozy made the call for a global environmental organization after a working lunch at the french consulate in new york city with united nations secretary general ban ki-moon , where the two took part in wide-ranging discussions on global issues , with climate change topping the agenda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy did n't explain the specifics of his idea during talks with ban speaking on french television after the meeting , sarkozy called for new action on environmental issues , which were a major part of discussions at this month 's g8 summit in italy .
sarkozy did n't give any indication of how he thought this new global organization should be laid out .
" we will fight , hand in hand , a battle against the consequences of climate change .
we must create a global organization on the environment , " he added .
the key decision of the g8 summit was an agreement that world efforts should be directed towards limiting global warming to 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- above eighteenth-century levels , to prevent catastrophic climate and weather changes around the world .
ban said he was grateful for sarkozy 's " full commitment to work together to seal the deal in copenhagen on a globally acceptable " climate change agreement .
unep left out ?
the world already has a global environmental organization .
it 's called the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- , established in june1972 as a result of the un conference on the human environment .
part of the mandate of the unep is " to promote international co-operation in the field of the environment and to recommend , as appropriate , policies to this end . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruni-sarkozy said she would n't take the stage again after becoming first lady of france almost every international agreement on the environment has come under the auspices of the unep , including the kyoto protocol . it is unclear how a new global environmental organization would really be different .
at an international conference on climate change in copenhagen in december , governments are to agree on goals to fight climate change under a new kyoto protocol .
the current protocol will expire in 2012 .
sarkozy is in new york with his wife carla bruni-sarkozy to attend a fund raising concert to celebrate the 91st birthday of former south african president nelson mandela .

the call , made public in berlin , also has the support of nobel peace prize winner and iranian shirin ebadi .
the organizations are demanding , among other things , that iran respect human rights , a un investigation into the more serious and systematic human rights violations , the release of all non-violent political prisoners and an end to state-supported violence .
opposition answers back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafsanjani is considered the main rival of president ahmadinejad following friday prayers given by influential cleric and government critic akbar hashemi rafsanjani , up to one hundred thousand people took to the streets in iran in the first mass demonstration against the government in weeks , clashing with police .
eyewitnesses reported countless arrests and instances where police used tear gas .
rafsanjani , a former president of iran , has often criticized the government and has warned the current situation could turn into a real crisis .
" our main task is to regain the trust of the people , " said rafsanjani , who is often considered the main rival of president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
that would only happen if the government released those taken into custody while protesting the presidential election on june 12 .
" we have to learn to tolerate each other , " added the 75 year old cleric , who is a supporter of the opposition leader mir-hossein mussavi .
rafsanjani is the head of two of the most powerful bodies in the islamic republic .
he is the chairman of both the assembly of experts , which elects and removes the supreme leader of iran , and the expediency discernment council of iran , an unelected administrative assembly that resolves legislative conflicts between the majlis and the council of guardians .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de peacekeeping -pipe- 18.07.2009 lack of helicopters hurts darfur peace mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helicopters are desperately needed in darfur after its launch a year and half ago the international peace mission in darfur , still lacks an important asset to carry out its operation - helicopters .
so whose fault is it ? after protracted negotiations and with the situation in the darfur region of sudan deteriorating , the international community finally agreed to set up a joint peace operation .
a year and half ago , the united nations and the african union deployed troops to darfur as part of the unamid mission to establish peace and protect the people in the troubled province in western sudan .
according to un estimates , the conflict there has claimed more than 300,000 lives since 2003 .
to carry out its operation , unamid requested 24 helicopters to support its 17,000 troops .
but a year and a half after the launch of the mission , unamid is still without choppers .
since unamid itself does n't possess airlift capabilities , it is dependent on contributions from individual countries .
so far , no country has provided any helicopters to the darfur mission .
susana malcorra , the head of the department of field support at the un in new york , thinks the reason why darfur has n't received any choppers is because they have been deployed to other international hotspots .
" it seems like the need of helicopters has become a big ticket item in afghanistan and iraq " , she says and adds that other un missions in africa are also lacking airlift capabilities .
" it 's not only unamid that is short of helicopters .
we are also behind in chad and now we have a question for additional helicopters in the democratic republic of congo . "
other priorities lauren gelfand , africa editor with jane 's defence weekly in london , argues that there actually are plenty of choppers available around the world , but africa is simply not a high priority for the un member states that own them . " i think that there is a misconception about helicopters " , gelfand says .
" they are assets of the individual countries .
there is not a big pool of helicopters , like a lending library , where you can just get and keep them then for a couple of months for your operation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : choppers could benefit unamid soldiers greatly malcorra and gelfand both do agree that choppers would make an important contribution , especially in a vast area like darfur .
" the helicopters , " says malcorra , " give us the possibility to move our forces at a speed that otherwise is not possible .
this is critical for the mandate unamid has . "
what 's more , says gelfand : " a helicopter flies low enough that you can have a look outside the window and see what 's really going on .
in an area as remote , as large and as difficult as darfur , that 's very useful . " help from ethiopia while it is clear that helicopters would greatly enhance the mission in darfur , it 's uncertain whether countries will finally come forward and supply them to unamid .
just how cumbersome it is to get choppers to darfur is highlighted by the fact that then us-senator joe biden introduced a resolution to the us senate urging the international community to dispatch helicopters to darfur .
biden 's bill had 33 co-sponsors and was passed unanimously .
that was back in february of 2008 .
since then joe biden has become us vice president , but neither the united states nor any other country have sent helicopters to darfur . ethiopia so far is the only country that has vowed to provide helicopters .
it pledged to sent five choppers to darfur in october . " it will make a difference , " says susana malcorra .
" but we need more . "

so whose fault is it ? after protracted negotiations and with the situation in the darfur region of sudan deteriorating , the international community finally agreed to set up a joint peace operation .
a year and half ago , the united nations and the african union deployed troops to darfur as part of the unamid mission to establish peace and protect the people in the troubled province in western sudan .
according to un estimates , the conflict there has claimed more than 300,000 lives since 2003 .
to carry out its operation , unamid requested 24 helicopters to support its 17,000 troops .
but a year and a half after the launch of the mission , unamid is still without choppers .
since unamid itself does n't possess airlift capabilities , it is dependent on contributions from individual countries .
so far , no country has provided any helicopters to the darfur mission .
susana malcorra , the head of the department of field support at the un in new york , thinks the reason why darfur has n't received any choppers is because they have been deployed to other international hotspots .
" it seems like the need of helicopters has become a big ticket item in afghanistan and iraq " , she says and adds that other un missions in africa are also lacking airlift capabilities .
" it 's not only unamid that is short of helicopters .
we are also behind in chad and now we have a question for additional helicopters in the democratic republic of congo . "
other priorities lauren gelfand , africa editor with jane 's defence weekly in london , argues that there actually are plenty of choppers available around the world , but africa is simply not a high priority for the un member states that own them . " i think that there is a misconception about helicopters " , gelfand says .
" they are assets of the individual countries .
there is not a big pool of helicopters , like a lending library , where you can just get and keep them then for a couple of months for your operation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : choppers could benefit unamid soldiers greatly malcorra and gelfand both do agree that choppers would make an important contribution , especially in a vast area like darfur .
" the helicopters , " says malcorra , " give us the possibility to move our forces at a speed that otherwise is not possible .
this is critical for the mandate unamid has . "
what 's more , says gelfand : " a helicopter flies low enough that you can have a look outside the window and see what 's really going on .
in an area as remote , as large and as difficult as darfur , that 's very useful . " help from ethiopia while it is clear that helicopters would greatly enhance the mission in darfur , it 's uncertain whether countries will finally come forward and supply them to unamid .

sarkozy is in new york to attend a concert honoring nelson mandela . french president nicolas sarkozy made the call for a global environmental organization after a working lunch at the french consulate in new york city with united nations secretary general ban ki-moon , where the two took part in wide-ranging discussions on global issues , with climate change topping the agenda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy did n't explain the specifics of his idea during talks with ban speaking on french television after the meeting , sarkozy called for new action on environmental issues , which were a major part of discussions at this month 's g8 summit in italy .
sarkozy did n't give any indication of how he thought this new global organization should be laid out .
" we will fight , hand in hand , a battle against the consequences of climate change .
we must create a global organization on the environment , " he added .
the key decision of the g8 summit was an agreement that world efforts should be directed towards limiting global warming to 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- above eighteenth-century levels , to prevent catastrophic climate and weather changes around the world .
ban said he was grateful for sarkozy 's " full commitment to work together to seal the deal in copenhagen on a globally acceptable " climate change agreement .
unep left out ?
the world already has a global environmental organization .
it 's called the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- , established in june1972 as a result of the un conference on the human environment .
part of the mandate of the unep is " to promote international co-operation in the field of the environment and to recommend , as appropriate , policies to this end . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruni-sarkozy said she would n't take the stage again after becoming first lady of france almost every international agreement on the environment has come under the auspices of the unep , including the kyoto protocol . it is unclear how a new global environmental organization would really be different .
at an international conference on climate change in copenhagen in december , governments are to agree on goals to fight climate change under a new kyoto protocol .
the current protocol will expire in 2012 .
sarkozy is in new york with his wife carla bruni-sarkozy to attend a fund raising concert to celebrate the 91st birthday of former south african president nelson mandela .

italy , for one , is shaking in its boot . the sight of water swishing around craggy rocks and wooden fishing boats in vernazza 's tiny harbor is postcard perfect .
the village is just one of several in italy 's cinque terre region that are strung along the coastline like gems on a necklace . in vernazza , vineyards perch on the cliffs above and the harbor is rimmed with pastel-colored homes and restaurants - a perfect setting for a romantic getaway . the problem is , fewer are deciding to get away to this picturesque region as the world stumbles through the global economic crisis .
" vernazza and tourism are like husband and wife , " said edoardo basso , restaurateur at the taverna del capitano .
" and if the wife leaves ?
now is a problem in the house , there 's a crisis . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the crisis , some tourists are still making it to cinque terre for views such as this , of vernazza basso estimates that his restaurant 's business is down 25 percent .
those who do come to gobble up local delicacies , like twisted pasta with basil , are skipping that second course and after-dinner drink . fewer euros as the financial downturn continues to drag on the global economy and people 's pocketbooks , more europeans and others are choosing their backyard hammock or the local beach as holiday destinations .
those decisions are exacerbating an already worrisome situation for italy , where tourism is the number-one industry .
spending in early 2009 has declined nearly nine percent from the previous year . the fall-off has been even worse for sonia d 'ambra , owner of a gelateria , or ice-cream shop .
she watched business in march plummet by 50 percent over the previous year , although she thinks the weather and a late easter holiday contributed to the decline .
she is trying to remain optimistic about the rest of the summer season , although she might find herself praying to the statue of the virgin mary next to the gelateria 's door for a little outside help .
" a family with little kids will buy a cone for them , at least i hope , " she said .
" they wo n't buy souvenir tee-shirts but a gelato , a pizza , one has to eat .
i 'm crossing my fingers ! "
two japanese tourists come into her shop and she takes their order - only one cone for the two of them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ice cream sellers hope that no matter what the situation , people will still want gelato " of course , before , they 'd have bought two cones , " she said .
" now they 're careful about what they spend their money on and how much they spend . " american numbers down tourists who come to the region still spend their time hiking the cliffside paths linking the five villages and they often rent apartments by the week .
but apartment owners say visitors are shortening their stays .
most now hail from europe whereas americans used to be the majority . americans are especially feeling the pinch of the financial crisis and a weak dollar .
even though , those who are traveling , like vicory and doug barton from seattle , washington , are getting a little more bang for their buck over last year .
hotel prices have fallen by as much as a third .
" it seemed like such a bargain , " said vicory .
" airfare-wise , it was less than half . "
but , she added , people back home are thinking hard about finances and to many , european vacations seem like a luxury they ca n't afford .
in fact , people are putting off buying a lot of things , like new cars , flat-screen televisions or new furniture .
" your furniture can last a while longer but maybe our legs wo n't , so we better go hike this year , " she said .
survival strategy to offset the drop-off in numbers , merchants are keeping their prices competitive and for many , they hope the bargains attract more people like the bartons .
andrea leonardino of the baia saracena pizza parlor has cut his prices and is keeping his head up , trying not to succumb to fear as the news of economic gloom continues its steady beat .
" i am not so afraid , we have to wait , " he said , slicing into a cheese pizza the size of a manhole cover .
" if people talk all the time about the crisis , crisis , crisis .
i think the crisis is big but it 's bigger in our minds . " he and others say they are following a simple strategy : smile – and make everyone feel it was worthwhile to leave home for the cinque terre , even during a financial crisis . " they like to hear , ' oh ciao , ciao bella ! " ' he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.07.2009 german pirates plot course for general elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the pirate party politely hopes to burn the opposition 's ships " while germany 's larger parties are stepping up their campaigns , there is a host of less established parties joining the race .
the pirate party is one of them . fabio reinhardt , 28 , has just graduated from braunschweig in history and political science .
as the pirate party 's new media liaison officer , he has decided to devote the next two months to getting the pirates into parliament .
" for me it started two years ago when i was looking for ways to bring civil rights more into german politics , " he said .
the pirate party was founded in 2006 by 50 technically savvy 20-somethings who champion the internet as a foundation of freedom of expression and democracy .
perceived as something of a single-issue party fighting for freedom from lobbyists , the right to legally download music for free and total freedom from government web censorship , it is the german government 's recently enacted legislation against online child pornography that has truly put the wind into the party 's sails .
' censursula ' the new law , drafted by the federal ministry of family affairs was officially legislated to contain child pornography on the internet .
disparaged by experts as being almost totally ineffective , the law – which gives the federal criminal police office the right to block certain websites - generated a storm on the internet with over 150,000 people signing an internet petition against family minister ursula von der leyen 's censorship legislation .
" it is a hoax ; it does n't deal with the problem of child porn being distributed .
it makes it possible for the german police force to ban internet sites .
and this is the beginning of censorship .
it is a problem with the balance of power in germany and this is a very severe problem , " reinhardt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tauss denies child pornography accusations child pornography has become something of a party issue after former social democrat joerg tauss , the pirates ' only member with mainstream political experience , was accused of downloading child pornography .
tauss has denied the accusations and so far the pirate party is standing behind him .
reinhardt says tauss was in fact researching how child pornography is distributed , claiming that as most trade happens by telephone or by mail , an internet censorship law is irrelevant .
while reinhardt agrees that tauss may have overstepped his authority , he is clear that no one in the party believes he was a user of child pornography .
reinhardt says child pornography is one of the points that forces a necessary discussion on the remit of the state in protecting its citizens .
" on the one side you have to have a state that is limiting the rights of its citizens for their own good .
but we think that the state right now is crossing the line and is breaching civil rights in a very harmful way .
so right now we are trying to restore the balance because we think that we have lost this balance in europe , " he said .
claims pertaining to an attempt to readjust the balance in power in europe would , not so long ago , have sounded absurd .
but since the party 's largest convention in hamburg two weeks ago business is booming .
membership has shot up from 750 to 4,000 in under a month and reinhardt claims as many as 100 new members are joining every day .
in june , the pirate party 's swedish counterparts took an astonishing seven percent of the national vote in the european parliamentary elections .
and with a surge in media interest and a general political malaise among 20- to 30-somethings , the german party , under the chairmanship of jens seipenbusch , is now a presence on the scene .
another small glitch for the pirates comes in the form of party member bodo thiesen , who allegedly made comments denying the holocaust and other dubious right-wing extremist comments .
" nobody in our party believes that he is actually denying the holocaust , " reinhardt said .
" but thiesen is a very strong proponent of freedom of opinion in every sense .
we are struggling with how to deal with thiesen 's opinions .
we as a very young party have still to find a way to deal with this , " reinhardt said .
thiesen has since apologized for generating trouble for the party and explicitly denied any comments about holocaust denial .
a further critique , and one that is some ways tied in with media stereotyping of the party , is the lack of female members .
a party of young male computer nerds – that is the perception .
at a recruitment night in berlin , of the 50 participants there were , at least , seven women .
twenty-four year-old lena simon feels comfortable as one of the few women in the party but does want the topic raised .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg greeted the largest number of pirates yet at the annual party convention " i think a lot of the men here would like to see more women in the party .
we need more women .
computers are becoming more important every day and women should not stay in the background .
women should take part in this , " she said .
pirates are more than just a single-issue party with the media content to put some emphasis onto the party 's inexperience and the pale , slightly spotty , young man emerging from behind his mac to take on the world , the party ' cadres ' say they do n't really care as long as their message gets across .
martin hecker is on the berlin pirates committee .
" this is really about the rights of people in the internet age .
and there are people who get it and people who do n't .
i think , go for it and see what happens .
europe is very intransparent and so laws are passed and we need to act on that .
the best that could happen is that we get a lot of media interest and that people start to see what we are doing and that there is a lot of interest and people start to copy what we are doing .
because we are about copying the good stuff i just want this stupid legislation not to pass , " he said .
the idea of copying , or ' piracy ' is a strong theme of the party 's ideology .
reinhardt vehemently denies that they are a single-issue party .
education is a big theme as well as how to use the net to further co-operative democracy .
the party has no central planning committee , rather they gather ideas – sent in online by members – which are then distributed and put into policy suggestions .
as with the concept of ' piracy ' reinhardt and hecker are clear that they have no problem with other parties taking their ideas .
it is not about power , or personally sitting in parliament they say .
it is about getting policies through – and if that means the greens adopting a pirate idea , then why not .
despite some good humored language and piracy tomfoolery – reinhardt even manages a straight face as he says the pirates are ready to board the opposition 's ships and sail into the open sea of politics – the party does not want to be seen as a joke .
aron koenig , at 45 , the biblical father of the group and committee representative says the party is not a one-hit wonder .
" the name ' pirate party ' is unconventional and it might make people think that we are a joke but we are definitely not .
we have a funny name but we are serious .
civil rights and freedom are not a joke issue .
we are the fastest growing party in german democracy and i think we can do a lot with that vote .
we will stay .
it is not a one hit wonder , we are here to stay , " says koenig .

she is currently in mumbai , where she attended a private ceremony to honour the victims of last november 's attacks which left more than 170 people dead .
she is staying in the taj mahal palace hotel , where many of the victims died .
mrs clinton is also likely to press for better ties between india and pakistan when she goes to delhi on sunday .
observers say she will argue that the current us alliance with pakistan is not at india 's expense .
bbc regional analyst jill mcgivering says that at present , the us focus is on pakistan and afghanistan , and the battle against taliban insurgents in both countries .
but the obama administration is keen to address concerns in india that delhi 's interests are being neglected , our correspondent adds .
drumming up business bbc state department correspondent kim ghattas , who is travelling with mrs clinton , says the secretary of state is keen on people-to-people diplomacy and usually holds town hall events and meetings with civil society leaders on foreign visits .
before the official part of the visit in delhi on monday , she will take time in mumbai , the commercial capital , to meet business leaders and visit a women 's ngo that helps to provide poor women with employment .
in the afternoon she will spend an hour at a school talking to volunteers at the teach india programme , promoting education for the poor .
as her first engagement , she attended a morning ceremony to mark the mumbai attacks , held in private and without press coverage .
it was held in the taj palace hotel where she was staying .
the attacks , in november last year , have become a major source of tension between india and pakistan .
india wants pakistan to punish those responsible and take tough action against militant groups .
the us has been working to bring the sides back into dialogue .
if tensions along pakistan 's border with india were reduced , the pakistani military would be able to focus more fully on the north-west and dealing with its own insurgency there .
pakistan is now promising to address the concerns about militants , but many in india are sceptical .
our correspondent also says the visit is also partly about business .
the agreement which ended a three-decade ban on the sale of civilian nuclear technology to india was a centrepiece of the last bush administration .
now india is expected to name two sites where us companies can build nuclear power plants .
it is business worth billions of dollars .
