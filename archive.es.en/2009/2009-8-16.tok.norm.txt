western condemnation has been swift , but that seems to be the only reaction .
but what if the violence spills over to more vital regions of the country ? the latest violence in nigeria began late last month when gang members attacked a police station in bauchi , a city in north-eastern nigeria .
they were members of boko haram , a nigerian militant islamist group led by ustaz mohammed yusuf .
boko haram 's mission is to overthrow the nigerian state , impose an extreme interpretation of islamic law and abolish what they term as " western-style education . "
the attack was the result of the gang members ' outrage at the arrests of various gang leaders .
the ensuing clashes with nigerian security forces resulted in a bloodbath that lasted for day , leaving at least 700 people dead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nigerian military destroyed the headquarters of the radical islamist sect boko haram nigerian security forces then launched an offensive on the compound of the sect leader , mohammed yusuf .
troops shelled yusuf 's home after the leader and his followers barricaded themselves inside the building .
boko haram 's leader was eventually captured and later shot dead in allegedly controversial circumstances .
conspiracy theorists insist the sect leader was assassinated .
international reaction the riots have triggered alarm and a call to normalcy from the international community .
the eu issued a statement urging both sides to show restraint : " the european union expresses its deep concern over the recent violent developments in parts of northern nigeria , including attacks by militant groups known as boko haram .
the eu deplores the loss of life . "
" the eu recognizes the right and obligation of the government of nigeria to uphold peace and security within its territory .
however , the eu trusts that the authorities will show restraint in the use of force and respect human rights .
protection of the civilian population is essential .
the eu calls for a quick return to normalcy and will continue to closely follow the developments . "
the islamist group has become known as the “ taliban ” , although it shares no evident links with the taliban in afghanistan .
while there is widespread concern , the international community has largely remained passive , suggesting that this is viewed as an internal nigerian problem .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon also expressed his concern over the reports of sectarian violence .
his spokesperson , farhan haq , said the secretary-general " condemns the unnecessary loss of human life and the destruction of property as a result of militant attacks .
he hopes that those behind the attacks would be identified and brought to justice in accordance with the law . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary-general ban ki-moon has urged both sides to end the violence " the secretary-general calls upon the government of nigeria , law enforcement and security agencies , as well as religious and community leaders , to work together to address the underlying causes of the frequent religious clashes in nigeria so that a resolution could be found through dialogue , tolerance and understanding , " haq said .
amnesty set for action while both the un and eu have taken a largely conciliatory approach , the rhetoric coming from amnesty international was more forceful . franziska ulm of the german division of amnesty international told deutsche welle that " amnesty international condemns the killings in northern nigeria from both the armed militants and the security forces .
we are demanding the authorities install a commission which would undertake prosecution of the killings committed both by the armed militants and the security forces . "
" amnesty has several times documented killings by nigerian security forces without them being brought to justice , ” she added .
complexity of peace goal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aftermath of the violence in maiduguri however , with widespread outrage over the allegedly unlawful killing of mohammed yusuf , and religious and socio-political tensions still rife in the less-industrialized northern nigeria region , peace may be a complex and challenging goal to achieve .
some experts insist the riots are more rooted in socio-politics rather than religion , as a poor and frustrated population takes to violence against the government and its troops .
if that is the case , the tensions in the north may eventually spill over into larger southern regions , such as lagos and ibadan , whose inhabitants are also suffering economic hardships and can relate to the deep frustration with the nigerian leadership .
if the conflict becomes entrenched in the more industrialized southern regions , home to foreign and multi-national corporations , it could mean that the issue is no longer merely an internal matter .

" you have clearly interfered in iran 's internal affairs and were naïve enough to think that you can damage the system but with god 's help you failed , " ahmadinejad said .
the eu and us have not acknowledged ahmadinejad 's re-election .
they have also decried the country 's harsh response towards the protests that took place over the alleged election fraud as well detained dissidents .
" you -lrb- world powers -rrb- will be held accountable for this ballyhoo you made in the world , " the president said . tehran has several times accused the west of having provoked the mass protests against the government , and condemned western support for the dissidents . the june 12 election , which secured ahmadinejad 's re-election , plunged iran into its biggest internal crisis since the 1979 islamic revolution , exposed deepening divisions in its ruling elite and set off a wave of protests that left 26 people dead .
the row with the eu has prompted calls in parliament to revise relations with some european states , namely britain , france , germany and sweden .
senior officials sound calls to condemn eu a senior iranian ayatollah called friday for a confrontation with the european union over its support for recent political protests in iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran accuses the eu of complicity in the protests " the foreign ministry should adopt measures and confront the european states in a way that they regret their approach and apologize to the iranian nation , " said ahmad ahmad khatami during the friday prayer ceremony in tehran . the eu has supported the popular unrest against alleged fraud in the june 12 presidential election and has not acknowledged the re-election of president ahmadinejad . the ayatollah - deputy head of an influential clerical body , the experts assembly , and a close aide of the president - condemned a statement by sweden , which now holds the rotating eu presidency , in support of the detained protestors as blatant interference in the internal affairs of the iranian establishment . the 27 eu states have also summoned the iranian ambassadors in their countries and voiced their protests over what they call " show trials " against more than 100 detained demonstrators , local embassy employees and former reformist officials .
the eu has been singled out by iran for what it calls " meddling " in its state affairs and for the public criticism of its mass trial of moderates charged with spying and trying to topple the clerical establishment after the disputed president vote .
senior foreign ministry official hassan qashqavi added more furl to the fire when he accused the west of interference during a weekly news conference .
" do we interfere in other countries ' state matters ?
why should they interfere in ours ?
iran will strongly resist such meddling , " qashqavi said .
" why do n't they -lrb- the west -rrb- leave us and our people alone ? "
president names first women ministers since 1979 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women have been excluded from the cabinet since the revolution the president 's criticism on sunday came as ahmadinejad announced the appointment of at least two women in his new cabinet - the first female ministers in iran since the islamic revolution of 1979 .
speaking on state television , the president said that the ministries of health and social welfare will have female ministers .
ahmadinejad added that there might be a third female minister , but did not disclose the ministry .
the president declined however to comment on local reports that chief nuclear negotiator saeid jalili had been appointed as new foreign minister to succeed manouchehr mottaki .
the full list of the cabinet is to be presented to the parliament on wednesday for approval .
the mehr news agency reported on august 16 that jalili would be the most likely candidate for the foreign ministry post .
the two women are fatemeh ajorlou at social welfare and marzieh vahid-dastjerdi at the health ministry .
ahmadinejad further said that he has appointed the cleric hojatoleslam moslehi as information minister and head of intelligence service .
the ministers of cooperatives , economy and industries have been reinstated , the president added. nda / afp / dpa / reuters editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu and us have not acknowledged ahmadinejad 's re-election .
they have also decried the country 's harsh response towards the protests that took place over the alleged election fraud as well detained dissidents .
" you -lrb- world powers -rrb- will be held accountable for this ballyhoo you made in the world , " the president said . tehran has several times accused the west of having provoked the mass protests against the government , and condemned western support for the dissidents . the june 12 election , which secured ahmadinejad 's re-election , plunged iran into its biggest internal crisis since the 1979 islamic revolution , exposed deepening divisions in its ruling elite and set off a wave of protests that left 26 people dead .

the eu has been singled out by iran for what it calls " meddling " in its state affairs and for the public criticism of its mass trial of moderates charged with spying and trying to topple the clerical establishment after the disputed president vote .
senior foreign ministry official hassan qashqavi added more furl to the fire when he accused the west of interference during a weekly news conference .

why should they interfere in ours ?
iran will strongly resist such meddling , " qashqavi said .

senior officials sound calls to condemn eu a senior iranian ayatollah called friday for a confrontation with the european union over its support for recent political protests in iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran accuses the eu of complicity in the protests " the foreign ministry should adopt measures and confront the european states in a way that they regret their approach and apologize to the iranian nation , " said ahmad ahmad khatami during the friday prayer ceremony in tehran . the eu has supported the popular unrest against alleged fraud in the june 12 presidential election and has not acknowledged the re-election of president ahmadinejad . the ayatollah - deputy head of an influential clerical body , the experts assembly , and a close aide of the president - condemned a statement by sweden , which now holds the rotating eu presidency , in support of the detained protestors as blatant interference in the internal affairs of the iranian establishment . the 27 eu states have also summoned the iranian ambassadors in their countries and voiced their protests over what they call " show trials " against more than 100 detained demonstrators , local embassy employees and former reformist officials .
the eu has been singled out by iran for what it calls " meddling " in its state affairs and for the public criticism of its mass trial of moderates charged with spying and trying to topple the clerical establishment after the disputed president vote .
senior foreign ministry official hassan qashqavi added more furl to the fire when he accused the west of interference during a weekly news conference .
" do we interfere in other countries ' state matters ?
why should they interfere in ours ?
iran will strongly resist such meddling , " qashqavi said .
" why do n't they -lrb- the west -rrb- leave us and our people alone ? "
president names first women ministers since 1979 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women have been excluded from the cabinet since the revolution the president 's criticism on sunday came as ahmadinejad announced the appointment of at least two women in his new cabinet - the first female ministers in iran since the islamic revolution of 1979 .
speaking on state television , the president said that the ministries of health and social welfare will have female ministers .
ahmadinejad added that there might be a third female minister , but did not disclose the ministry .
the president declined however to comment on local reports that chief nuclear negotiator saeid jalili had been appointed as new foreign minister to succeed manouchehr mottaki .
the full list of the cabinet is to be presented to the parliament on wednesday for approval .
the mehr news agency reported on august 16 that jalili would be the most likely candidate for the foreign ministry post .
the two women are fatemeh ajorlou at social welfare and marzieh vahid-dastjerdi at the health ministry .
ahmadinejad further said that he has appointed the cleric hojatoleslam moslehi as information minister and head of intelligence service .
the ministers of cooperatives , economy and industries have been reinstated , the president added. nda / afp / dpa / reuters editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to the well respected russian maritime journal sovfrakht , the ship 's automatic identification signal was turned on briefly , and sent a signal at 0830gmt on saturday august 15 before it went silent again .
over the weekend , reports had the freighter in the neighborhood of the cape verde islands off the west coast of africa , as well as in the bay of biscay near france .
a french navy spokesman jerome baroe dismissed the report that the " arctic sea " was off the coast of france and said it was most likely that the ship was headed for brazil .

russia 's ambassador to nato , dmitry rogozin , said that russia and nato were coordinating their efforts to locate the ship .
rumors about what is really going on with the ship continued to circulate .

they have also decried the country 's harsh response towards the protests that took place over the alleged election fraud as well detained dissidents .
" you -lrb- world powers -rrb- will be held accountable for this ballyhoo you made in the world , " the president said . tehran has several times accused the west of having provoked the mass protests against the government , and condemned western support for the dissidents . the june 12 election , which secured ahmadinejad 's re-election , plunged iran into its biggest internal crisis since the 1979 islamic revolution , exposed deepening divisions in its ruling elite and set off a wave of protests that left 26 people dead .

the eu has been singled out by iran for what it calls " meddling " in its state affairs and for the public criticism of its mass trial of moderates charged with spying and trying to topple the clerical establishment after the disputed president vote .
senior foreign ministry official hassan qashqavi added more furl to the fire when he accused the west of interference during a weekly news conference .

the latest reports have the hijackers demanding a ransom . finnish media on saturday said that a ransom demand had been received from the people who hijacked the freighter " arctic sea " .
according to the financial times deutschland , the hijackers have demanded a ransom of $ 1.5 million -lrb- 1.05 million euros -rrb- , but have not revealed the source of this information .
according to the well respected russian maritime journal sovfrakht , the ship 's automatic identification signal was turned on briefly , and sent a signal at 0830gmt on saturday august 15 before it went silent again .
over the weekend , reports had the freighter in the neighborhood of the cape verde islands off the west coast of africa , as well as in the bay of biscay near france .
a french navy spokesman jerome baroe dismissed the report that the " arctic sea " was off the coast of france and said it was most likely that the ship was headed for brazil .
mikhail boytenko , the editor of sovfrakht was of the opinion that there was something a lot more sinister going on .
" i do n't think that is was pirates who took this vessel but it really smells of some sort of state involvement .
this is real cloak and dagger stuff , like a le carre novel , " he said according to reuters .
russia 's ambassador to nato , dmitry rogozin , said that russia and nato were coordinating their efforts to locate the ship .
rumors about what is really going on with the ship continued to circulate .
theories range that this is some sort of russian organized crime dispute , to the fact that the ship may be carrying some sort of mystery cargo that could possibly be of a radioactive nature , or arms for terrorists .
on july 23 , the " arctic sea " set sail from finland carrying a cargo of lumber bound for algeria .
while sailing through the baltic sea off sweden in the early hours of the next morning , the ship was allegedly boarded by a band of up to a dozen men posing as swedish narcotics police .
currently there are about 20 countries looking for the ship and the russians are using a submarine , a naval vessel and " other means " to search for the " arctic sea " . av / dpa / reuters / afp / ap editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 16.08.2009 west offers mixed response to northern nigeria conflict großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in maiduguri , nigeria , bodies lie in the street in front of police headquarters northern nigeria is seeing an increase in sectarian violence .
western condemnation has been swift , but that seems to be the only reaction .
but what if the violence spills over to more vital regions of the country ? the latest violence in nigeria began late last month when gang members attacked a police station in bauchi , a city in north-eastern nigeria .
they were members of boko haram , a nigerian militant islamist group led by ustaz mohammed yusuf .
boko haram 's mission is to overthrow the nigerian state , impose an extreme interpretation of islamic law and abolish what they term as " western-style education . "
the attack was the result of the gang members ' outrage at the arrests of various gang leaders .
the ensuing clashes with nigerian security forces resulted in a bloodbath that lasted for day , leaving at least 700 people dead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nigerian military destroyed the headquarters of the radical islamist sect boko haram nigerian security forces then launched an offensive on the compound of the sect leader , mohammed yusuf .
troops shelled yusuf 's home after the leader and his followers barricaded themselves inside the building .
boko haram 's leader was eventually captured and later shot dead in allegedly controversial circumstances .
conspiracy theorists insist the sect leader was assassinated .
international reaction the riots have triggered alarm and a call to normalcy from the international community .
the eu issued a statement urging both sides to show restraint : " the european union expresses its deep concern over the recent violent developments in parts of northern nigeria , including attacks by militant groups known as boko haram .
the eu deplores the loss of life . "
" the eu recognizes the right and obligation of the government of nigeria to uphold peace and security within its territory .
however , the eu trusts that the authorities will show restraint in the use of force and respect human rights .
protection of the civilian population is essential .
the eu calls for a quick return to normalcy and will continue to closely follow the developments . "
the islamist group has become known as the “ taliban ” , although it shares no evident links with the taliban in afghanistan .
while there is widespread concern , the international community has largely remained passive , suggesting that this is viewed as an internal nigerian problem .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon also expressed his concern over the reports of sectarian violence .
his spokesperson , farhan haq , said the secretary-general " condemns the unnecessary loss of human life and the destruction of property as a result of militant attacks .
he hopes that those behind the attacks would be identified and brought to justice in accordance with the law . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary-general ban ki-moon has urged both sides to end the violence " the secretary-general calls upon the government of nigeria , law enforcement and security agencies , as well as religious and community leaders , to work together to address the underlying causes of the frequent religious clashes in nigeria so that a resolution could be found through dialogue , tolerance and understanding , " haq said .
amnesty set for action while both the un and eu have taken a largely conciliatory approach , the rhetoric coming from amnesty international was more forceful . franziska ulm of the german division of amnesty international told deutsche welle that " amnesty international condemns the killings in northern nigeria from both the armed militants and the security forces .
we are demanding the authorities install a commission which would undertake prosecution of the killings committed both by the armed militants and the security forces . "
" amnesty has several times documented killings by nigerian security forces without them being brought to justice , ” she added .
complexity of peace goal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aftermath of the violence in maiduguri however , with widespread outrage over the allegedly unlawful killing of mohammed yusuf , and religious and socio-political tensions still rife in the less-industrialized northern nigeria region , peace may be a complex and challenging goal to achieve .
some experts insist the riots are more rooted in socio-politics rather than religion , as a poor and frustrated population takes to violence against the government and its troops .
if that is the case , the tensions in the north may eventually spill over into larger southern regions , such as lagos and ibadan , whose inhabitants are also suffering economic hardships and can relate to the deep frustration with the nigerian leadership .
if the conflict becomes entrenched in the more industrialized southern regions , home to foreign and multi-national corporations , it could mean that the issue is no longer merely an internal matter .

a french navy spokesman jerome baroe dismissed the report that the " arctic sea " was off the coast of france and said it was most likely that the ship was headed for brazil .
mikhail boytenko , the editor of sovfrakht was of the opinion that there was something a lot more sinister going on .
" i do n't think that is was pirates who took this vessel but it really smells of some sort of state involvement .
this is real cloak and dagger stuff , like a le carre novel , " he said according to reuters .
russia 's ambassador to nato , dmitry rogozin , said that russia and nato were coordinating their efforts to locate the ship .
rumors about what is really going on with the ship continued to circulate .
theories range that this is some sort of russian organized crime dispute , to the fact that the ship may be carrying some sort of mystery cargo that could possibly be of a radioactive nature , or arms for terrorists .
on july 23 , the " arctic sea " set sail from finland carrying a cargo of lumber bound for algeria .
while sailing through the baltic sea off sweden in the early hours of the next morning , the ship was allegedly boarded by a band of up to a dozen men posing as swedish narcotics police .
currently there are about 20 countries looking for the ship and the russians are using a submarine , a naval vessel and " other means " to search for the " arctic sea " . av / dpa / reuters / afp / ap editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de the bermuda triangle of the north a german paper reported a sighting of the freighter which appeared to have sailed into a void .
but without official confirmation , the story remains every bit as murky as the waters in which the vessel vanished .

the latest reports have the hijackers demanding a ransom . finnish media on saturday said that a ransom demand had been received from the people who hijacked the freighter " arctic sea " .
according to the financial times deutschland , the hijackers have demanded a ransom of $ 1.5 million -lrb- 1.05 million euros -rrb- , but have not revealed the source of this information .
according to the well respected russian maritime journal sovfrakht , the ship 's automatic identification signal was turned on briefly , and sent a signal at 0830gmt on saturday august 15 before it went silent again .
over the weekend , reports had the freighter in the neighborhood of the cape verde islands off the west coast of africa , as well as in the bay of biscay near france .
a french navy spokesman jerome baroe dismissed the report that the " arctic sea " was off the coast of france and said it was most likely that the ship was headed for brazil .
mikhail boytenko , the editor of sovfrakht was of the opinion that there was something a lot more sinister going on .
" i do n't think that is was pirates who took this vessel but it really smells of some sort of state involvement .
this is real cloak and dagger stuff , like a le carre novel , " he said according to reuters .
russia 's ambassador to nato , dmitry rogozin , said that russia and nato were coordinating their efforts to locate the ship .
rumors about what is really going on with the ship continued to circulate .
theories range that this is some sort of russian organized crime dispute , to the fact that the ship may be carrying some sort of mystery cargo that could possibly be of a radioactive nature , or arms for terrorists .
on july 23 , the " arctic sea " set sail from finland carrying a cargo of lumber bound for algeria .
while sailing through the baltic sea off sweden in the early hours of the next morning , the ship was allegedly boarded by a band of up to a dozen men posing as swedish narcotics police .
currently there are about 20 countries looking for the ship and the russians are using a submarine , a naval vessel and " other means " to search for the " arctic sea " . av / dpa / reuters / afp / ap editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

western condemnation has been swift , but that seems to be the only reaction .
but what if the violence spills over to more vital regions of the country ? the latest violence in nigeria began late last month when gang members attacked a police station in bauchi , a city in north-eastern nigeria .
they were members of boko haram , a nigerian militant islamist group led by ustaz mohammed yusuf .
boko haram 's mission is to overthrow the nigerian state , impose an extreme interpretation of islamic law and abolish what they term as " western-style education . "
the attack was the result of the gang members ' outrage at the arrests of various gang leaders .
the ensuing clashes with nigerian security forces resulted in a bloodbath that lasted for day , leaving at least 700 people dead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nigerian military destroyed the headquarters of the radical islamist sect boko haram nigerian security forces then launched an offensive on the compound of the sect leader , mohammed yusuf .
troops shelled yusuf 's home after the leader and his followers barricaded themselves inside the building .
boko haram 's leader was eventually captured and later shot dead in allegedly controversial circumstances .
conspiracy theorists insist the sect leader was assassinated .
international reaction the riots have triggered alarm and a call to normalcy from the international community .
the eu issued a statement urging both sides to show restraint : " the european union expresses its deep concern over the recent violent developments in parts of northern nigeria , including attacks by militant groups known as boko haram .
the eu deplores the loss of life . "
" the eu recognizes the right and obligation of the government of nigeria to uphold peace and security within its territory .
however , the eu trusts that the authorities will show restraint in the use of force and respect human rights .
protection of the civilian population is essential .
the eu calls for a quick return to normalcy and will continue to closely follow the developments . "
the islamist group has become known as the “ taliban ” , although it shares no evident links with the taliban in afghanistan .
while there is widespread concern , the international community has largely remained passive , suggesting that this is viewed as an internal nigerian problem .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon also expressed his concern over the reports of sectarian violence .
his spokesperson , farhan haq , said the secretary-general " condemns the unnecessary loss of human life and the destruction of property as a result of militant attacks .
he hopes that those behind the attacks would be identified and brought to justice in accordance with the law . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary-general ban ki-moon has urged both sides to end the violence " the secretary-general calls upon the government of nigeria , law enforcement and security agencies , as well as religious and community leaders , to work together to address the underlying causes of the frequent religious clashes in nigeria so that a resolution could be found through dialogue , tolerance and understanding , " haq said .
amnesty set for action while both the un and eu have taken a largely conciliatory approach , the rhetoric coming from amnesty international was more forceful . franziska ulm of the german division of amnesty international told deutsche welle that " amnesty international condemns the killings in northern nigeria from both the armed militants and the security forces .
we are demanding the authorities install a commission which would undertake prosecution of the killings committed both by the armed militants and the security forces . "
" amnesty has several times documented killings by nigerian security forces without them being brought to justice , ” she added .
complexity of peace goal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aftermath of the violence in maiduguri however , with widespread outrage over the allegedly unlawful killing of mohammed yusuf , and religious and socio-political tensions still rife in the less-industrialized northern nigeria region , peace may be a complex and challenging goal to achieve .
some experts insist the riots are more rooted in socio-politics rather than religion , as a poor and frustrated population takes to violence against the government and its troops .
if that is the case , the tensions in the north may eventually spill over into larger southern regions , such as lagos and ibadan , whose inhabitants are also suffering economic hardships and can relate to the deep frustration with the nigerian leadership .
if the conflict becomes entrenched in the more industrialized southern regions , home to foreign and multi-national corporations , it could mean that the issue is no longer merely an internal matter .

" you have clearly interfered in iran 's internal affairs and were naïve enough to think that you can damage the system but with god 's help you failed , " ahmadinejad said .
the eu and us have not acknowledged ahmadinejad 's re-election .
they have also decried the country 's harsh response towards the protests that took place over the alleged election fraud as well detained dissidents .
" you -lrb- world powers -rrb- will be held accountable for this ballyhoo you made in the world , " the president said . tehran has several times accused the west of having provoked the mass protests against the government , and condemned western support for the dissidents . the june 12 election , which secured ahmadinejad 's re-election , plunged iran into its biggest internal crisis since the 1979 islamic revolution , exposed deepening divisions in its ruling elite and set off a wave of protests that left 26 people dead .
the row with the eu has prompted calls in parliament to revise relations with some european states , namely britain , france , germany and sweden .
senior officials sound calls to condemn eu a senior iranian ayatollah called friday for a confrontation with the european union over its support for recent political protests in iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran accuses the eu of complicity in the protests " the foreign ministry should adopt measures and confront the european states in a way that they regret their approach and apologize to the iranian nation , " said ahmad ahmad khatami during the friday prayer ceremony in tehran . the eu has supported the popular unrest against alleged fraud in the june 12 presidential election and has not acknowledged the re-election of president ahmadinejad . the ayatollah - deputy head of an influential clerical body , the experts assembly , and a close aide of the president - condemned a statement by sweden , which now holds the rotating eu presidency , in support of the detained protestors as blatant interference in the internal affairs of the iranian establishment . the 27 eu states have also summoned the iranian ambassadors in their countries and voiced their protests over what they call " show trials " against more than 100 detained demonstrators , local embassy employees and former reformist officials .
the eu has been singled out by iran for what it calls " meddling " in its state affairs and for the public criticism of its mass trial of moderates charged with spying and trying to topple the clerical establishment after the disputed president vote .
senior foreign ministry official hassan qashqavi added more furl to the fire when he accused the west of interference during a weekly news conference .
" do we interfere in other countries ' state matters ?
why should they interfere in ours ?
iran will strongly resist such meddling , " qashqavi said .
" why do n't they -lrb- the west -rrb- leave us and our people alone ? "
president names first women ministers since 1979 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women have been excluded from the cabinet since the revolution the president 's criticism on sunday came as ahmadinejad announced the appointment of at least two women in his new cabinet - the first female ministers in iran since the islamic revolution of 1979 .
speaking on state television , the president said that the ministries of health and social welfare will have female ministers .
ahmadinejad added that there might be a third female minister , but did not disclose the ministry .
the president declined however to comment on local reports that chief nuclear negotiator saeid jalili had been appointed as new foreign minister to succeed manouchehr mottaki .
the full list of the cabinet is to be presented to the parliament on wednesday for approval .
the mehr news agency reported on august 16 that jalili would be the most likely candidate for the foreign ministry post .
the two women are fatemeh ajorlou at social welfare and marzieh vahid-dastjerdi at the health ministry .
ahmadinejad further said that he has appointed the cleric hojatoleslam moslehi as information minister and head of intelligence service .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 16.08.2009 west offers mixed response to northern nigeria conflict großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in maiduguri , nigeria , bodies lie in the street in front of police headquarters northern nigeria is seeing an increase in sectarian violence .
western condemnation has been swift , but that seems to be the only reaction .
but what if the violence spills over to more vital regions of the country ? the latest violence in nigeria began late last month when gang members attacked a police station in bauchi , a city in north-eastern nigeria .
they were members of boko haram , a nigerian militant islamist group led by ustaz mohammed yusuf .
boko haram 's mission is to overthrow the nigerian state , impose an extreme interpretation of islamic law and abolish what they term as " western-style education . "
the attack was the result of the gang members ' outrage at the arrests of various gang leaders .
the ensuing clashes with nigerian security forces resulted in a bloodbath that lasted for day , leaving at least 700 people dead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nigerian military destroyed the headquarters of the radical islamist sect boko haram nigerian security forces then launched an offensive on the compound of the sect leader , mohammed yusuf .
troops shelled yusuf 's home after the leader and his followers barricaded themselves inside the building .
boko haram 's leader was eventually captured and later shot dead in allegedly controversial circumstances .
conspiracy theorists insist the sect leader was assassinated .
international reaction the riots have triggered alarm and a call to normalcy from the international community .
the eu issued a statement urging both sides to show restraint : " the european union expresses its deep concern over the recent violent developments in parts of northern nigeria , including attacks by militant groups known as boko haram .
the eu deplores the loss of life . "
" the eu recognizes the right and obligation of the government of nigeria to uphold peace and security within its territory .
however , the eu trusts that the authorities will show restraint in the use of force and respect human rights .
protection of the civilian population is essential .
the eu calls for a quick return to normalcy and will continue to closely follow the developments . "
the islamist group has become known as the “ taliban ” , although it shares no evident links with the taliban in afghanistan .
while there is widespread concern , the international community has largely remained passive , suggesting that this is viewed as an internal nigerian problem .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon also expressed his concern over the reports of sectarian violence .
his spokesperson , farhan haq , said the secretary-general " condemns the unnecessary loss of human life and the destruction of property as a result of militant attacks .
he hopes that those behind the attacks would be identified and brought to justice in accordance with the law . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary-general ban ki-moon has urged both sides to end the violence " the secretary-general calls upon the government of nigeria , law enforcement and security agencies , as well as religious and community leaders , to work together to address the underlying causes of the frequent religious clashes in nigeria so that a resolution could be found through dialogue , tolerance and understanding , " haq said .
amnesty set for action while both the un and eu have taken a largely conciliatory approach , the rhetoric coming from amnesty international was more forceful . franziska ulm of the german division of amnesty international told deutsche welle that " amnesty international condemns the killings in northern nigeria from both the armed militants and the security forces .
we are demanding the authorities install a commission which would undertake prosecution of the killings committed both by the armed militants and the security forces . "
" amnesty has several times documented killings by nigerian security forces without them being brought to justice , ” she added .
complexity of peace goal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aftermath of the violence in maiduguri however , with widespread outrage over the allegedly unlawful killing of mohammed yusuf , and religious and socio-political tensions still rife in the less-industrialized northern nigeria region , peace may be a complex and challenging goal to achieve .
some experts insist the riots are more rooted in socio-politics rather than religion , as a poor and frustrated population takes to violence against the government and its troops .
if that is the case , the tensions in the north may eventually spill over into larger southern regions , such as lagos and ibadan , whose inhabitants are also suffering economic hardships and can relate to the deep frustration with the nigerian leadership .
if the conflict becomes entrenched in the more industrialized southern regions , home to foreign and multi-national corporations , it could mean that the issue is no longer merely an internal matter .

according to the financial times deutschland , the hijackers have demanded a ransom of $ 1.5 million -lrb- 1.05 million euros -rrb- , but have not revealed the source of this information .

over the weekend , reports had the freighter in the neighborhood of the cape verde islands off the west coast of africa , as well as in the bay of biscay near france .
a french navy spokesman jerome baroe dismissed the report that the " arctic sea " was off the coast of france and said it was most likely that the ship was headed for brazil .
mikhail boytenko , the editor of sovfrakht was of the opinion that there was something a lot more sinister going on .
" i do n't think that is was pirates who took this vessel but it really smells of some sort of state involvement .

russia 's ambassador to nato , dmitry rogozin , said that russia and nato were coordinating their efforts to locate the ship .
rumors about what is really going on with the ship continued to circulate .

on july 23 , the " arctic sea " set sail from finland carrying a cargo of lumber bound for algeria .
while sailing through the baltic sea off sweden in the early hours of the next morning , the ship was allegedly boarded by a band of up to a dozen men posing as swedish narcotics police .

" you -lrb- world powers -rrb- will be held accountable for this ballyhoo you made in the world , " the president said . tehran has several times accused the west of having provoked the mass protests against the government , and condemned western support for the dissidents . the june 12 election , which secured ahmadinejad 's re-election , plunged iran into its biggest internal crisis since the 1979 islamic revolution , exposed deepening divisions in its ruling elite and set off a wave of protests that left 26 people dead .

the eu has been singled out by iran for what it calls " meddling " in its state affairs and for the public criticism of its mass trial of moderates charged with spying and trying to topple the clerical establishment after the disputed president vote .
senior foreign ministry official hassan qashqavi added more furl to the fire when he accused the west of interference during a weekly news conference .

the latest reports have the hijackers demanding a ransom . finnish media on saturday said that a ransom demand had been received from the people who hijacked the freighter " arctic sea " .
according to the financial times deutschland , the hijackers have demanded a ransom of $ 1.5 million -lrb- 1.05 million euros -rrb- , but have not revealed the source of this information .
according to the well respected russian maritime journal sovfrakht , the ship 's automatic identification signal was turned on briefly , and sent a signal at 0830gmt on saturday august 15 before it went silent again .
over the weekend , reports had the freighter in the neighborhood of the cape verde islands off the west coast of africa , as well as in the bay of biscay near france .
a french navy spokesman jerome baroe dismissed the report that the " arctic sea " was off the coast of france and said it was most likely that the ship was headed for brazil .
mikhail boytenko , the editor of sovfrakht was of the opinion that there was something a lot more sinister going on .
" i do n't think that is was pirates who took this vessel but it really smells of some sort of state involvement .
this is real cloak and dagger stuff , like a le carre novel , " he said according to reuters .
russia 's ambassador to nato , dmitry rogozin , said that russia and nato were coordinating their efforts to locate the ship .
rumors about what is really going on with the ship continued to circulate .
theories range that this is some sort of russian organized crime dispute , to the fact that the ship may be carrying some sort of mystery cargo that could possibly be of a radioactive nature , or arms for terrorists .
on july 23 , the " arctic sea " set sail from finland carrying a cargo of lumber bound for algeria .
while sailing through the baltic sea off sweden in the early hours of the next morning , the ship was allegedly boarded by a band of up to a dozen men posing as swedish narcotics police .
currently there are about 20 countries looking for the ship and the russians are using a submarine , a naval vessel and " other means " to search for the " arctic sea " . av / dpa / reuters / afp / ap editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de the bermuda triangle of the north a german paper reported a sighting of the freighter which appeared to have sailed into a void .
but without official confirmation , the story remains every bit as murky as the waters in which the vessel vanished .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 16.08.2009 west offers mixed response to northern nigeria conflict großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in maiduguri , nigeria , bodies lie in the street in front of police headquarters northern nigeria is seeing an increase in sectarian violence .
western condemnation has been swift , but that seems to be the only reaction .
but what if the violence spills over to more vital regions of the country ? the latest violence in nigeria began late last month when gang members attacked a police station in bauchi , a city in north-eastern nigeria .
they were members of boko haram , a nigerian militant islamist group led by ustaz mohammed yusuf .
boko haram 's mission is to overthrow the nigerian state , impose an extreme interpretation of islamic law and abolish what they term as " western-style education . "
the attack was the result of the gang members ' outrage at the arrests of various gang leaders .
the ensuing clashes with nigerian security forces resulted in a bloodbath that lasted for day , leaving at least 700 people dead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nigerian military destroyed the headquarters of the radical islamist sect boko haram nigerian security forces then launched an offensive on the compound of the sect leader , mohammed yusuf .
troops shelled yusuf 's home after the leader and his followers barricaded themselves inside the building .
boko haram 's leader was eventually captured and later shot dead in allegedly controversial circumstances .
conspiracy theorists insist the sect leader was assassinated .
international reaction the riots have triggered alarm and a call to normalcy from the international community .
the eu issued a statement urging both sides to show restraint : " the european union expresses its deep concern over the recent violent developments in parts of northern nigeria , including attacks by militant groups known as boko haram .
the eu deplores the loss of life . "
" the eu recognizes the right and obligation of the government of nigeria to uphold peace and security within its territory .
however , the eu trusts that the authorities will show restraint in the use of force and respect human rights .
protection of the civilian population is essential .
the eu calls for a quick return to normalcy and will continue to closely follow the developments . "
the islamist group has become known as the “ taliban ” , although it shares no evident links with the taliban in afghanistan .
while there is widespread concern , the international community has largely remained passive , suggesting that this is viewed as an internal nigerian problem .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon also expressed his concern over the reports of sectarian violence .
his spokesperson , farhan haq , said the secretary-general " condemns the unnecessary loss of human life and the destruction of property as a result of militant attacks .
he hopes that those behind the attacks would be identified and brought to justice in accordance with the law . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary-general ban ki-moon has urged both sides to end the violence " the secretary-general calls upon the government of nigeria , law enforcement and security agencies , as well as religious and community leaders , to work together to address the underlying causes of the frequent religious clashes in nigeria so that a resolution could be found through dialogue , tolerance and understanding , " haq said .
amnesty set for action while both the un and eu have taken a largely conciliatory approach , the rhetoric coming from amnesty international was more forceful . franziska ulm of the german division of amnesty international told deutsche welle that " amnesty international condemns the killings in northern nigeria from both the armed militants and the security forces .
we are demanding the authorities install a commission which would undertake prosecution of the killings committed both by the armed militants and the security forces . "
" amnesty has several times documented killings by nigerian security forces without them being brought to justice , ” she added .
complexity of peace goal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aftermath of the violence in maiduguri however , with widespread outrage over the allegedly unlawful killing of mohammed yusuf , and religious and socio-political tensions still rife in the less-industrialized northern nigeria region , peace may be a complex and challenging goal to achieve .
some experts insist the riots are more rooted in socio-politics rather than religion , as a poor and frustrated population takes to violence against the government and its troops .
if that is the case , the tensions in the north may eventually spill over into larger southern regions , such as lagos and ibadan , whose inhabitants are also suffering economic hardships and can relate to the deep frustration with the nigerian leadership .
if the conflict becomes entrenched in the more industrialized southern regions , home to foreign and multi-national corporations , it could mean that the issue is no longer merely an internal matter .

" you have clearly interfered in iran 's internal affairs and were naïve enough to think that you can damage the system but with god 's help you failed , " ahmadinejad said .
the eu and us have not acknowledged ahmadinejad 's re-election .
they have also decried the country 's harsh response towards the protests that took place over the alleged election fraud as well detained dissidents .
" you -lrb- world powers -rrb- will be held accountable for this ballyhoo you made in the world , " the president said . tehran has several times accused the west of having provoked the mass protests against the government , and condemned western support for the dissidents . the june 12 election , which secured ahmadinejad 's re-election , plunged iran into its biggest internal crisis since the 1979 islamic revolution , exposed deepening divisions in its ruling elite and set off a wave of protests that left 26 people dead .
the row with the eu has prompted calls in parliament to revise relations with some european states , namely britain , france , germany and sweden .
senior officials sound calls to condemn eu a senior iranian ayatollah called friday for a confrontation with the european union over its support for recent political protests in iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran accuses the eu of complicity in the protests " the foreign ministry should adopt measures and confront the european states in a way that they regret their approach and apologize to the iranian nation , " said ahmad ahmad khatami during the friday prayer ceremony in tehran . the eu has supported the popular unrest against alleged fraud in the june 12 presidential election and has not acknowledged the re-election of president ahmadinejad . the ayatollah - deputy head of an influential clerical body , the experts assembly , and a close aide of the president - condemned a statement by sweden , which now holds the rotating eu presidency , in support of the detained protestors as blatant interference in the internal affairs of the iranian establishment . the 27 eu states have also summoned the iranian ambassadors in their countries and voiced their protests over what they call " show trials " against more than 100 detained demonstrators , local embassy employees and former reformist officials .
the eu has been singled out by iran for what it calls " meddling " in its state affairs and for the public criticism of its mass trial of moderates charged with spying and trying to topple the clerical establishment after the disputed president vote .
senior foreign ministry official hassan qashqavi added more furl to the fire when he accused the west of interference during a weekly news conference .
" do we interfere in other countries ' state matters ?
why should they interfere in ours ?
iran will strongly resist such meddling , " qashqavi said .
" why do n't they -lrb- the west -rrb- leave us and our people alone ? "
president names first women ministers since 1979 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women have been excluded from the cabinet since the revolution the president 's criticism on sunday came as ahmadinejad announced the appointment of at least two women in his new cabinet - the first female ministers in iran since the islamic revolution of 1979 .
speaking on state television , the president said that the ministries of health and social welfare will have female ministers .
ahmadinejad added that there might be a third female minister , but did not disclose the ministry .
the president declined however to comment on local reports that chief nuclear negotiator saeid jalili had been appointed as new foreign minister to succeed manouchehr mottaki .
the full list of the cabinet is to be presented to the parliament on wednesday for approval .
the mehr news agency reported on august 16 that jalili would be the most likely candidate for the foreign ministry post .
the two women are fatemeh ajorlou at social welfare and marzieh vahid-dastjerdi at the health ministry .
ahmadinejad further said that he has appointed the cleric hojatoleslam moslehi as information minister and head of intelligence service .

" you have clearly interfered in iran 's internal affairs and were naïve enough to think that you can damage the system but with god 's help you failed , " ahmadinejad said .
the eu and us have not acknowledged ahmadinejad 's re-election .
they have also decried the country 's harsh response towards the protests that took place over the alleged election fraud as well detained dissidents .
" you -lrb- world powers -rrb- will be held accountable for this ballyhoo you made in the world , " the president said . tehran has several times accused the west of having provoked the mass protests against the government , and condemned western support for the dissidents . the june 12 election , which secured ahmadinejad 's re-election , plunged iran into its biggest internal crisis since the 1979 islamic revolution , exposed deepening divisions in its ruling elite and set off a wave of protests that left 26 people dead .
the row with the eu has prompted calls in parliament to revise relations with some european states , namely britain , france , germany and sweden .
senior officials sound calls to condemn eu a senior iranian ayatollah called friday for a confrontation with the european union over its support for recent political protests in iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran accuses the eu of complicity in the protests " the foreign ministry should adopt measures and confront the european states in a way that they regret their approach and apologize to the iranian nation , " said ahmad ahmad khatami during the friday prayer ceremony in tehran . the eu has supported the popular unrest against alleged fraud in the june 12 presidential election and has not acknowledged the re-election of president ahmadinejad . the ayatollah - deputy head of an influential clerical body , the experts assembly , and a close aide of the president - condemned a statement by sweden , which now holds the rotating eu presidency , in support of the detained protestors as blatant interference in the internal affairs of the iranian establishment . the 27 eu states have also summoned the iranian ambassadors in their countries and voiced their protests over what they call " show trials " against more than 100 detained demonstrators , local embassy employees and former reformist officials .
the eu has been singled out by iran for what it calls " meddling " in its state affairs and for the public criticism of its mass trial of moderates charged with spying and trying to topple the clerical establishment after the disputed president vote .
senior foreign ministry official hassan qashqavi added more furl to the fire when he accused the west of interference during a weekly news conference .
" do we interfere in other countries ' state matters ?
why should they interfere in ours ?
iran will strongly resist such meddling , " qashqavi said .
" why do n't they -lrb- the west -rrb- leave us and our people alone ? "
president names first women ministers since 1979 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women have been excluded from the cabinet since the revolution the president 's criticism on sunday came as ahmadinejad announced the appointment of at least two women in his new cabinet - the first female ministers in iran since the islamic revolution of 1979 .
speaking on state television , the president said that the ministries of health and social welfare will have female ministers .
ahmadinejad added that there might be a third female minister , but did not disclose the ministry .
the president declined however to comment on local reports that chief nuclear negotiator saeid jalili had been appointed as new foreign minister to succeed manouchehr mottaki .
the full list of the cabinet is to be presented to the parliament on wednesday for approval .
the mehr news agency reported on august 16 that jalili would be the most likely candidate for the foreign ministry post .
the two women are fatemeh ajorlou at social welfare and marzieh vahid-dastjerdi at the health ministry .
ahmadinejad further said that he has appointed the cleric hojatoleslam moslehi as information minister and head of intelligence service .
the ministers of cooperatives , economy and industries have been reinstated , the president added. nda / afp / dpa / reuters editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the latest reports have the hijackers demanding a ransom . finnish media on saturday said that a ransom demand had been received from the people who hijacked the freighter " arctic sea " .
according to the financial times deutschland , the hijackers have demanded a ransom of $ 1.5 million -lrb- 1.05 million euros -rrb- , but have not revealed the source of this information .
according to the well respected russian maritime journal sovfrakht , the ship 's automatic identification signal was turned on briefly , and sent a signal at 0830gmt on saturday august 15 before it went silent again .
over the weekend , reports had the freighter in the neighborhood of the cape verde islands off the west coast of africa , as well as in the bay of biscay near france .
a french navy spokesman jerome baroe dismissed the report that the " arctic sea " was off the coast of france and said it was most likely that the ship was headed for brazil .
mikhail boytenko , the editor of sovfrakht was of the opinion that there was something a lot more sinister going on .
" i do n't think that is was pirates who took this vessel but it really smells of some sort of state involvement .
this is real cloak and dagger stuff , like a le carre novel , " he said according to reuters .
russia 's ambassador to nato , dmitry rogozin , said that russia and nato were coordinating their efforts to locate the ship .
rumors about what is really going on with the ship continued to circulate .
theories range that this is some sort of russian organized crime dispute , to the fact that the ship may be carrying some sort of mystery cargo that could possibly be of a radioactive nature , or arms for terrorists .
on july 23 , the " arctic sea " set sail from finland carrying a cargo of lumber bound for algeria .
while sailing through the baltic sea off sweden in the early hours of the next morning , the ship was allegedly boarded by a band of up to a dozen men posing as swedish narcotics police .
currently there are about 20 countries looking for the ship and the russians are using a submarine , a naval vessel and " other means " to search for the " arctic sea " . av / dpa / reuters / afp / ap editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de the bermuda triangle of the north a german paper reported a sighting of the freighter which appeared to have sailed into a void .
but without official confirmation , the story remains every bit as murky as the waters in which the vessel vanished .

the latest reports have the hijackers demanding a ransom . finnish media on saturday said that a ransom demand had been received from the people who hijacked the freighter " arctic sea " .
according to the financial times deutschland , the hijackers have demanded a ransom of $ 1.5 million -lrb- 1.05 million euros -rrb- , but have not revealed the source of this information .
according to the well respected russian maritime journal sovfrakht , the ship 's automatic identification signal was turned on briefly , and sent a signal at 0830gmt on saturday august 15 before it went silent again .
over the weekend , reports had the freighter in the neighborhood of the cape verde islands off the west coast of africa , as well as in the bay of biscay near france .
a french navy spokesman jerome baroe dismissed the report that the " arctic sea " was off the coast of france and said it was most likely that the ship was headed for brazil .
mikhail boytenko , the editor of sovfrakht was of the opinion that there was something a lot more sinister going on .
" i do n't think that is was pirates who took this vessel but it really smells of some sort of state involvement .
this is real cloak and dagger stuff , like a le carre novel , " he said according to reuters .
russia 's ambassador to nato , dmitry rogozin , said that russia and nato were coordinating their efforts to locate the ship .
rumors about what is really going on with the ship continued to circulate .
theories range that this is some sort of russian organized crime dispute , to the fact that the ship may be carrying some sort of mystery cargo that could possibly be of a radioactive nature , or arms for terrorists .
on july 23 , the " arctic sea " set sail from finland carrying a cargo of lumber bound for algeria .
while sailing through the baltic sea off sweden in the early hours of the next morning , the ship was allegedly boarded by a band of up to a dozen men posing as swedish narcotics police .
currently there are about 20 countries looking for the ship and the russians are using a submarine , a naval vessel and " other means " to search for the " arctic sea " . av / dpa / reuters / afp / ap editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" you have clearly interfered in iran 's internal affairs and were naïve enough to think that you can damage the system but with god 's help you failed , " ahmadinejad said .
the eu and us have not acknowledged ahmadinejad 's re-election .
they have also decried the country 's harsh response towards the protests that took place over the alleged election fraud as well detained dissidents .
" you -lrb- world powers -rrb- will be held accountable for this ballyhoo you made in the world , " the president said . tehran has several times accused the west of having provoked the mass protests against the government , and condemned western support for the dissidents . the june 12 election , which secured ahmadinejad 's re-election , plunged iran into its biggest internal crisis since the 1979 islamic revolution , exposed deepening divisions in its ruling elite and set off a wave of protests that left 26 people dead .
the row with the eu has prompted calls in parliament to revise relations with some european states , namely britain , france , germany and sweden .
senior officials sound calls to condemn eu a senior iranian ayatollah called friday for a confrontation with the european union over its support for recent political protests in iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran accuses the eu of complicity in the protests " the foreign ministry should adopt measures and confront the european states in a way that they regret their approach and apologize to the iranian nation , " said ahmad ahmad khatami during the friday prayer ceremony in tehran . the eu has supported the popular unrest against alleged fraud in the june 12 presidential election and has not acknowledged the re-election of president ahmadinejad . the ayatollah - deputy head of an influential clerical body , the experts assembly , and a close aide of the president - condemned a statement by sweden , which now holds the rotating eu presidency , in support of the detained protestors as blatant interference in the internal affairs of the iranian establishment . the 27 eu states have also summoned the iranian ambassadors in their countries and voiced their protests over what they call " show trials " against more than 100 detained demonstrators , local embassy employees and former reformist officials .
the eu has been singled out by iran for what it calls " meddling " in its state affairs and for the public criticism of its mass trial of moderates charged with spying and trying to topple the clerical establishment after the disputed president vote .
senior foreign ministry official hassan qashqavi added more furl to the fire when he accused the west of interference during a weekly news conference .
" do we interfere in other countries ' state matters ?
why should they interfere in ours ?
iran will strongly resist such meddling , " qashqavi said .
" why do n't they -lrb- the west -rrb- leave us and our people alone ? "
president names first women ministers since 1979 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women have been excluded from the cabinet since the revolution the president 's criticism on sunday came as ahmadinejad announced the appointment of at least two women in his new cabinet - the first female ministers in iran since the islamic revolution of 1979 .
speaking on state television , the president said that the ministries of health and social welfare will have female ministers .
ahmadinejad added that there might be a third female minister , but did not disclose the ministry .
the president declined however to comment on local reports that chief nuclear negotiator saeid jalili had been appointed as new foreign minister to succeed manouchehr mottaki .
the full list of the cabinet is to be presented to the parliament on wednesday for approval .
the mehr news agency reported on august 16 that jalili would be the most likely candidate for the foreign ministry post .
the two women are fatemeh ajorlou at social welfare and marzieh vahid-dastjerdi at the health ministry .
ahmadinejad further said that he has appointed the cleric hojatoleslam moslehi as information minister and head of intelligence service .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 16.08.2009 west offers mixed response to northern nigeria conflict großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in maiduguri , nigeria , bodies lie in the street in front of police headquarters northern nigeria is seeing an increase in sectarian violence .
western condemnation has been swift , but that seems to be the only reaction .
but what if the violence spills over to more vital regions of the country ? the latest violence in nigeria began late last month when gang members attacked a police station in bauchi , a city in north-eastern nigeria .
they were members of boko haram , a nigerian militant islamist group led by ustaz mohammed yusuf .
boko haram 's mission is to overthrow the nigerian state , impose an extreme interpretation of islamic law and abolish what they term as " western-style education . "
the attack was the result of the gang members ' outrage at the arrests of various gang leaders .
the ensuing clashes with nigerian security forces resulted in a bloodbath that lasted for day , leaving at least 700 people dead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nigerian military destroyed the headquarters of the radical islamist sect boko haram nigerian security forces then launched an offensive on the compound of the sect leader , mohammed yusuf .
troops shelled yusuf 's home after the leader and his followers barricaded themselves inside the building .
boko haram 's leader was eventually captured and later shot dead in allegedly controversial circumstances .
conspiracy theorists insist the sect leader was assassinated .
international reaction the riots have triggered alarm and a call to normalcy from the international community .
the eu issued a statement urging both sides to show restraint : " the european union expresses its deep concern over the recent violent developments in parts of northern nigeria , including attacks by militant groups known as boko haram .
the eu deplores the loss of life . "
" the eu recognizes the right and obligation of the government of nigeria to uphold peace and security within its territory .
however , the eu trusts that the authorities will show restraint in the use of force and respect human rights .
protection of the civilian population is essential .
the eu calls for a quick return to normalcy and will continue to closely follow the developments . "
the islamist group has become known as the “ taliban ” , although it shares no evident links with the taliban in afghanistan .
while there is widespread concern , the international community has largely remained passive , suggesting that this is viewed as an internal nigerian problem .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon also expressed his concern over the reports of sectarian violence .
his spokesperson , farhan haq , said the secretary-general " condemns the unnecessary loss of human life and the destruction of property as a result of militant attacks .
he hopes that those behind the attacks would be identified and brought to justice in accordance with the law . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary-general ban ki-moon has urged both sides to end the violence " the secretary-general calls upon the government of nigeria , law enforcement and security agencies , as well as religious and community leaders , to work together to address the underlying causes of the frequent religious clashes in nigeria so that a resolution could be found through dialogue , tolerance and understanding , " haq said .
amnesty set for action while both the un and eu have taken a largely conciliatory approach , the rhetoric coming from amnesty international was more forceful . franziska ulm of the german division of amnesty international told deutsche welle that " amnesty international condemns the killings in northern nigeria from both the armed militants and the security forces .
we are demanding the authorities install a commission which would undertake prosecution of the killings committed both by the armed militants and the security forces . "
" amnesty has several times documented killings by nigerian security forces without them being brought to justice , ” she added .
complexity of peace goal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aftermath of the violence in maiduguri however , with widespread outrage over the allegedly unlawful killing of mohammed yusuf , and religious and socio-political tensions still rife in the less-industrialized northern nigeria region , peace may be a complex and challenging goal to achieve .
some experts insist the riots are more rooted in socio-politics rather than religion , as a poor and frustrated population takes to violence against the government and its troops .
if that is the case , the tensions in the north may eventually spill over into larger southern regions , such as lagos and ibadan , whose inhabitants are also suffering economic hardships and can relate to the deep frustration with the nigerian leadership .
if the conflict becomes entrenched in the more industrialized southern regions , home to foreign and multi-national corporations , it could mean that the issue is no longer merely an internal matter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 16.08.2009 west offers mixed response to northern nigeria conflict großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in maiduguri , nigeria , bodies lie in the street in front of police headquarters northern nigeria is seeing an increase in sectarian violence .
western condemnation has been swift , but that seems to be the only reaction .
but what if the violence spills over to more vital regions of the country ? the latest violence in nigeria began late last month when gang members attacked a police station in bauchi , a city in north-eastern nigeria .
they were members of boko haram , a nigerian militant islamist group led by ustaz mohammed yusuf .
boko haram 's mission is to overthrow the nigerian state , impose an extreme interpretation of islamic law and abolish what they term as " western-style education . "
the attack was the result of the gang members ' outrage at the arrests of various gang leaders .
the ensuing clashes with nigerian security forces resulted in a bloodbath that lasted for day , leaving at least 700 people dead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nigerian military destroyed the headquarters of the radical islamist sect boko haram nigerian security forces then launched an offensive on the compound of the sect leader , mohammed yusuf .
troops shelled yusuf 's home after the leader and his followers barricaded themselves inside the building .
boko haram 's leader was eventually captured and later shot dead in allegedly controversial circumstances .
conspiracy theorists insist the sect leader was assassinated .
international reaction the riots have triggered alarm and a call to normalcy from the international community .
the eu issued a statement urging both sides to show restraint : " the european union expresses its deep concern over the recent violent developments in parts of northern nigeria , including attacks by militant groups known as boko haram .
the eu deplores the loss of life . "
" the eu recognizes the right and obligation of the government of nigeria to uphold peace and security within its territory .
however , the eu trusts that the authorities will show restraint in the use of force and respect human rights .
protection of the civilian population is essential .
the eu calls for a quick return to normalcy and will continue to closely follow the developments . "
the islamist group has become known as the “ taliban ” , although it shares no evident links with the taliban in afghanistan .
while there is widespread concern , the international community has largely remained passive , suggesting that this is viewed as an internal nigerian problem .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon also expressed his concern over the reports of sectarian violence .
his spokesperson , farhan haq , said the secretary-general " condemns the unnecessary loss of human life and the destruction of property as a result of militant attacks .
he hopes that those behind the attacks would be identified and brought to justice in accordance with the law . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary-general ban ki-moon has urged both sides to end the violence " the secretary-general calls upon the government of nigeria , law enforcement and security agencies , as well as religious and community leaders , to work together to address the underlying causes of the frequent religious clashes in nigeria so that a resolution could be found through dialogue , tolerance and understanding , " haq said .
amnesty set for action while both the un and eu have taken a largely conciliatory approach , the rhetoric coming from amnesty international was more forceful . franziska ulm of the german division of amnesty international told deutsche welle that " amnesty international condemns the killings in northern nigeria from both the armed militants and the security forces .
we are demanding the authorities install a commission which would undertake prosecution of the killings committed both by the armed militants and the security forces . "
" amnesty has several times documented killings by nigerian security forces without them being brought to justice , ” she added .
complexity of peace goal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aftermath of the violence in maiduguri however , with widespread outrage over the allegedly unlawful killing of mohammed yusuf , and religious and socio-political tensions still rife in the less-industrialized northern nigeria region , peace may be a complex and challenging goal to achieve .
some experts insist the riots are more rooted in socio-politics rather than religion , as a poor and frustrated population takes to violence against the government and its troops .
if that is the case , the tensions in the north may eventually spill over into larger southern regions , such as lagos and ibadan , whose inhabitants are also suffering economic hardships and can relate to the deep frustration with the nigerian leadership .
if the conflict becomes entrenched in the more industrialized southern regions , home to foreign and multi-national corporations , it could mean that the issue is no longer merely an internal matter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 16.08.2009 west offers mixed response to northern nigeria conflict großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in maiduguri , nigeria , bodies lie in the street in front of police headquarters northern nigeria is seeing an increase in sectarian violence .
western condemnation has been swift , but that seems to be the only reaction .
but what if the violence spills over to more vital regions of the country ? the latest violence in nigeria began late last month when gang members attacked a police station in bauchi , a city in north-eastern nigeria .
they were members of boko haram , a nigerian militant islamist group led by ustaz mohammed yusuf .
boko haram 's mission is to overthrow the nigerian state , impose an extreme interpretation of islamic law and abolish what they term as " western-style education . "
the attack was the result of the gang members ' outrage at the arrests of various gang leaders .
the ensuing clashes with nigerian security forces resulted in a bloodbath that lasted for day , leaving at least 700 people dead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nigerian military destroyed the headquarters of the radical islamist sect boko haram nigerian security forces then launched an offensive on the compound of the sect leader , mohammed yusuf .
troops shelled yusuf 's home after the leader and his followers barricaded themselves inside the building .
boko haram 's leader was eventually captured and later shot dead in allegedly controversial circumstances .
conspiracy theorists insist the sect leader was assassinated .
international reaction the riots have triggered alarm and a call to normalcy from the international community .
the eu issued a statement urging both sides to show restraint : " the european union expresses its deep concern over the recent violent developments in parts of northern nigeria , including attacks by militant groups known as boko haram .
the eu deplores the loss of life . "
" the eu recognizes the right and obligation of the government of nigeria to uphold peace and security within its territory .
however , the eu trusts that the authorities will show restraint in the use of force and respect human rights .
protection of the civilian population is essential .
the eu calls for a quick return to normalcy and will continue to closely follow the developments . "
the islamist group has become known as the “ taliban ” , although it shares no evident links with the taliban in afghanistan .
while there is widespread concern , the international community has largely remained passive , suggesting that this is viewed as an internal nigerian problem .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon also expressed his concern over the reports of sectarian violence .
his spokesperson , farhan haq , said the secretary-general " condemns the unnecessary loss of human life and the destruction of property as a result of militant attacks .
he hopes that those behind the attacks would be identified and brought to justice in accordance with the law . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary-general ban ki-moon has urged both sides to end the violence " the secretary-general calls upon the government of nigeria , law enforcement and security agencies , as well as religious and community leaders , to work together to address the underlying causes of the frequent religious clashes in nigeria so that a resolution could be found through dialogue , tolerance and understanding , " haq said .
amnesty set for action while both the un and eu have taken a largely conciliatory approach , the rhetoric coming from amnesty international was more forceful . franziska ulm of the german division of amnesty international told deutsche welle that " amnesty international condemns the killings in northern nigeria from both the armed militants and the security forces .
we are demanding the authorities install a commission which would undertake prosecution of the killings committed both by the armed militants and the security forces . "
" amnesty has several times documented killings by nigerian security forces without them being brought to justice , ” she added .
complexity of peace goal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aftermath of the violence in maiduguri however , with widespread outrage over the allegedly unlawful killing of mohammed yusuf , and religious and socio-political tensions still rife in the less-industrialized northern nigeria region , peace may be a complex and challenging goal to achieve .
some experts insist the riots are more rooted in socio-politics rather than religion , as a poor and frustrated population takes to violence against the government and its troops .
if that is the case , the tensions in the north may eventually spill over into larger southern regions , such as lagos and ibadan , whose inhabitants are also suffering economic hardships and can relate to the deep frustration with the nigerian leadership .
if the conflict becomes entrenched in the more industrialized southern regions , home to foreign and multi-national corporations , it could mean that the issue is no longer merely an internal matter .

the latest reports have the hijackers demanding a ransom . finnish media on saturday said that a ransom demand had been received from the people who hijacked the freighter " arctic sea " .
according to the financial times deutschland , the hijackers have demanded a ransom of $ 1.5 million -lrb- 1.05 million euros -rrb- , but have not revealed the source of this information .
according to the well respected russian maritime journal sovfrakht , the ship 's automatic identification signal was turned on briefly , and sent a signal at 0830gmt on saturday august 15 before it went silent again .
over the weekend , reports had the freighter in the neighborhood of the cape verde islands off the west coast of africa , as well as in the bay of biscay near france .
a french navy spokesman jerome baroe dismissed the report that the " arctic sea " was off the coast of france and said it was most likely that the ship was headed for brazil .
mikhail boytenko , the editor of sovfrakht was of the opinion that there was something a lot more sinister going on .
" i do n't think that is was pirates who took this vessel but it really smells of some sort of state involvement .
this is real cloak and dagger stuff , like a le carre novel , " he said according to reuters .
russia 's ambassador to nato , dmitry rogozin , said that russia and nato were coordinating their efforts to locate the ship .
rumors about what is really going on with the ship continued to circulate .
theories range that this is some sort of russian organized crime dispute , to the fact that the ship may be carrying some sort of mystery cargo that could possibly be of a radioactive nature , or arms for terrorists .
on july 23 , the " arctic sea " set sail from finland carrying a cargo of lumber bound for algeria .
while sailing through the baltic sea off sweden in the early hours of the next morning , the ship was allegedly boarded by a band of up to a dozen men posing as swedish narcotics police .
currently there are about 20 countries looking for the ship and the russians are using a submarine , a naval vessel and " other means " to search for the " arctic sea " . av / dpa / reuters / afp / ap editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the latest reports have the hijackers demanding a ransom . finnish media on saturday said that a ransom demand had been received from the people who hijacked the freighter " arctic sea " .
according to the financial times deutschland , the hijackers have demanded a ransom of $ 1.5 million -lrb- 1.05 million euros -rrb- , but have not revealed the source of this information .
according to the well respected russian maritime journal sovfrakht , the ship 's automatic identification signal was turned on briefly , and sent a signal at 0830gmt on saturday august 15 before it went silent again .
over the weekend , reports had the freighter in the neighborhood of the cape verde islands off the west coast of africa , as well as in the bay of biscay near france .
a french navy spokesman jerome baroe dismissed the report that the " arctic sea " was off the coast of france and said it was most likely that the ship was headed for brazil .
mikhail boytenko , the editor of sovfrakht was of the opinion that there was something a lot more sinister going on .
" i do n't think that is was pirates who took this vessel but it really smells of some sort of state involvement .
this is real cloak and dagger stuff , like a le carre novel , " he said according to reuters .
russia 's ambassador to nato , dmitry rogozin , said that russia and nato were coordinating their efforts to locate the ship .
rumors about what is really going on with the ship continued to circulate .
theories range that this is some sort of russian organized crime dispute , to the fact that the ship may be carrying some sort of mystery cargo that could possibly be of a radioactive nature , or arms for terrorists .
on july 23 , the " arctic sea " set sail from finland carrying a cargo of lumber bound for algeria .
while sailing through the baltic sea off sweden in the early hours of the next morning , the ship was allegedly boarded by a band of up to a dozen men posing as swedish narcotics police .
currently there are about 20 countries looking for the ship and the russians are using a submarine , a naval vessel and " other means " to search for the " arctic sea " . av / dpa / reuters / afp / ap editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the latest reports have the hijackers demanding a ransom . finnish media on saturday said that a ransom demand had been received from the people who hijacked the freighter " arctic sea " .
according to the financial times deutschland , the hijackers have demanded a ransom of $ 1.5 million -lrb- 1.05 million euros -rrb- , but have not revealed the source of this information .
according to the well respected russian maritime journal sovfrakht , the ship 's automatic identification signal was turned on briefly , and sent a signal at 0830gmt on saturday august 15 before it went silent again .
over the weekend , reports had the freighter in the neighborhood of the cape verde islands off the west coast of africa , as well as in the bay of biscay near france .
a french navy spokesman jerome baroe dismissed the report that the " arctic sea " was off the coast of france and said it was most likely that the ship was headed for brazil .
mikhail boytenko , the editor of sovfrakht was of the opinion that there was something a lot more sinister going on .
" i do n't think that is was pirates who took this vessel but it really smells of some sort of state involvement .
this is real cloak and dagger stuff , like a le carre novel , " he said according to reuters .
russia 's ambassador to nato , dmitry rogozin , said that russia and nato were coordinating their efforts to locate the ship .
rumors about what is really going on with the ship continued to circulate .
theories range that this is some sort of russian organized crime dispute , to the fact that the ship may be carrying some sort of mystery cargo that could possibly be of a radioactive nature , or arms for terrorists .
on july 23 , the " arctic sea " set sail from finland carrying a cargo of lumber bound for algeria .
while sailing through the baltic sea off sweden in the early hours of the next morning , the ship was allegedly boarded by a band of up to a dozen men posing as swedish narcotics police .

western condemnation has been swift , but that seems to be the only reaction .
but what if the violence spills over to more vital regions of the country ? the latest violence in nigeria began late last month when gang members attacked a police station in bauchi , a city in north-eastern nigeria .
they were members of boko haram , a nigerian militant islamist group led by ustaz mohammed yusuf .
boko haram 's mission is to overthrow the nigerian state , impose an extreme interpretation of islamic law and abolish what they term as " western-style education . "
the attack was the result of the gang members ' outrage at the arrests of various gang leaders .
the ensuing clashes with nigerian security forces resulted in a bloodbath that lasted for day , leaving at least 700 people dead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nigerian military destroyed the headquarters of the radical islamist sect boko haram nigerian security forces then launched an offensive on the compound of the sect leader , mohammed yusuf .
troops shelled yusuf 's home after the leader and his followers barricaded themselves inside the building .
boko haram 's leader was eventually captured and later shot dead in allegedly controversial circumstances .
conspiracy theorists insist the sect leader was assassinated .
international reaction the riots have triggered alarm and a call to normalcy from the international community .
the eu issued a statement urging both sides to show restraint : " the european union expresses its deep concern over the recent violent developments in parts of northern nigeria , including attacks by militant groups known as boko haram .
the eu deplores the loss of life . "
" the eu recognizes the right and obligation of the government of nigeria to uphold peace and security within its territory .
however , the eu trusts that the authorities will show restraint in the use of force and respect human rights .
protection of the civilian population is essential .
the eu calls for a quick return to normalcy and will continue to closely follow the developments . "
the islamist group has become known as the “ taliban ” , although it shares no evident links with the taliban in afghanistan .
while there is widespread concern , the international community has largely remained passive , suggesting that this is viewed as an internal nigerian problem .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon also expressed his concern over the reports of sectarian violence .
his spokesperson , farhan haq , said the secretary-general " condemns the unnecessary loss of human life and the destruction of property as a result of militant attacks .
he hopes that those behind the attacks would be identified and brought to justice in accordance with the law . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary-general ban ki-moon has urged both sides to end the violence " the secretary-general calls upon the government of nigeria , law enforcement and security agencies , as well as religious and community leaders , to work together to address the underlying causes of the frequent religious clashes in nigeria so that a resolution could be found through dialogue , tolerance and understanding , " haq said .
amnesty set for action while both the un and eu have taken a largely conciliatory approach , the rhetoric coming from amnesty international was more forceful . franziska ulm of the german division of amnesty international told deutsche welle that " amnesty international condemns the killings in northern nigeria from both the armed militants and the security forces .
we are demanding the authorities install a commission which would undertake prosecution of the killings committed both by the armed militants and the security forces . "
" amnesty has several times documented killings by nigerian security forces without them being brought to justice , ” she added .
complexity of peace goal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aftermath of the violence in maiduguri however , with widespread outrage over the allegedly unlawful killing of mohammed yusuf , and religious and socio-political tensions still rife in the less-industrialized northern nigeria region , peace may be a complex and challenging goal to achieve .
some experts insist the riots are more rooted in socio-politics rather than religion , as a poor and frustrated population takes to violence against the government and its troops .
if that is the case , the tensions in the north may eventually spill over into larger southern regions , such as lagos and ibadan , whose inhabitants are also suffering economic hardships and can relate to the deep frustration with the nigerian leadership .
if the conflict becomes entrenched in the more industrialized southern regions , home to foreign and multi-national corporations , it could mean that the issue is no longer merely an internal matter .

western condemnation has been swift , but that seems to be the only reaction .
but what if the violence spills over to more vital regions of the country ? the latest violence in nigeria began late last month when gang members attacked a police station in bauchi , a city in north-eastern nigeria .
they were members of boko haram , a nigerian militant islamist group led by ustaz mohammed yusuf .
boko haram 's mission is to overthrow the nigerian state , impose an extreme interpretation of islamic law and abolish what they term as " western-style education . "
the attack was the result of the gang members ' outrage at the arrests of various gang leaders .
the ensuing clashes with nigerian security forces resulted in a bloodbath that lasted for day , leaving at least 700 people dead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nigerian military destroyed the headquarters of the radical islamist sect boko haram nigerian security forces then launched an offensive on the compound of the sect leader , mohammed yusuf .
troops shelled yusuf 's home after the leader and his followers barricaded themselves inside the building .
boko haram 's leader was eventually captured and later shot dead in allegedly controversial circumstances .
conspiracy theorists insist the sect leader was assassinated .
international reaction the riots have triggered alarm and a call to normalcy from the international community .
the eu issued a statement urging both sides to show restraint : " the european union expresses its deep concern over the recent violent developments in parts of northern nigeria , including attacks by militant groups known as boko haram .
the eu deplores the loss of life . "
" the eu recognizes the right and obligation of the government of nigeria to uphold peace and security within its territory .
however , the eu trusts that the authorities will show restraint in the use of force and respect human rights .
protection of the civilian population is essential .
the eu calls for a quick return to normalcy and will continue to closely follow the developments . "
the islamist group has become known as the “ taliban ” , although it shares no evident links with the taliban in afghanistan .
while there is widespread concern , the international community has largely remained passive , suggesting that this is viewed as an internal nigerian problem .

the latest reports have the hijackers demanding a ransom . finnish media on saturday said that a ransom demand had been received from the people who hijacked the freighter " arctic sea " .
according to the financial times deutschland , the hijackers have demanded a ransom of $ 1.5 million -lrb- 1.05 million euros -rrb- , but have not revealed the source of this information .
according to the well respected russian maritime journal sovfrakht , the ship 's automatic identification signal was turned on briefly , and sent a signal at 0830gmt on saturday august 15 before it went silent again .
over the weekend , reports had the freighter in the neighborhood of the cape verde islands off the west coast of africa , as well as in the bay of biscay near france .
a french navy spokesman jerome baroe dismissed the report that the " arctic sea " was off the coast of france and said it was most likely that the ship was headed for brazil .
mikhail boytenko , the editor of sovfrakht was of the opinion that there was something a lot more sinister going on .
" i do n't think that is was pirates who took this vessel but it really smells of some sort of state involvement .
this is real cloak and dagger stuff , like a le carre novel , " he said according to reuters .
russia 's ambassador to nato , dmitry rogozin , said that russia and nato were coordinating their efforts to locate the ship .
rumors about what is really going on with the ship continued to circulate .
theories range that this is some sort of russian organized crime dispute , to the fact that the ship may be carrying some sort of mystery cargo that could possibly be of a radioactive nature , or arms for terrorists .
on july 23 , the " arctic sea " set sail from finland carrying a cargo of lumber bound for algeria .
while sailing through the baltic sea off sweden in the early hours of the next morning , the ship was allegedly boarded by a band of up to a dozen men posing as swedish narcotics police .
currently there are about 20 countries looking for the ship and the russians are using a submarine , a naval vessel and " other means " to search for the " arctic sea " . av / dpa / reuters / afp / ap editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

western condemnation has been swift , but that seems to be the only reaction .
but what if the violence spills over to more vital regions of the country ? the latest violence in nigeria began late last month when gang members attacked a police station in bauchi , a city in north-eastern nigeria .
they were members of boko haram , a nigerian militant islamist group led by ustaz mohammed yusuf .
boko haram 's mission is to overthrow the nigerian state , impose an extreme interpretation of islamic law and abolish what they term as " western-style education . "
the attack was the result of the gang members ' outrage at the arrests of various gang leaders .
the ensuing clashes with nigerian security forces resulted in a bloodbath that lasted for day , leaving at least 700 people dead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nigerian military destroyed the headquarters of the radical islamist sect boko haram nigerian security forces then launched an offensive on the compound of the sect leader , mohammed yusuf .
troops shelled yusuf 's home after the leader and his followers barricaded themselves inside the building .
boko haram 's leader was eventually captured and later shot dead in allegedly controversial circumstances .
conspiracy theorists insist the sect leader was assassinated .
international reaction the riots have triggered alarm and a call to normalcy from the international community .
the eu issued a statement urging both sides to show restraint : " the european union expresses its deep concern over the recent violent developments in parts of northern nigeria , including attacks by militant groups known as boko haram .
the eu deplores the loss of life . "
" the eu recognizes the right and obligation of the government of nigeria to uphold peace and security within its territory .
however , the eu trusts that the authorities will show restraint in the use of force and respect human rights .
protection of the civilian population is essential .
the eu calls for a quick return to normalcy and will continue to closely follow the developments . "
the islamist group has become known as the “ taliban ” , although it shares no evident links with the taliban in afghanistan .
while there is widespread concern , the international community has largely remained passive , suggesting that this is viewed as an internal nigerian problem .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon also expressed his concern over the reports of sectarian violence .
his spokesperson , farhan haq , said the secretary-general " condemns the unnecessary loss of human life and the destruction of property as a result of militant attacks .
he hopes that those behind the attacks would be identified and brought to justice in accordance with the law . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary-general ban ki-moon has urged both sides to end the violence " the secretary-general calls upon the government of nigeria , law enforcement and security agencies , as well as religious and community leaders , to work together to address the underlying causes of the frequent religious clashes in nigeria so that a resolution could be found through dialogue , tolerance and understanding , " haq said .
amnesty set for action while both the un and eu have taken a largely conciliatory approach , the rhetoric coming from amnesty international was more forceful . franziska ulm of the german division of amnesty international told deutsche welle that " amnesty international condemns the killings in northern nigeria from both the armed militants and the security forces .
we are demanding the authorities install a commission which would undertake prosecution of the killings committed both by the armed militants and the security forces . "
" amnesty has several times documented killings by nigerian security forces without them being brought to justice , ” she added .
complexity of peace goal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aftermath of the violence in maiduguri however , with widespread outrage over the allegedly unlawful killing of mohammed yusuf , and religious and socio-political tensions still rife in the less-industrialized northern nigeria region , peace may be a complex and challenging goal to achieve .
some experts insist the riots are more rooted in socio-politics rather than religion , as a poor and frustrated population takes to violence against the government and its troops .
if that is the case , the tensions in the north may eventually spill over into larger southern regions , such as lagos and ibadan , whose inhabitants are also suffering economic hardships and can relate to the deep frustration with the nigerian leadership .
if the conflict becomes entrenched in the more industrialized southern regions , home to foreign and multi-national corporations , it could mean that the issue is no longer merely an internal matter .

" you -lrb- world powers -rrb- will be held accountable for this ballyhoo you made in the world , " the president said . tehran has several times accused the west of having provoked the mass protests against the government , and condemned western support for the dissidents . the june 12 election , which secured ahmadinejad 's re-election , plunged iran into its biggest internal crisis since the 1979 islamic revolution , exposed deepening divisions in its ruling elite and set off a wave of protests that left 26 people dead .

the eu has been singled out by iran for what it calls " meddling " in its state affairs and for the public criticism of its mass trial of moderates charged with spying and trying to topple the clerical establishment after the disputed president vote .

the latest reports have the hijackers demanding a ransom . finnish media on saturday said that a ransom demand had been received from the people who hijacked the freighter " arctic sea " .
according to the financial times deutschland , the hijackers have demanded a ransom of $ 1.5 million -lrb- 1.05 million euros -rrb- , but have not revealed the source of this information .
according to the well respected russian maritime journal sovfrakht , the ship 's automatic identification signal was turned on briefly , and sent a signal at 0830gmt on saturday august 15 before it went silent again .

this is real cloak and dagger stuff , like a le carre novel , " he said according to reuters .
russia 's ambassador to nato , dmitry rogozin , said that russia and nato were coordinating their efforts to locate the ship .
rumors about what is really going on with the ship continued to circulate .
theories range that this is some sort of russian organized crime dispute , to the fact that the ship may be carrying some sort of mystery cargo that could possibly be of a radioactive nature , or arms for terrorists .
on july 23 , the " arctic sea " set sail from finland carrying a cargo of lumber bound for algeria .
while sailing through the baltic sea off sweden in the early hours of the next morning , the ship was allegedly boarded by a band of up to a dozen men posing as swedish narcotics police .
currently there are about 20 countries looking for the ship and the russians are using a submarine , a naval vessel and " other means " to search for the " arctic sea " . av / dpa / reuters / afp / ap editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

western condemnation has been swift , but that seems to be the only reaction .
but what if the violence spills over to more vital regions of the country ? the latest violence in nigeria began late last month when gang members attacked a police station in bauchi , a city in north-eastern nigeria .
they were members of boko haram , a nigerian militant islamist group led by ustaz mohammed yusuf .
boko haram 's mission is to overthrow the nigerian state , impose an extreme interpretation of islamic law and abolish what they term as " western-style education . "
the attack was the result of the gang members ' outrage at the arrests of various gang leaders .
the ensuing clashes with nigerian security forces resulted in a bloodbath that lasted for day , leaving at least 700 people dead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nigerian military destroyed the headquarters of the radical islamist sect boko haram nigerian security forces then launched an offensive on the compound of the sect leader , mohammed yusuf .
troops shelled yusuf 's home after the leader and his followers barricaded themselves inside the building .
boko haram 's leader was eventually captured and later shot dead in allegedly controversial circumstances .
conspiracy theorists insist the sect leader was assassinated .
international reaction the riots have triggered alarm and a call to normalcy from the international community .
the eu issued a statement urging both sides to show restraint : " the european union expresses its deep concern over the recent violent developments in parts of northern nigeria , including attacks by militant groups known as boko haram .
the eu deplores the loss of life . "
" the eu recognizes the right and obligation of the government of nigeria to uphold peace and security within its territory .
however , the eu trusts that the authorities will show restraint in the use of force and respect human rights .
protection of the civilian population is essential .
the eu calls for a quick return to normalcy and will continue to closely follow the developments . "
the islamist group has become known as the “ taliban ” , although it shares no evident links with the taliban in afghanistan .
while there is widespread concern , the international community has largely remained passive , suggesting that this is viewed as an internal nigerian problem .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon also expressed his concern over the reports of sectarian violence .
his spokesperson , farhan haq , said the secretary-general " condemns the unnecessary loss of human life and the destruction of property as a result of militant attacks .
he hopes that those behind the attacks would be identified and brought to justice in accordance with the law . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary-general ban ki-moon has urged both sides to end the violence " the secretary-general calls upon the government of nigeria , law enforcement and security agencies , as well as religious and community leaders , to work together to address the underlying causes of the frequent religious clashes in nigeria so that a resolution could be found through dialogue , tolerance and understanding , " haq said .
amnesty set for action while both the un and eu have taken a largely conciliatory approach , the rhetoric coming from amnesty international was more forceful . franziska ulm of the german division of amnesty international told deutsche welle that " amnesty international condemns the killings in northern nigeria from both the armed militants and the security forces .
we are demanding the authorities install a commission which would undertake prosecution of the killings committed both by the armed militants and the security forces . "
" amnesty has several times documented killings by nigerian security forces without them being brought to justice , ” she added .
complexity of peace goal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aftermath of the violence in maiduguri however , with widespread outrage over the allegedly unlawful killing of mohammed yusuf , and religious and socio-political tensions still rife in the less-industrialized northern nigeria region , peace may be a complex and challenging goal to achieve .
some experts insist the riots are more rooted in socio-politics rather than religion , as a poor and frustrated population takes to violence against the government and its troops .
if that is the case , the tensions in the north may eventually spill over into larger southern regions , such as lagos and ibadan , whose inhabitants are also suffering economic hardships and can relate to the deep frustration with the nigerian leadership .
if the conflict becomes entrenched in the more industrialized southern regions , home to foreign and multi-national corporations , it could mean that the issue is no longer merely an internal matter .

rifleman daniel wild , from county durham , and capt mark hale went to his aid but were caught in a second blast .
capt hale died later of his injuries , but the other two died at the scene .
capt hale , 42 , and rifleman wild , 19 , were from 2nd battalion the rifles .
the details emerged as the men were named by the ministry of defence on saturday .
capt hale genuinely had an aura about him - it seems inconceivable that he has gone lt col rupert jones mbe the details were released hours before it was announced that another soldier had been killed in helmand , taking to 200 the number of uk personnel killed since the conflict in afghanistan began in 2001 .
nine have now been killed this month - 22 were killed in july - as troops aim to shore up security ahead of afghan elections on 20 august .
in thursday 's incident , lance bombardier hatton was among three men injured when an improvised explosive detonated .
they had been patrolling as part of an operation aimed at providing security for a pre-election shura , or meeting of elders .
capt hale and rifleman wild went to his aid and were carrying him to a helicopter landing zone when a second bomb went off .
lt col rupert jones mbe , commanding officer of 4 rifles , described capt hale , originally from bournemouth , as " a legend " .
" honourable , intelligent , utterly professional and loyal .
he has touched the lives of so many people over his 20-plus years ' service , " he said .

the details emerged as the men were named by the ministry of defence on saturday .
capt hale genuinely had an aura about him - it seems inconceivable that he has gone lt col rupert jones mbe the details were released hours before it was announced that another soldier had been killed in helmand , taking to 200 the number of uk personnel killed since the conflict in afghanistan began in 2001 .
nine have now been killed this month - 22 were killed in july - as troops aim to shore up security ahead of afghan elections on 20 august .
in thursday 's incident , lance bombardier hatton was among three men injured when an improvised explosive detonated .
they had been patrolling as part of an operation aimed at providing security for a pre-election shura , or meeting of elders .
capt hale and rifleman wild went to his aid and were carrying him to a helicopter landing zone when a second bomb went off .
lt col rupert jones mbe , commanding officer of 4 rifles , described capt hale , originally from bournemouth , as " a legend " .
" honourable , intelligent , utterly professional and loyal .
he has touched the lives of so many people over his 20-plus years ' service , " he said .
" he had that air of self-confidence , born of quality , which the very finest soldiers have .
" however , it is his wonderfully warm character that i will remember most , always a big smile on his face .
he genuinely had an aura about him .
it seems inconceivable that he has gone . "
' extraordinary burden ' lt col rob thomson mbe , of the rifles battlegroup , described rifleman wild , from easington in county durham , as a " fearless " soldier who died while carrying a wounded friend to safety .
" he has been fearless and his platoon adored him for it .
" he was smaller than most - smaller than everyone , if i am being honest - and when laden appeared to disappear under the extraordinary burden the boys all carry here .
" but rifleman wild carried his load lightly and was in no sense a ' small man ' .
in a land of metaphorical giants here in sangin , he was as tall as any of them , perhaps more so . "
lance bombardier hatton lived to excel in his chosen profession lt col owen adams in a family statement , the parents of lance bombardier hatton - jill and philip - said he had wanted to be a soldier from a young age .
" he passionately enjoyed his job and often talked fondly about his colleagues and friends , " it read .
" he was very brave and a credit to both us and the army .
we are really proud of him . "
lance bombardier hatton was a member of a fire support team , which is responsible for providing covering artillery fire .
his commanding officer , lt col owen adams , described him as a character who " stood out in a crowd " .
" he revelled in the bond that is commonplace amongst soldiers who serve in small teams across the army and he lived to excel in his chosen profession , " he said .
the ministry of defence has released no further details about capt hale .
the three soldiers were serving with the rifles battlegroup when they were killed .

rifleman daniel wild , from county durham , and capt mark hale went to his aid but were caught in a second blast .
capt hale died later of his injuries , but the other two died at the scene .
capt hale , 42 , and rifleman wild , 19 , were from 2nd battalion the rifles .
the details emerged as the men were named by the ministry of defence on saturday .
capt hale genuinely had an aura about him - it seems inconceivable that he has gone lt col rupert jones mbe the details were released hours before it was announced that another soldier had been killed in helmand , taking to 200 the number of uk personnel killed since the conflict in afghanistan began in 2001 .
nine have now been killed this month - 22 were killed in july - as troops aim to shore up security ahead of afghan elections on 20 august .
in thursday 's incident , lance bombardier hatton was among three men injured when an improvised explosive detonated .
they had been patrolling as part of an operation aimed at providing security for a pre-election shura , or meeting of elders .
capt hale and rifleman wild went to his aid and were carrying him to a helicopter landing zone when a second bomb went off .
lt col rupert jones mbe , commanding officer of 4 rifles , described capt hale , originally from bournemouth , as " a legend " .
" honourable , intelligent , utterly professional and loyal .
he has touched the lives of so many people over his 20-plus years ' service , " he said .

" he has been fearless and his platoon adored him for it .
" he was smaller than most - smaller than everyone , if i am being honest - and when laden appeared to disappear under the extraordinary burden the boys all carry here .

lance bombardier hatton lived to excel in his chosen profession lt col owen adams in a family statement , the parents of lance bombardier hatton - jill and philip - said he had wanted to be a soldier from a young age .
" he passionately enjoyed his job and often talked fondly about his colleagues and friends , " it read .
" he was very brave and a credit to both us and the army .
we are really proud of him . "
lance bombardier hatton was a member of a fire support team , which is responsible for providing covering artillery fire .
his commanding officer , lt col owen adams , described him as a character who " stood out in a crowd " .
" he revelled in the bond that is commonplace amongst soldiers who serve in small teams across the army and he lived to excel in his chosen profession , " he said .
