program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 17.07.2009 aldi advances on wal-mart 's home turf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with revenue dropping in germany , aldi is turing abroad for growth german discounting pioneer aldi is using the economic crisis to expand its presence in the us .
the move could help mitigate the company 's troubles on its home turf . it is something that has n't happened to aldi before : in the midst of a severe economic crisis germany 's discounting pioneer is faced with declining revenues in its home market .
according to data from research company gfk , aldi 's sales in germany declined by about five percent in the first five months of this year while the german retail sector as a whole shrank by only 2.2 percent .
it 's an entirely different story in the united states .
there , aldi is rapidly expanding its reach and expects to open 75 new stores this year .
the discount retailer entered the us market back in 1976 , but its no-frills concept only really started to take off in recent years .
" and of course the current economic crisis is really helping aldi to gain more customers , but is also making some changes in its concept " , explains matthias queck , senior discount analyst at market reseach firm planet retail .
for instance , aldi has added more fresh products , especially produce , to its range of products and has spruced up its stores to make them more attractive to new customers .
while older aldi stores where often located in less affluent neighborhoods , many new stores are located in areas that attract suburban and middle class shoppers as well .
low prices for high price markets aldi traditionally does n't release financial figures , but experts believe the german discount chain is doing quite well in the us and making significant inroads in the retail sector .
how then does aldi compete against us retail behemoth wal-mart on its home turf ?
it 's very simple , say the experts , the same way aldi and other german discounters forced wal-mart to shutter its doors in germany a couple of years ago : low prices and high quality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldi is taking on retail giant wal-mart on his home turf thomas roeb , a retail expert at the university of applied sciences rhine-sieg , argues that while wal-mart is considered a discounter in the us and has an image as a low-price retailer , its general pricing level is still fairly high .
in comparison to wal-mart aldi has a lower cost structure that allows it to become very successful in higher price markets like the united states . " however , the consumers so far did n't really believe in the value proposition of aldi and it is due to the economic crisis right now that people have started to try the concept . "
and , adds roeb , more and more americans give aldi 's no-frills concept a chance and actually find it attractive .
that 's because consumers realize that they can save money when shopping at aldi .
experts estimate that aldi 's prices are generally 10 to 15 percent lower than those of other national us retailers .
how does aldi do that ?
it keeps costs down with a limited range of products , smaller stores , fewer staff , and by not staying open as late as some of its competitors . it has also developed an efficient logistics system and most of the products that it sells are its own brand .
its sheer size allows it to get discounts by buying large quantities . too successful what can happen once aldi 's value proposition catches on in a big way , is evident in germany .
there , so-called " hard discounters " like aldi , account for more than 40 percent of the country 's retail sector .
the discount model has been so successful that aldi 's many competitors in germany are finally taking a bite out of its revenues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , aldi faces stiff competition from other discounters after decades of imitating aldi , says retail expert roeb , its german competitors have finally caught on .
" so it 's less aldi 's loss in the german market , it 's less that aldi is doing something wrong , but rather the fact that the competition is doing something right . "
that 's why aldi 's future growth will come mainly from abroad with the us being a prime target for expansion , argues discount expert queck : " just imagine that in the us , aldi has just 1,000 stores spread over 29 states , so that leaves a lot of room for further expansion . "
compare that with the roughly 1,700 stores that aldi sued , the part of the aldi company that manages its us operation , owns in southern and western germany alone and you can imagine the huge growth potential for the discounter in the us .
wal-mart dwarfs aldi despite aldi 's current advances in the us market , the question remains whether it can sustain its growth and customers once the economic malaise is over .
" i do believe that aldi is going to be successful even after the crisis , " says roeb .
" because we have had the same situation in germany and in some western european countries in the past .
everywhere aldi benefitted from economic crises to increase sales and consumers found the selection of products attractive so they found no need to switch back to their former supermarket . "
while aldi in the us with an estimated revenue of about seven billion dollars last year is tiny in comparison to wal-mart with its revenue of 375 billion dollars , the german discounter could challenge wal-mart in a specific segment - food .
wal-mart , says roeb is basically a non-food retailer that carries food as an important part , but not the main attraction of its product range .
" aldi however is a food specialist .
so when we are talking about competition between aldi and wal-mart , we are talking about competition in the field of food .
and i do believe that aldi is going to cause some problems for wal-mart in the future and even today in the area of food . "
that 's because , wal-mart 's image as a discounter in the food segment could be undercut by aldi 's value proposition .
and that , adds roeb , might end up having a negative impact on wal-mart 's public image . author : michael knigge editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's why aldi 's future growth will come mainly from abroad with the us being a prime target for expansion , argues discount expert queck : " just imagine that in the us , aldi has just 1,000 stores spread over 29 states , so that leaves a lot of room for further expansion . "
compare that with the roughly 1,700 stores that aldi sued , the part of the aldi company that manages its us operation , owns in southern and western germany alone and you can imagine the huge growth potential for the discounter in the us .
wal-mart dwarfs aldi despite aldi 's current advances in the us market , the question remains whether it can sustain its growth and customers once the economic malaise is over .
" i do believe that aldi is going to be successful even after the crisis , " says roeb .
" because we have had the same situation in germany and in some western european countries in the past .
everywhere aldi benefitted from economic crises to increase sales and consumers found the selection of products attractive so they found no need to switch back to their former supermarket . "
while aldi in the us with an estimated revenue of about seven billion dollars last year is tiny in comparison to wal-mart with its revenue of 375 billion dollars , the german discounter could challenge wal-mart in a specific segment - food .
wal-mart , says roeb is basically a non-food retailer that carries food as an important part , but not the main attraction of its product range .

the move could help mitigate the company 's troubles on its home turf . it is something that has n't happened to aldi before : in the midst of a severe economic crisis germany 's discounting pioneer is faced with declining revenues in its home market .
according to data from research company gfk , aldi 's sales in germany declined by about five percent in the first five months of this year while the german retail sector as a whole shrank by only 2.2 percent .
it 's an entirely different story in the united states .
there , aldi is rapidly expanding its reach and expects to open 75 new stores this year .
the discount retailer entered the us market back in 1976 , but its no-frills concept only really started to take off in recent years .
" and of course the current economic crisis is really helping aldi to gain more customers , but is also making some changes in its concept " , explains matthias queck , senior discount analyst at market reseach firm planet retail .
for instance , aldi has added more fresh products , especially produce , to its range of products and has spruced up its stores to make them more attractive to new customers .
while older aldi stores where often located in less affluent neighborhoods , many new stores are located in areas that attract suburban and middle class shoppers as well .
low prices for high price markets aldi traditionally does n't release financial figures , but experts believe the german discount chain is doing quite well in the us and making significant inroads in the retail sector .
how then does aldi compete against us retail behemoth wal-mart on its home turf ?
it 's very simple , say the experts , the same way aldi and other german discounters forced wal-mart to shutter its doors in germany a couple of years ago : low prices and high quality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldi is taking on retail giant wal-mart on his home turf thomas roeb , a retail expert at the university of applied sciences rhine-sieg , argues that while wal-mart is considered a discounter in the us and has an image as a low-price retailer , its general pricing level is still fairly high .
in comparison to wal-mart aldi has a lower cost structure that allows it to become very successful in higher price markets like the united states . " however , the consumers so far did n't really believe in the value proposition of aldi and it is due to the economic crisis right now that people have started to try the concept . "
and , adds roeb , more and more americans give aldi 's no-frills concept a chance and actually find it attractive .
that 's because consumers realize that they can save money when shopping at aldi .
experts estimate that aldi 's prices are generally 10 to 15 percent lower than those of other national us retailers .
how does aldi do that ?
it keeps costs down with a limited range of products , smaller stores , fewer staff , and by not staying open as late as some of its competitors . it has also developed an efficient logistics system and most of the products that it sells are its own brand .
its sheer size allows it to get discounts by buying large quantities . too successful what can happen once aldi 's value proposition catches on in a big way , is evident in germany .
there , so-called " hard discounters " like aldi , account for more than 40 percent of the country 's retail sector .
the discount model has been so successful that aldi 's many competitors in germany are finally taking a bite out of its revenues .

that 's because consumers realize that they can save money when shopping at aldi .
experts estimate that aldi 's prices are generally 10 to 15 percent lower than those of other national us retailers .
how does aldi do that ?
it keeps costs down with a limited range of products , smaller stores , fewer staff , and by not staying open as late as some of its competitors . it has also developed an efficient logistics system and most of the products that it sells are its own brand .
its sheer size allows it to get discounts by buying large quantities . too successful what can happen once aldi 's value proposition catches on in a big way , is evident in germany .
there , so-called " hard discounters " like aldi , account for more than 40 percent of the country 's retail sector .
the discount model has been so successful that aldi 's many competitors in germany are finally taking a bite out of its revenues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , aldi faces stiff competition from other discounters after decades of imitating aldi , says retail expert roeb , its german competitors have finally caught on .
" so it 's less aldi 's loss in the german market , it 's less that aldi is doing something wrong , but rather the fact that the competition is doing something right . "
that 's why aldi 's future growth will come mainly from abroad with the us being a prime target for expansion , argues discount expert queck : " just imagine that in the us , aldi has just 1,000 stores spread over 29 states , so that leaves a lot of room for further expansion . "
compare that with the roughly 1,700 stores that aldi sued , the part of the aldi company that manages its us operation , owns in southern and western germany alone and you can imagine the huge growth potential for the discounter in the us .
wal-mart dwarfs aldi despite aldi 's current advances in the us market , the question remains whether it can sustain its growth and customers once the economic malaise is over .
" i do believe that aldi is going to be successful even after the crisis , " says roeb .
" because we have had the same situation in germany and in some western european countries in the past .
everywhere aldi benefitted from economic crises to increase sales and consumers found the selection of products attractive so they found no need to switch back to their former supermarket . "
while aldi in the us with an estimated revenue of about seven billion dollars last year is tiny in comparison to wal-mart with its revenue of 375 billion dollars , the german discounter could challenge wal-mart in a specific segment - food .
wal-mart , says roeb is basically a non-food retailer that carries food as an important part , but not the main attraction of its product range .
" aldi however is a food specialist .
so when we are talking about competition between aldi and wal-mart , we are talking about competition in the field of food .
and i do believe that aldi is going to cause some problems for wal-mart in the future and even today in the area of food . "
that 's because , wal-mart 's image as a discounter in the food segment could be undercut by aldi 's value proposition .
and that , adds roeb , might end up having a negative impact on wal-mart 's public image . author : michael knigge editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" our passenger costs must fall , " lufthansa spokesperson claudia lange said in a statement , adding that details would be released in the coming weeks .
lufthansa staff were warned in a letter sent by the airline 's new chief executive christoph franz that higher fuel costs and falling passenger numbers posed a serious threat .
" this situation is forcing us to act , " franz wrote in the letter .
" air traffic is mired in the worst crisis in its history , " and the german carrier expected it to last longer than previously anticipated , he added .
the airline would reappraise all its operations , including " structures , projects and processes , " the new chief executive vowed .
after posting a first-quarter loss , lufthansa 's first-half results " will show that this negative trend is continuing , " franz said .
" unless market conditions change , our losses will increase significantly in the coming year owing especially to the rise in fuel prices .
" we must now make ever more determined efforts to counteract the trend , " he stressed , adding : " we have no other alternative but to resort to painful measures . "
analysts have expressed doubts about whether lufthansa can reach its cost-cutting target citing strong resistance from trade unions as one barrier .
the cockpit union which represents pilots has already objected to the airline 's cost-savings plans .
in mid-june , the carrier said slumping passenger and freight traffic would force it to take additional measures to avoid posting a full year loss .
analysts took this to mean job losses with forecasts predicting around 20 percent of the airline 's administrative passenger division being cut in the medium term .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science & technology -pipe- 17.07.2009 a face with wrinkles and blemishes : the moon is aging with dignity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people see a man in the moon the moon is more than 4 billion years old and people used to think there were large areas of water as well as lunar species .
but there are no settlements yet and the moon 's " seas " are bone dry . the earth 's satellite looks really old .
it 's turned completely grey and its face is marked with numerous wrinkles , stains and scars .
it 's visible : it 's been through a lot in its lifespan .
but given it 's been around for some 4 and a half billion years , the moon has aged with dignity .
getting a facelift is out of the question .
and it 's not even necessary – as every four weeks during the new moon phase , the moon is veiled in darkness and ca n't be spotted from earth .
we can see many big dark and lighter areas on the face of the moon .
this is due to the varied landscape on its surface .
some people see a face up there , others claim the pattern looks like a hopping rabbit .
at the time of astronomer galileo galilei , the first observers looking through their telescopes euphorically baptized the dark spots " maria " - the latin word for the seas .
they imagined huge bodies of water sloshing about what poets called the " watery planet " , and they imagined a very special lunar species living on the moon .
all that has become legend , and although astronomers still talk about " maria " , it 's quite clear that the moon is dry as a desert .
bildunterschrift : the near side of the moon looks rugged from ancient meteorite collisions just like an old bookshelf , the moon is covered in thick dust .
today , it has completely congealed .
however our celestial companion looks back at a very turbulent past .
in the first billion years of its existence , just like earth , it was exposed to a tremendous bombardment .
leftover debris from planet formation was abundant , and huge meteorites and whole asteroids were colliding with the surface .
even today , the numerous craters on the moon bear witness to the dramatic impact .
the biggest craters gradually filled up with liquid lava and welled up from what then was the hot liquid core of the moon .
so the dark spots on the moon are actually due to volcanic activity .
and the maria of the moon probably came about roughly 3 billion years ago .
that 's when the worst bombardment with space debris was over , which is why there are relatively few craters in the maria .
the lighter-coloured regions of the moon are called " terrae " , or more commonly just highlands , since they are higher than most maria .
the soil samples collected by the apollo space missions are evidence that once upon a time there was indeed volcanic activity on the moon .
it 's still unclear though how the lava reached the surface of the moon .
possibly it came up through cracks created by the impact of meteorites in the craters .
even the first scientists observing the moon have come up with colorful names for the maria , full of longing for the supposedly paradisiacal conditions on the moon : there are for instance , a sea of mirth , of nectar , of crisis , of clouds and also a ' mare fecunditiatis ' , or the sea of fertility .
bildunterschrift : the first men on the moon put an end to lunar tranquility however , the most well-known dark spot in the near side of the moon – the right eye in the moon 's face – is called mare tranquilitatis , or the sea of tranquillity .
that name is an obvious misconception because four and a half million years later the lunar peace has well and truly been disturbed .
on july 21 , 1969 , neil armstrong took his famous first step on the moon right in the sea of tranquillity .

but there are no settlements yet and the moon 's " seas " are bone dry . the earth 's satellite looks really old .
it 's turned completely grey and its face is marked with numerous wrinkles , stains and scars .
it 's visible : it 's been through a lot in its lifespan .
but given it 's been around for some 4 and a half billion years , the moon has aged with dignity .
getting a facelift is out of the question .
and it 's not even necessary – as every four weeks during the new moon phase , the moon is veiled in darkness and ca n't be spotted from earth .
we can see many big dark and lighter areas on the face of the moon .
this is due to the varied landscape on its surface .
some people see a face up there , others claim the pattern looks like a hopping rabbit .
at the time of astronomer galileo galilei , the first observers looking through their telescopes euphorically baptized the dark spots " maria " - the latin word for the seas .
they imagined huge bodies of water sloshing about what poets called the " watery planet " , and they imagined a very special lunar species living on the moon .
all that has become legend , and although astronomers still talk about " maria " , it 's quite clear that the moon is dry as a desert .
bildunterschrift : the near side of the moon looks rugged from ancient meteorite collisions just like an old bookshelf , the moon is covered in thick dust .
today , it has completely congealed .
however our celestial companion looks back at a very turbulent past .
in the first billion years of its existence , just like earth , it was exposed to a tremendous bombardment .
leftover debris from planet formation was abundant , and huge meteorites and whole asteroids were colliding with the surface .
even today , the numerous craters on the moon bear witness to the dramatic impact .
the biggest craters gradually filled up with liquid lava and welled up from what then was the hot liquid core of the moon .
so the dark spots on the moon are actually due to volcanic activity .
and the maria of the moon probably came about roughly 3 billion years ago .
that 's when the worst bombardment with space debris was over , which is why there are relatively few craters in the maria .
the lighter-coloured regions of the moon are called " terrae " , or more commonly just highlands , since they are higher than most maria .
the soil samples collected by the apollo space missions are evidence that once upon a time there was indeed volcanic activity on the moon .
it 's still unclear though how the lava reached the surface of the moon .
possibly it came up through cracks created by the impact of meteorites in the craters .
even the first scientists observing the moon have come up with colorful names for the maria , full of longing for the supposedly paradisiacal conditions on the moon : there are for instance , a sea of mirth , of nectar , of crisis , of clouds and also a ' mare fecunditiatis ' , or the sea of fertility .
bildunterschrift : the first men on the moon put an end to lunar tranquility however , the most well-known dark spot in the near side of the moon – the right eye in the moon 's face – is called mare tranquilitatis , or the sea of tranquillity .
that name is an obvious misconception because four and a half million years later the lunar peace has well and truly been disturbed .
on july 21 , 1969 , neil armstrong took his famous first step on the moon right in the sea of tranquillity .

that 's when the worst bombardment with space debris was over , which is why there are relatively few craters in the maria .
the lighter-coloured regions of the moon are called " terrae " , or more commonly just highlands , since they are higher than most maria .
the soil samples collected by the apollo space missions are evidence that once upon a time there was indeed volcanic activity on the moon .
it 's still unclear though how the lava reached the surface of the moon .
possibly it came up through cracks created by the impact of meteorites in the craters .
even the first scientists observing the moon have come up with colorful names for the maria , full of longing for the supposedly paradisiacal conditions on the moon : there are for instance , a sea of mirth , of nectar , of crisis , of clouds and also a ' mare fecunditiatis ' , or the sea of fertility .
bildunterschrift : the first men on the moon put an end to lunar tranquility however , the most well-known dark spot in the near side of the moon – the right eye in the moon 's face – is called mare tranquilitatis , or the sea of tranquillity .
that name is an obvious misconception because four and a half million years later the lunar peace has well and truly been disturbed .
on july 21 , 1969 , neil armstrong took his famous first step on the moon right in the sea of tranquillity .

the three claimed to have more videos of susanne klatten in trysts with a swiss gigolo . in june this year , the blackmailers had written to susanne klatten and threatened to sell recordings of her with helg sgarbi to the italian media if the mother of three did not hand over 800,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.1 million -rrb- and a bmw x5 luxury sports utility vehicle .
the bwm-heiress immediately contacted the authorities .
police in the northern german city of duisburg " pretended to be acquaintances contacting them on behalf of klatten , " said thomas steinkraus-koch , a spokesman for prosecutors in munich .
police arrived in the bmw x5 to " complete the deal " as agreed on wednesday .
the three men were immediately arrested .
police said two of the three men aged 33 to 46 have a criminal history involving fraud and narcotics .
police said they had started analyzing computers and other evidence but so far no videos had been found .
not the first copy-cat attempt this is not the first copy-cat attempt to extort germany 's richest woman .
a munich newspaper reported that in march this year , klatten had received a letter from someone claiming to be sgarbi 's prison inmate who had told him where the sex-videos were hidden .
he had " only " demanded 75,000 euros .
klatten did not hesitate to pass the letter on to the authorities .

44-year old swiss national helg sgarbi is currently serving a six-year prison term for blackmailing the billionairess . the former investment banker met klatten in a luxury hotel in tirol in 2007 and began an affair with her and methodically videoed their private meetings .
sgarbi has refused to provide the names of any accomplices , or say where he has hidden the videos and the seven million euros he received from klatten .
police do have a seven-minute video in their possession but have not said what is on it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 17.07.2009 little enthusiasm for " us-india 3.0 " in mumbai and delhi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indians are glad hillary clinton is touring india , but really hope for a visit by president obama soon hillary clinton is visiting india for the first time as us secretary of state .
india , which signed an historic nuclear deal with the us under president bush has felt somewhat neglected by the obama administration so far . secretary clinton has announced that us-india relations are entering a new era , which she has called " us-india 3.0 " .
this new phase of bilateral relations would come after a first phase full of mutual distrust during the cold war and a slow rapprochement process under presidents bill clinton and george w. bush .
in her council on foreign relations address in washington this week , clinton said her talks in mumbai and delhi would cover an unprecedentedly wide range of issues .
" we are delighted that our two countries will be engaging in a very broad , comprehensive dialogue .
we believe india has a tremendous opportunity and growing responsibility , which they acknowledge , to play not just a regional role , but a global one as well . "
pakistan is top regional issue the most important regional issue is considered to be pakistan .
india has generally been supportive of the obama administration 's so called afpak -lrb- afghanistan-pakistan -rrb- policies , says chintamani mahapatra , an expert in indo-us relations at delhi 's prestigious jawaharlal nehru university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : combatting islamists in pakistan is a common goal for the us and india but , he adds , there remains disagreement on some issues : " american interest is confined to making pakistan fight the taliban , who are anti-us , anti-west .
and lashkar-e-taiba and other groups of terrorists in pakistan who are fomenting problems in india , both in kashmir and elsewhere , are off the hook . "
india blames lashkar-e-taiba for the mumbai attacks that killed more than 170 people last november and has suspended the " composite dialogue " process with pakistan as a consequence .
however , at this week 's meeting between the two countries ' prime ministers in sharm-el-sheikh , the indian position seemed to have mellowed somewhat .
the us will surely be happy about this , as any indo-pakistani conflict would distract pakistan from fighting the taliban .
observers also expect clinton to try and convince delhi that the kashmir conflict needs more attention .
non-proliferation before leaving for india , the secretary of state also mentioned that she wanted to talk about nuclear non-proliferation .
a tricky affair , since india has never been officially acknowledged as a nuclear power and refuses to sign the non-proliferation treaty , which it regards as discriminatory .
clinton has signalled that the americans are ready to look for innovative solutions : " there is nothing easy about non-proliferation .
i mean , anybody who ever read strobe talbott 's book ‘ engaging india ' knows this is a very difficult issue . "
other difficult issues likely to crop up during clinton 's trip to india include climate change and the " doha round " global trade negotiations .
but clinton is also going to want to simply improve the mood in india .
buttering up the indians chintamani mahapatra says the country has felt neglected by the obama administration so far : " i think the obama administration has marginalized india for quite a few months now .
we understand why it did so because the foreign policy plate of obama was truly overflowing . "
but he adds that at a time when hillary clinton 's clout in the administration is openly questioned in the us , it is not likely that her visit alone will impress the indians .
" we know very well that hillary clinton 's position in the decision-making process in the us is not very strong . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh is expected in washington in september although she has the ear of the president and has taken many foreign policy initiatives , they have not been taken up by the white house , says mahapatra who already talks about a visit of president barack obama to india .
" our prime minister is going to visit the us in september , and he had extended an invitation to president obama .
hopefully , he will come to india not towards the end of his term , but in the middle of his term if he really wants to improve the relationship between the two countries . "
so while there might be no serious conflict between india and the united states right now , there also seems to be little enthusiasm about " us-india 3.0 " .

india , which signed an historic nuclear deal with the us under president bush has felt somewhat neglected by the obama administration so far . secretary clinton has announced that us-india relations are entering a new era , which she has called " us-india 3.0 " .
this new phase of bilateral relations would come after a first phase full of mutual distrust during the cold war and a slow rapprochement process under presidents bill clinton and george w. bush .
in her council on foreign relations address in washington this week , clinton said her talks in mumbai and delhi would cover an unprecedentedly wide range of issues .
" we are delighted that our two countries will be engaging in a very broad , comprehensive dialogue .
we believe india has a tremendous opportunity and growing responsibility , which they acknowledge , to play not just a regional role , but a global one as well . "
pakistan is top regional issue the most important regional issue is considered to be pakistan .
india has generally been supportive of the obama administration 's so called afpak -lrb- afghanistan-pakistan -rrb- policies , says chintamani mahapatra , an expert in indo-us relations at delhi 's prestigious jawaharlal nehru university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : combatting islamists in pakistan is a common goal for the us and india but , he adds , there remains disagreement on some issues : " american interest is confined to making pakistan fight the taliban , who are anti-us , anti-west .
and lashkar-e-taiba and other groups of terrorists in pakistan who are fomenting problems in india , both in kashmir and elsewhere , are off the hook . "
india blames lashkar-e-taiba for the mumbai attacks that killed more than 170 people last november and has suspended the " composite dialogue " process with pakistan as a consequence .
however , at this week 's meeting between the two countries ' prime ministers in sharm-el-sheikh , the indian position seemed to have mellowed somewhat .
the us will surely be happy about this , as any indo-pakistani conflict would distract pakistan from fighting the taliban .
observers also expect clinton to try and convince delhi that the kashmir conflict needs more attention .
non-proliferation before leaving for india , the secretary of state also mentioned that she wanted to talk about nuclear non-proliferation .
a tricky affair , since india has never been officially acknowledged as a nuclear power and refuses to sign the non-proliferation treaty , which it regards as discriminatory .
clinton has signalled that the americans are ready to look for innovative solutions : " there is nothing easy about non-proliferation .
i mean , anybody who ever read strobe talbott 's book ‘ engaging india ' knows this is a very difficult issue . "
other difficult issues likely to crop up during clinton 's trip to india include climate change and the " doha round " global trade negotiations .
but clinton is also going to want to simply improve the mood in india .
buttering up the indians chintamani mahapatra says the country has felt neglected by the obama administration so far : " i think the obama administration has marginalized india for quite a few months now .
we understand why it did so because the foreign policy plate of obama was truly overflowing . "
but he adds that at a time when hillary clinton 's clout in the administration is openly questioned in the us , it is not likely that her visit alone will impress the indians .
" we know very well that hillary clinton 's position in the decision-making process in the us is not very strong . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh is expected in washington in september although she has the ear of the president and has taken many foreign policy initiatives , they have not been taken up by the white house , says mahapatra who already talks about a visit of president barack obama to india .
" our prime minister is going to visit the us in september , and he had extended an invitation to president obama .
hopefully , he will come to india not towards the end of his term , but in the middle of his term if he really wants to improve the relationship between the two countries . "
so while there might be no serious conflict between india and the united states right now , there also seems to be little enthusiasm about " us-india 3.0 " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 17.07.2009 three arrested for blackmailing bmw billionairess großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne klatten is germany 's richest woman police in duisburg have arrested three men in a failed copy-cat attempt to extort germany 's richest woman .
the three claimed to have more videos of susanne klatten in trysts with a swiss gigolo . in june this year , the blackmailers had written to susanne klatten and threatened to sell recordings of her with helg sgarbi to the italian media if the mother of three did not hand over 800,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.1 million -rrb- and a bmw x5 luxury sports utility vehicle .
the bwm-heiress immediately contacted the authorities .
police in the northern german city of duisburg " pretended to be acquaintances contacting them on behalf of klatten , " said thomas steinkraus-koch , a spokesman for prosecutors in munich .
police arrived in the bmw x5 to " complete the deal " as agreed on wednesday .
the three men were immediately arrested .
police said two of the three men aged 33 to 46 have a criminal history involving fraud and narcotics .
police said they had started analyzing computers and other evidence but so far no videos had been found .
not the first copy-cat attempt this is not the first copy-cat attempt to extort germany 's richest woman .
a munich newspaper reported that in march this year , klatten had received a letter from someone claiming to be sgarbi 's prison inmate who had told him where the sex-videos were hidden .
he had " only " demanded 75,000 euros .
klatten did not hesitate to pass the letter on to the authorities .
" we have a 100 percent success rate in catching any would-be blackmailers , " warned steinkraus-koch .
44-year old swiss national helg sgarbi is currently serving a six-year prison term for blackmailing the billionairess . the former investment banker met klatten in a luxury hotel in tirol in 2007 and began an affair with her and methodically videoed their private meetings .
sgarbi has refused to provide the names of any accomplices , or say where he has hidden the videos and the seven million euros he received from klatten .
police do have a seven-minute video in their possession but have not said what is on it .
no other videos of klatten and sgarbi have ever been recovered .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 17.07.2009 aldi advances on wal-mart 's home turf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with revenue dropping in germany , aldi is turing abroad for growth german discounting pioneer aldi is using the economic crisis to expand its presence in the us .
the move could help mitigate the company 's troubles on its home turf . it is something that has n't happened to aldi before : in the midst of a severe economic crisis germany 's discounting pioneer is faced with declining revenues in its home market .
according to data from research company gfk , aldi 's sales in germany declined by about five percent in the first five months of this year while the german retail sector as a whole shrank by only 2.2 percent .
it 's an entirely different story in the united states .
there , aldi is rapidly expanding its reach and expects to open 75 new stores this year .
the discount retailer entered the us market back in 1976 , but its no-frills concept only really started to take off in recent years .
" and of course the current economic crisis is really helping aldi to gain more customers , but is also making some changes in its concept " , explains matthias queck , senior discount analyst at market reseach firm planet retail .
for instance , aldi has added more fresh products , especially produce , to its range of products and has spruced up its stores to make them more attractive to new customers .
while older aldi stores where often located in less affluent neighborhoods , many new stores are located in areas that attract suburban and middle class shoppers as well .
low prices for high price markets aldi traditionally does n't release financial figures , but experts believe the german discount chain is doing quite well in the us and making significant inroads in the retail sector .
how then does aldi compete against us retail behemoth wal-mart on its home turf ?
it 's very simple , say the experts , the same way aldi and other german discounters forced wal-mart to shutter its doors in germany a couple of years ago : low prices and high quality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldi is taking on retail giant wal-mart on his home turf thomas roeb , a retail expert at the university of applied sciences rhine-sieg , argues that while wal-mart is considered a discounter in the us and has an image as a low-price retailer , its general pricing level is still fairly high .
in comparison to wal-mart aldi has a lower cost structure that allows it to become very successful in higher price markets like the united states . " however , the consumers so far did n't really believe in the value proposition of aldi and it is due to the economic crisis right now that people have started to try the concept . "
and , adds roeb , more and more americans give aldi 's no-frills concept a chance and actually find it attractive .
that 's because consumers realize that they can save money when shopping at aldi .
experts estimate that aldi 's prices are generally 10 to 15 percent lower than those of other national us retailers .
how does aldi do that ?
it keeps costs down with a limited range of products , smaller stores , fewer staff , and by not staying open as late as some of its competitors . it has also developed an efficient logistics system and most of the products that it sells are its own brand .
its sheer size allows it to get discounts by buying large quantities . too successful what can happen once aldi 's value proposition catches on in a big way , is evident in germany .
there , so-called " hard discounters " like aldi , account for more than 40 percent of the country 's retail sector .
the discount model has been so successful that aldi 's many competitors in germany are finally taking a bite out of its revenues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , aldi faces stiff competition from other discounters after decades of imitating aldi , says retail expert roeb , its german competitors have finally caught on .
" so it 's less aldi 's loss in the german market , it 's less that aldi is doing something wrong , but rather the fact that the competition is doing something right . "
that 's why aldi 's future growth will come mainly from abroad with the us being a prime target for expansion , argues discount expert queck : " just imagine that in the us , aldi has just 1,000 stores spread over 29 states , so that leaves a lot of room for further expansion . "
compare that with the roughly 1,700 stores that aldi sued , the part of the aldi company that manages its us operation , owns in southern and western germany alone and you can imagine the huge growth potential for the discounter in the us .
wal-mart dwarfs aldi despite aldi 's current advances in the us market , the question remains whether it can sustain its growth and customers once the economic malaise is over .
" i do believe that aldi is going to be successful even after the crisis , " says roeb .
" because we have had the same situation in germany and in some western european countries in the past .
everywhere aldi benefitted from economic crises to increase sales and consumers found the selection of products attractive so they found no need to switch back to their former supermarket . "
while aldi in the us with an estimated revenue of about seven billion dollars last year is tiny in comparison to wal-mart with its revenue of 375 billion dollars , the german discounter could challenge wal-mart in a specific segment - food .
wal-mart , says roeb is basically a non-food retailer that carries food as an important part , but not the main attraction of its product range .
" aldi however is a food specialist .
so when we are talking about competition between aldi and wal-mart , we are talking about competition in the field of food .
and i do believe that aldi is going to cause some problems for wal-mart in the future and even today in the area of food . "
that 's because , wal-mart 's image as a discounter in the food segment could be undercut by aldi 's value proposition .
and that , adds roeb , might end up having a negative impact on wal-mart 's public image . author : michael knigge editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

health and public workers , as well as chronically ill people will get the flu shots first . the german health ministry announced on friday that an estimated quarter of germany 's population will be eligible to receive the flu shots .
this confirms reports earlier this week that the government had plans to order 50 million vaccine units against swine flu .
the vaccines will be available from september , to coincide with an expected surge in flu cases .
health state ministers late on thursday agreed that chronically ill patients , health care workers , police officers , fire fighters , public workers and pregnant women can receive the injections first .
two shots are needed for the vaccination to be effective against the -lrb- a -rrb- h1n1 virus .
" the vaccinations are a precautionary measure , " said health ministry spokesman , klaus vater .
" no one can tell how the new virus will develop in the coming weeks . "
despite the priority immunization list , federal health minister ulla schmidt insists that everyone who wants to be vaccinated against swine flu , will be able to do so .
protecting the entire population is expected to cost health insurers an estimated two billion euros .
around 800 infections - none fatal - have been reported in germany .
that 's the third-highest number in europe after britain and spain .
berlin has not said when the remaining population can be vaccinated .
this largely depends on how fast pharmaceutical companies can produce the vaccine .
the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- said up to 4.9 billion doses could be produced in 12 months . the un health body has meanwhile announced that it was no longer counting individual cases of swine flu .
it said the virus is spreading so fast , it can not keep up with all the figures and is now asking national health authorities to only report clusters of severe cases , deaths caused by the new virus , or unusual clinical patterns. wl / reuters / dpa / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german media quotes piepenburg as saying that plans to revive the company were not on a solid foundation and that there was no support from arcandor 's main shareholder sal .
oppenheim jr .
cie .
piepenburg 's departure increases the odds that arcandor 's ailing department store chain karstadt as well as its troubled mail order business primondo will be sold off in parts .
arcandor also holds 53 percent of uk travel retailer thomas cook , and it is now believed that creditors will become more aggressive in seeking to acquire a stake in cook which was used as collateral with a group of eight lenders last last year .
the departure of piepenburg is also a setback for karl-gerhard eick , arcandor 's chief executive , who wants to keep the three companies together .
but he remains optimistic .
" until the middle of august , i will welcome every opportunity for investors to implement a recovery plan , to save arcandor ag and its jobs , " eick was quoted as saying in german media .
last month , while the government refused to help out arcandor , another of arcandor 's troubled firms , mail-order retailer quelle , received government loan guarantees to the tune of 50 million euros from the german state of bavaria which allowed it to pay its bills and keep operating. av / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hossein shariatmadari , editor-in-chief of the kayhan daily , said rafsanjani , a moderate who backed mousavi 's election campaign , had done nothing to prevent the gathering of mousavi supporters inside and outside tehran university , where prayers are held each friday and broadcast live on state radio .
in his first friday sermon since the controversial vote , rafsanjani criticized the way authorities in iran had handled the poll and said large numbers of iranians doubted the results of the election .
" in the current situation it is not necessary for us to have a number of people in prisons ... we should allow them to return to their families , " he said in the sermon at tehran university , broadcast live on state radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafsanjani is considered a key power-broker in iranian politics " we are all members of a family .
i hope with this sermon we can pass through this period of hardships that can be called a crisis , " rafsanjani said .
large opposition rally in tehran his sermon was marked by a large opposition rally in the streets outside the university - the first such demonstration for more than a week .
many protestors were reported to be wearing green bands to indicate support for opposition leader and defeated election candidate mir hossein mousavi .
news agency reuters said some were heard chanting " death to the dictator " and " ahmadinejad , resign , resign . "
the agency also quoted an unidentified witness saying police had fired tear gas and beat up mousavi supporters .
rafsanjani is a backer of mousavi who has demanded a re-run of the vote and described the new government as illegitimate .
cleric slams security crackdown rafsanjani , who heads the powerful assembly of experts and is an influential cleric , also appealed for an open debate on radio and television about the disputed 12 june election and called for media restrictions to be eased .
" it is not necessary to pressure media .
we should allow them to work freely within the law , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a protestor at the opposition rally in tehran on friday although rafsanjani stayed silent during the unrest that followed the election , members of his family - including his daughter faezeh - openly supported mousavi .
rafsanjani , who was a close aide to iran 's late revolutionary founder ayatollah ruhollah khomeini , also condemned the security crackdown on demonstrators .
" we knew what imam khomeini wanted .
he did n't want the use of terror or arms , even in fights -lrb- for the revolution -rrb- . "
rafsanjani 's remarks are seen as a challenge to supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei , who has upheld the election result and accused foreign powers of fuelling the unrest .
violent street protests broke out in iran last month , as news of president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's victory was met with accusations of fraud and vote-rigging .

health and public workers , as well as chronically ill people will get the flu shots first . the german health ministry announced on friday that an estimated quarter of germany 's population will be eligible to receive the flu shots .
this confirms reports earlier this week that the government had plans to order 50 million vaccine units against swine flu .
the vaccines will be available from september , to coincide with an expected surge in flu cases .
health state ministers late on thursday agreed that chronically ill patients , health care workers , police officers , fire fighters , public workers and pregnant women can receive the injections first .
two shots are needed for the vaccination to be effective against the -lrb- a -rrb- h1n1 virus .
" the vaccinations are a precautionary measure , " said health ministry spokesman , klaus vater .
" no one can tell how the new virus will develop in the coming weeks . "
despite the priority immunization list , federal health minister ulla schmidt insists that everyone who wants to be vaccinated against swine flu , will be able to do so .
protecting the entire population is expected to cost health insurers an estimated two billion euros .
around 800 infections - none fatal - have been reported in germany .
that 's the third-highest number in europe after britain and spain .
berlin has not said when the remaining population can be vaccinated .
this largely depends on how fast pharmaceutical companies can produce the vaccine .
the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- said up to 4.9 billion doses could be produced in 12 months . the un health body has meanwhile announced that it was no longer counting individual cases of swine flu .
it said the virus is spreading so fast , it can not keep up with all the figures and is now asking national health authorities to only report clusters of severe cases , deaths caused by the new virus , or unusual clinical patterns. wl / reuters / dpa / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it all started back in october 2006 when pyongyang tested a nuclear device , causing the members of the united nations security council -lrb- unsc -rrb- to issue unsc resolution 1718 , which put sanctions on trade in major weapons system , all products related to the production of weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- , and luxury goods .
but instead of convincing north korea to back off , it actually incited them to try harder ; a point that was proved when they launched a multi-stage rocket on april 5 of this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea 's explosion of a nuclear device on may 25 triggered protests in the south the newest sanctions imposed by the unsc panel on pyongyang for exploding a nuclear device on may 25 , which is completely binding for all member states , is a little bit different in that they focus not on the government as a whole , but rather on individuals and economic entities .
the list includes five companies , including one based in iran , and five north koreans .
the 15-nation council 's panel also banned two goods to be imported by north korea : graphite designed or specified for use in electrical discharge machining -lrb- edm -rrb- machines and para-aramid fiber - commonly known as kevlar - filament and tape .
the panel imposed a freeze of assets belonging to namchongang trading company , hong kong electronics , korea hyoksin trading corporation , general bureau of atomic energy and korean tangun trading corporation .
the five north koreans are : yun ho-jin , director of namchongang trading ; ri je-son and hwang suk-hwa , both directors of separate departments in the general bureau of atomic energy ; rihong-sop , former director of yongbyon nuclear research centre ; han yu-ro , director of korea ryongaksan general trading corporation .
the individuals ' assets will be frozen and they will be banned from travelling abroad .
smart sanctions according to professor michael brzoska , director of the institute for peace research and security policy at the university of hamburg , sanctions against north korea have been changed several times , but the main goal has always been to tighten the screws , particularly on the leadership , without harming the population too much .
the idea is to make life difficult for north korean president kim jong-il and those around him , as well as to limit the possibilities for state institutions , particularly in the financial field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea has been very secretive about the health of the country 's leader kim jong-il using these so-called smart sanctions to target individuals rather than entire governments is n't new ; since the early 1990s the unsc decided to try and influence the behavior of decision makers without harming the general population .
the first cases were iraq and the former yugoslavia , says brzoska , and since then there have been others , adding that the success of these actions has been very mixed .
in angola , for example , the unita rebel movement was targeted in this way and , in the end , lost the war to the government .
in liberia , where former president charles taylor , who is now at the international court of justice in the hague , became a target and that was successful in limiting his possibilities to buy arms and to pay his soldiers .
" one could also argue that in libya sanctions that harmed the leadership by making it more difficult to fly and to have money available for investment in the oil industry also helped to bring about change there .
but there are a lot of other cases where these types of smart sanctions did not have much effect , like in iran , the ivory coast or sierra leone , " says brzoska .
the china question the key to any of these sanctions being successful has always been how inclined the chinese government is to enforce them .
china is north korea 's only ally in the region , if not the world , and they have been reluctant to put pressure on pyongyang in the past .
this is mostly due to the fact that beijing uses its relationship with north korea - and the ability to bring kim jong-il to the negotiating table - to bargain with both japan and the united states , says dr. patrick koellner , acting head of the institute of asian affairs at the german institute of global and area studies .
according to koellner , china , which holds a permanent position on the security council , has the ability to bring north korea to its knees .
simply by cutting of supplies of energy and food and freezing the assets of north korean leaders , kim 's regime would have no choice but to surrender to any demands the un had of it .
however , unlike the japanese and the americans , the chinese actually have a vested financial interest in the sound future of north korea .
according to a report by the council on foreign relations , chinese trade and investment in north korea now totals $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.4 billion euros -rrb- a year . bildunterschrift : since the korean war the border between the two nations has been heavily guarded enforcement while complete chinese cooperation would make things a whole lot faster , it is n't required to put pressure on north korea .
stephan haggard and marcus noland from the peterson institute for international economics argue in a recently published report that the most interesting features of the resolution have to do with means of enforcement .
the resolution calls upon member states to inspect vessels on the high seas or escort them to port if they have reasonable grounds to believe that they are carrying prohibited cargo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any vessel heading into north korean waters suspected of carrying contraban is subject to a search however , there is a loophole in the wording , in order to intercept a ship , the country under which the vessel is flagged must give permission .
according to haggard and noland , this could provide incentives for north korea to do more shipping under its own flag ; though that is doubtful given the country 's standing in the international community .
many ships , regardless of their country of origin , sail under the auspices of countries such as liberia and panama - countries where fees , taxes , regulations , and laws protecting seafarers are often minimal or non-existent .
that means that these nations will be under more and more pressure to allow these ships to be searched , leaving north korea no choice but to use its own flag ; though this causes its own potential drama as north korea has stated in no uncertain terms that it would view such action as an act of war .

smart sanctions according to professor michael brzoska , director of the institute for peace research and security policy at the university of hamburg , sanctions against north korea have been changed several times , but the main goal has always been to tighten the screws , particularly on the leadership , without harming the population too much .
the idea is to make life difficult for north korean president kim jong-il and those around him , as well as to limit the possibilities for state institutions , particularly in the financial field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea has been very secretive about the health of the country 's leader kim jong-il using these so-called smart sanctions to target individuals rather than entire governments is n't new ; since the early 1990s the unsc decided to try and influence the behavior of decision makers without harming the general population .
the first cases were iraq and the former yugoslavia , says brzoska , and since then there have been others , adding that the success of these actions has been very mixed .
in angola , for example , the unita rebel movement was targeted in this way and , in the end , lost the war to the government .
in liberia , where former president charles taylor , who is now at the international court of justice in the hague , became a target and that was successful in limiting his possibilities to buy arms and to pay his soldiers .
" one could also argue that in libya sanctions that harmed the leadership by making it more difficult to fly and to have money available for investment in the oil industry also helped to bring about change there .
but there are a lot of other cases where these types of smart sanctions did not have much effect , like in iran , the ivory coast or sierra leone , " says brzoska .
the china question the key to any of these sanctions being successful has always been how inclined the chinese government is to enforce them .
china is north korea 's only ally in the region , if not the world , and they have been reluctant to put pressure on pyongyang in the past .
this is mostly due to the fact that beijing uses its relationship with north korea - and the ability to bring kim jong-il to the negotiating table - to bargain with both japan and the united states , says dr. patrick koellner , acting head of the institute of asian affairs at the german institute of global and area studies .
according to koellner , china , which holds a permanent position on the security council , has the ability to bring north korea to its knees .
simply by cutting of supplies of energy and food and freezing the assets of north korean leaders , kim 's regime would have no choice but to surrender to any demands the un had of it .
however , unlike the japanese and the americans , the chinese actually have a vested financial interest in the sound future of north korea .
according to a report by the council on foreign relations , chinese trade and investment in north korea now totals $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.4 billion euros -rrb- a year . bildunterschrift : since the korean war the border between the two nations has been heavily guarded enforcement while complete chinese cooperation would make things a whole lot faster , it is n't required to put pressure on north korea .
stephan haggard and marcus noland from the peterson institute for international economics argue in a recently published report that the most interesting features of the resolution have to do with means of enforcement .
the resolution calls upon member states to inspect vessels on the high seas or escort them to port if they have reasonable grounds to believe that they are carrying prohibited cargo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any vessel heading into north korean waters suspected of carrying contraban is subject to a search however , there is a loophole in the wording , in order to intercept a ship , the country under which the vessel is flagged must give permission .
according to haggard and noland , this could provide incentives for north korea to do more shipping under its own flag ; though that is doubtful given the country 's standing in the international community .
many ships , regardless of their country of origin , sail under the auspices of countries such as liberia and panama - countries where fees , taxes , regulations , and laws protecting seafarers are often minimal or non-existent .
that means that these nations will be under more and more pressure to allow these ships to be searched , leaving north korea no choice but to use its own flag ; though this causes its own potential drama as north korea has stated in no uncertain terms that it would view such action as an act of war .

it all started back in october 2006 when pyongyang tested a nuclear device , causing the members of the united nations security council -lrb- unsc -rrb- to issue unsc resolution 1718 , which put sanctions on trade in major weapons system , all products related to the production of weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- , and luxury goods .
but instead of convincing north korea to back off , it actually incited them to try harder ; a point that was proved when they launched a multi-stage rocket on april 5 of this year .

the list includes five companies , including one based in iran , and five north koreans .
the 15-nation council 's panel also banned two goods to be imported by north korea : graphite designed or specified for use in electrical discharge machining -lrb- edm -rrb- machines and para-aramid fiber - commonly known as kevlar - filament and tape .
the panel imposed a freeze of assets belonging to namchongang trading company , hong kong electronics , korea hyoksin trading corporation , general bureau of atomic energy and korean tangun trading corporation .
the five north koreans are : yun ho-jin , director of namchongang trading ; ri je-son and hwang suk-hwa , both directors of separate departments in the general bureau of atomic energy ; rihong-sop , former director of yongbyon nuclear research centre ; han yu-ro , director of korea ryongaksan general trading corporation .

he 's among the first german designers to head east , but he wo n't be the last . " china is the most exciting market for fashion right now , " enthuses michael michalsky , the darling of the recent berlin fashion week . " the chinese are really open to fashion , and let 's face it , the future of the world lies in this region , " he says as he reflects on his deal to develop a range of sportswear for the china dongxiang group .
the michalsky label might not yet be in the same league as karl lagerfeld , hugo boss or joop ! , but its namesake has always been ahead of the pack .
" i like to do things differently and i like to be the first , " he says .
" i was the first designer to move to berlin and do major shows here even before it was really on the map .
it 's part of my own nature and the character of both my company and my brand . "
shifting focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael michalsky is pushing fashion 's frontiers in these economically troubled times , thinking outside the box can make all the difference - and michael michalsky has broken with decades of fashion tradition by setting his sights on beijing and shanghai rather than paris and milan .
at the high-end of the industry , he 's one of the first to have woken up to china 's potential as more than a market for established western brands such as louis vuitton , cartier and bmw .
earlier this year , the new york times stated the obvious when it reported that china is now the world 's fastest-growing luxury market , with an estimated $ 7.6 billion in sales in 2008 .
michalsky , in the meantime , had cottoned on to a different , more significant growth - that of the domestic market .
although its love affair with imported luxury is still going strong , china is increasingly fed up being merely a production site for other countries and the home of cheap knock-offs .
these days , it 's keen to foster indigenous brands and to meet its consumer needs under its own steam .
" the domestic chinese market is expanding rapidly , " confirms rené lang , president of the association of german fashion and textile designers .
" until now , china has been known first and foremost as a supplier , but now it has greater spending power , despite the crisis , and there are some very well trained designers and fashion schools .
but they are still in a phase where they tend to rely on foreign help expertise . "
enter michalsky .
after eleven years as global creative director at adidas , he founded his own label in 2006 and his ' real clothes for real people ' approach has done much to establish berlin as an up and coming fashion capital where style reflects the street more than the catwalk . nonetheless , the michalsky label has n't yet managed to turn a profit .
in that respect , it 's in the same boat as many ailing brands .
but while hard-up veteran french labels such as lacroix are busy nursing their wounds and sulkily blaming bankruptcy on the global financial crisis , michael michalsky - like the brave young rookie he is - wasted no time identifying markets not feeling the pinch of recession quite so harshly .
traditional brands might turn their noses up at china , but where others see only a low-end market , the german designer sees real potential : " the dongxiang group is very successful locally , and the company is now looking to expand internationally , " he says .
" to begin with , the line will only be available in china because that 's where they have their own stores , but they 're planning to expand across asia and i do n't see what 's to stop them ending up in other markets futher afield . "
" china is in a transitional phase right now , it 's moving away from imported goods towards home-grown products , " agrees rené lang .
" there 's a burgeoning desire for a more personal cultural identity attached to goods that have been specially produced for the chinese market . "
hot on the heels of jil sander bildunterschrift : jil sander 's clothes are elegant and austere - and big in japan in heading east , michalsky is following in the footsteps of only one other german designer .
in march , jil sander raised eyebrows from madison avenue to avenue montaigne when she teamed up with japanese budget clothing retailer uniqlo .
the company sells $ 30 jeans and $ 15 parkas , and is one of the few companies still thriving despite japan 's recession .
" the challenge for me is to establish premium quality and democratically priced brand uniqlo , " she told reporters in tokyo in spring .
similarly , michalsky showed that he 's not too proud to take his talents wherever they 're most wanted when he launched his mitch & co range for tchibo , a german range of coffee shops that also sells clothing , household items , electronics and electrical appliances .
the collection flopped , but the tie-up helped make michalsky a household name .
unlike many designers , he 's just not that precious .
as far as china is concerned , he shrugs off the qualms some of his colleagues might have about poor working conditions .
" i have n't yet been to any of the dongxiang factories , " he says .
" i 've been to the headquarters and it 's a very modern company and very european in its thinking .
in fact , the chinese factories i 've visited in their past when i was still with my former employer , were surprisingly modern and conditions were good .
they were no different to places i 've visited in italy .
i think conditions have improved a lot . "
image boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are conditions improving in the chinese textile industry ?
rené lang says the same .
" we need to get way from the idea of cheap china , " he stresses .
" standards are changing fast and there 's a growing interest in organic textiles , sustainability and better working conditions .
the situation will inevitably improve the more money starts circulating in the market .
china is trying to shed its bad image . "
as a designer , michalsky has often demonstrated a social conscience , referencing world affairs in his shows with comments on issues such as the hypocrisy of left-wing intellectuals , the tyranny of capitalism and the profligacy of wall street .
but with the ink still drying on his latest deal , he 's reluctant to consider the political or economic ramifications of his move into china .
" my message is simply that we are all living in one world and that 's why i wanted to do something in this part of the globe , " he sums up .
" i understand that young people are influenced by the same things all over the world , and i think that 's why i got the job . "

he 's among the first german designers to head east , but he wo n't be the last . " china is the most exciting market for fashion right now , " enthuses michael michalsky , the darling of the recent berlin fashion week . " the chinese are really open to fashion , and let 's face it , the future of the world lies in this region , " he says as he reflects on his deal to develop a range of sportswear for the china dongxiang group .
the michalsky label might not yet be in the same league as karl lagerfeld , hugo boss or joop ! , but its namesake has always been ahead of the pack .
" i like to do things differently and i like to be the first , " he says .
" i was the first designer to move to berlin and do major shows here even before it was really on the map .
it 's part of my own nature and the character of both my company and my brand . "
shifting focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael michalsky is pushing fashion 's frontiers in these economically troubled times , thinking outside the box can make all the difference - and michael michalsky has broken with decades of fashion tradition by setting his sights on beijing and shanghai rather than paris and milan .
at the high-end of the industry , he 's one of the first to have woken up to china 's potential as more than a market for established western brands such as louis vuitton , cartier and bmw .
earlier this year , the new york times stated the obvious when it reported that china is now the world 's fastest-growing luxury market , with an estimated $ 7.6 billion in sales in 2008 .
michalsky , in the meantime , had cottoned on to a different , more significant growth - that of the domestic market .
although its love affair with imported luxury is still going strong , china is increasingly fed up being merely a production site for other countries and the home of cheap knock-offs .
these days , it 's keen to foster indigenous brands and to meet its consumer needs under its own steam .
" the domestic chinese market is expanding rapidly , " confirms rené lang , president of the association of german fashion and textile designers .
" until now , china has been known first and foremost as a supplier , but now it has greater spending power , despite the crisis , and there are some very well trained designers and fashion schools .
but they are still in a phase where they tend to rely on foreign help expertise . "
enter michalsky .
after eleven years as global creative director at adidas , he founded his own label in 2006 and his ' real clothes for real people ' approach has done much to establish berlin as an up and coming fashion capital where style reflects the street more than the catwalk . nonetheless , the michalsky label has n't yet managed to turn a profit .
in that respect , it 's in the same boat as many ailing brands .
but while hard-up veteran french labels such as lacroix are busy nursing their wounds and sulkily blaming bankruptcy on the global financial crisis , michael michalsky - like the brave young rookie he is - wasted no time identifying markets not feeling the pinch of recession quite so harshly .
traditional brands might turn their noses up at china , but where others see only a low-end market , the german designer sees real potential : " the dongxiang group is very successful locally , and the company is now looking to expand internationally , " he says .
" to begin with , the line will only be available in china because that 's where they have their own stores , but they 're planning to expand across asia and i do n't see what 's to stop them ending up in other markets futher afield . "
" china is in a transitional phase right now , it 's moving away from imported goods towards home-grown products , " agrees rené lang .
" there 's a burgeoning desire for a more personal cultural identity attached to goods that have been specially produced for the chinese market . "
hot on the heels of jil sander bildunterschrift : jil sander 's clothes are elegant and austere - and big in japan in heading east , michalsky is following in the footsteps of only one other german designer .
in march , jil sander raised eyebrows from madison avenue to avenue montaigne when she teamed up with japanese budget clothing retailer uniqlo .
the company sells $ 30 jeans and $ 15 parkas , and is one of the few companies still thriving despite japan 's recession .
" the challenge for me is to establish premium quality and democratically priced brand uniqlo , " she told reporters in tokyo in spring .
similarly , michalsky showed that he 's not too proud to take his talents wherever they 're most wanted when he launched his mitch & co range for tchibo , a german range of coffee shops that also sells clothing , household items , electronics and electrical appliances .
the collection flopped , but the tie-up helped make michalsky a household name .
unlike many designers , he 's just not that precious .
as far as china is concerned , he shrugs off the qualms some of his colleagues might have about poor working conditions .
" i have n't yet been to any of the dongxiang factories , " he says .
" i 've been to the headquarters and it 's a very modern company and very european in its thinking .
in fact , the chinese factories i 've visited in their past when i was still with my former employer , were surprisingly modern and conditions were good .
they were no different to places i 've visited in italy .
i think conditions have improved a lot . "
image boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are conditions improving in the chinese textile industry ?
rené lang says the same .
" we need to get way from the idea of cheap china , " he stresses .
" standards are changing fast and there 's a growing interest in organic textiles , sustainability and better working conditions .
the situation will inevitably improve the more money starts circulating in the market .
china is trying to shed its bad image . "
as a designer , michalsky has often demonstrated a social conscience , referencing world affairs in his shows with comments on issues such as the hypocrisy of left-wing intellectuals , the tyranny of capitalism and the profligacy of wall street .
but with the ink still drying on his latest deal , he 's reluctant to consider the political or economic ramifications of his move into china .
" my message is simply that we are all living in one world and that 's why i wanted to do something in this part of the globe , " he sums up .
" i understand that young people are influenced by the same things all over the world , and i think that 's why i got the job . "

shifting focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael michalsky is pushing fashion 's frontiers in these economically troubled times , thinking outside the box can make all the difference - and michael michalsky has broken with decades of fashion tradition by setting his sights on beijing and shanghai rather than paris and milan .
at the high-end of the industry , he 's one of the first to have woken up to china 's potential as more than a market for established western brands such as louis vuitton , cartier and bmw .
earlier this year , the new york times stated the obvious when it reported that china is now the world 's fastest-growing luxury market , with an estimated $ 7.6 billion in sales in 2008 .
michalsky , in the meantime , had cottoned on to a different , more significant growth - that of the domestic market .
although its love affair with imported luxury is still going strong , china is increasingly fed up being merely a production site for other countries and the home of cheap knock-offs .
these days , it 's keen to foster indigenous brands and to meet its consumer needs under its own steam .
" the domestic chinese market is expanding rapidly , " confirms rené lang , president of the association of german fashion and textile designers .
" until now , china has been known first and foremost as a supplier , but now it has greater spending power , despite the crisis , and there are some very well trained designers and fashion schools .
but they are still in a phase where they tend to rely on foreign help expertise . "
enter michalsky .
after eleven years as global creative director at adidas , he founded his own label in 2006 and his ' real clothes for real people ' approach has done much to establish berlin as an up and coming fashion capital where style reflects the street more than the catwalk . nonetheless , the michalsky label has n't yet managed to turn a profit .
in that respect , it 's in the same boat as many ailing brands .
but while hard-up veteran french labels such as lacroix are busy nursing their wounds and sulkily blaming bankruptcy on the global financial crisis , michael michalsky - like the brave young rookie he is - wasted no time identifying markets not feeling the pinch of recession quite so harshly .
traditional brands might turn their noses up at china , but where others see only a low-end market , the german designer sees real potential : " the dongxiang group is very successful locally , and the company is now looking to expand internationally , " he says .
" to begin with , the line will only be available in china because that 's where they have their own stores , but they 're planning to expand across asia and i do n't see what 's to stop them ending up in other markets futher afield . "
" china is in a transitional phase right now , it 's moving away from imported goods towards home-grown products , " agrees rené lang .
" there 's a burgeoning desire for a more personal cultural identity attached to goods that have been specially produced for the chinese market . "
hot on the heels of jil sander bildunterschrift : jil sander 's clothes are elegant and austere - and big in japan in heading east , michalsky is following in the footsteps of only one other german designer .
in march , jil sander raised eyebrows from madison avenue to avenue montaigne when she teamed up with japanese budget clothing retailer uniqlo .
the company sells $ 30 jeans and $ 15 parkas , and is one of the few companies still thriving despite japan 's recession .
" the challenge for me is to establish premium quality and democratically priced brand uniqlo , " she told reporters in tokyo in spring .
similarly , michalsky showed that he 's not too proud to take his talents wherever they 're most wanted when he launched his mitch & co range for tchibo , a german range of coffee shops that also sells clothing , household items , electronics and electrical appliances .
the collection flopped , but the tie-up helped make michalsky a household name .
unlike many designers , he 's just not that precious .
as far as china is concerned , he shrugs off the qualms some of his colleagues might have about poor working conditions .
" i have n't yet been to any of the dongxiang factories , " he says .
" i 've been to the headquarters and it 's a very modern company and very european in its thinking .
in fact , the chinese factories i 've visited in their past when i was still with my former employer , were surprisingly modern and conditions were good .
they were no different to places i 've visited in italy .
i think conditions have improved a lot . "
image boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are conditions improving in the chinese textile industry ?
rené lang says the same .
" we need to get way from the idea of cheap china , " he stresses .
" standards are changing fast and there 's a growing interest in organic textiles , sustainability and better working conditions .
the situation will inevitably improve the more money starts circulating in the market .
china is trying to shed its bad image . "
as a designer , michalsky has often demonstrated a social conscience , referencing world affairs in his shows with comments on issues such as the hypocrisy of left-wing intellectuals , the tyranny of capitalism and the profligacy of wall street .
but with the ink still drying on his latest deal , he 's reluctant to consider the political or economic ramifications of his move into china .
" my message is simply that we are all living in one world and that 's why i wanted to do something in this part of the globe , " he sums up .
" i understand that young people are influenced by the same things all over the world , and i think that 's why i got the job . "

her comments were picked up by a number of german broadcasters , as well as many german newspapers .
but it seems that german media were not the only ones listening : conservative iranian media have now attacked ebadi for the statements she made while at deutsche welle .
" feigning interest " iran 's official news agency , the islamic republic news agency -lrb- irna -rrb- , writes that shirin ebadi has assumed the view of german chancellor angela merkel , feigning in unison with her concerns about freedom and civil rights in iran .
irna adds that on the other hand , ebadil like other western media , remains silent about " murders committed by the zionists and occupiers of palastine . "
it also accuses her of being silent about the " suffering of the poor people in afghanistan and thousands of prisoners in abu ghraib , guantanamo and baghram . "
irna continues : " when ebadi aligns herself with the europeans and other western nations , and criticizes and condemns the iranian government , she provides the western media with luxurious gifts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian authorities closed down the office of ebadi 's human rights group last year iranian internet news agency raja news linked ebadi 's statements to the fatal shooting of neda agha soltan , the young female student whose face became a symbol of the anti-government protests .
raja news writes : " following the unlawful killing of our beloved citizen neda by british agents in iran , mrs ebadi was one of those who published a letter , in unison with dishonest media like deutsche welle and the bbc , accusing the iranian government of being involved in this incident . "
comments misreported during her press conference at deutsche welle , ebadi spoke out clearly against economic sanctions on iran , saying these hurt only the iranian population .
but bultan news , another iranian internet news agency , reported that ebadi had in fact said the opposite .
bultan news quoted ebadi as saying : " if negotiations with iran do not result in democracy , then western countries should impose sanctions on iran . "
it also quoted her as saying that " negotiations are always the best approach - but we ca n't go on negotiating forever . "
such attacks are part of the stardard reperatoire of iran 's conservative media .
over the past few years , president mahmoud ahmedinejad has used the dispute over iran 's nuclear program to distract the population from the country 's economic problems and maintain their support .
the election of us president barack obama has robbed ahmedinejad of his favorite enemy , george w. bush .
the diputed iranian presidential election and the use of violence to put down protests there have further weakened him politically .
now the iranian leadership is apparently seeking to make up lost ground by creating new public enemies .
among those in their sights , apart from britain and france , is germany .
so far , this strategy has n't been successful .
criticism of the election continues in iran itself .
the protests are continuing even though the government has , through the use and threat of violence , managed to keep the demonstrators off the streets . author : jamsheed faroughi / sybille golte -lrb- ca -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they include the bavarian brand " oettinger , " whose sales were up two percent .
oettinger , which for years has been germany 's most widely consumed beer , is to take over in august the " feldschloeßchen " brewery owned by the danish beer giant carlsberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous german beer brand " krombacher " saw sales plunge by 5.3 percent in the first quarter the other brewer to show growth in the first quarter - 2.5 percent - is the " hasseröder " brand .
the beer brand is part of belgium-based ab inbev , the world 's largest brewery and the second-largest beer producer in germany .
the biggest loser in the beer market , according to the study , is the cheaply-priced " sternburg , " an east german brand whose sales plunged 11 percent in the first quarter .
the brand is part of the frankfurt-based radeberger group , germany 's largest brewer .
steady drop in beer consumption according to the federal statistical office , the german beer market shrank by four percent in the first five months of 2009 .
exports to germany 's partners in the 27-nation european union were also down 12.5 percent in the first quarter .
thursday 's study did not provide a reason for the decline .
however , beer sales have been sliding steadily in germany for more than a decade , a trend that experts have attributed to an increasingly health-conscious public as well as the different drinking habits of younger consumers .
" the market has been significantly shrinking over the last few years , " peter hahn , head of the german brewers ' association told news agency dpa earlier this year .
" the times when every german drank more than 150 liters of beer annually are definitely gone . "
some have also blamed a public smoking ban in some german states as well as a deep recession for the latest drop in beer consumption .
to add to the woes , munich 's office of tourism said in may that revelers at this year 's oktoberfest in september would have to dig deeper into their pockets .
officials said a one-liter mug of beer will cost between 8.50 euros -lrb- $ 11.63 -rrb- and 8.60 euros this year - a five percent hike over 2008 prices. sp / dpa / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" our passenger costs must fall , " lufthansa spokesperson claudia lange said in a statement , adding that details would be released in the coming weeks .
lufthansa staff were warned in a letter sent by the airline 's new chief executive christoph franz that higher fuel costs and falling passenger numbers posed a serious threat .
" this situation is forcing us to act , " franz wrote in the letter .
" air traffic is mired in the worst crisis in its history , " and the german carrier expected it to last longer than previously anticipated , he added .
the airline would reappraise all its operations , including " structures , projects and processes , " the new chief executive vowed .
after posting a first-quarter loss , lufthansa 's first-half results " will show that this negative trend is continuing , " franz said .
" unless market conditions change , our losses will increase significantly in the coming year owing especially to the rise in fuel prices .
" we must now make ever more determined efforts to counteract the trend , " he stressed , adding : " we have no other alternative but to resort to painful measures . "
analysts have expressed doubts about whether lufthansa can reach its cost-cutting target citing strong resistance from trade unions as one barrier .
the cockpit union which represents pilots has already objected to the airline 's cost-savings plans .
in mid-june , the carrier said slumping passenger and freight traffic would force it to take additional measures to avoid posting a full year loss .
analysts took this to mean job losses with forecasts predicting around 20 percent of the airline 's administrative passenger division being cut in the medium term .
the news of the cost-cutting plans comes as lufthansa continues its effort to take over two european carriers , austrian airlines and the britain 's bmi .
new proposals for austrian takeover with the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa issues new set of proposals to buy austrian meanwhile , lufthansa has sent its new proposals for a planned takeover of austrian airlines to the european commission which now consider the proposed acquisition . the commission , which has launched a probe and demanded reassurances the deal would not distort competition , said in a statement it " will study the offer carefully but can not make any further comment at this stage . " austrian finance minister josef proell told austrian news agency apa on thursday that an offer was on the table which would " get things moving " . the european commission fears the takeover could lead to higher prices for passengers or fewer flights on some routes and has demanded lufthansa make concessions to protect european air travellers . it launched an inquiry at the start of the month into the proposed link-up and has until november 6 to make a decision . but lufthansa said its takeover offer , which must be approved by brussels , would only stand until july 31 . brussels said on friday it had not received anything to address competition concerns and " without concrete proposals from lufthansa within the next few hours it would be impossible " to meet that deadline . doubts raised about lufthansa 's desire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some doubt whether lufthansa is still interested in the deal concessions already made have been deemed insufficient by the commission , which expressed scepticism on monday that the german airliner was still interested in the venture . brussels is demanding that aua surrender key take-off and landing slots for services between vienna and frankfurt , munich , stuttgart , cologne , zurich , geneva and brussels . a european commission spokesman dismissed as " rubbish " austrian press reports that it had approached air france-klm to see if it would be interested in taking over austrian airlines if the lufthansa offer fell through . lufthansa signed a deal last year to acquire a 41.6-percent stake in aua from the austrian state holding company oeiag for a symbolic one euro cent per share - or just over 366,000 euros in all . one of the conditions was an agreement that the austrian state would absorb 500 million euros - or just over a third - of aua 's debts . but those terms have enraged rival airlines , such as air france-klm , which had also sought to buy aua , as well as other airlines such as british airways and irish low-fares carrier ryanair . nda / afp / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 17.07.2009 german designer breathes life into china 's fashion dragon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the michalsky label was the talk of berlin fashion week berlin-based designer michael michalsky has signed a deal with china 's leading sportswear brand for a range earmarked for the chinese market .
he 's among the first german designers to head east , but he wo n't be the last . " china is the most exciting market for fashion right now , " enthuses michael michalsky , the darling of the recent berlin fashion week . " the chinese are really open to fashion , and let 's face it , the future of the world lies in this region , " he says as he reflects on his deal to develop a range of sportswear for the china dongxiang group .
the michalsky label might not yet be in the same league as karl lagerfeld , hugo boss or joop ! , but its namesake has always been ahead of the pack .
" i like to do things differently and i like to be the first , " he says .
" i was the first designer to move to berlin and do major shows here even before it was really on the map .
it 's part of my own nature and the character of both my company and my brand . "
shifting focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael michalsky is pushing fashion 's frontiers in these economically troubled times , thinking outside the box can make all the difference - and michael michalsky has broken with decades of fashion tradition by setting his sights on beijing and shanghai rather than paris and milan .
at the high-end of the industry , he 's one of the first to have woken up to china 's potential as more than a market for established western brands such as louis vuitton , cartier and bmw .
earlier this year , the new york times stated the obvious when it reported that china is now the world 's fastest-growing luxury market , with an estimated $ 7.6 billion in sales in 2008 .
michalsky , in the meantime , had cottoned on to a different , more significant growth - that of the domestic market .
although its love affair with imported luxury is still going strong , china is increasingly fed up being merely a production site for other countries and the home of cheap knock-offs .
these days , it 's keen to foster indigenous brands and to meet its consumer needs under its own steam .
" the domestic chinese market is expanding rapidly , " confirms rené lang , president of the association of german fashion and textile designers .
" until now , china has been known first and foremost as a supplier , but now it has greater spending power , despite the crisis , and there are some very well trained designers and fashion schools .
but they are still in a phase where they tend to rely on foreign help expertise . "
enter michalsky .
after eleven years as global creative director at adidas , he founded his own label in 2006 and his ' real clothes for real people ' approach has done much to establish berlin as an up and coming fashion capital where style reflects the street more than the catwalk . nonetheless , the michalsky label has n't yet managed to turn a profit .
in that respect , it 's in the same boat as many ailing brands .
but while hard-up veteran french labels such as lacroix are busy nursing their wounds and sulkily blaming bankruptcy on the global financial crisis , michael michalsky - like the brave young rookie he is - wasted no time identifying markets not feeling the pinch of recession quite so harshly .
traditional brands might turn their noses up at china , but where others see only a low-end market , the german designer sees real potential : " the dongxiang group is very successful locally , and the company is now looking to expand internationally , " he says .
" to begin with , the line will only be available in china because that 's where they have their own stores , but they 're planning to expand across asia and i do n't see what 's to stop them ending up in other markets futher afield . "
" china is in a transitional phase right now , it 's moving away from imported goods towards home-grown products , " agrees rené lang .
" there 's a burgeoning desire for a more personal cultural identity attached to goods that have been specially produced for the chinese market . "
hot on the heels of jil sander bildunterschrift : jil sander 's clothes are elegant and austere - and big in japan in heading east , michalsky is following in the footsteps of only one other german designer .
in march , jil sander raised eyebrows from madison avenue to avenue montaigne when she teamed up with japanese budget clothing retailer uniqlo .
the company sells $ 30 jeans and $ 15 parkas , and is one of the few companies still thriving despite japan 's recession .
" the challenge for me is to establish premium quality and democratically priced brand uniqlo , " she told reporters in tokyo in spring .
similarly , michalsky showed that he 's not too proud to take his talents wherever they 're most wanted when he launched his mitch & co range for tchibo , a german range of coffee shops that also sells clothing , household items , electronics and electrical appliances .
the collection flopped , but the tie-up helped make michalsky a household name .
unlike many designers , he 's just not that precious .
as far as china is concerned , he shrugs off the qualms some of his colleagues might have about poor working conditions .
" i have n't yet been to any of the dongxiang factories , " he says .
" i 've been to the headquarters and it 's a very modern company and very european in its thinking .
in fact , the chinese factories i 've visited in their past when i was still with my former employer , were surprisingly modern and conditions were good .
they were no different to places i 've visited in italy .
i think conditions have improved a lot . "
image boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are conditions improving in the chinese textile industry ?
rené lang says the same .
" we need to get way from the idea of cheap china , " he stresses .
" standards are changing fast and there 's a growing interest in organic textiles , sustainability and better working conditions .
the situation will inevitably improve the more money starts circulating in the market .
china is trying to shed its bad image . "
as a designer , michalsky has often demonstrated a social conscience , referencing world affairs in his shows with comments on issues such as the hypocrisy of left-wing intellectuals , the tyranny of capitalism and the profligacy of wall street .
but with the ink still drying on his latest deal , he 's reluctant to consider the political or economic ramifications of his move into china .
" my message is simply that we are all living in one world and that 's why i wanted to do something in this part of the globe , " he sums up .
" i understand that young people are influenced by the same things all over the world , and i think that 's why i got the job . "

" our passenger costs must fall , " lufthansa spokesperson claudia lange said in a statement , adding that details would be released in the coming weeks .
lufthansa staff were warned in a letter sent by the airline 's new chief executive christoph franz that higher fuel costs and falling passenger numbers posed a serious threat .
" this situation is forcing us to act , " franz wrote in the letter .
" air traffic is mired in the worst crisis in its history , " and the german carrier expected it to last longer than previously anticipated , he added .
the airline would reappraise all its operations , including " structures , projects and processes , " the new chief executive vowed .
after posting a first-quarter loss , lufthansa 's first-half results " will show that this negative trend is continuing , " franz said .
" unless market conditions change , our losses will increase significantly in the coming year owing especially to the rise in fuel prices .
" we must now make ever more determined efforts to counteract the trend , " he stressed , adding : " we have no other alternative but to resort to painful measures . "
analysts have expressed doubts about whether lufthansa can reach its cost-cutting target citing strong resistance from trade unions as one barrier .
the cockpit union which represents pilots has already objected to the airline 's cost-savings plans .
in mid-june , the carrier said slumping passenger and freight traffic would force it to take additional measures to avoid posting a full year loss .
analysts took this to mean job losses with forecasts predicting around 20 percent of the airline 's administrative passenger division being cut in the medium term .

" our passenger costs must fall , " lufthansa spokesperson claudia lange said in a statement , adding that details would be released in the coming weeks .
lufthansa staff were warned in a letter sent by the airline 's new chief executive christoph franz that higher fuel costs and falling passenger numbers posed a serious threat .
" this situation is forcing us to act , " franz wrote in the letter .
" air traffic is mired in the worst crisis in its history , " and the german carrier expected it to last longer than previously anticipated , he added .
the airline would reappraise all its operations , including " structures , projects and processes , " the new chief executive vowed .
after posting a first-quarter loss , lufthansa 's first-half results " will show that this negative trend is continuing , " franz said .
" unless market conditions change , our losses will increase significantly in the coming year owing especially to the rise in fuel prices .
" we must now make ever more determined efforts to counteract the trend , " he stressed , adding : " we have no other alternative but to resort to painful measures . "
analysts have expressed doubts about whether lufthansa can reach its cost-cutting target citing strong resistance from trade unions as one barrier .
the cockpit union which represents pilots has already objected to the airline 's cost-savings plans .

analysts took this to mean job losses with forecasts predicting around 20 percent of the airline 's administrative passenger division being cut in the medium term .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 17.07.2009 aldi advances on wal-mart 's home turf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with revenue dropping in germany , aldi is turing abroad for growth german discounting pioneer aldi is using the economic crisis to expand its presence in the us .
the move could help mitigate the company 's troubles on its home turf . it is something that has n't happened to aldi before : in the midst of a severe economic crisis germany 's discounting pioneer is faced with declining revenues in its home market .
according to data from research company gfk , aldi 's sales in germany declined by about five percent in the first five months of this year while the german retail sector as a whole shrank by only 2.2 percent .
it 's an entirely different story in the united states .
there , aldi is rapidly expanding its reach and expects to open 75 new stores this year .
the discount retailer entered the us market back in 1976 , but its no-frills concept only really started to take off in recent years .
" and of course the current economic crisis is really helping aldi to gain more customers , but is also making some changes in its concept " , explains matthias queck , senior discount analyst at market reseach firm planet retail .
for instance , aldi has added more fresh products , especially produce , to its range of products and has spruced up its stores to make them more attractive to new customers .
while older aldi stores where often located in less affluent neighborhoods , many new stores are located in areas that attract suburban and middle class shoppers as well .
low prices for high price markets aldi traditionally does n't release financial figures , but experts believe the german discount chain is doing quite well in the us and making significant inroads in the retail sector .
how then does aldi compete against us retail behemoth wal-mart on its home turf ?
it 's very simple , say the experts , the same way aldi and other german discounters forced wal-mart to shutter its doors in germany a couple of years ago : low prices and high quality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldi is taking on retail giant wal-mart on his home turf thomas roeb , a retail expert at the university of applied sciences rhine-sieg , argues that while wal-mart is considered a discounter in the us and has an image as a low-price retailer , its general pricing level is still fairly high .
in comparison to wal-mart aldi has a lower cost structure that allows it to become very successful in higher price markets like the united states . " however , the consumers so far did n't really believe in the value proposition of aldi and it is due to the economic crisis right now that people have started to try the concept . "
and , adds roeb , more and more americans give aldi 's no-frills concept a chance and actually find it attractive .
that 's because consumers realize that they can save money when shopping at aldi .
experts estimate that aldi 's prices are generally 10 to 15 percent lower than those of other national us retailers .
how does aldi do that ?
it keeps costs down with a limited range of products , smaller stores , fewer staff , and by not staying open as late as some of its competitors . it has also developed an efficient logistics system and most of the products that it sells are its own brand .
its sheer size allows it to get discounts by buying large quantities . too successful what can happen once aldi 's value proposition catches on in a big way , is evident in germany .
there , so-called " hard discounters " like aldi , account for more than 40 percent of the country 's retail sector .
the discount model has been so successful that aldi 's many competitors in germany are finally taking a bite out of its revenues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , aldi faces stiff competition from other discounters after decades of imitating aldi , says retail expert roeb , its german competitors have finally caught on .
" so it 's less aldi 's loss in the german market , it 's less that aldi is doing something wrong , but rather the fact that the competition is doing something right . "
that 's why aldi 's future growth will come mainly from abroad with the us being a prime target for expansion , argues discount expert queck : " just imagine that in the us , aldi has just 1,000 stores spread over 29 states , so that leaves a lot of room for further expansion . "
compare that with the roughly 1,700 stores that aldi sued , the part of the aldi company that manages its us operation , owns in southern and western germany alone and you can imagine the huge growth potential for the discounter in the us .
wal-mart dwarfs aldi despite aldi 's current advances in the us market , the question remains whether it can sustain its growth and customers once the economic malaise is over .
" i do believe that aldi is going to be successful even after the crisis , " says roeb .
" because we have had the same situation in germany and in some western european countries in the past .
everywhere aldi benefitted from economic crises to increase sales and consumers found the selection of products attractive so they found no need to switch back to their former supermarket . "
while aldi in the us with an estimated revenue of about seven billion dollars last year is tiny in comparison to wal-mart with its revenue of 375 billion dollars , the german discounter could challenge wal-mart in a specific segment - food .
wal-mart , says roeb is basically a non-food retailer that carries food as an important part , but not the main attraction of its product range .
" aldi however is a food specialist .
so when we are talking about competition between aldi and wal-mart , we are talking about competition in the field of food .
and i do believe that aldi is going to cause some problems for wal-mart in the future and even today in the area of food . "
that 's because , wal-mart 's image as a discounter in the food segment could be undercut by aldi 's value proposition .
and that , adds roeb , might end up having a negative impact on wal-mart 's public image . author : michael knigge editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's why aldi 's future growth will come mainly from abroad with the us being a prime target for expansion , argues discount expert queck : " just imagine that in the us , aldi has just 1,000 stores spread over 29 states , so that leaves a lot of room for further expansion . "
compare that with the roughly 1,700 stores that aldi sued , the part of the aldi company that manages its us operation , owns in southern and western germany alone and you can imagine the huge growth potential for the discounter in the us .
wal-mart dwarfs aldi despite aldi 's current advances in the us market , the question remains whether it can sustain its growth and customers once the economic malaise is over .
" i do believe that aldi is going to be successful even after the crisis , " says roeb .
" because we have had the same situation in germany and in some western european countries in the past .
everywhere aldi benefitted from economic crises to increase sales and consumers found the selection of products attractive so they found no need to switch back to their former supermarket . "
while aldi in the us with an estimated revenue of about seven billion dollars last year is tiny in comparison to wal-mart with its revenue of 375 billion dollars , the german discounter could challenge wal-mart in a specific segment - food .
wal-mart , says roeb is basically a non-food retailer that carries food as an important part , but not the main attraction of its product range .

so when we are talking about competition between aldi and wal-mart , we are talking about competition in the field of food .

the move could help mitigate the company 's troubles on its home turf . it is something that has n't happened to aldi before : in the midst of a severe economic crisis germany 's discounting pioneer is faced with declining revenues in its home market .
according to data from research company gfk , aldi 's sales in germany declined by about five percent in the first five months of this year while the german retail sector as a whole shrank by only 2.2 percent .
it 's an entirely different story in the united states .
there , aldi is rapidly expanding its reach and expects to open 75 new stores this year .
the discount retailer entered the us market back in 1976 , but its no-frills concept only really started to take off in recent years .
" and of course the current economic crisis is really helping aldi to gain more customers , but is also making some changes in its concept " , explains matthias queck , senior discount analyst at market reseach firm planet retail .
for instance , aldi has added more fresh products , especially produce , to its range of products and has spruced up its stores to make them more attractive to new customers .
while older aldi stores where often located in less affluent neighborhoods , many new stores are located in areas that attract suburban and middle class shoppers as well .
low prices for high price markets aldi traditionally does n't release financial figures , but experts believe the german discount chain is doing quite well in the us and making significant inroads in the retail sector .
how then does aldi compete against us retail behemoth wal-mart on its home turf ?
it 's very simple , say the experts , the same way aldi and other german discounters forced wal-mart to shutter its doors in germany a couple of years ago : low prices and high quality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldi is taking on retail giant wal-mart on his home turf thomas roeb , a retail expert at the university of applied sciences rhine-sieg , argues that while wal-mart is considered a discounter in the us and has an image as a low-price retailer , its general pricing level is still fairly high .
in comparison to wal-mart aldi has a lower cost structure that allows it to become very successful in higher price markets like the united states . " however , the consumers so far did n't really believe in the value proposition of aldi and it is due to the economic crisis right now that people have started to try the concept . "
and , adds roeb , more and more americans give aldi 's no-frills concept a chance and actually find it attractive .
that 's because consumers realize that they can save money when shopping at aldi .
experts estimate that aldi 's prices are generally 10 to 15 percent lower than those of other national us retailers .
how does aldi do that ?
it keeps costs down with a limited range of products , smaller stores , fewer staff , and by not staying open as late as some of its competitors . it has also developed an efficient logistics system and most of the products that it sells are its own brand .
its sheer size allows it to get discounts by buying large quantities . too successful what can happen once aldi 's value proposition catches on in a big way , is evident in germany .
there , so-called " hard discounters " like aldi , account for more than 40 percent of the country 's retail sector .
the discount model has been so successful that aldi 's many competitors in germany are finally taking a bite out of its revenues .

experts estimate that aldi 's prices are generally 10 to 15 percent lower than those of other national us retailers .
how does aldi do that ?
it keeps costs down with a limited range of products , smaller stores , fewer staff , and by not staying open as late as some of its competitors . it has also developed an efficient logistics system and most of the products that it sells are its own brand .
its sheer size allows it to get discounts by buying large quantities . too successful what can happen once aldi 's value proposition catches on in a big way , is evident in germany .
there , so-called " hard discounters " like aldi , account for more than 40 percent of the country 's retail sector .
the discount model has been so successful that aldi 's many competitors in germany are finally taking a bite out of its revenues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , aldi faces stiff competition from other discounters after decades of imitating aldi , says retail expert roeb , its german competitors have finally caught on .
" so it 's less aldi 's loss in the german market , it 's less that aldi is doing something wrong , but rather the fact that the competition is doing something right . "
that 's why aldi 's future growth will come mainly from abroad with the us being a prime target for expansion , argues discount expert queck : " just imagine that in the us , aldi has just 1,000 stores spread over 29 states , so that leaves a lot of room for further expansion . "
compare that with the roughly 1,700 stores that aldi sued , the part of the aldi company that manages its us operation , owns in southern and western germany alone and you can imagine the huge growth potential for the discounter in the us .
wal-mart dwarfs aldi despite aldi 's current advances in the us market , the question remains whether it can sustain its growth and customers once the economic malaise is over .
" i do believe that aldi is going to be successful even after the crisis , " says roeb .
" because we have had the same situation in germany and in some western european countries in the past .
everywhere aldi benefitted from economic crises to increase sales and consumers found the selection of products attractive so they found no need to switch back to their former supermarket . "
while aldi in the us with an estimated revenue of about seven billion dollars last year is tiny in comparison to wal-mart with its revenue of 375 billion dollars , the german discounter could challenge wal-mart in a specific segment - food .
wal-mart , says roeb is basically a non-food retailer that carries food as an important part , but not the main attraction of its product range .
" aldi however is a food specialist .
so when we are talking about competition between aldi and wal-mart , we are talking about competition in the field of food .
and i do believe that aldi is going to cause some problems for wal-mart in the future and even today in the area of food . "
that 's because , wal-mart 's image as a discounter in the food segment could be undercut by aldi 's value proposition .

the move could help mitigate the company 's troubles on its home turf . it is something that has n't happened to aldi before : in the midst of a severe economic crisis germany 's discounting pioneer is faced with declining revenues in its home market .
according to data from research company gfk , aldi 's sales in germany declined by about five percent in the first five months of this year while the german retail sector as a whole shrank by only 2.2 percent .
it 's an entirely different story in the united states .
there , aldi is rapidly expanding its reach and expects to open 75 new stores this year .
the discount retailer entered the us market back in 1976 , but its no-frills concept only really started to take off in recent years .
" and of course the current economic crisis is really helping aldi to gain more customers , but is also making some changes in its concept " , explains matthias queck , senior discount analyst at market reseach firm planet retail .
for instance , aldi has added more fresh products , especially produce , to its range of products and has spruced up its stores to make them more attractive to new customers .
while older aldi stores where often located in less affluent neighborhoods , many new stores are located in areas that attract suburban and middle class shoppers as well .
low prices for high price markets aldi traditionally does n't release financial figures , but experts believe the german discount chain is doing quite well in the us and making significant inroads in the retail sector .
how then does aldi compete against us retail behemoth wal-mart on its home turf ?
it 's very simple , say the experts , the same way aldi and other german discounters forced wal-mart to shutter its doors in germany a couple of years ago : low prices and high quality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldi is taking on retail giant wal-mart on his home turf thomas roeb , a retail expert at the university of applied sciences rhine-sieg , argues that while wal-mart is considered a discounter in the us and has an image as a low-price retailer , its general pricing level is still fairly high .
in comparison to wal-mart aldi has a lower cost structure that allows it to become very successful in higher price markets like the united states . " however , the consumers so far did n't really believe in the value proposition of aldi and it is due to the economic crisis right now that people have started to try the concept . "
and , adds roeb , more and more americans give aldi 's no-frills concept a chance and actually find it attractive .
that 's because consumers realize that they can save money when shopping at aldi .
experts estimate that aldi 's prices are generally 10 to 15 percent lower than those of other national us retailers .

its sheer size allows it to get discounts by buying large quantities . too successful what can happen once aldi 's value proposition catches on in a big way , is evident in germany .

july is shaping up to be one of the deadliest months for international forces fighting in afghanistan in the eight-year history of the conflict .
as of wednesday , at least 46 international troops were killed this month . the increasing death toll has reignited debate in countries such as britain and germany about whether their afghan missions are worth the high cost and new voices in both countries are calling for a reconsideration of troop deployment in a country that seems to be sinking deeper into a quagmire of militant violence . but for international groups on the ground there in the run-up to elections on august 20 , there is no doubt that a continued international presence is needed , and is vital , to ensure that the country has an election that is fair and credible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western and international groups have been helping with voter registration " the stakes are extremely high , the challenges are significant , " said aleem siddique , the united nation 's spokesperson in kabul .

they include the bavarian brand " oettinger , " whose sales were up two percent .
oettinger , which for years has been germany 's most widely consumed beer , is to take over in august the " feldschloeßchen " brewery owned by the danish beer giant carlsberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous german beer brand " krombacher " saw sales plunge by 5.3 percent in the first quarter the other brewer to show growth in the first quarter - 2.5 percent - is the " hasseröder " brand .
the beer brand is part of belgium-based ab inbev , the world 's largest brewery and the second-largest beer producer in germany .
the biggest loser in the beer market , according to the study , is the cheaply-priced " sternburg , " an east german brand whose sales plunged 11 percent in the first quarter .
the brand is part of the frankfurt-based radeberger group , germany 's largest brewer .
steady drop in beer consumption according to the federal statistical office , the german beer market shrank by four percent in the first five months of 2009 .
exports to germany 's partners in the 27-nation european union were also down 12.5 percent in the first quarter .
thursday 's study did not provide a reason for the decline .
however , beer sales have been sliding steadily in germany for more than a decade , a trend that experts have attributed to an increasingly health-conscious public as well as the different drinking habits of younger consumers .
" the market has been significantly shrinking over the last few years , " peter hahn , head of the german brewers ' association told news agency dpa earlier this year .
" the times when every german drank more than 150 liters of beer annually are definitely gone . "
some have also blamed a public smoking ban in some german states as well as a deep recession for the latest drop in beer consumption .
to add to the woes , munich 's office of tourism said in may that revelers at this year 's oktoberfest in september would have to dig deeper into their pockets .
officials said a one-liter mug of beer will cost between 8.50 euros -lrb- $ 11.63 -rrb- and 8.60 euros this year - a five percent hike over 2008 prices. sp / dpa / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i was the first designer to move to berlin and do major shows here even before it was really on the map .
it 's part of my own nature and the character of both my company and my brand . "
shifting focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael michalsky is pushing fashion 's frontiers in these economically troubled times , thinking outside the box can make all the difference - and michael michalsky has broken with decades of fashion tradition by setting his sights on beijing and shanghai rather than paris and milan .
at the high-end of the industry , he 's one of the first to have woken up to china 's potential as more than a market for established western brands such as louis vuitton , cartier and bmw .
earlier this year , the new york times stated the obvious when it reported that china is now the world 's fastest-growing luxury market , with an estimated $ 7.6 billion in sales in 2008 .
michalsky , in the meantime , had cottoned on to a different , more significant growth - that of the domestic market .
although its love affair with imported luxury is still going strong , china is increasingly fed up being merely a production site for other countries and the home of cheap knock-offs .
these days , it 's keen to foster indigenous brands and to meet its consumer needs under its own steam .
" the domestic chinese market is expanding rapidly , " confirms rené lang , president of the association of german fashion and textile designers .
" until now , china has been known first and foremost as a supplier , but now it has greater spending power , despite the crisis , and there are some very well trained designers and fashion schools .
but they are still in a phase where they tend to rely on foreign help expertise . "
enter michalsky .
after eleven years as global creative director at adidas , he founded his own label in 2006 and his ' real clothes for real people ' approach has done much to establish berlin as an up and coming fashion capital where style reflects the street more than the catwalk . nonetheless , the michalsky label has n't yet managed to turn a profit .
in that respect , it 's in the same boat as many ailing brands .
but while hard-up veteran french labels such as lacroix are busy nursing their wounds and sulkily blaming bankruptcy on the global financial crisis , michael michalsky - like the brave young rookie he is - wasted no time identifying markets not feeling the pinch of recession quite so harshly .
traditional brands might turn their noses up at china , but where others see only a low-end market , the german designer sees real potential : " the dongxiang group is very successful locally , and the company is now looking to expand internationally , " he says .
" to begin with , the line will only be available in china because that 's where they have their own stores , but they 're planning to expand across asia and i do n't see what 's to stop them ending up in other markets futher afield . "
" china is in a transitional phase right now , it 's moving away from imported goods towards home-grown products , " agrees rené lang .
" there 's a burgeoning desire for a more personal cultural identity attached to goods that have been specially produced for the chinese market . "
hot on the heels of jil sander bildunterschrift : jil sander 's clothes are elegant and austere - and big in japan in heading east , michalsky is following in the footsteps of only one other german designer .
in march , jil sander raised eyebrows from madison avenue to avenue montaigne when she teamed up with japanese budget clothing retailer uniqlo .
the company sells $ 30 jeans and $ 15 parkas , and is one of the few companies still thriving despite japan 's recession .
" the challenge for me is to establish premium quality and democratically priced brand uniqlo , " she told reporters in tokyo in spring .
similarly , michalsky showed that he 's not too proud to take his talents wherever they 're most wanted when he launched his mitch & co range for tchibo , a german range of coffee shops that also sells clothing , household items , electronics and electrical appliances .
the collection flopped , but the tie-up helped make michalsky a household name .
unlike many designers , he 's just not that precious .
as far as china is concerned , he shrugs off the qualms some of his colleagues might have about poor working conditions .
" i have n't yet been to any of the dongxiang factories , " he says .
" i 've been to the headquarters and it 's a very modern company and very european in its thinking .
in fact , the chinese factories i 've visited in their past when i was still with my former employer , were surprisingly modern and conditions were good .
they were no different to places i 've visited in italy .
i think conditions have improved a lot . "
image boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are conditions improving in the chinese textile industry ?
rené lang says the same .
" we need to get way from the idea of cheap china , " he stresses .
" standards are changing fast and there 's a growing interest in organic textiles , sustainability and better working conditions .
the situation will inevitably improve the more money starts circulating in the market .
china is trying to shed its bad image . "
as a designer , michalsky has often demonstrated a social conscience , referencing world affairs in his shows with comments on issues such as the hypocrisy of left-wing intellectuals , the tyranny of capitalism and the profligacy of wall street .
but with the ink still drying on his latest deal , he 's reluctant to consider the political or economic ramifications of his move into china .
" my message is simply that we are all living in one world and that 's why i wanted to do something in this part of the globe , " he sums up .
" i understand that young people are influenced by the same things all over the world , and i think that 's why i got the job . "

they include the bavarian brand " oettinger , " whose sales were up two percent .
oettinger , which for years has been germany 's most widely consumed beer , is to take over in august the " feldschloeßchen " brewery owned by the danish beer giant carlsberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous german beer brand " krombacher " saw sales plunge by 5.3 percent in the first quarter the other brewer to show growth in the first quarter - 2.5 percent - is the " hasseröder " brand .
the beer brand is part of belgium-based ab inbev , the world 's largest brewery and the second-largest beer producer in germany .
the biggest loser in the beer market , according to the study , is the cheaply-priced " sternburg , " an east german brand whose sales plunged 11 percent in the first quarter .
the brand is part of the frankfurt-based radeberger group , germany 's largest brewer .
steady drop in beer consumption according to the federal statistical office , the german beer market shrank by four percent in the first five months of 2009 .
exports to germany 's partners in the 27-nation european union were also down 12.5 percent in the first quarter .
thursday 's study did not provide a reason for the decline .
however , beer sales have been sliding steadily in germany for more than a decade , a trend that experts have attributed to an increasingly health-conscious public as well as the different drinking habits of younger consumers .
" the market has been significantly shrinking over the last few years , " peter hahn , head of the german brewers ' association told news agency dpa earlier this year .
" the times when every german drank more than 150 liters of beer annually are definitely gone . "
some have also blamed a public smoking ban in some german states as well as a deep recession for the latest drop in beer consumption .
to add to the woes , munich 's office of tourism said in may that revelers at this year 's oktoberfest in september would have to dig deeper into their pockets .
officials said a one-liter mug of beer will cost between 8.50 euros -lrb- $ 11.63 -rrb- and 8.60 euros this year - a five percent hike over 2008 prices. sp / dpa / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 17.07.2009 new un security council resolution against north korea großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the resolution is binding on all un member states a un security council panel has put five companies , including one based in iran , and five north koreans under un sanctions because of their links to pyongyang 's nuclear and ballistic missile activities . these sanctions against north korea are just the newest in an ongoing struggle to get the asian state to abandon its nuclear ambitions .
it all started back in october 2006 when pyongyang tested a nuclear device , causing the members of the united nations security council -lrb- unsc -rrb- to issue unsc resolution 1718 , which put sanctions on trade in major weapons system , all products related to the production of weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- , and luxury goods .
but instead of convincing north korea to back off , it actually incited them to try harder ; a point that was proved when they launched a multi-stage rocket on april 5 of this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea 's explosion of a nuclear device on may 25 triggered protests in the south the newest sanctions imposed by the unsc panel on pyongyang for exploding a nuclear device on may 25 , which is completely binding for all member states , is a little bit different in that they focus not on the government as a whole , but rather on individuals and economic entities .
the list includes five companies , including one based in iran , and five north koreans .
the 15-nation council 's panel also banned two goods to be imported by north korea : graphite designed or specified for use in electrical discharge machining -lrb- edm -rrb- machines and para-aramid fiber - commonly known as kevlar - filament and tape .
the panel imposed a freeze of assets belonging to namchongang trading company , hong kong electronics , korea hyoksin trading corporation , general bureau of atomic energy and korean tangun trading corporation .
the five north koreans are : yun ho-jin , director of namchongang trading ; ri je-son and hwang suk-hwa , both directors of separate departments in the general bureau of atomic energy ; rihong-sop , former director of yongbyon nuclear research centre ; han yu-ro , director of korea ryongaksan general trading corporation .
the individuals ' assets will be frozen and they will be banned from travelling abroad .
smart sanctions according to professor michael brzoska , director of the institute for peace research and security policy at the university of hamburg , sanctions against north korea have been changed several times , but the main goal has always been to tighten the screws , particularly on the leadership , without harming the population too much .
the idea is to make life difficult for north korean president kim jong-il and those around him , as well as to limit the possibilities for state institutions , particularly in the financial field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea has been very secretive about the health of the country 's leader kim jong-il using these so-called smart sanctions to target individuals rather than entire governments is n't new ; since the early 1990s the unsc decided to try and influence the behavior of decision makers without harming the general population .
the first cases were iraq and the former yugoslavia , says brzoska , and since then there have been others , adding that the success of these actions has been very mixed .
in angola , for example , the unita rebel movement was targeted in this way and , in the end , lost the war to the government .
in liberia , where former president charles taylor , who is now at the international court of justice in the hague , became a target and that was successful in limiting his possibilities to buy arms and to pay his soldiers .
" one could also argue that in libya sanctions that harmed the leadership by making it more difficult to fly and to have money available for investment in the oil industry also helped to bring about change there .
but there are a lot of other cases where these types of smart sanctions did not have much effect , like in iran , the ivory coast or sierra leone , " says brzoska .
the china question the key to any of these sanctions being successful has always been how inclined the chinese government is to enforce them .
china is north korea 's only ally in the region , if not the world , and they have been reluctant to put pressure on pyongyang in the past .
this is mostly due to the fact that beijing uses its relationship with north korea - and the ability to bring kim jong-il to the negotiating table - to bargain with both japan and the united states , says dr. patrick koellner , acting head of the institute of asian affairs at the german institute of global and area studies .
according to koellner , china , which holds a permanent position on the security council , has the ability to bring north korea to its knees .
simply by cutting of supplies of energy and food and freezing the assets of north korean leaders , kim 's regime would have no choice but to surrender to any demands the un had of it .
however , unlike the japanese and the americans , the chinese actually have a vested financial interest in the sound future of north korea .
according to a report by the council on foreign relations , chinese trade and investment in north korea now totals $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.4 billion euros -rrb- a year . bildunterschrift : since the korean war the border between the two nations has been heavily guarded enforcement while complete chinese cooperation would make things a whole lot faster , it is n't required to put pressure on north korea .
stephan haggard and marcus noland from the peterson institute for international economics argue in a recently published report that the most interesting features of the resolution have to do with means of enforcement .
the resolution calls upon member states to inspect vessels on the high seas or escort them to port if they have reasonable grounds to believe that they are carrying prohibited cargo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any vessel heading into north korean waters suspected of carrying contraban is subject to a search however , there is a loophole in the wording , in order to intercept a ship , the country under which the vessel is flagged must give permission .
according to haggard and noland , this could provide incentives for north korea to do more shipping under its own flag ; though that is doubtful given the country 's standing in the international community .
many ships , regardless of their country of origin , sail under the auspices of countries such as liberia and panama - countries where fees , taxes , regulations , and laws protecting seafarers are often minimal or non-existent .
that means that these nations will be under more and more pressure to allow these ships to be searched , leaving north korea no choice but to use its own flag ; though this causes its own potential drama as north korea has stated in no uncertain terms that it would view such action as an act of war .

many ships , regardless of their country of origin , sail under the auspices of countries such as liberia and panama - countries where fees , taxes , regulations , and laws protecting seafarers are often minimal or non-existent .
that means that these nations will be under more and more pressure to allow these ships to be searched , leaving north korea no choice but to use its own flag ; though this causes its own potential drama as north korea has stated in no uncertain terms that it would view such action as an act of war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 17.07.2009 new un security council resolution against north korea großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the resolution is binding on all un member states a un security council panel has put five companies , including one based in iran , and five north koreans under un sanctions because of their links to pyongyang 's nuclear and ballistic missile activities . these sanctions against north korea are just the newest in an ongoing struggle to get the asian state to abandon its nuclear ambitions .
it all started back in october 2006 when pyongyang tested a nuclear device , causing the members of the united nations security council -lrb- unsc -rrb- to issue unsc resolution 1718 , which put sanctions on trade in major weapons system , all products related to the production of weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- , and luxury goods .
but instead of convincing north korea to back off , it actually incited them to try harder ; a point that was proved when they launched a multi-stage rocket on april 5 of this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea 's explosion of a nuclear device on may 25 triggered protests in the south the newest sanctions imposed by the unsc panel on pyongyang for exploding a nuclear device on may 25 , which is completely binding for all member states , is a little bit different in that they focus not on the government as a whole , but rather on individuals and economic entities .
the list includes five companies , including one based in iran , and five north koreans .
the 15-nation council 's panel also banned two goods to be imported by north korea : graphite designed or specified for use in electrical discharge machining -lrb- edm -rrb- machines and para-aramid fiber - commonly known as kevlar - filament and tape .
the panel imposed a freeze of assets belonging to namchongang trading company , hong kong electronics , korea hyoksin trading corporation , general bureau of atomic energy and korean tangun trading corporation .
the five north koreans are : yun ho-jin , director of namchongang trading ; ri je-son and hwang suk-hwa , both directors of separate departments in the general bureau of atomic energy ; rihong-sop , former director of yongbyon nuclear research centre ; han yu-ro , director of korea ryongaksan general trading corporation .
the individuals ' assets will be frozen and they will be banned from travelling abroad .
smart sanctions according to professor michael brzoska , director of the institute for peace research and security policy at the university of hamburg , sanctions against north korea have been changed several times , but the main goal has always been to tighten the screws , particularly on the leadership , without harming the population too much .
the idea is to make life difficult for north korean president kim jong-il and those around him , as well as to limit the possibilities for state institutions , particularly in the financial field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea has been very secretive about the health of the country 's leader kim jong-il using these so-called smart sanctions to target individuals rather than entire governments is n't new ; since the early 1990s the unsc decided to try and influence the behavior of decision makers without harming the general population .
the first cases were iraq and the former yugoslavia , says brzoska , and since then there have been others , adding that the success of these actions has been very mixed .
in angola , for example , the unita rebel movement was targeted in this way and , in the end , lost the war to the government .
in liberia , where former president charles taylor , who is now at the international court of justice in the hague , became a target and that was successful in limiting his possibilities to buy arms and to pay his soldiers .
" one could also argue that in libya sanctions that harmed the leadership by making it more difficult to fly and to have money available for investment in the oil industry also helped to bring about change there .
but there are a lot of other cases where these types of smart sanctions did not have much effect , like in iran , the ivory coast or sierra leone , " says brzoska .
the china question the key to any of these sanctions being successful has always been how inclined the chinese government is to enforce them .
china is north korea 's only ally in the region , if not the world , and they have been reluctant to put pressure on pyongyang in the past .
this is mostly due to the fact that beijing uses its relationship with north korea - and the ability to bring kim jong-il to the negotiating table - to bargain with both japan and the united states , says dr. patrick koellner , acting head of the institute of asian affairs at the german institute of global and area studies .
according to koellner , china , which holds a permanent position on the security council , has the ability to bring north korea to its knees .
simply by cutting of supplies of energy and food and freezing the assets of north korean leaders , kim 's regime would have no choice but to surrender to any demands the un had of it .
however , unlike the japanese and the americans , the chinese actually have a vested financial interest in the sound future of north korea .
according to a report by the council on foreign relations , chinese trade and investment in north korea now totals $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.4 billion euros -rrb- a year . bildunterschrift : since the korean war the border between the two nations has been heavily guarded enforcement while complete chinese cooperation would make things a whole lot faster , it is n't required to put pressure on north korea .
stephan haggard and marcus noland from the peterson institute for international economics argue in a recently published report that the most interesting features of the resolution have to do with means of enforcement .
the resolution calls upon member states to inspect vessels on the high seas or escort them to port if they have reasonable grounds to believe that they are carrying prohibited cargo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any vessel heading into north korean waters suspected of carrying contraban is subject to a search however , there is a loophole in the wording , in order to intercept a ship , the country under which the vessel is flagged must give permission .

hossein shariatmadari , editor-in-chief of the kayhan daily , said rafsanjani , a moderate who backed mousavi 's election campaign , had done nothing to prevent the gathering of mousavi supporters inside and outside tehran university , where prayers are held each friday and broadcast live on state radio .
in his first friday sermon since the controversial vote , rafsanjani criticized the way authorities in iran had handled the poll and said large numbers of iranians doubted the results of the election .
" in the current situation it is not necessary for us to have a number of people in prisons ... we should allow them to return to their families , " he said in the sermon at tehran university , broadcast live on state radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafsanjani is considered a key power-broker in iranian politics " we are all members of a family .
i hope with this sermon we can pass through this period of hardships that can be called a crisis , " rafsanjani said .
large opposition rally in tehran his sermon was marked by a large opposition rally in the streets outside the university - the first such demonstration for more than a week .
many protestors were reported to be wearing green bands to indicate support for opposition leader and defeated election candidate mir hossein mousavi .
news agency reuters said some were heard chanting " death to the dictator " and " ahmadinejad , resign , resign . "
the agency also quoted an unidentified witness saying police had fired tear gas and beat up mousavi supporters .
rafsanjani is a backer of mousavi who has demanded a re-run of the vote and described the new government as illegitimate .
cleric slams security crackdown rafsanjani , who heads the powerful assembly of experts and is an influential cleric , also appealed for an open debate on radio and television about the disputed 12 june election and called for media restrictions to be eased .
" it is not necessary to pressure media .
we should allow them to work freely within the law , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a protestor at the opposition rally in tehran on friday although rafsanjani stayed silent during the unrest that followed the election , members of his family - including his daughter faezeh - openly supported mousavi .

" we knew what imam khomeini wanted .
he did n't want the use of terror or arms , even in fights -lrb- for the revolution -rrb- . "
rafsanjani 's remarks are seen as a challenge to supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei , who has upheld the election result and accused foreign powers of fuelling the unrest .
violent street protests broke out in iran last month , as news of president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's victory was met with accusations of fraud and vote-rigging .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 17.07.2009 german designer breathes life into china 's fashion dragon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the michalsky label was the talk of berlin fashion week berlin-based designer michael michalsky has signed a deal with china 's leading sportswear brand for a range earmarked for the chinese market .
he 's among the first german designers to head east , but he wo n't be the last . " china is the most exciting market for fashion right now , " enthuses michael michalsky , the darling of the recent berlin fashion week . " the chinese are really open to fashion , and let 's face it , the future of the world lies in this region , " he says as he reflects on his deal to develop a range of sportswear for the china dongxiang group .
the michalsky label might not yet be in the same league as karl lagerfeld , hugo boss or joop ! , but its namesake has always been ahead of the pack .
" i like to do things differently and i like to be the first , " he says .
" i was the first designer to move to berlin and do major shows here even before it was really on the map .
it 's part of my own nature and the character of both my company and my brand . "
shifting focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael michalsky is pushing fashion 's frontiers in these economically troubled times , thinking outside the box can make all the difference - and michael michalsky has broken with decades of fashion tradition by setting his sights on beijing and shanghai rather than paris and milan .
at the high-end of the industry , he 's one of the first to have woken up to china 's potential as more than a market for established western brands such as louis vuitton , cartier and bmw .
earlier this year , the new york times stated the obvious when it reported that china is now the world 's fastest-growing luxury market , with an estimated $ 7.6 billion in sales in 2008 .
michalsky , in the meantime , had cottoned on to a different , more significant growth - that of the domestic market .
although its love affair with imported luxury is still going strong , china is increasingly fed up being merely a production site for other countries and the home of cheap knock-offs .
these days , it 's keen to foster indigenous brands and to meet its consumer needs under its own steam .
" the domestic chinese market is expanding rapidly , " confirms rené lang , president of the association of german fashion and textile designers .
" until now , china has been known first and foremost as a supplier , but now it has greater spending power , despite the crisis , and there are some very well trained designers and fashion schools .
but they are still in a phase where they tend to rely on foreign help expertise . "
enter michalsky .
after eleven years as global creative director at adidas , he founded his own label in 2006 and his ' real clothes for real people ' approach has done much to establish berlin as an up and coming fashion capital where style reflects the street more than the catwalk . nonetheless , the michalsky label has n't yet managed to turn a profit .
in that respect , it 's in the same boat as many ailing brands .
but while hard-up veteran french labels such as lacroix are busy nursing their wounds and sulkily blaming bankruptcy on the global financial crisis , michael michalsky - like the brave young rookie he is - wasted no time identifying markets not feeling the pinch of recession quite so harshly .
traditional brands might turn their noses up at china , but where others see only a low-end market , the german designer sees real potential : " the dongxiang group is very successful locally , and the company is now looking to expand internationally , " he says .
" to begin with , the line will only be available in china because that 's where they have their own stores , but they 're planning to expand across asia and i do n't see what 's to stop them ending up in other markets futher afield . "
" china is in a transitional phase right now , it 's moving away from imported goods towards home-grown products , " agrees rené lang .
" there 's a burgeoning desire for a more personal cultural identity attached to goods that have been specially produced for the chinese market . "
hot on the heels of jil sander bildunterschrift : jil sander 's clothes are elegant and austere - and big in japan in heading east , michalsky is following in the footsteps of only one other german designer .
in march , jil sander raised eyebrows from madison avenue to avenue montaigne when she teamed up with japanese budget clothing retailer uniqlo .
the company sells $ 30 jeans and $ 15 parkas , and is one of the few companies still thriving despite japan 's recession .
" the challenge for me is to establish premium quality and democratically priced brand uniqlo , " she told reporters in tokyo in spring .
similarly , michalsky showed that he 's not too proud to take his talents wherever they 're most wanted when he launched his mitch & co range for tchibo , a german range of coffee shops that also sells clothing , household items , electronics and electrical appliances .
the collection flopped , but the tie-up helped make michalsky a household name .
unlike many designers , he 's just not that precious .
as far as china is concerned , he shrugs off the qualms some of his colleagues might have about poor working conditions .
" i have n't yet been to any of the dongxiang factories , " he says .
" i 've been to the headquarters and it 's a very modern company and very european in its thinking .
in fact , the chinese factories i 've visited in their past when i was still with my former employer , were surprisingly modern and conditions were good .
they were no different to places i 've visited in italy .
i think conditions have improved a lot . "
image boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are conditions improving in the chinese textile industry ?
rené lang says the same .
" we need to get way from the idea of cheap china , " he stresses .
" standards are changing fast and there 's a growing interest in organic textiles , sustainability and better working conditions .
the situation will inevitably improve the more money starts circulating in the market .
china is trying to shed its bad image . "
as a designer , michalsky has often demonstrated a social conscience , referencing world affairs in his shows with comments on issues such as the hypocrisy of left-wing intellectuals , the tyranny of capitalism and the profligacy of wall street .
but with the ink still drying on his latest deal , he 's reluctant to consider the political or economic ramifications of his move into china .
" my message is simply that we are all living in one world and that 's why i wanted to do something in this part of the globe , " he sums up .
" i understand that young people are influenced by the same things all over the world , and i think that 's why i got the job . "

the three claimed to have more videos of susanne klatten in trysts with a swiss gigolo . in june this year , the blackmailers had written to susanne klatten and threatened to sell recordings of her with helg sgarbi to the italian media if the mother of three did not hand over 800,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.1 million -rrb- and a bmw x5 luxury sports utility vehicle .
the bwm-heiress immediately contacted the authorities .
police in the northern german city of duisburg " pretended to be acquaintances contacting them on behalf of klatten , " said thomas steinkraus-koch , a spokesman for prosecutors in munich .
police arrived in the bmw x5 to " complete the deal " as agreed on wednesday .
the three men were immediately arrested .
police said two of the three men aged 33 to 46 have a criminal history involving fraud and narcotics .
police said they had started analyzing computers and other evidence but so far no videos had been found .
not the first copy-cat attempt this is not the first copy-cat attempt to extort germany 's richest woman .
a munich newspaper reported that in march this year , klatten had received a letter from someone claiming to be sgarbi 's prison inmate who had told him where the sex-videos were hidden .
he had " only " demanded 75,000 euros .
klatten did not hesitate to pass the letter on to the authorities .
" we have a 100 percent success rate in catching any would-be blackmailers , " warned steinkraus-koch .
44-year old swiss national helg sgarbi is currently serving a six-year prison term for blackmailing the billionairess . the former investment banker met klatten in a luxury hotel in tirol in 2007 and began an affair with her and methodically videoed their private meetings .
sgarbi has refused to provide the names of any accomplices , or say where he has hidden the videos and the seven million euros he received from klatten .
police do have a seven-minute video in their possession but have not said what is on it .
no other videos of klatten and sgarbi have ever been recovered .
" we have not found any videos so far , " said steinkraus-koch .
" we can not rule out however that they do not exist .
we have evidence that they may have been destroyed , but this has not been confirmed . " wl / ap / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

her comments were picked up by a number of german broadcasters , as well as many german newspapers .
but it seems that german media were not the only ones listening : conservative iranian media have now attacked ebadi for the statements she made while at deutsche welle .
" feigning interest " iran 's official news agency , the islamic republic news agency -lrb- irna -rrb- , writes that shirin ebadi has assumed the view of german chancellor angela merkel , feigning in unison with her concerns about freedom and civil rights in iran .
irna adds that on the other hand , ebadil like other western media , remains silent about " murders committed by the zionists and occupiers of palastine . "
it also accuses her of being silent about the " suffering of the poor people in afghanistan and thousands of prisoners in abu ghraib , guantanamo and baghram . "
irna continues : " when ebadi aligns herself with the europeans and other western nations , and criticizes and condemns the iranian government , she provides the western media with luxurious gifts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian authorities closed down the office of ebadi 's human rights group last year iranian internet news agency raja news linked ebadi 's statements to the fatal shooting of neda agha soltan , the young female student whose face became a symbol of the anti-government protests .
raja news writes : " following the unlawful killing of our beloved citizen neda by british agents in iran , mrs ebadi was one of those who published a letter , in unison with dishonest media like deutsche welle and the bbc , accusing the iranian government of being involved in this incident . "
comments misreported during her press conference at deutsche welle , ebadi spoke out clearly against economic sanctions on iran , saying these hurt only the iranian population .
but bultan news , another iranian internet news agency , reported that ebadi had in fact said the opposite .
bultan news quoted ebadi as saying : " if negotiations with iran do not result in democracy , then western countries should impose sanctions on iran . "
it also quoted her as saying that " negotiations are always the best approach - but we ca n't go on negotiating forever . "
such attacks are part of the stardard reperatoire of iran 's conservative media .
over the past few years , president mahmoud ahmedinejad has used the dispute over iran 's nuclear program to distract the population from the country 's economic problems and maintain their support .
the election of us president barack obama has robbed ahmedinejad of his favorite enemy , george w. bush .
the diputed iranian presidential election and the use of violence to put down protests there have further weakened him politically .
now the iranian leadership is apparently seeking to make up lost ground by creating new public enemies .
among those in their sights , apart from britain and france , is germany .
so far , this strategy has n't been successful .

her comments were picked up by a number of german broadcasters , as well as many german newspapers .
but it seems that german media were not the only ones listening : conservative iranian media have now attacked ebadi for the statements she made while at deutsche welle .
" feigning interest " iran 's official news agency , the islamic republic news agency -lrb- irna -rrb- , writes that shirin ebadi has assumed the view of german chancellor angela merkel , feigning in unison with her concerns about freedom and civil rights in iran .
irna adds that on the other hand , ebadil like other western media , remains silent about " murders committed by the zionists and occupiers of palastine . "
it also accuses her of being silent about the " suffering of the poor people in afghanistan and thousands of prisoners in abu ghraib , guantanamo and baghram . "
irna continues : " when ebadi aligns herself with the europeans and other western nations , and criticizes and condemns the iranian government , she provides the western media with luxurious gifts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian authorities closed down the office of ebadi 's human rights group last year iranian internet news agency raja news linked ebadi 's statements to the fatal shooting of neda agha soltan , the young female student whose face became a symbol of the anti-government protests .
raja news writes : " following the unlawful killing of our beloved citizen neda by british agents in iran , mrs ebadi was one of those who published a letter , in unison with dishonest media like deutsche welle and the bbc , accusing the iranian government of being involved in this incident . "
comments misreported during her press conference at deutsche welle , ebadi spoke out clearly against economic sanctions on iran , saying these hurt only the iranian population .
but bultan news , another iranian internet news agency , reported that ebadi had in fact said the opposite .
bultan news quoted ebadi as saying : " if negotiations with iran do not result in democracy , then western countries should impose sanctions on iran . "
it also quoted her as saying that " negotiations are always the best approach - but we ca n't go on negotiating forever . "
such attacks are part of the stardard reperatoire of iran 's conservative media .
over the past few years , president mahmoud ahmedinejad has used the dispute over iran 's nuclear program to distract the population from the country 's economic problems and maintain their support .
the election of us president barack obama has robbed ahmedinejad of his favorite enemy , george w. bush .
the diputed iranian presidential election and the use of violence to put down protests there have further weakened him politically .
now the iranian leadership is apparently seeking to make up lost ground by creating new public enemies .
among those in their sights , apart from britain and france , is germany .
so far , this strategy has n't been successful .
criticism of the election continues in iran itself .
the protests are continuing even though the government has , through the use and threat of violence , managed to keep the demonstrators off the streets . author : jamsheed faroughi / sybille golte -lrb- ca -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the three claimed to have more videos of susanne klatten in trysts with a swiss gigolo . in june this year , the blackmailers had written to susanne klatten and threatened to sell recordings of her with helg sgarbi to the italian media if the mother of three did not hand over 800,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.1 million -rrb- and a bmw x5 luxury sports utility vehicle .
the bwm-heiress immediately contacted the authorities .
police in the northern german city of duisburg " pretended to be acquaintances contacting them on behalf of klatten , " said thomas steinkraus-koch , a spokesman for prosecutors in munich .
police arrived in the bmw x5 to " complete the deal " as agreed on wednesday .
the three men were immediately arrested .
police said two of the three men aged 33 to 46 have a criminal history involving fraud and narcotics .
police said they had started analyzing computers and other evidence but so far no videos had been found .
not the first copy-cat attempt this is not the first copy-cat attempt to extort germany 's richest woman .
a munich newspaper reported that in march this year , klatten had received a letter from someone claiming to be sgarbi 's prison inmate who had told him where the sex-videos were hidden .
he had " only " demanded 75,000 euros .
klatten did not hesitate to pass the letter on to the authorities .

sgarbi has refused to provide the names of any accomplices , or say where he has hidden the videos and the seven million euros he received from klatten .
police do have a seven-minute video in their possession but have not said what is on it .

the three claimed to have more videos of susanne klatten in trysts with a swiss gigolo . in june this year , the blackmailers had written to susanne klatten and threatened to sell recordings of her with helg sgarbi to the italian media if the mother of three did not hand over 800,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.1 million -rrb- and a bmw x5 luxury sports utility vehicle .
the bwm-heiress immediately contacted the authorities .
police in the northern german city of duisburg " pretended to be acquaintances contacting them on behalf of klatten , " said thomas steinkraus-koch , a spokesman for prosecutors in munich .
police arrived in the bmw x5 to " complete the deal " as agreed on wednesday .
the three men were immediately arrested .
police said two of the three men aged 33 to 46 have a criminal history involving fraud and narcotics .
police said they had started analyzing computers and other evidence but so far no videos had been found .
not the first copy-cat attempt this is not the first copy-cat attempt to extort germany 's richest woman .
a munich newspaper reported that in march this year , klatten had received a letter from someone claiming to be sgarbi 's prison inmate who had told him where the sex-videos were hidden .
he had " only " demanded 75,000 euros .
klatten did not hesitate to pass the letter on to the authorities .
" we have a 100 percent success rate in catching any would-be blackmailers , " warned steinkraus-koch .
44-year old swiss national helg sgarbi is currently serving a six-year prison term for blackmailing the billionairess . the former investment banker met klatten in a luxury hotel in tirol in 2007 and began an affair with her and methodically videoed their private meetings .
sgarbi has refused to provide the names of any accomplices , or say where he has hidden the videos and the seven million euros he received from klatten .
police do have a seven-minute video in their possession but have not said what is on it .
no other videos of klatten and sgarbi have ever been recovered .
" we have not found any videos so far , " said steinkraus-koch .

but there are no settlements yet and the moon 's " seas " are bone dry . the earth 's satellite looks really old .
it 's turned completely grey and its face is marked with numerous wrinkles , stains and scars .
it 's visible : it 's been through a lot in its lifespan .
but given it 's been around for some 4 and a half billion years , the moon has aged with dignity .
getting a facelift is out of the question .
and it 's not even necessary – as every four weeks during the new moon phase , the moon is veiled in darkness and ca n't be spotted from earth .
we can see many big dark and lighter areas on the face of the moon .
this is due to the varied landscape on its surface .
some people see a face up there , others claim the pattern looks like a hopping rabbit .
at the time of astronomer galileo galilei , the first observers looking through their telescopes euphorically baptized the dark spots " maria " - the latin word for the seas .
they imagined huge bodies of water sloshing about what poets called the " watery planet " , and they imagined a very special lunar species living on the moon .
all that has become legend , and although astronomers still talk about " maria " , it 's quite clear that the moon is dry as a desert .
bildunterschrift : the near side of the moon looks rugged from ancient meteorite collisions just like an old bookshelf , the moon is covered in thick dust .
today , it has completely congealed .
however our celestial companion looks back at a very turbulent past .
in the first billion years of its existence , just like earth , it was exposed to a tremendous bombardment .
leftover debris from planet formation was abundant , and huge meteorites and whole asteroids were colliding with the surface .
even today , the numerous craters on the moon bear witness to the dramatic impact .
the biggest craters gradually filled up with liquid lava and welled up from what then was the hot liquid core of the moon .
so the dark spots on the moon are actually due to volcanic activity .
and the maria of the moon probably came about roughly 3 billion years ago .
that 's when the worst bombardment with space debris was over , which is why there are relatively few craters in the maria .
the lighter-coloured regions of the moon are called " terrae " , or more commonly just highlands , since they are higher than most maria .
the soil samples collected by the apollo space missions are evidence that once upon a time there was indeed volcanic activity on the moon .
it 's still unclear though how the lava reached the surface of the moon .
possibly it came up through cracks created by the impact of meteorites in the craters .
even the first scientists observing the moon have come up with colorful names for the maria , full of longing for the supposedly paradisiacal conditions on the moon : there are for instance , a sea of mirth , of nectar , of crisis , of clouds and also a ' mare fecunditiatis ' , or the sea of fertility .
bildunterschrift : the first men on the moon put an end to lunar tranquility however , the most well-known dark spot in the near side of the moon – the right eye in the moon 's face – is called mare tranquilitatis , or the sea of tranquillity .
that name is an obvious misconception because four and a half million years later the lunar peace has well and truly been disturbed .
on july 21 , 1969 , neil armstrong took his famous first step on the moon right in the sea of tranquillity .

but there are no settlements yet and the moon 's " seas " are bone dry . the earth 's satellite looks really old .
it 's turned completely grey and its face is marked with numerous wrinkles , stains and scars .
it 's visible : it 's been through a lot in its lifespan .
but given it 's been around for some 4 and a half billion years , the moon has aged with dignity .
getting a facelift is out of the question .
and it 's not even necessary – as every four weeks during the new moon phase , the moon is veiled in darkness and ca n't be spotted from earth .
we can see many big dark and lighter areas on the face of the moon .
this is due to the varied landscape on its surface .
some people see a face up there , others claim the pattern looks like a hopping rabbit .
at the time of astronomer galileo galilei , the first observers looking through their telescopes euphorically baptized the dark spots " maria " - the latin word for the seas .
they imagined huge bodies of water sloshing about what poets called the " watery planet " , and they imagined a very special lunar species living on the moon .
all that has become legend , and although astronomers still talk about " maria " , it 's quite clear that the moon is dry as a desert .
bildunterschrift : the near side of the moon looks rugged from ancient meteorite collisions just like an old bookshelf , the moon is covered in thick dust .
today , it has completely congealed .
however our celestial companion looks back at a very turbulent past .
in the first billion years of its existence , just like earth , it was exposed to a tremendous bombardment .
leftover debris from planet formation was abundant , and huge meteorites and whole asteroids were colliding with the surface .
even today , the numerous craters on the moon bear witness to the dramatic impact .
the biggest craters gradually filled up with liquid lava and welled up from what then was the hot liquid core of the moon .
so the dark spots on the moon are actually due to volcanic activity .
and the maria of the moon probably came about roughly 3 billion years ago .
that 's when the worst bombardment with space debris was over , which is why there are relatively few craters in the maria .
the lighter-coloured regions of the moon are called " terrae " , or more commonly just highlands , since they are higher than most maria .
the soil samples collected by the apollo space missions are evidence that once upon a time there was indeed volcanic activity on the moon .
it 's still unclear though how the lava reached the surface of the moon .
possibly it came up through cracks created by the impact of meteorites in the craters .
even the first scientists observing the moon have come up with colorful names for the maria , full of longing for the supposedly paradisiacal conditions on the moon : there are for instance , a sea of mirth , of nectar , of crisis , of clouds and also a ' mare fecunditiatis ' , or the sea of fertility .
bildunterschrift : the first men on the moon put an end to lunar tranquility however , the most well-known dark spot in the near side of the moon – the right eye in the moon 's face – is called mare tranquilitatis , or the sea of tranquillity .
that name is an obvious misconception because four and a half million years later the lunar peace has well and truly been disturbed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 17.07.2009 little enthusiasm for " us-india 3.0 " in mumbai and delhi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indians are glad hillary clinton is touring india , but really hope for a visit by president obama soon hillary clinton is visiting india for the first time as us secretary of state .
india , which signed an historic nuclear deal with the us under president bush has felt somewhat neglected by the obama administration so far . secretary clinton has announced that us-india relations are entering a new era , which she has called " us-india 3.0 " .
this new phase of bilateral relations would come after a first phase full of mutual distrust during the cold war and a slow rapprochement process under presidents bill clinton and george w. bush .
in her council on foreign relations address in washington this week , clinton said her talks in mumbai and delhi would cover an unprecedentedly wide range of issues .
" we are delighted that our two countries will be engaging in a very broad , comprehensive dialogue .
we believe india has a tremendous opportunity and growing responsibility , which they acknowledge , to play not just a regional role , but a global one as well . "
pakistan is top regional issue the most important regional issue is considered to be pakistan .
india has generally been supportive of the obama administration 's so called afpak -lrb- afghanistan-pakistan -rrb- policies , says chintamani mahapatra , an expert in indo-us relations at delhi 's prestigious jawaharlal nehru university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : combatting islamists in pakistan is a common goal for the us and india but , he adds , there remains disagreement on some issues : " american interest is confined to making pakistan fight the taliban , who are anti-us , anti-west .
and lashkar-e-taiba and other groups of terrorists in pakistan who are fomenting problems in india , both in kashmir and elsewhere , are off the hook . "
india blames lashkar-e-taiba for the mumbai attacks that killed more than 170 people last november and has suspended the " composite dialogue " process with pakistan as a consequence .
however , at this week 's meeting between the two countries ' prime ministers in sharm-el-sheikh , the indian position seemed to have mellowed somewhat .
the us will surely be happy about this , as any indo-pakistani conflict would distract pakistan from fighting the taliban .
observers also expect clinton to try and convince delhi that the kashmir conflict needs more attention .
non-proliferation before leaving for india , the secretary of state also mentioned that she wanted to talk about nuclear non-proliferation .
a tricky affair , since india has never been officially acknowledged as a nuclear power and refuses to sign the non-proliferation treaty , which it regards as discriminatory .
clinton has signalled that the americans are ready to look for innovative solutions : " there is nothing easy about non-proliferation .
i mean , anybody who ever read strobe talbott 's book ‘ engaging india ' knows this is a very difficult issue . "
other difficult issues likely to crop up during clinton 's trip to india include climate change and the " doha round " global trade negotiations .
but clinton is also going to want to simply improve the mood in india .
buttering up the indians chintamani mahapatra says the country has felt neglected by the obama administration so far : " i think the obama administration has marginalized india for quite a few months now .
we understand why it did so because the foreign policy plate of obama was truly overflowing . "
but he adds that at a time when hillary clinton 's clout in the administration is openly questioned in the us , it is not likely that her visit alone will impress the indians .
" we know very well that hillary clinton 's position in the decision-making process in the us is not very strong . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh is expected in washington in september although she has the ear of the president and has taken many foreign policy initiatives , they have not been taken up by the white house , says mahapatra who already talks about a visit of president barack obama to india .
" our prime minister is going to visit the us in september , and he had extended an invitation to president obama .
hopefully , he will come to india not towards the end of his term , but in the middle of his term if he really wants to improve the relationship between the two countries . "
so while there might be no serious conflict between india and the united states right now , there also seems to be little enthusiasm about " us-india 3.0 " .

however , at this week 's meeting between the two countries ' prime ministers in sharm-el-sheikh , the indian position seemed to have mellowed somewhat .
the us will surely be happy about this , as any indo-pakistani conflict would distract pakistan from fighting the taliban .
observers also expect clinton to try and convince delhi that the kashmir conflict needs more attention .
non-proliferation before leaving for india , the secretary of state also mentioned that she wanted to talk about nuclear non-proliferation .
a tricky affair , since india has never been officially acknowledged as a nuclear power and refuses to sign the non-proliferation treaty , which it regards as discriminatory .
clinton has signalled that the americans are ready to look for innovative solutions : " there is nothing easy about non-proliferation .
i mean , anybody who ever read strobe talbott 's book ‘ engaging india ' knows this is a very difficult issue . "
other difficult issues likely to crop up during clinton 's trip to india include climate change and the " doha round " global trade negotiations .
but clinton is also going to want to simply improve the mood in india .
buttering up the indians chintamani mahapatra says the country has felt neglected by the obama administration so far : " i think the obama administration has marginalized india for quite a few months now .
we understand why it did so because the foreign policy plate of obama was truly overflowing . "
but he adds that at a time when hillary clinton 's clout in the administration is openly questioned in the us , it is not likely that her visit alone will impress the indians .
" we know very well that hillary clinton 's position in the decision-making process in the us is not very strong . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh is expected in washington in september although she has the ear of the president and has taken many foreign policy initiatives , they have not been taken up by the white house , says mahapatra who already talks about a visit of president barack obama to india .
" our prime minister is going to visit the us in september , and he had extended an invitation to president obama .
hopefully , he will come to india not towards the end of his term , but in the middle of his term if he really wants to improve the relationship between the two countries . "
so while there might be no serious conflict between india and the united states right now , there also seems to be little enthusiasm about " us-india 3.0 " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 17.07.2009 little enthusiasm for " us-india 3.0 " in mumbai and delhi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indians are glad hillary clinton is touring india , but really hope for a visit by president obama soon hillary clinton is visiting india for the first time as us secretary of state .
india , which signed an historic nuclear deal with the us under president bush has felt somewhat neglected by the obama administration so far . secretary clinton has announced that us-india relations are entering a new era , which she has called " us-india 3.0 " .
this new phase of bilateral relations would come after a first phase full of mutual distrust during the cold war and a slow rapprochement process under presidents bill clinton and george w. bush .
in her council on foreign relations address in washington this week , clinton said her talks in mumbai and delhi would cover an unprecedentedly wide range of issues .
" we are delighted that our two countries will be engaging in a very broad , comprehensive dialogue .
we believe india has a tremendous opportunity and growing responsibility , which they acknowledge , to play not just a regional role , but a global one as well . "
pakistan is top regional issue the most important regional issue is considered to be pakistan .
india has generally been supportive of the obama administration 's so called afpak -lrb- afghanistan-pakistan -rrb- policies , says chintamani mahapatra , an expert in indo-us relations at delhi 's prestigious jawaharlal nehru university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : combatting islamists in pakistan is a common goal for the us and india but , he adds , there remains disagreement on some issues : " american interest is confined to making pakistan fight the taliban , who are anti-us , anti-west .
and lashkar-e-taiba and other groups of terrorists in pakistan who are fomenting problems in india , both in kashmir and elsewhere , are off the hook . "
india blames lashkar-e-taiba for the mumbai attacks that killed more than 170 people last november and has suspended the " composite dialogue " process with pakistan as a consequence .
however , at this week 's meeting between the two countries ' prime ministers in sharm-el-sheikh , the indian position seemed to have mellowed somewhat .
the us will surely be happy about this , as any indo-pakistani conflict would distract pakistan from fighting the taliban .
observers also expect clinton to try and convince delhi that the kashmir conflict needs more attention .
non-proliferation before leaving for india , the secretary of state also mentioned that she wanted to talk about nuclear non-proliferation .
a tricky affair , since india has never been officially acknowledged as a nuclear power and refuses to sign the non-proliferation treaty , which it regards as discriminatory .
clinton has signalled that the americans are ready to look for innovative solutions : " there is nothing easy about non-proliferation .
i mean , anybody who ever read strobe talbott 's book ‘ engaging india ' knows this is a very difficult issue . "
other difficult issues likely to crop up during clinton 's trip to india include climate change and the " doha round " global trade negotiations .
but clinton is also going to want to simply improve the mood in india .
buttering up the indians chintamani mahapatra says the country has felt neglected by the obama administration so far : " i think the obama administration has marginalized india for quite a few months now .
we understand why it did so because the foreign policy plate of obama was truly overflowing . "
but he adds that at a time when hillary clinton 's clout in the administration is openly questioned in the us , it is not likely that her visit alone will impress the indians .
" we know very well that hillary clinton 's position in the decision-making process in the us is not very strong . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh is expected in washington in september although she has the ear of the president and has taken many foreign policy initiatives , they have not been taken up by the white house , says mahapatra who already talks about a visit of president barack obama to india .
" our prime minister is going to visit the us in september , and he had extended an invitation to president obama .
hopefully , he will come to india not towards the end of his term , but in the middle of his term if he really wants to improve the relationship between the two countries . "
so while there might be no serious conflict between india and the united states right now , there also seems to be little enthusiasm about " us-india 3.0 " .

health and public workers , as well as chronically ill people will get the flu shots first . the german health ministry announced on friday that an estimated quarter of germany 's population will be eligible to receive the flu shots .
this confirms reports earlier this week that the government had plans to order 50 million vaccine units against swine flu .
the vaccines will be available from september , to coincide with an expected surge in flu cases .
health state ministers late on thursday agreed that chronically ill patients , health care workers , police officers , fire fighters , public workers and pregnant women can receive the injections first .
two shots are needed for the vaccination to be effective against the -lrb- a -rrb- h1n1 virus .
" the vaccinations are a precautionary measure , " said health ministry spokesman , klaus vater .
" no one can tell how the new virus will develop in the coming weeks . "
despite the priority immunization list , federal health minister ulla schmidt insists that everyone who wants to be vaccinated against swine flu , will be able to do so .
protecting the entire population is expected to cost health insurers an estimated two billion euros .
around 800 infections - none fatal - have been reported in germany .
that 's the third-highest number in europe after britain and spain .
berlin has not said when the remaining population can be vaccinated .
this largely depends on how fast pharmaceutical companies can produce the vaccine .
the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- said up to 4.9 billion doses could be produced in 12 months . the un health body has meanwhile announced that it was no longer counting individual cases of swine flu .
it said the virus is spreading so fast , it can not keep up with all the figures and is now asking national health authorities to only report clusters of severe cases , deaths caused by the new virus , or unusual clinical patterns. wl / reuters / dpa / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 17.07.2009 german designer breathes life into china 's fashion dragon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the michalsky label was the talk of berlin fashion week berlin-based designer michael michalsky has signed a deal with china 's leading sportswear brand for a range earmarked for the chinese market .
he 's among the first german designers to head east , but he wo n't be the last . " china is the most exciting market for fashion right now , " enthuses michael michalsky , the darling of the recent berlin fashion week . " the chinese are really open to fashion , and let 's face it , the future of the world lies in this region , " he says as he reflects on his deal to develop a range of sportswear for the china dongxiang group .
the michalsky label might not yet be in the same league as karl lagerfeld , hugo boss or joop ! , but its namesake has always been ahead of the pack .
" i like to do things differently and i like to be the first , " he says .
" i was the first designer to move to berlin and do major shows here even before it was really on the map .
it 's part of my own nature and the character of both my company and my brand . "
shifting focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael michalsky is pushing fashion 's frontiers in these economically troubled times , thinking outside the box can make all the difference - and michael michalsky has broken with decades of fashion tradition by setting his sights on beijing and shanghai rather than paris and milan .
at the high-end of the industry , he 's one of the first to have woken up to china 's potential as more than a market for established western brands such as louis vuitton , cartier and bmw .
earlier this year , the new york times stated the obvious when it reported that china is now the world 's fastest-growing luxury market , with an estimated $ 7.6 billion in sales in 2008 .
michalsky , in the meantime , had cottoned on to a different , more significant growth - that of the domestic market .
although its love affair with imported luxury is still going strong , china is increasingly fed up being merely a production site for other countries and the home of cheap knock-offs .
these days , it 's keen to foster indigenous brands and to meet its consumer needs under its own steam .
" the domestic chinese market is expanding rapidly , " confirms rené lang , president of the association of german fashion and textile designers .
" until now , china has been known first and foremost as a supplier , but now it has greater spending power , despite the crisis , and there are some very well trained designers and fashion schools .
but they are still in a phase where they tend to rely on foreign help expertise . "
enter michalsky .
after eleven years as global creative director at adidas , he founded his own label in 2006 and his ' real clothes for real people ' approach has done much to establish berlin as an up and coming fashion capital where style reflects the street more than the catwalk . nonetheless , the michalsky label has n't yet managed to turn a profit .
in that respect , it 's in the same boat as many ailing brands .
but while hard-up veteran french labels such as lacroix are busy nursing their wounds and sulkily blaming bankruptcy on the global financial crisis , michael michalsky - like the brave young rookie he is - wasted no time identifying markets not feeling the pinch of recession quite so harshly .
traditional brands might turn their noses up at china , but where others see only a low-end market , the german designer sees real potential : " the dongxiang group is very successful locally , and the company is now looking to expand internationally , " he says .
" to begin with , the line will only be available in china because that 's where they have their own stores , but they 're planning to expand across asia and i do n't see what 's to stop them ending up in other markets futher afield . "
" china is in a transitional phase right now , it 's moving away from imported goods towards home-grown products , " agrees rené lang .
" there 's a burgeoning desire for a more personal cultural identity attached to goods that have been specially produced for the chinese market . "
hot on the heels of jil sander bildunterschrift : jil sander 's clothes are elegant and austere - and big in japan in heading east , michalsky is following in the footsteps of only one other german designer .
in march , jil sander raised eyebrows from madison avenue to avenue montaigne when she teamed up with japanese budget clothing retailer uniqlo .
the company sells $ 30 jeans and $ 15 parkas , and is one of the few companies still thriving despite japan 's recession .
" the challenge for me is to establish premium quality and democratically priced brand uniqlo , " she told reporters in tokyo in spring .
similarly , michalsky showed that he 's not too proud to take his talents wherever they 're most wanted when he launched his mitch & co range for tchibo , a german range of coffee shops that also sells clothing , household items , electronics and electrical appliances .
the collection flopped , but the tie-up helped make michalsky a household name .
unlike many designers , he 's just not that precious .
as far as china is concerned , he shrugs off the qualms some of his colleagues might have about poor working conditions .
" i have n't yet been to any of the dongxiang factories , " he says .
" i 've been to the headquarters and it 's a very modern company and very european in its thinking .
in fact , the chinese factories i 've visited in their past when i was still with my former employer , were surprisingly modern and conditions were good .
they were no different to places i 've visited in italy .
i think conditions have improved a lot . "
image boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are conditions improving in the chinese textile industry ?
rené lang says the same .
" we need to get way from the idea of cheap china , " he stresses .
" standards are changing fast and there 's a growing interest in organic textiles , sustainability and better working conditions .
the situation will inevitably improve the more money starts circulating in the market .
china is trying to shed its bad image . "
as a designer , michalsky has often demonstrated a social conscience , referencing world affairs in his shows with comments on issues such as the hypocrisy of left-wing intellectuals , the tyranny of capitalism and the profligacy of wall street .
but with the ink still drying on his latest deal , he 's reluctant to consider the political or economic ramifications of his move into china .
" my message is simply that we are all living in one world and that 's why i wanted to do something in this part of the globe , " he sums up .
" i understand that young people are influenced by the same things all over the world , and i think that 's why i got the job . "

" our passenger costs must fall , " lufthansa spokesperson claudia lange said in a statement , adding that details would be released in the coming weeks .
lufthansa staff were warned in a letter sent by the airline 's new chief executive christoph franz that higher fuel costs and falling passenger numbers posed a serious threat .
" this situation is forcing us to act , " franz wrote in the letter .
" air traffic is mired in the worst crisis in its history , " and the german carrier expected it to last longer than previously anticipated , he added .
the airline would reappraise all its operations , including " structures , projects and processes , " the new chief executive vowed .
after posting a first-quarter loss , lufthansa 's first-half results " will show that this negative trend is continuing , " franz said .
" unless market conditions change , our losses will increase significantly in the coming year owing especially to the rise in fuel prices .
" we must now make ever more determined efforts to counteract the trend , " he stressed , adding : " we have no other alternative but to resort to painful measures . "
analysts have expressed doubts about whether lufthansa can reach its cost-cutting target citing strong resistance from trade unions as one barrier .
the cockpit union which represents pilots has already objected to the airline 's cost-savings plans .
in mid-june , the carrier said slumping passenger and freight traffic would force it to take additional measures to avoid posting a full year loss .
analysts took this to mean job losses with forecasts predicting around 20 percent of the airline 's administrative passenger division being cut in the medium term .

" our passenger costs must fall , " lufthansa spokesperson claudia lange said in a statement , adding that details would be released in the coming weeks .
lufthansa staff were warned in a letter sent by the airline 's new chief executive christoph franz that higher fuel costs and falling passenger numbers posed a serious threat .
" this situation is forcing us to act , " franz wrote in the letter .
" air traffic is mired in the worst crisis in its history , " and the german carrier expected it to last longer than previously anticipated , he added .
the airline would reappraise all its operations , including " structures , projects and processes , " the new chief executive vowed .
after posting a first-quarter loss , lufthansa 's first-half results " will show that this negative trend is continuing , " franz said .
" unless market conditions change , our losses will increase significantly in the coming year owing especially to the rise in fuel prices .
" we must now make ever more determined efforts to counteract the trend , " he stressed , adding : " we have no other alternative but to resort to painful measures . "
analysts have expressed doubts about whether lufthansa can reach its cost-cutting target citing strong resistance from trade unions as one barrier .
the cockpit union which represents pilots has already objected to the airline 's cost-savings plans .
in mid-june , the carrier said slumping passenger and freight traffic would force it to take additional measures to avoid posting a full year loss .
analysts took this to mean job losses with forecasts predicting around 20 percent of the airline 's administrative passenger division being cut in the medium term .
the news of the cost-cutting plans comes as lufthansa continues its effort to take over two european carriers , austrian airlines and the britain 's bmi .

july is shaping up to be one of the deadliest months for international forces fighting in afghanistan in the eight-year history of the conflict .
as of wednesday , at least 46 international troops were killed this month . the increasing death toll has reignited debate in countries such as britain and germany about whether their afghan missions are worth the high cost and new voices in both countries are calling for a reconsideration of troop deployment in a country that seems to be sinking deeper into a quagmire of militant violence . but for international groups on the ground there in the run-up to elections on august 20 , there is no doubt that a continued international presence is needed , and is vital , to ensure that the country has an election that is fair and credible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western and international groups have been helping with voter registration " the stakes are extremely high , the challenges are significant , " said aleem siddique , the united nation 's spokesperson in kabul .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 17.07.2009 aldi advances on wal-mart 's home turf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with revenue dropping in germany , aldi is turing abroad for growth german discounting pioneer aldi is using the economic crisis to expand its presence in the us .
the move could help mitigate the company 's troubles on its home turf . it is something that has n't happened to aldi before : in the midst of a severe economic crisis germany 's discounting pioneer is faced with declining revenues in its home market .
according to data from research company gfk , aldi 's sales in germany declined by about five percent in the first five months of this year while the german retail sector as a whole shrank by only 2.2 percent .
it 's an entirely different story in the united states .
there , aldi is rapidly expanding its reach and expects to open 75 new stores this year .
the discount retailer entered the us market back in 1976 , but its no-frills concept only really started to take off in recent years .
" and of course the current economic crisis is really helping aldi to gain more customers , but is also making some changes in its concept " , explains matthias queck , senior discount analyst at market reseach firm planet retail .
for instance , aldi has added more fresh products , especially produce , to its range of products and has spruced up its stores to make them more attractive to new customers .
while older aldi stores where often located in less affluent neighborhoods , many new stores are located in areas that attract suburban and middle class shoppers as well .
low prices for high price markets aldi traditionally does n't release financial figures , but experts believe the german discount chain is doing quite well in the us and making significant inroads in the retail sector .
how then does aldi compete against us retail behemoth wal-mart on its home turf ?
it 's very simple , say the experts , the same way aldi and other german discounters forced wal-mart to shutter its doors in germany a couple of years ago : low prices and high quality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldi is taking on retail giant wal-mart on his home turf thomas roeb , a retail expert at the university of applied sciences rhine-sieg , argues that while wal-mart is considered a discounter in the us and has an image as a low-price retailer , its general pricing level is still fairly high .
in comparison to wal-mart aldi has a lower cost structure that allows it to become very successful in higher price markets like the united states . " however , the consumers so far did n't really believe in the value proposition of aldi and it is due to the economic crisis right now that people have started to try the concept . "
and , adds roeb , more and more americans give aldi 's no-frills concept a chance and actually find it attractive .
that 's because consumers realize that they can save money when shopping at aldi .
experts estimate that aldi 's prices are generally 10 to 15 percent lower than those of other national us retailers .
how does aldi do that ?
it keeps costs down with a limited range of products , smaller stores , fewer staff , and by not staying open as late as some of its competitors . it has also developed an efficient logistics system and most of the products that it sells are its own brand .
its sheer size allows it to get discounts by buying large quantities . too successful what can happen once aldi 's value proposition catches on in a big way , is evident in germany .
there , so-called " hard discounters " like aldi , account for more than 40 percent of the country 's retail sector .
the discount model has been so successful that aldi 's many competitors in germany are finally taking a bite out of its revenues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , aldi faces stiff competition from other discounters after decades of imitating aldi , says retail expert roeb , its german competitors have finally caught on .
" so it 's less aldi 's loss in the german market , it 's less that aldi is doing something wrong , but rather the fact that the competition is doing something right . "
that 's why aldi 's future growth will come mainly from abroad with the us being a prime target for expansion , argues discount expert queck : " just imagine that in the us , aldi has just 1,000 stores spread over 29 states , so that leaves a lot of room for further expansion . "
compare that with the roughly 1,700 stores that aldi sued , the part of the aldi company that manages its us operation , owns in southern and western germany alone and you can imagine the huge growth potential for the discounter in the us .
wal-mart dwarfs aldi despite aldi 's current advances in the us market , the question remains whether it can sustain its growth and customers once the economic malaise is over .
" i do believe that aldi is going to be successful even after the crisis , " says roeb .
" because we have had the same situation in germany and in some western european countries in the past .
everywhere aldi benefitted from economic crises to increase sales and consumers found the selection of products attractive so they found no need to switch back to their former supermarket . "
while aldi in the us with an estimated revenue of about seven billion dollars last year is tiny in comparison to wal-mart with its revenue of 375 billion dollars , the german discounter could challenge wal-mart in a specific segment - food .
wal-mart , says roeb is basically a non-food retailer that carries food as an important part , but not the main attraction of its product range .
" aldi however is a food specialist .
so when we are talking about competition between aldi and wal-mart , we are talking about competition in the field of food .
and i do believe that aldi is going to cause some problems for wal-mart in the future and even today in the area of food . "
that 's because , wal-mart 's image as a discounter in the food segment could be undercut by aldi 's value proposition .

the move could help mitigate the company 's troubles on its home turf . it is something that has n't happened to aldi before : in the midst of a severe economic crisis germany 's discounting pioneer is faced with declining revenues in its home market .
according to data from research company gfk , aldi 's sales in germany declined by about five percent in the first five months of this year while the german retail sector as a whole shrank by only 2.2 percent .
it 's an entirely different story in the united states .
there , aldi is rapidly expanding its reach and expects to open 75 new stores this year .
the discount retailer entered the us market back in 1976 , but its no-frills concept only really started to take off in recent years .
" and of course the current economic crisis is really helping aldi to gain more customers , but is also making some changes in its concept " , explains matthias queck , senior discount analyst at market reseach firm planet retail .
for instance , aldi has added more fresh products , especially produce , to its range of products and has spruced up its stores to make them more attractive to new customers .
while older aldi stores where often located in less affluent neighborhoods , many new stores are located in areas that attract suburban and middle class shoppers as well .
low prices for high price markets aldi traditionally does n't release financial figures , but experts believe the german discount chain is doing quite well in the us and making significant inroads in the retail sector .

" our passenger costs must fall , " lufthansa spokesperson claudia lange said in a statement , adding that details would be released in the coming weeks .
lufthansa staff were warned in a letter sent by the airline 's new chief executive christoph franz that higher fuel costs and falling passenger numbers posed a serious threat .
" this situation is forcing us to act , " franz wrote in the letter .
" air traffic is mired in the worst crisis in its history , " and the german carrier expected it to last longer than previously anticipated , he added .
the airline would reappraise all its operations , including " structures , projects and processes , " the new chief executive vowed .
after posting a first-quarter loss , lufthansa 's first-half results " will show that this negative trend is continuing , " franz said .
" unless market conditions change , our losses will increase significantly in the coming year owing especially to the rise in fuel prices .
" we must now make ever more determined efforts to counteract the trend , " he stressed , adding : " we have no other alternative but to resort to painful measures . "
analysts have expressed doubts about whether lufthansa can reach its cost-cutting target citing strong resistance from trade unions as one barrier .
the cockpit union which represents pilots has already objected to the airline 's cost-savings plans .
in mid-june , the carrier said slumping passenger and freight traffic would force it to take additional measures to avoid posting a full year loss .
analysts took this to mean job losses with forecasts predicting around 20 percent of the airline 's administrative passenger division being cut in the medium term .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 17.07.2009 aldi advances on wal-mart 's home turf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with revenue dropping in germany , aldi is turing abroad for growth german discounting pioneer aldi is using the economic crisis to expand its presence in the us .
the move could help mitigate the company 's troubles on its home turf . it is something that has n't happened to aldi before : in the midst of a severe economic crisis germany 's discounting pioneer is faced with declining revenues in its home market .
according to data from research company gfk , aldi 's sales in germany declined by about five percent in the first five months of this year while the german retail sector as a whole shrank by only 2.2 percent .
it 's an entirely different story in the united states .
there , aldi is rapidly expanding its reach and expects to open 75 new stores this year .
the discount retailer entered the us market back in 1976 , but its no-frills concept only really started to take off in recent years .
" and of course the current economic crisis is really helping aldi to gain more customers , but is also making some changes in its concept " , explains matthias queck , senior discount analyst at market reseach firm planet retail .
for instance , aldi has added more fresh products , especially produce , to its range of products and has spruced up its stores to make them more attractive to new customers .
while older aldi stores where often located in less affluent neighborhoods , many new stores are located in areas that attract suburban and middle class shoppers as well .
low prices for high price markets aldi traditionally does n't release financial figures , but experts believe the german discount chain is doing quite well in the us and making significant inroads in the retail sector .
how then does aldi compete against us retail behemoth wal-mart on its home turf ?
it 's very simple , say the experts , the same way aldi and other german discounters forced wal-mart to shutter its doors in germany a couple of years ago : low prices and high quality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldi is taking on retail giant wal-mart on his home turf thomas roeb , a retail expert at the university of applied sciences rhine-sieg , argues that while wal-mart is considered a discounter in the us and has an image as a low-price retailer , its general pricing level is still fairly high .
in comparison to wal-mart aldi has a lower cost structure that allows it to become very successful in higher price markets like the united states . " however , the consumers so far did n't really believe in the value proposition of aldi and it is due to the economic crisis right now that people have started to try the concept . "
and , adds roeb , more and more americans give aldi 's no-frills concept a chance and actually find it attractive .
that 's because consumers realize that they can save money when shopping at aldi .
experts estimate that aldi 's prices are generally 10 to 15 percent lower than those of other national us retailers .
how does aldi do that ?
it keeps costs down with a limited range of products , smaller stores , fewer staff , and by not staying open as late as some of its competitors . it has also developed an efficient logistics system and most of the products that it sells are its own brand .
its sheer size allows it to get discounts by buying large quantities . too successful what can happen once aldi 's value proposition catches on in a big way , is evident in germany .
there , so-called " hard discounters " like aldi , account for more than 40 percent of the country 's retail sector .
the discount model has been so successful that aldi 's many competitors in germany are finally taking a bite out of its revenues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , aldi faces stiff competition from other discounters after decades of imitating aldi , says retail expert roeb , its german competitors have finally caught on .
" so it 's less aldi 's loss in the german market , it 's less that aldi is doing something wrong , but rather the fact that the competition is doing something right . "
that 's why aldi 's future growth will come mainly from abroad with the us being a prime target for expansion , argues discount expert queck : " just imagine that in the us , aldi has just 1,000 stores spread over 29 states , so that leaves a lot of room for further expansion . "
compare that with the roughly 1,700 stores that aldi sued , the part of the aldi company that manages its us operation , owns in southern and western germany alone and you can imagine the huge growth potential for the discounter in the us .
wal-mart dwarfs aldi despite aldi 's current advances in the us market , the question remains whether it can sustain its growth and customers once the economic malaise is over .
" i do believe that aldi is going to be successful even after the crisis , " says roeb .
" because we have had the same situation in germany and in some western european countries in the past .
everywhere aldi benefitted from economic crises to increase sales and consumers found the selection of products attractive so they found no need to switch back to their former supermarket . "
while aldi in the us with an estimated revenue of about seven billion dollars last year is tiny in comparison to wal-mart with its revenue of 375 billion dollars , the german discounter could challenge wal-mart in a specific segment - food .
wal-mart , says roeb is basically a non-food retailer that carries food as an important part , but not the main attraction of its product range .
" aldi however is a food specialist .
so when we are talking about competition between aldi and wal-mart , we are talking about competition in the field of food .
and i do believe that aldi is going to cause some problems for wal-mart in the future and even today in the area of food . "
that 's because , wal-mart 's image as a discounter in the food segment could be undercut by aldi 's value proposition .
and that , adds roeb , might end up having a negative impact on wal-mart 's public image . author : michael knigge editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

her comments were picked up by a number of german broadcasters , as well as many german newspapers .
but it seems that german media were not the only ones listening : conservative iranian media have now attacked ebadi for the statements she made while at deutsche welle .
" feigning interest " iran 's official news agency , the islamic republic news agency -lrb- irna -rrb- , writes that shirin ebadi has assumed the view of german chancellor angela merkel , feigning in unison with her concerns about freedom and civil rights in iran .
irna adds that on the other hand , ebadil like other western media , remains silent about " murders committed by the zionists and occupiers of palastine . "
it also accuses her of being silent about the " suffering of the poor people in afghanistan and thousands of prisoners in abu ghraib , guantanamo and baghram . "
irna continues : " when ebadi aligns herself with the europeans and other western nations , and criticizes and condemns the iranian government , she provides the western media with luxurious gifts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian authorities closed down the office of ebadi 's human rights group last year iranian internet news agency raja news linked ebadi 's statements to the fatal shooting of neda agha soltan , the young female student whose face became a symbol of the anti-government protests .
raja news writes : " following the unlawful killing of our beloved citizen neda by british agents in iran , mrs ebadi was one of those who published a letter , in unison with dishonest media like deutsche welle and the bbc , accusing the iranian government of being involved in this incident . "
comments misreported during her press conference at deutsche welle , ebadi spoke out clearly against economic sanctions on iran , saying these hurt only the iranian population .
but bultan news , another iranian internet news agency , reported that ebadi had in fact said the opposite .
bultan news quoted ebadi as saying : " if negotiations with iran do not result in democracy , then western countries should impose sanctions on iran . "
it also quoted her as saying that " negotiations are always the best approach - but we ca n't go on negotiating forever . "
such attacks are part of the stardard reperatoire of iran 's conservative media .
over the past few years , president mahmoud ahmedinejad has used the dispute over iran 's nuclear program to distract the population from the country 's economic problems and maintain their support .
the election of us president barack obama has robbed ahmedinejad of his favorite enemy , george w. bush .
the diputed iranian presidential election and the use of violence to put down protests there have further weakened him politically .
now the iranian leadership is apparently seeking to make up lost ground by creating new public enemies .
among those in their sights , apart from britain and france , is germany .
so far , this strategy has n't been successful .
criticism of the election continues in iran itself .
the protests are continuing even though the government has , through the use and threat of violence , managed to keep the demonstrators off the streets . author : jamsheed faroughi / sybille golte -lrb- ca -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" our passenger costs must fall , " lufthansa spokesperson claudia lange said in a statement , adding that details would be released in the coming weeks .
lufthansa staff were warned in a letter sent by the airline 's new chief executive christoph franz that higher fuel costs and falling passenger numbers posed a serious threat .
" this situation is forcing us to act , " franz wrote in the letter .
" air traffic is mired in the worst crisis in its history , " and the german carrier expected it to last longer than previously anticipated , he added .
the airline would reappraise all its operations , including " structures , projects and processes , " the new chief executive vowed .
after posting a first-quarter loss , lufthansa 's first-half results " will show that this negative trend is continuing , " franz said .
" unless market conditions change , our losses will increase significantly in the coming year owing especially to the rise in fuel prices .
" we must now make ever more determined efforts to counteract the trend , " he stressed , adding : " we have no other alternative but to resort to painful measures . "
analysts have expressed doubts about whether lufthansa can reach its cost-cutting target citing strong resistance from trade unions as one barrier .
the cockpit union which represents pilots has already objected to the airline 's cost-savings plans .
in mid-june , the carrier said slumping passenger and freight traffic would force it to take additional measures to avoid posting a full year loss .
analysts took this to mean job losses with forecasts predicting around 20 percent of the airline 's administrative passenger division being cut in the medium term .
the news of the cost-cutting plans comes as lufthansa continues its effort to take over two european carriers , austrian airlines and the britain 's bmi .

her comments were picked up by a number of german broadcasters , as well as many german newspapers .
but it seems that german media were not the only ones listening : conservative iranian media have now attacked ebadi for the statements she made while at deutsche welle .
" feigning interest " iran 's official news agency , the islamic republic news agency -lrb- irna -rrb- , writes that shirin ebadi has assumed the view of german chancellor angela merkel , feigning in unison with her concerns about freedom and civil rights in iran .
irna adds that on the other hand , ebadil like other western media , remains silent about " murders committed by the zionists and occupiers of palastine . "
it also accuses her of being silent about the " suffering of the poor people in afghanistan and thousands of prisoners in abu ghraib , guantanamo and baghram . "
irna continues : " when ebadi aligns herself with the europeans and other western nations , and criticizes and condemns the iranian government , she provides the western media with luxurious gifts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian authorities closed down the office of ebadi 's human rights group last year iranian internet news agency raja news linked ebadi 's statements to the fatal shooting of neda agha soltan , the young female student whose face became a symbol of the anti-government protests .
raja news writes : " following the unlawful killing of our beloved citizen neda by british agents in iran , mrs ebadi was one of those who published a letter , in unison with dishonest media like deutsche welle and the bbc , accusing the iranian government of being involved in this incident . "
comments misreported during her press conference at deutsche welle , ebadi spoke out clearly against economic sanctions on iran , saying these hurt only the iranian population .
but bultan news , another iranian internet news agency , reported that ebadi had in fact said the opposite .
bultan news quoted ebadi as saying : " if negotiations with iran do not result in democracy , then western countries should impose sanctions on iran . "
it also quoted her as saying that " negotiations are always the best approach - but we ca n't go on negotiating forever . "
such attacks are part of the stardard reperatoire of iran 's conservative media .
over the past few years , president mahmoud ahmedinejad has used the dispute over iran 's nuclear program to distract the population from the country 's economic problems and maintain their support .
the election of us president barack obama has robbed ahmedinejad of his favorite enemy , george w. bush .
the diputed iranian presidential election and the use of violence to put down protests there have further weakened him politically .
now the iranian leadership is apparently seeking to make up lost ground by creating new public enemies .
among those in their sights , apart from britain and france , is germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 17.07.2009 international groups step up to help with afghan election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan will be holding crucial elections on august 20 the security situation in afghanistan is deteriorating as elections approach .
while national governments debate their afghan missions , international groups are working on the ground to ensure a free and fair election . the drumbeat of bad news out of afghanistan continues unabated .
july is shaping up to be one of the deadliest months for international forces fighting in afghanistan in the eight-year history of the conflict .
as of wednesday , at least 46 international troops were killed this month . the increasing death toll has reignited debate in countries such as britain and germany about whether their afghan missions are worth the high cost and new voices in both countries are calling for a reconsideration of troop deployment in a country that seems to be sinking deeper into a quagmire of militant violence . but for international groups on the ground there in the run-up to elections on august 20 , there is no doubt that a continued international presence is needed , and is vital , to ensure that the country has an election that is fair and credible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western and international groups have been helping with voter registration " the stakes are extremely high , the challenges are significant , " said aleem siddique , the united nation 's spokesperson in kabul . "
afghanistan deserves the best leaders it can possibly obtain .
the afghan people are looking to the international community to provide that oversight to ensure their rights are protected . " this is the first time the afghans are running their own presidential election .
the independent election commission of afghanistan is in charge of the polling , but the un is providing support in the run-up to the vote . the un development program is giving the election commission logistics support and is also helping train afghan police who will guard polling stations across the country on august 20 .
the global body is behind a team of 1,600 so-called civic educators , afghans who are fanning out across the country to introduce the population to the democratic process – an idea very foreign to many . " what we want to see is a process that is credible to the afghans because we are talking about a very young democracy that is still in infant shoes , " said christiane hohmann , spokeswoman for the eu 's external relations section . european commitments the european commission announced late last week that it is sending about 100 election monitors to the country – 16 are on the ground now , the rest will go just before election day . all in all , the eu is spending 40 million euros on afghan election support – money that goes to train eu and afghan election monitors and helps with practicalities , like printing up ballot sheets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan policeman stands guard as officials put up election posters near kabul " the immediate priority is naturally to ensure that the upcoming presidential election brings the necessary legitimacy needed to the new government , " european commissioner for external relations benita ferrero-waldner said in a speech at a donor conference on afghanistan in march . the organization for security and cooperation in europe is sending some 20 experts to kabul at the end of this month to provide technical assistance with voter registration , vote counting and tabulation , and domestic observation teams .
while afghanistan is outside the osce 's normal purview , it is looking at helping find ways to maintain long-term political in the country . " there is a lot of international support for this election and a lot of expertise is in the country , a lot of know-how , " said jens-hagen eschenbächer of the osce 's office for democratic institutions and human rights .
" we provide advice how these structures can be integrated to make the election process more sustainable . " german fears and hopes the german presence in afghanistan is considerable .
it has 3,830 troops in afghanistan as part of the nato-led international security assistance force and has been active in training afghan police . bildunterschrift : as the german death toll in afghanistan has risen , support at home is falling but support for the mission there in germany has been slipping .
according to a recent poll by german public broadcaster zdf , 55 percent of germans are not in favor of the peacekeeping mission there while 42 percent support the operation . the country has also been involved in economic reconstruction projects through its gtz technical aid organization .
despite the worsening security situation , the group 's afghan director andreas clausing said from kabul that the upcoming elections are something of a light at the end of the tunnel . " i think it is a very positive step , " he said , adding that " we and our afghan partners are looking very hopefully forward .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 17.07.2009 aldi advances on wal-mart 's home turf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with revenue dropping in germany , aldi is turing abroad for growth german discounting pioneer aldi is using the economic crisis to expand its presence in the us .
the move could help mitigate the company 's troubles on its home turf . it is something that has n't happened to aldi before : in the midst of a severe economic crisis germany 's discounting pioneer is faced with declining revenues in its home market .
according to data from research company gfk , aldi 's sales in germany declined by about five percent in the first five months of this year while the german retail sector as a whole shrank by only 2.2 percent .
it 's an entirely different story in the united states .
there , aldi is rapidly expanding its reach and expects to open 75 new stores this year .
the discount retailer entered the us market back in 1976 , but its no-frills concept only really started to take off in recent years .
" and of course the current economic crisis is really helping aldi to gain more customers , but is also making some changes in its concept " , explains matthias queck , senior discount analyst at market reseach firm planet retail .
for instance , aldi has added more fresh products , especially produce , to its range of products and has spruced up its stores to make them more attractive to new customers .
while older aldi stores where often located in less affluent neighborhoods , many new stores are located in areas that attract suburban and middle class shoppers as well .
low prices for high price markets aldi traditionally does n't release financial figures , but experts believe the german discount chain is doing quite well in the us and making significant inroads in the retail sector .
how then does aldi compete against us retail behemoth wal-mart on its home turf ?
it 's very simple , say the experts , the same way aldi and other german discounters forced wal-mart to shutter its doors in germany a couple of years ago : low prices and high quality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldi is taking on retail giant wal-mart on his home turf thomas roeb , a retail expert at the university of applied sciences rhine-sieg , argues that while wal-mart is considered a discounter in the us and has an image as a low-price retailer , its general pricing level is still fairly high .
in comparison to wal-mart aldi has a lower cost structure that allows it to become very successful in higher price markets like the united states . " however , the consumers so far did n't really believe in the value proposition of aldi and it is due to the economic crisis right now that people have started to try the concept . "
and , adds roeb , more and more americans give aldi 's no-frills concept a chance and actually find it attractive .
that 's because consumers realize that they can save money when shopping at aldi .
experts estimate that aldi 's prices are generally 10 to 15 percent lower than those of other national us retailers .
how does aldi do that ?
it keeps costs down with a limited range of products , smaller stores , fewer staff , and by not staying open as late as some of its competitors . it has also developed an efficient logistics system and most of the products that it sells are its own brand .
its sheer size allows it to get discounts by buying large quantities . too successful what can happen once aldi 's value proposition catches on in a big way , is evident in germany .
there , so-called " hard discounters " like aldi , account for more than 40 percent of the country 's retail sector .
the discount model has been so successful that aldi 's many competitors in germany are finally taking a bite out of its revenues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , aldi faces stiff competition from other discounters after decades of imitating aldi , says retail expert roeb , its german competitors have finally caught on .
" so it 's less aldi 's loss in the german market , it 's less that aldi is doing something wrong , but rather the fact that the competition is doing something right . "
that 's why aldi 's future growth will come mainly from abroad with the us being a prime target for expansion , argues discount expert queck : " just imagine that in the us , aldi has just 1,000 stores spread over 29 states , so that leaves a lot of room for further expansion . "
compare that with the roughly 1,700 stores that aldi sued , the part of the aldi company that manages its us operation , owns in southern and western germany alone and you can imagine the huge growth potential for the discounter in the us .
wal-mart dwarfs aldi despite aldi 's current advances in the us market , the question remains whether it can sustain its growth and customers once the economic malaise is over .
" i do believe that aldi is going to be successful even after the crisis , " says roeb .
" because we have had the same situation in germany and in some western european countries in the past .
everywhere aldi benefitted from economic crises to increase sales and consumers found the selection of products attractive so they found no need to switch back to their former supermarket . "
while aldi in the us with an estimated revenue of about seven billion dollars last year is tiny in comparison to wal-mart with its revenue of 375 billion dollars , the german discounter could challenge wal-mart in a specific segment - food .
wal-mart , says roeb is basically a non-food retailer that carries food as an important part , but not the main attraction of its product range .
" aldi however is a food specialist .
so when we are talking about competition between aldi and wal-mart , we are talking about competition in the field of food .
and i do believe that aldi is going to cause some problems for wal-mart in the future and even today in the area of food . "
that 's because , wal-mart 's image as a discounter in the food segment could be undercut by aldi 's value proposition .
and that , adds roeb , might end up having a negative impact on wal-mart 's public image . author : michael knigge editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

her comments were picked up by a number of german broadcasters , as well as many german newspapers .
but it seems that german media were not the only ones listening : conservative iranian media have now attacked ebadi for the statements she made while at deutsche welle .
" feigning interest " iran 's official news agency , the islamic republic news agency -lrb- irna -rrb- , writes that shirin ebadi has assumed the view of german chancellor angela merkel , feigning in unison with her concerns about freedom and civil rights in iran .
irna adds that on the other hand , ebadil like other western media , remains silent about " murders committed by the zionists and occupiers of palastine . "
it also accuses her of being silent about the " suffering of the poor people in afghanistan and thousands of prisoners in abu ghraib , guantanamo and baghram . "
irna continues : " when ebadi aligns herself with the europeans and other western nations , and criticizes and condemns the iranian government , she provides the western media with luxurious gifts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian authorities closed down the office of ebadi 's human rights group last year iranian internet news agency raja news linked ebadi 's statements to the fatal shooting of neda agha soltan , the young female student whose face became a symbol of the anti-government protests .
raja news writes : " following the unlawful killing of our beloved citizen neda by british agents in iran , mrs ebadi was one of those who published a letter , in unison with dishonest media like deutsche welle and the bbc , accusing the iranian government of being involved in this incident . "
comments misreported during her press conference at deutsche welle , ebadi spoke out clearly against economic sanctions on iran , saying these hurt only the iranian population .
but bultan news , another iranian internet news agency , reported that ebadi had in fact said the opposite .
bultan news quoted ebadi as saying : " if negotiations with iran do not result in democracy , then western countries should impose sanctions on iran . "
it also quoted her as saying that " negotiations are always the best approach - but we ca n't go on negotiating forever . "
such attacks are part of the stardard reperatoire of iran 's conservative media .
over the past few years , president mahmoud ahmedinejad has used the dispute over iran 's nuclear program to distract the population from the country 's economic problems and maintain their support .
the election of us president barack obama has robbed ahmedinejad of his favorite enemy , george w. bush .
the diputed iranian presidential election and the use of violence to put down protests there have further weakened him politically .
now the iranian leadership is apparently seeking to make up lost ground by creating new public enemies .
among those in their sights , apart from britain and france , is germany .
so far , this strategy has n't been successful .
criticism of the election continues in iran itself .

her comments were picked up by a number of german broadcasters , as well as many german newspapers .
but it seems that german media were not the only ones listening : conservative iranian media have now attacked ebadi for the statements she made while at deutsche welle .
" feigning interest " iran 's official news agency , the islamic republic news agency -lrb- irna -rrb- , writes that shirin ebadi has assumed the view of german chancellor angela merkel , feigning in unison with her concerns about freedom and civil rights in iran .
irna adds that on the other hand , ebadil like other western media , remains silent about " murders committed by the zionists and occupiers of palastine . "
it also accuses her of being silent about the " suffering of the poor people in afghanistan and thousands of prisoners in abu ghraib , guantanamo and baghram . "
irna continues : " when ebadi aligns herself with the europeans and other western nations , and criticizes and condemns the iranian government , she provides the western media with luxurious gifts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian authorities closed down the office of ebadi 's human rights group last year iranian internet news agency raja news linked ebadi 's statements to the fatal shooting of neda agha soltan , the young female student whose face became a symbol of the anti-government protests .
raja news writes : " following the unlawful killing of our beloved citizen neda by british agents in iran , mrs ebadi was one of those who published a letter , in unison with dishonest media like deutsche welle and the bbc , accusing the iranian government of being involved in this incident . "
comments misreported during her press conference at deutsche welle , ebadi spoke out clearly against economic sanctions on iran , saying these hurt only the iranian population .
but bultan news , another iranian internet news agency , reported that ebadi had in fact said the opposite .
bultan news quoted ebadi as saying : " if negotiations with iran do not result in democracy , then western countries should impose sanctions on iran . "
it also quoted her as saying that " negotiations are always the best approach - but we ca n't go on negotiating forever . "
such attacks are part of the stardard reperatoire of iran 's conservative media .
over the past few years , president mahmoud ahmedinejad has used the dispute over iran 's nuclear program to distract the population from the country 's economic problems and maintain their support .
the election of us president barack obama has robbed ahmedinejad of his favorite enemy , george w. bush .
the diputed iranian presidential election and the use of violence to put down protests there have further weakened him politically .
now the iranian leadership is apparently seeking to make up lost ground by creating new public enemies .
among those in their sights , apart from britain and france , is germany .
so far , this strategy has n't been successful .
criticism of the election continues in iran itself .
the protests are continuing even though the government has , through the use and threat of violence , managed to keep the demonstrators off the streets . author : jamsheed faroughi / sybille golte -lrb- ca -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

her comments were picked up by a number of german broadcasters , as well as many german newspapers .
but it seems that german media were not the only ones listening : conservative iranian media have now attacked ebadi for the statements she made while at deutsche welle .
" feigning interest " iran 's official news agency , the islamic republic news agency -lrb- irna -rrb- , writes that shirin ebadi has assumed the view of german chancellor angela merkel , feigning in unison with her concerns about freedom and civil rights in iran .
irna adds that on the other hand , ebadil like other western media , remains silent about " murders committed by the zionists and occupiers of palastine . "
it also accuses her of being silent about the " suffering of the poor people in afghanistan and thousands of prisoners in abu ghraib , guantanamo and baghram . "
irna continues : " when ebadi aligns herself with the europeans and other western nations , and criticizes and condemns the iranian government , she provides the western media with luxurious gifts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian authorities closed down the office of ebadi 's human rights group last year iranian internet news agency raja news linked ebadi 's statements to the fatal shooting of neda agha soltan , the young female student whose face became a symbol of the anti-government protests .
raja news writes : " following the unlawful killing of our beloved citizen neda by british agents in iran , mrs ebadi was one of those who published a letter , in unison with dishonest media like deutsche welle and the bbc , accusing the iranian government of being involved in this incident . "
comments misreported during her press conference at deutsche welle , ebadi spoke out clearly against economic sanctions on iran , saying these hurt only the iranian population .
but bultan news , another iranian internet news agency , reported that ebadi had in fact said the opposite .
bultan news quoted ebadi as saying : " if negotiations with iran do not result in democracy , then western countries should impose sanctions on iran . "
it also quoted her as saying that " negotiations are always the best approach - but we ca n't go on negotiating forever . "
such attacks are part of the stardard reperatoire of iran 's conservative media .
over the past few years , president mahmoud ahmedinejad has used the dispute over iran 's nuclear program to distract the population from the country 's economic problems and maintain their support .
the election of us president barack obama has robbed ahmedinejad of his favorite enemy , george w. bush .
the diputed iranian presidential election and the use of violence to put down protests there have further weakened him politically .
now the iranian leadership is apparently seeking to make up lost ground by creating new public enemies .
among those in their sights , apart from britain and france , is germany .
so far , this strategy has n't been successful .
criticism of the election continues in iran itself .
the protests are continuing even though the government has , through the use and threat of violence , managed to keep the demonstrators off the streets . author : jamsheed faroughi / sybille golte -lrb- ca -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 17.07.2009 german designer breathes life into china 's fashion dragon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the michalsky label was the talk of berlin fashion week berlin-based designer michael michalsky has signed a deal with china 's leading sportswear brand for a range earmarked for the chinese market .
he 's among the first german designers to head east , but he wo n't be the last . " china is the most exciting market for fashion right now , " enthuses michael michalsky , the darling of the recent berlin fashion week . " the chinese are really open to fashion , and let 's face it , the future of the world lies in this region , " he says as he reflects on his deal to develop a range of sportswear for the china dongxiang group .
the michalsky label might not yet be in the same league as karl lagerfeld , hugo boss or joop ! , but its namesake has always been ahead of the pack .
" i like to do things differently and i like to be the first , " he says .
" i was the first designer to move to berlin and do major shows here even before it was really on the map .
it 's part of my own nature and the character of both my company and my brand . "
shifting focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael michalsky is pushing fashion 's frontiers in these economically troubled times , thinking outside the box can make all the difference - and michael michalsky has broken with decades of fashion tradition by setting his sights on beijing and shanghai rather than paris and milan .
at the high-end of the industry , he 's one of the first to have woken up to china 's potential as more than a market for established western brands such as louis vuitton , cartier and bmw .
earlier this year , the new york times stated the obvious when it reported that china is now the world 's fastest-growing luxury market , with an estimated $ 7.6 billion in sales in 2008 .
michalsky , in the meantime , had cottoned on to a different , more significant growth - that of the domestic market .
although its love affair with imported luxury is still going strong , china is increasingly fed up being merely a production site for other countries and the home of cheap knock-offs .
these days , it 's keen to foster indigenous brands and to meet its consumer needs under its own steam .
" the domestic chinese market is expanding rapidly , " confirms rené lang , president of the association of german fashion and textile designers .
" until now , china has been known first and foremost as a supplier , but now it has greater spending power , despite the crisis , and there are some very well trained designers and fashion schools .
but they are still in a phase where they tend to rely on foreign help expertise . "
enter michalsky .
after eleven years as global creative director at adidas , he founded his own label in 2006 and his ' real clothes for real people ' approach has done much to establish berlin as an up and coming fashion capital where style reflects the street more than the catwalk . nonetheless , the michalsky label has n't yet managed to turn a profit .
in that respect , it 's in the same boat as many ailing brands .
but while hard-up veteran french labels such as lacroix are busy nursing their wounds and sulkily blaming bankruptcy on the global financial crisis , michael michalsky - like the brave young rookie he is - wasted no time identifying markets not feeling the pinch of recession quite so harshly .
traditional brands might turn their noses up at china , but where others see only a low-end market , the german designer sees real potential : " the dongxiang group is very successful locally , and the company is now looking to expand internationally , " he says .
" to begin with , the line will only be available in china because that 's where they have their own stores , but they 're planning to expand across asia and i do n't see what 's to stop them ending up in other markets futher afield . "
" china is in a transitional phase right now , it 's moving away from imported goods towards home-grown products , " agrees rené lang .
" there 's a burgeoning desire for a more personal cultural identity attached to goods that have been specially produced for the chinese market . "
hot on the heels of jil sander bildunterschrift : jil sander 's clothes are elegant and austere - and big in japan in heading east , michalsky is following in the footsteps of only one other german designer .
in march , jil sander raised eyebrows from madison avenue to avenue montaigne when she teamed up with japanese budget clothing retailer uniqlo .
the company sells $ 30 jeans and $ 15 parkas , and is one of the few companies still thriving despite japan 's recession .
" the challenge for me is to establish premium quality and democratically priced brand uniqlo , " she told reporters in tokyo in spring .
similarly , michalsky showed that he 's not too proud to take his talents wherever they 're most wanted when he launched his mitch & co range for tchibo , a german range of coffee shops that also sells clothing , household items , electronics and electrical appliances .
the collection flopped , but the tie-up helped make michalsky a household name .
unlike many designers , he 's just not that precious .
as far as china is concerned , he shrugs off the qualms some of his colleagues might have about poor working conditions .
" i have n't yet been to any of the dongxiang factories , " he says .
" i 've been to the headquarters and it 's a very modern company and very european in its thinking .
in fact , the chinese factories i 've visited in their past when i was still with my former employer , were surprisingly modern and conditions were good .
they were no different to places i 've visited in italy .
i think conditions have improved a lot . "
image boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are conditions improving in the chinese textile industry ?
rené lang says the same .
" we need to get way from the idea of cheap china , " he stresses .
" standards are changing fast and there 's a growing interest in organic textiles , sustainability and better working conditions .
the situation will inevitably improve the more money starts circulating in the market .
china is trying to shed its bad image . "
as a designer , michalsky has often demonstrated a social conscience , referencing world affairs in his shows with comments on issues such as the hypocrisy of left-wing intellectuals , the tyranny of capitalism and the profligacy of wall street .
but with the ink still drying on his latest deal , he 's reluctant to consider the political or economic ramifications of his move into china .
" my message is simply that we are all living in one world and that 's why i wanted to do something in this part of the globe , " he sums up .
" i understand that young people are influenced by the same things all over the world , and i think that 's why i got the job . "

in march , jil sander raised eyebrows from madison avenue to avenue montaigne when she teamed up with japanese budget clothing retailer uniqlo .
the company sells $ 30 jeans and $ 15 parkas , and is one of the few companies still thriving despite japan 's recession .
" the challenge for me is to establish premium quality and democratically priced brand uniqlo , " she told reporters in tokyo in spring .
similarly , michalsky showed that he 's not too proud to take his talents wherever they 're most wanted when he launched his mitch & co range for tchibo , a german range of coffee shops that also sells clothing , household items , electronics and electrical appliances .
the collection flopped , but the tie-up helped make michalsky a household name .
unlike many designers , he 's just not that precious .
as far as china is concerned , he shrugs off the qualms some of his colleagues might have about poor working conditions .
" i have n't yet been to any of the dongxiang factories , " he says .
" i 've been to the headquarters and it 's a very modern company and very european in its thinking .
in fact , the chinese factories i 've visited in their past when i was still with my former employer , were surprisingly modern and conditions were good .
they were no different to places i 've visited in italy .
i think conditions have improved a lot . "

" standards are changing fast and there 's a growing interest in organic textiles , sustainability and better working conditions .

china is trying to shed its bad image . "
as a designer , michalsky has often demonstrated a social conscience , referencing world affairs in his shows with comments on issues such as the hypocrisy of left-wing intellectuals , the tyranny of capitalism and the profligacy of wall street .
but with the ink still drying on his latest deal , he 's reluctant to consider the political or economic ramifications of his move into china .
" my message is simply that we are all living in one world and that 's why i wanted to do something in this part of the globe , " he sums up .
" i understand that young people are influenced by the same things all over the world , and i think that 's why i got the job . "

he 's among the first german designers to head east , but he wo n't be the last . " china is the most exciting market for fashion right now , " enthuses michael michalsky , the darling of the recent berlin fashion week . " the chinese are really open to fashion , and let 's face it , the future of the world lies in this region , " he says as he reflects on his deal to develop a range of sportswear for the china dongxiang group .
the michalsky label might not yet be in the same league as karl lagerfeld , hugo boss or joop ! , but its namesake has always been ahead of the pack .
" i like to do things differently and i like to be the first , " he says .
" i was the first designer to move to berlin and do major shows here even before it was really on the map .
it 's part of my own nature and the character of both my company and my brand . "
shifting focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael michalsky is pushing fashion 's frontiers in these economically troubled times , thinking outside the box can make all the difference - and michael michalsky has broken with decades of fashion tradition by setting his sights on beijing and shanghai rather than paris and milan .
at the high-end of the industry , he 's one of the first to have woken up to china 's potential as more than a market for established western brands such as louis vuitton , cartier and bmw .
earlier this year , the new york times stated the obvious when it reported that china is now the world 's fastest-growing luxury market , with an estimated $ 7.6 billion in sales in 2008 .
michalsky , in the meantime , had cottoned on to a different , more significant growth - that of the domestic market .
although its love affair with imported luxury is still going strong , china is increasingly fed up being merely a production site for other countries and the home of cheap knock-offs .
these days , it 's keen to foster indigenous brands and to meet its consumer needs under its own steam .
" the domestic chinese market is expanding rapidly , " confirms rené lang , president of the association of german fashion and textile designers .
" until now , china has been known first and foremost as a supplier , but now it has greater spending power , despite the crisis , and there are some very well trained designers and fashion schools .
but they are still in a phase where they tend to rely on foreign help expertise . "
enter michalsky .
after eleven years as global creative director at adidas , he founded his own label in 2006 and his ' real clothes for real people ' approach has done much to establish berlin as an up and coming fashion capital where style reflects the street more than the catwalk . nonetheless , the michalsky label has n't yet managed to turn a profit .
in that respect , it 's in the same boat as many ailing brands .
but while hard-up veteran french labels such as lacroix are busy nursing their wounds and sulkily blaming bankruptcy on the global financial crisis , michael michalsky - like the brave young rookie he is - wasted no time identifying markets not feeling the pinch of recession quite so harshly .
traditional brands might turn their noses up at china , but where others see only a low-end market , the german designer sees real potential : " the dongxiang group is very successful locally , and the company is now looking to expand internationally , " he says .
" to begin with , the line will only be available in china because that 's where they have their own stores , but they 're planning to expand across asia and i do n't see what 's to stop them ending up in other markets futher afield . "
" china is in a transitional phase right now , it 's moving away from imported goods towards home-grown products , " agrees rené lang .
" there 's a burgeoning desire for a more personal cultural identity attached to goods that have been specially produced for the chinese market . "

but with the ink still drying on his latest deal , he 's reluctant to consider the political or economic ramifications of his move into china .
" my message is simply that we are all living in one world and that 's why i wanted to do something in this part of the globe , " he sums up .

he 's among the first german designers to head east , but he wo n't be the last . " china is the most exciting market for fashion right now , " enthuses michael michalsky , the darling of the recent berlin fashion week . " the chinese are really open to fashion , and let 's face it , the future of the world lies in this region , " he says as he reflects on his deal to develop a range of sportswear for the china dongxiang group .
the michalsky label might not yet be in the same league as karl lagerfeld , hugo boss or joop ! , but its namesake has always been ahead of the pack .
" i like to do things differently and i like to be the first , " he says .
" i was the first designer to move to berlin and do major shows here even before it was really on the map .
it 's part of my own nature and the character of both my company and my brand . "
shifting focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael michalsky is pushing fashion 's frontiers in these economically troubled times , thinking outside the box can make all the difference - and michael michalsky has broken with decades of fashion tradition by setting his sights on beijing and shanghai rather than paris and milan .
at the high-end of the industry , he 's one of the first to have woken up to china 's potential as more than a market for established western brands such as louis vuitton , cartier and bmw .
earlier this year , the new york times stated the obvious when it reported that china is now the world 's fastest-growing luxury market , with an estimated $ 7.6 billion in sales in 2008 .
michalsky , in the meantime , had cottoned on to a different , more significant growth - that of the domestic market .
although its love affair with imported luxury is still going strong , china is increasingly fed up being merely a production site for other countries and the home of cheap knock-offs .
these days , it 's keen to foster indigenous brands and to meet its consumer needs under its own steam .
" the domestic chinese market is expanding rapidly , " confirms rené lang , president of the association of german fashion and textile designers .
" until now , china has been known first and foremost as a supplier , but now it has greater spending power , despite the crisis , and there are some very well trained designers and fashion schools .
but they are still in a phase where they tend to rely on foreign help expertise . "
enter michalsky .
after eleven years as global creative director at adidas , he founded his own label in 2006 and his ' real clothes for real people ' approach has done much to establish berlin as an up and coming fashion capital where style reflects the street more than the catwalk . nonetheless , the michalsky label has n't yet managed to turn a profit .
in that respect , it 's in the same boat as many ailing brands .
but while hard-up veteran french labels such as lacroix are busy nursing their wounds and sulkily blaming bankruptcy on the global financial crisis , michael michalsky - like the brave young rookie he is - wasted no time identifying markets not feeling the pinch of recession quite so harshly .
traditional brands might turn their noses up at china , but where others see only a low-end market , the german designer sees real potential : " the dongxiang group is very successful locally , and the company is now looking to expand internationally , " he says .
" to begin with , the line will only be available in china because that 's where they have their own stores , but they 're planning to expand across asia and i do n't see what 's to stop them ending up in other markets futher afield . "
" china is in a transitional phase right now , it 's moving away from imported goods towards home-grown products , " agrees rené lang .
" there 's a burgeoning desire for a more personal cultural identity attached to goods that have been specially produced for the chinese market . "
hot on the heels of jil sander bildunterschrift : jil sander 's clothes are elegant and austere - and big in japan in heading east , michalsky is following in the footsteps of only one other german designer .
in march , jil sander raised eyebrows from madison avenue to avenue montaigne when she teamed up with japanese budget clothing retailer uniqlo .
the company sells $ 30 jeans and $ 15 parkas , and is one of the few companies still thriving despite japan 's recession .
" the challenge for me is to establish premium quality and democratically priced brand uniqlo , " she told reporters in tokyo in spring .
similarly , michalsky showed that he 's not too proud to take his talents wherever they 're most wanted when he launched his mitch & co range for tchibo , a german range of coffee shops that also sells clothing , household items , electronics and electrical appliances .
the collection flopped , but the tie-up helped make michalsky a household name .
unlike many designers , he 's just not that precious .
as far as china is concerned , he shrugs off the qualms some of his colleagues might have about poor working conditions .
" i have n't yet been to any of the dongxiang factories , " he says .
" i 've been to the headquarters and it 's a very modern company and very european in its thinking .
in fact , the chinese factories i 've visited in their past when i was still with my former employer , were surprisingly modern and conditions were good .
they were no different to places i 've visited in italy .
i think conditions have improved a lot . "
image boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are conditions improving in the chinese textile industry ?
rené lang says the same .
" we need to get way from the idea of cheap china , " he stresses .
" standards are changing fast and there 's a growing interest in organic textiles , sustainability and better working conditions .
the situation will inevitably improve the more money starts circulating in the market .
china is trying to shed its bad image . "
as a designer , michalsky has often demonstrated a social conscience , referencing world affairs in his shows with comments on issues such as the hypocrisy of left-wing intellectuals , the tyranny of capitalism and the profligacy of wall street .
but with the ink still drying on his latest deal , he 's reluctant to consider the political or economic ramifications of his move into china .
" my message is simply that we are all living in one world and that 's why i wanted to do something in this part of the globe , " he sums up .
" i understand that young people are influenced by the same things all over the world , and i think that 's why i got the job . "

health and public workers , as well as chronically ill people will get the flu shots first . the german health ministry announced on friday that an estimated quarter of germany 's population will be eligible to receive the flu shots .
this confirms reports earlier this week that the government had plans to order 50 million vaccine units against swine flu .
the vaccines will be available from september , to coincide with an expected surge in flu cases .
health state ministers late on thursday agreed that chronically ill patients , health care workers , police officers , fire fighters , public workers and pregnant women can receive the injections first .
two shots are needed for the vaccination to be effective against the -lrb- a -rrb- h1n1 virus .
" the vaccinations are a precautionary measure , " said health ministry spokesman , klaus vater .
" no one can tell how the new virus will develop in the coming weeks . "
despite the priority immunization list , federal health minister ulla schmidt insists that everyone who wants to be vaccinated against swine flu , will be able to do so .
protecting the entire population is expected to cost health insurers an estimated two billion euros .
around 800 infections - none fatal - have been reported in germany .
that 's the third-highest number in europe after britain and spain .
berlin has not said when the remaining population can be vaccinated .
this largely depends on how fast pharmaceutical companies can produce the vaccine .
the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- said up to 4.9 billion doses could be produced in 12 months . the un health body has meanwhile announced that it was no longer counting individual cases of swine flu .
it said the virus is spreading so fast , it can not keep up with all the figures and is now asking national health authorities to only report clusters of severe cases , deaths caused by the new virus , or unusual clinical patterns. wl / reuters / dpa / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

health and public workers , as well as chronically ill people will get the flu shots first . the german health ministry announced on friday that an estimated quarter of germany 's population will be eligible to receive the flu shots .
this confirms reports earlier this week that the government had plans to order 50 million vaccine units against swine flu .
the vaccines will be available from september , to coincide with an expected surge in flu cases .
health state ministers late on thursday agreed that chronically ill patients , health care workers , police officers , fire fighters , public workers and pregnant women can receive the injections first .
two shots are needed for the vaccination to be effective against the -lrb- a -rrb- h1n1 virus .
" the vaccinations are a precautionary measure , " said health ministry spokesman , klaus vater .
" no one can tell how the new virus will develop in the coming weeks . "
despite the priority immunization list , federal health minister ulla schmidt insists that everyone who wants to be vaccinated against swine flu , will be able to do so .
protecting the entire population is expected to cost health insurers an estimated two billion euros .
around 800 infections - none fatal - have been reported in germany .
that 's the third-highest number in europe after britain and spain .
berlin has not said when the remaining population can be vaccinated .
this largely depends on how fast pharmaceutical companies can produce the vaccine .
the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- said up to 4.9 billion doses could be produced in 12 months . the un health body has meanwhile announced that it was no longer counting individual cases of swine flu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 17.07.2009 little enthusiasm for " us-india 3.0 " in mumbai and delhi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indians are glad hillary clinton is touring india , but really hope for a visit by president obama soon hillary clinton is visiting india for the first time as us secretary of state .
india , which signed an historic nuclear deal with the us under president bush has felt somewhat neglected by the obama administration so far . secretary clinton has announced that us-india relations are entering a new era , which she has called " us-india 3.0 " .
this new phase of bilateral relations would come after a first phase full of mutual distrust during the cold war and a slow rapprochement process under presidents bill clinton and george w. bush .
in her council on foreign relations address in washington this week , clinton said her talks in mumbai and delhi would cover an unprecedentedly wide range of issues .
" we are delighted that our two countries will be engaging in a very broad , comprehensive dialogue .
we believe india has a tremendous opportunity and growing responsibility , which they acknowledge , to play not just a regional role , but a global one as well . "
pakistan is top regional issue the most important regional issue is considered to be pakistan .
india has generally been supportive of the obama administration 's so called afpak -lrb- afghanistan-pakistan -rrb- policies , says chintamani mahapatra , an expert in indo-us relations at delhi 's prestigious jawaharlal nehru university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : combatting islamists in pakistan is a common goal for the us and india but , he adds , there remains disagreement on some issues : " american interest is confined to making pakistan fight the taliban , who are anti-us , anti-west .
and lashkar-e-taiba and other groups of terrorists in pakistan who are fomenting problems in india , both in kashmir and elsewhere , are off the hook . "
india blames lashkar-e-taiba for the mumbai attacks that killed more than 170 people last november and has suspended the " composite dialogue " process with pakistan as a consequence .
however , at this week 's meeting between the two countries ' prime ministers in sharm-el-sheikh , the indian position seemed to have mellowed somewhat .
the us will surely be happy about this , as any indo-pakistani conflict would distract pakistan from fighting the taliban .
observers also expect clinton to try and convince delhi that the kashmir conflict needs more attention .
non-proliferation before leaving for india , the secretary of state also mentioned that she wanted to talk about nuclear non-proliferation .
a tricky affair , since india has never been officially acknowledged as a nuclear power and refuses to sign the non-proliferation treaty , which it regards as discriminatory .
clinton has signalled that the americans are ready to look for innovative solutions : " there is nothing easy about non-proliferation .
i mean , anybody who ever read strobe talbott 's book ‘ engaging india ' knows this is a very difficult issue . "
other difficult issues likely to crop up during clinton 's trip to india include climate change and the " doha round " global trade negotiations .
but clinton is also going to want to simply improve the mood in india .
buttering up the indians chintamani mahapatra says the country has felt neglected by the obama administration so far : " i think the obama administration has marginalized india for quite a few months now .
we understand why it did so because the foreign policy plate of obama was truly overflowing . "
but he adds that at a time when hillary clinton 's clout in the administration is openly questioned in the us , it is not likely that her visit alone will impress the indians .
" we know very well that hillary clinton 's position in the decision-making process in the us is not very strong . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh is expected in washington in september although she has the ear of the president and has taken many foreign policy initiatives , they have not been taken up by the white house , says mahapatra who already talks about a visit of president barack obama to india .
" our prime minister is going to visit the us in september , and he had extended an invitation to president obama .
hopefully , he will come to india not towards the end of his term , but in the middle of his term if he really wants to improve the relationship between the two countries . "
so while there might be no serious conflict between india and the united states right now , there also seems to be little enthusiasm about " us-india 3.0 " .

india , which signed an historic nuclear deal with the us under president bush has felt somewhat neglected by the obama administration so far . secretary clinton has announced that us-india relations are entering a new era , which she has called " us-india 3.0 " .
this new phase of bilateral relations would come after a first phase full of mutual distrust during the cold war and a slow rapprochement process under presidents bill clinton and george w. bush .
in her council on foreign relations address in washington this week , clinton said her talks in mumbai and delhi would cover an unprecedentedly wide range of issues .
" we are delighted that our two countries will be engaging in a very broad , comprehensive dialogue .
we believe india has a tremendous opportunity and growing responsibility , which they acknowledge , to play not just a regional role , but a global one as well . "
pakistan is top regional issue the most important regional issue is considered to be pakistan .
india has generally been supportive of the obama administration 's so called afpak -lrb- afghanistan-pakistan -rrb- policies , says chintamani mahapatra , an expert in indo-us relations at delhi 's prestigious jawaharlal nehru university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : combatting islamists in pakistan is a common goal for the us and india but , he adds , there remains disagreement on some issues : " american interest is confined to making pakistan fight the taliban , who are anti-us , anti-west .
and lashkar-e-taiba and other groups of terrorists in pakistan who are fomenting problems in india , both in kashmir and elsewhere , are off the hook . "
india blames lashkar-e-taiba for the mumbai attacks that killed more than 170 people last november and has suspended the " composite dialogue " process with pakistan as a consequence .
however , at this week 's meeting between the two countries ' prime ministers in sharm-el-sheikh , the indian position seemed to have mellowed somewhat .
the us will surely be happy about this , as any indo-pakistani conflict would distract pakistan from fighting the taliban .
observers also expect clinton to try and convince delhi that the kashmir conflict needs more attention .
non-proliferation before leaving for india , the secretary of state also mentioned that she wanted to talk about nuclear non-proliferation .
a tricky affair , since india has never been officially acknowledged as a nuclear power and refuses to sign the non-proliferation treaty , which it regards as discriminatory .
clinton has signalled that the americans are ready to look for innovative solutions : " there is nothing easy about non-proliferation .
i mean , anybody who ever read strobe talbott 's book ‘ engaging india ' knows this is a very difficult issue . "
other difficult issues likely to crop up during clinton 's trip to india include climate change and the " doha round " global trade negotiations .
but clinton is also going to want to simply improve the mood in india .
buttering up the indians chintamani mahapatra says the country has felt neglected by the obama administration so far : " i think the obama administration has marginalized india for quite a few months now .
we understand why it did so because the foreign policy plate of obama was truly overflowing . "
but he adds that at a time when hillary clinton 's clout in the administration is openly questioned in the us , it is not likely that her visit alone will impress the indians .
" we know very well that hillary clinton 's position in the decision-making process in the us is not very strong . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh is expected in washington in september although she has the ear of the president and has taken many foreign policy initiatives , they have not been taken up by the white house , says mahapatra who already talks about a visit of president barack obama to india .
" our prime minister is going to visit the us in september , and he had extended an invitation to president obama .
hopefully , he will come to india not towards the end of his term , but in the middle of his term if he really wants to improve the relationship between the two countries . "
so while there might be no serious conflict between india and the united states right now , there also seems to be little enthusiasm about " us-india 3.0 " .

india , which signed an historic nuclear deal with the us under president bush has felt somewhat neglected by the obama administration so far . secretary clinton has announced that us-india relations are entering a new era , which she has called " us-india 3.0 " .
this new phase of bilateral relations would come after a first phase full of mutual distrust during the cold war and a slow rapprochement process under presidents bill clinton and george w. bush .
in her council on foreign relations address in washington this week , clinton said her talks in mumbai and delhi would cover an unprecedentedly wide range of issues .
" we are delighted that our two countries will be engaging in a very broad , comprehensive dialogue .
we believe india has a tremendous opportunity and growing responsibility , which they acknowledge , to play not just a regional role , but a global one as well . "
pakistan is top regional issue the most important regional issue is considered to be pakistan .
india has generally been supportive of the obama administration 's so called afpak -lrb- afghanistan-pakistan -rrb- policies , says chintamani mahapatra , an expert in indo-us relations at delhi 's prestigious jawaharlal nehru university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : combatting islamists in pakistan is a common goal for the us and india but , he adds , there remains disagreement on some issues : " american interest is confined to making pakistan fight the taliban , who are anti-us , anti-west .
and lashkar-e-taiba and other groups of terrorists in pakistan who are fomenting problems in india , both in kashmir and elsewhere , are off the hook . "
india blames lashkar-e-taiba for the mumbai attacks that killed more than 170 people last november and has suspended the " composite dialogue " process with pakistan as a consequence .
however , at this week 's meeting between the two countries ' prime ministers in sharm-el-sheikh , the indian position seemed to have mellowed somewhat .
the us will surely be happy about this , as any indo-pakistani conflict would distract pakistan from fighting the taliban .
observers also expect clinton to try and convince delhi that the kashmir conflict needs more attention .
non-proliferation before leaving for india , the secretary of state also mentioned that she wanted to talk about nuclear non-proliferation .
a tricky affair , since india has never been officially acknowledged as a nuclear power and refuses to sign the non-proliferation treaty , which it regards as discriminatory .
clinton has signalled that the americans are ready to look for innovative solutions : " there is nothing easy about non-proliferation .
i mean , anybody who ever read strobe talbott 's book ‘ engaging india ' knows this is a very difficult issue . "

but there are no settlements yet and the moon 's " seas " are bone dry . the earth 's satellite looks really old .
it 's turned completely grey and its face is marked with numerous wrinkles , stains and scars .
it 's visible : it 's been through a lot in its lifespan .
but given it 's been around for some 4 and a half billion years , the moon has aged with dignity .
getting a facelift is out of the question .
and it 's not even necessary – as every four weeks during the new moon phase , the moon is veiled in darkness and ca n't be spotted from earth .
we can see many big dark and lighter areas on the face of the moon .
this is due to the varied landscape on its surface .
some people see a face up there , others claim the pattern looks like a hopping rabbit .
at the time of astronomer galileo galilei , the first observers looking through their telescopes euphorically baptized the dark spots " maria " - the latin word for the seas .
they imagined huge bodies of water sloshing about what poets called the " watery planet " , and they imagined a very special lunar species living on the moon .
all that has become legend , and although astronomers still talk about " maria " , it 's quite clear that the moon is dry as a desert .
bildunterschrift : the near side of the moon looks rugged from ancient meteorite collisions just like an old bookshelf , the moon is covered in thick dust .
today , it has completely congealed .
however our celestial companion looks back at a very turbulent past .
in the first billion years of its existence , just like earth , it was exposed to a tremendous bombardment .
leftover debris from planet formation was abundant , and huge meteorites and whole asteroids were colliding with the surface .
even today , the numerous craters on the moon bear witness to the dramatic impact .
the biggest craters gradually filled up with liquid lava and welled up from what then was the hot liquid core of the moon .
so the dark spots on the moon are actually due to volcanic activity .
and the maria of the moon probably came about roughly 3 billion years ago .
that 's when the worst bombardment with space debris was over , which is why there are relatively few craters in the maria .
the lighter-coloured regions of the moon are called " terrae " , or more commonly just highlands , since they are higher than most maria .
the soil samples collected by the apollo space missions are evidence that once upon a time there was indeed volcanic activity on the moon .
it 's still unclear though how the lava reached the surface of the moon .
possibly it came up through cracks created by the impact of meteorites in the craters .
even the first scientists observing the moon have come up with colorful names for the maria , full of longing for the supposedly paradisiacal conditions on the moon : there are for instance , a sea of mirth , of nectar , of crisis , of clouds and also a ' mare fecunditiatis ' , or the sea of fertility .
bildunterschrift : the first men on the moon put an end to lunar tranquility however , the most well-known dark spot in the near side of the moon – the right eye in the moon 's face – is called mare tranquilitatis , or the sea of tranquillity .
that name is an obvious misconception because four and a half million years later the lunar peace has well and truly been disturbed .
on july 21 , 1969 , neil armstrong took his famous first step on the moon right in the sea of tranquillity .

but there are no settlements yet and the moon 's " seas " are bone dry . the earth 's satellite looks really old .
it 's turned completely grey and its face is marked with numerous wrinkles , stains and scars .
it 's visible : it 's been through a lot in its lifespan .
but given it 's been around for some 4 and a half billion years , the moon has aged with dignity .
getting a facelift is out of the question .
and it 's not even necessary – as every four weeks during the new moon phase , the moon is veiled in darkness and ca n't be spotted from earth .
we can see many big dark and lighter areas on the face of the moon .
this is due to the varied landscape on its surface .
some people see a face up there , others claim the pattern looks like a hopping rabbit .
at the time of astronomer galileo galilei , the first observers looking through their telescopes euphorically baptized the dark spots " maria " - the latin word for the seas .
they imagined huge bodies of water sloshing about what poets called the " watery planet " , and they imagined a very special lunar species living on the moon .
all that has become legend , and although astronomers still talk about " maria " , it 's quite clear that the moon is dry as a desert .
bildunterschrift : the near side of the moon looks rugged from ancient meteorite collisions just like an old bookshelf , the moon is covered in thick dust .
today , it has completely congealed .
however our celestial companion looks back at a very turbulent past .
in the first billion years of its existence , just like earth , it was exposed to a tremendous bombardment .
leftover debris from planet formation was abundant , and huge meteorites and whole asteroids were colliding with the surface .
even today , the numerous craters on the moon bear witness to the dramatic impact .
the biggest craters gradually filled up with liquid lava and welled up from what then was the hot liquid core of the moon .
so the dark spots on the moon are actually due to volcanic activity .
and the maria of the moon probably came about roughly 3 billion years ago .
that 's when the worst bombardment with space debris was over , which is why there are relatively few craters in the maria .
the lighter-coloured regions of the moon are called " terrae " , or more commonly just highlands , since they are higher than most maria .
the soil samples collected by the apollo space missions are evidence that once upon a time there was indeed volcanic activity on the moon .
it 's still unclear though how the lava reached the surface of the moon .
possibly it came up through cracks created by the impact of meteorites in the craters .
even the first scientists observing the moon have come up with colorful names for the maria , full of longing for the supposedly paradisiacal conditions on the moon : there are for instance , a sea of mirth , of nectar , of crisis , of clouds and also a ' mare fecunditiatis ' , or the sea of fertility .
bildunterschrift : the first men on the moon put an end to lunar tranquility however , the most well-known dark spot in the near side of the moon – the right eye in the moon 's face – is called mare tranquilitatis , or the sea of tranquillity .
that name is an obvious misconception because four and a half million years later the lunar peace has well and truly been disturbed .
on july 21 , 1969 , neil armstrong took his famous first step on the moon right in the sea of tranquillity .

the three claimed to have more videos of susanne klatten in trysts with a swiss gigolo . in june this year , the blackmailers had written to susanne klatten and threatened to sell recordings of her with helg sgarbi to the italian media if the mother of three did not hand over 800,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.1 million -rrb- and a bmw x5 luxury sports utility vehicle .
the bwm-heiress immediately contacted the authorities .
police in the northern german city of duisburg " pretended to be acquaintances contacting them on behalf of klatten , " said thomas steinkraus-koch , a spokesman for prosecutors in munich .
police arrived in the bmw x5 to " complete the deal " as agreed on wednesday .

police said they had started analyzing computers and other evidence but so far no videos had been found .
not the first copy-cat attempt this is not the first copy-cat attempt to extort germany 's richest woman .
a munich newspaper reported that in march this year , klatten had received a letter from someone claiming to be sgarbi 's prison inmate who had told him where the sex-videos were hidden .
he had " only " demanded 75,000 euros .
klatten did not hesitate to pass the letter on to the authorities .

sgarbi has refused to provide the names of any accomplices , or say where he has hidden the videos and the seven million euros he received from klatten .
police do have a seven-minute video in their possession but have not said what is on it .

hossein shariatmadari , editor-in-chief of the kayhan daily , said rafsanjani , a moderate who backed mousavi 's election campaign , had done nothing to prevent the gathering of mousavi supporters inside and outside tehran university , where prayers are held each friday and broadcast live on state radio .
in his first friday sermon since the controversial vote , rafsanjani criticized the way authorities in iran had handled the poll and said large numbers of iranians doubted the results of the election .
" in the current situation it is not necessary for us to have a number of people in prisons ... we should allow them to return to their families , " he said in the sermon at tehran university , broadcast live on state radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafsanjani is considered a key power-broker in iranian politics " we are all members of a family .
i hope with this sermon we can pass through this period of hardships that can be called a crisis , " rafsanjani said .
large opposition rally in tehran his sermon was marked by a large opposition rally in the streets outside the university - the first such demonstration for more than a week .
many protestors were reported to be wearing green bands to indicate support for opposition leader and defeated election candidate mir hossein mousavi .
news agency reuters said some were heard chanting " death to the dictator " and " ahmadinejad , resign , resign . "
the agency also quoted an unidentified witness saying police had fired tear gas and beat up mousavi supporters .
rafsanjani is a backer of mousavi who has demanded a re-run of the vote and described the new government as illegitimate .
cleric slams security crackdown rafsanjani , who heads the powerful assembly of experts and is an influential cleric , also appealed for an open debate on radio and television about the disputed 12 june election and called for media restrictions to be eased .
" it is not necessary to pressure media .
we should allow them to work freely within the law , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a protestor at the opposition rally in tehran on friday although rafsanjani stayed silent during the unrest that followed the election , members of his family - including his daughter faezeh - openly supported mousavi .
rafsanjani , who was a close aide to iran 's late revolutionary founder ayatollah ruhollah khomeini , also condemned the security crackdown on demonstrators .
" we knew what imam khomeini wanted .
he did n't want the use of terror or arms , even in fights -lrb- for the revolution -rrb- . "
rafsanjani 's remarks are seen as a challenge to supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei , who has upheld the election result and accused foreign powers of fuelling the unrest .
violent street protests broke out in iran last month , as news of president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's victory was met with accusations of fraud and vote-rigging .

hossein shariatmadari , editor-in-chief of the kayhan daily , said rafsanjani , a moderate who backed mousavi 's election campaign , had done nothing to prevent the gathering of mousavi supporters inside and outside tehran university , where prayers are held each friday and broadcast live on state radio .
in his first friday sermon since the controversial vote , rafsanjani criticized the way authorities in iran had handled the poll and said large numbers of iranians doubted the results of the election .
" in the current situation it is not necessary for us to have a number of people in prisons ... we should allow them to return to their families , " he said in the sermon at tehran university , broadcast live on state radio .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 17.07.2009 new un security council resolution against north korea großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the resolution is binding on all un member states a un security council panel has put five companies , including one based in iran , and five north koreans under un sanctions because of their links to pyongyang 's nuclear and ballistic missile activities . these sanctions against north korea are just the newest in an ongoing struggle to get the asian state to abandon its nuclear ambitions .
it all started back in october 2006 when pyongyang tested a nuclear device , causing the members of the united nations security council -lrb- unsc -rrb- to issue unsc resolution 1718 , which put sanctions on trade in major weapons system , all products related to the production of weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- , and luxury goods .
but instead of convincing north korea to back off , it actually incited them to try harder ; a point that was proved when they launched a multi-stage rocket on april 5 of this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea 's explosion of a nuclear device on may 25 triggered protests in the south the newest sanctions imposed by the unsc panel on pyongyang for exploding a nuclear device on may 25 , which is completely binding for all member states , is a little bit different in that they focus not on the government as a whole , but rather on individuals and economic entities .
the list includes five companies , including one based in iran , and five north koreans .
the 15-nation council 's panel also banned two goods to be imported by north korea : graphite designed or specified for use in electrical discharge machining -lrb- edm -rrb- machines and para-aramid fiber - commonly known as kevlar - filament and tape .
the panel imposed a freeze of assets belonging to namchongang trading company , hong kong electronics , korea hyoksin trading corporation , general bureau of atomic energy and korean tangun trading corporation .
the five north koreans are : yun ho-jin , director of namchongang trading ; ri je-son and hwang suk-hwa , both directors of separate departments in the general bureau of atomic energy ; rihong-sop , former director of yongbyon nuclear research centre ; han yu-ro , director of korea ryongaksan general trading corporation .
the individuals ' assets will be frozen and they will be banned from travelling abroad .
smart sanctions according to professor michael brzoska , director of the institute for peace research and security policy at the university of hamburg , sanctions against north korea have been changed several times , but the main goal has always been to tighten the screws , particularly on the leadership , without harming the population too much .
the idea is to make life difficult for north korean president kim jong-il and those around him , as well as to limit the possibilities for state institutions , particularly in the financial field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea has been very secretive about the health of the country 's leader kim jong-il using these so-called smart sanctions to target individuals rather than entire governments is n't new ; since the early 1990s the unsc decided to try and influence the behavior of decision makers without harming the general population .
the first cases were iraq and the former yugoslavia , says brzoska , and since then there have been others , adding that the success of these actions has been very mixed .
in angola , for example , the unita rebel movement was targeted in this way and , in the end , lost the war to the government .
in liberia , where former president charles taylor , who is now at the international court of justice in the hague , became a target and that was successful in limiting his possibilities to buy arms and to pay his soldiers .
" one could also argue that in libya sanctions that harmed the leadership by making it more difficult to fly and to have money available for investment in the oil industry also helped to bring about change there .
but there are a lot of other cases where these types of smart sanctions did not have much effect , like in iran , the ivory coast or sierra leone , " says brzoska .
the china question the key to any of these sanctions being successful has always been how inclined the chinese government is to enforce them .
china is north korea 's only ally in the region , if not the world , and they have been reluctant to put pressure on pyongyang in the past .
this is mostly due to the fact that beijing uses its relationship with north korea - and the ability to bring kim jong-il to the negotiating table - to bargain with both japan and the united states , says dr. patrick koellner , acting head of the institute of asian affairs at the german institute of global and area studies .
according to koellner , china , which holds a permanent position on the security council , has the ability to bring north korea to its knees .
simply by cutting of supplies of energy and food and freezing the assets of north korean leaders , kim 's regime would have no choice but to surrender to any demands the un had of it .
however , unlike the japanese and the americans , the chinese actually have a vested financial interest in the sound future of north korea .
according to a report by the council on foreign relations , chinese trade and investment in north korea now totals $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.4 billion euros -rrb- a year . bildunterschrift : since the korean war the border between the two nations has been heavily guarded enforcement while complete chinese cooperation would make things a whole lot faster , it is n't required to put pressure on north korea .
stephan haggard and marcus noland from the peterson institute for international economics argue in a recently published report that the most interesting features of the resolution have to do with means of enforcement .
the resolution calls upon member states to inspect vessels on the high seas or escort them to port if they have reasonable grounds to believe that they are carrying prohibited cargo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any vessel heading into north korean waters suspected of carrying contraban is subject to a search however , there is a loophole in the wording , in order to intercept a ship , the country under which the vessel is flagged must give permission .
according to haggard and noland , this could provide incentives for north korea to do more shipping under its own flag ; though that is doubtful given the country 's standing in the international community .
many ships , regardless of their country of origin , sail under the auspices of countries such as liberia and panama - countries where fees , taxes , regulations , and laws protecting seafarers are often minimal or non-existent .
that means that these nations will be under more and more pressure to allow these ships to be searched , leaving north korea no choice but to use its own flag ; though this causes its own potential drama as north korea has stated in no uncertain terms that it would view such action as an act of war .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any vessel heading into north korean waters suspected of carrying contraban is subject to a search however , there is a loophole in the wording , in order to intercept a ship , the country under which the vessel is flagged must give permission .
according to haggard and noland , this could provide incentives for north korea to do more shipping under its own flag ; though that is doubtful given the country 's standing in the international community .
many ships , regardless of their country of origin , sail under the auspices of countries such as liberia and panama - countries where fees , taxes , regulations , and laws protecting seafarers are often minimal or non-existent .
that means that these nations will be under more and more pressure to allow these ships to be searched , leaving north korea no choice but to use its own flag ; though this causes its own potential drama as north korea has stated in no uncertain terms that it would view such action as an act of war .

it all started back in october 2006 when pyongyang tested a nuclear device , causing the members of the united nations security council -lrb- unsc -rrb- to issue unsc resolution 1718 , which put sanctions on trade in major weapons system , all products related to the production of weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- , and luxury goods .
but instead of convincing north korea to back off , it actually incited them to try harder ; a point that was proved when they launched a multi-stage rocket on april 5 of this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea 's explosion of a nuclear device on may 25 triggered protests in the south the newest sanctions imposed by the unsc panel on pyongyang for exploding a nuclear device on may 25 , which is completely binding for all member states , is a little bit different in that they focus not on the government as a whole , but rather on individuals and economic entities .
the list includes five companies , including one based in iran , and five north koreans .
the 15-nation council 's panel also banned two goods to be imported by north korea : graphite designed or specified for use in electrical discharge machining -lrb- edm -rrb- machines and para-aramid fiber - commonly known as kevlar - filament and tape .
the panel imposed a freeze of assets belonging to namchongang trading company , hong kong electronics , korea hyoksin trading corporation , general bureau of atomic energy and korean tangun trading corporation .
the five north koreans are : yun ho-jin , director of namchongang trading ; ri je-son and hwang suk-hwa , both directors of separate departments in the general bureau of atomic energy ; rihong-sop , former director of yongbyon nuclear research centre ; han yu-ro , director of korea ryongaksan general trading corporation .
the individuals ' assets will be frozen and they will be banned from travelling abroad .
smart sanctions according to professor michael brzoska , director of the institute for peace research and security policy at the university of hamburg , sanctions against north korea have been changed several times , but the main goal has always been to tighten the screws , particularly on the leadership , without harming the population too much .
the idea is to make life difficult for north korean president kim jong-il and those around him , as well as to limit the possibilities for state institutions , particularly in the financial field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea has been very secretive about the health of the country 's leader kim jong-il using these so-called smart sanctions to target individuals rather than entire governments is n't new ; since the early 1990s the unsc decided to try and influence the behavior of decision makers without harming the general population .
the first cases were iraq and the former yugoslavia , says brzoska , and since then there have been others , adding that the success of these actions has been very mixed .
in angola , for example , the unita rebel movement was targeted in this way and , in the end , lost the war to the government .
in liberia , where former president charles taylor , who is now at the international court of justice in the hague , became a target and that was successful in limiting his possibilities to buy arms and to pay his soldiers .
" one could also argue that in libya sanctions that harmed the leadership by making it more difficult to fly and to have money available for investment in the oil industry also helped to bring about change there .
but there are a lot of other cases where these types of smart sanctions did not have much effect , like in iran , the ivory coast or sierra leone , " says brzoska .
the china question the key to any of these sanctions being successful has always been how inclined the chinese government is to enforce them .
china is north korea 's only ally in the region , if not the world , and they have been reluctant to put pressure on pyongyang in the past .
this is mostly due to the fact that beijing uses its relationship with north korea - and the ability to bring kim jong-il to the negotiating table - to bargain with both japan and the united states , says dr. patrick koellner , acting head of the institute of asian affairs at the german institute of global and area studies .
according to koellner , china , which holds a permanent position on the security council , has the ability to bring north korea to its knees .
simply by cutting of supplies of energy and food and freezing the assets of north korean leaders , kim 's regime would have no choice but to surrender to any demands the un had of it .
however , unlike the japanese and the americans , the chinese actually have a vested financial interest in the sound future of north korea .
according to a report by the council on foreign relations , chinese trade and investment in north korea now totals $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.4 billion euros -rrb- a year . bildunterschrift : since the korean war the border between the two nations has been heavily guarded enforcement while complete chinese cooperation would make things a whole lot faster , it is n't required to put pressure on north korea .
stephan haggard and marcus noland from the peterson institute for international economics argue in a recently published report that the most interesting features of the resolution have to do with means of enforcement .
the resolution calls upon member states to inspect vessels on the high seas or escort them to port if they have reasonable grounds to believe that they are carrying prohibited cargo .

they include the bavarian brand " oettinger , " whose sales were up two percent .
oettinger , which for years has been germany 's most widely consumed beer , is to take over in august the " feldschloeßchen " brewery owned by the danish beer giant carlsberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous german beer brand " krombacher " saw sales plunge by 5.3 percent in the first quarter the other brewer to show growth in the first quarter - 2.5 percent - is the " hasseröder " brand .
the beer brand is part of belgium-based ab inbev , the world 's largest brewery and the second-largest beer producer in germany .
the biggest loser in the beer market , according to the study , is the cheaply-priced " sternburg , " an east german brand whose sales plunged 11 percent in the first quarter .
the brand is part of the frankfurt-based radeberger group , germany 's largest brewer .
steady drop in beer consumption according to the federal statistical office , the german beer market shrank by four percent in the first five months of 2009 .
exports to germany 's partners in the 27-nation european union were also down 12.5 percent in the first quarter .
thursday 's study did not provide a reason for the decline .
however , beer sales have been sliding steadily in germany for more than a decade , a trend that experts have attributed to an increasingly health-conscious public as well as the different drinking habits of younger consumers .
" the market has been significantly shrinking over the last few years , " peter hahn , head of the german brewers ' association told news agency dpa earlier this year .
" the times when every german drank more than 150 liters of beer annually are definitely gone . "
some have also blamed a public smoking ban in some german states as well as a deep recession for the latest drop in beer consumption .
to add to the woes , munich 's office of tourism said in may that revelers at this year 's oktoberfest in september would have to dig deeper into their pockets .
officials said a one-liter mug of beer will cost between 8.50 euros -lrb- $ 11.63 -rrb- and 8.60 euros this year - a five percent hike over 2008 prices. sp / dpa / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they include the bavarian brand " oettinger , " whose sales were up two percent .
oettinger , which for years has been germany 's most widely consumed beer , is to take over in august the " feldschloeßchen " brewery owned by the danish beer giant carlsberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous german beer brand " krombacher " saw sales plunge by 5.3 percent in the first quarter the other brewer to show growth in the first quarter - 2.5 percent - is the " hasseröder " brand .
the beer brand is part of belgium-based ab inbev , the world 's largest brewery and the second-largest beer producer in germany .
the biggest loser in the beer market , according to the study , is the cheaply-priced " sternburg , " an east german brand whose sales plunged 11 percent in the first quarter .
the brand is part of the frankfurt-based radeberger group , germany 's largest brewer .
steady drop in beer consumption according to the federal statistical office , the german beer market shrank by four percent in the first five months of 2009 .

" our passenger costs must fall , " lufthansa spokesperson claudia lange said in a statement , adding that details would be released in the coming weeks .
lufthansa staff were warned in a letter sent by the airline 's new chief executive christoph franz that higher fuel costs and falling passenger numbers posed a serious threat .
" this situation is forcing us to act , " franz wrote in the letter .
" air traffic is mired in the worst crisis in its history , " and the german carrier expected it to last longer than previously anticipated , he added .
the airline would reappraise all its operations , including " structures , projects and processes , " the new chief executive vowed .
after posting a first-quarter loss , lufthansa 's first-half results " will show that this negative trend is continuing , " franz said .
" unless market conditions change , our losses will increase significantly in the coming year owing especially to the rise in fuel prices .
" we must now make ever more determined efforts to counteract the trend , " he stressed , adding : " we have no other alternative but to resort to painful measures . "
analysts have expressed doubts about whether lufthansa can reach its cost-cutting target citing strong resistance from trade unions as one barrier .
the cockpit union which represents pilots has already objected to the airline 's cost-savings plans .
in mid-june , the carrier said slumping passenger and freight traffic would force it to take additional measures to avoid posting a full year loss .
analysts took this to mean job losses with forecasts predicting around 20 percent of the airline 's administrative passenger division being cut in the medium term .
the news of the cost-cutting plans comes as lufthansa continues its effort to take over two european carriers , austrian airlines and the britain 's bmi .
new proposals for austrian takeover with the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa issues new set of proposals to buy austrian meanwhile , lufthansa has sent its new proposals for a planned takeover of austrian airlines to the european commission which now consider the proposed acquisition . the commission , which has launched a probe and demanded reassurances the deal would not distort competition , said in a statement it " will study the offer carefully but can not make any further comment at this stage . " austrian finance minister josef proell told austrian news agency apa on thursday that an offer was on the table which would " get things moving " . the european commission fears the takeover could lead to higher prices for passengers or fewer flights on some routes and has demanded lufthansa make concessions to protect european air travellers . it launched an inquiry at the start of the month into the proposed link-up and has until november 6 to make a decision . but lufthansa said its takeover offer , which must be approved by brussels , would only stand until july 31 . brussels said on friday it had not received anything to address competition concerns and " without concrete proposals from lufthansa within the next few hours it would be impossible " to meet that deadline . doubts raised about lufthansa 's desire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some doubt whether lufthansa is still interested in the deal concessions already made have been deemed insufficient by the commission , which expressed scepticism on monday that the german airliner was still interested in the venture . brussels is demanding that aua surrender key take-off and landing slots for services between vienna and frankfurt , munich , stuttgart , cologne , zurich , geneva and brussels . a european commission spokesman dismissed as " rubbish " austrian press reports that it had approached air france-klm to see if it would be interested in taking over austrian airlines if the lufthansa offer fell through . lufthansa signed a deal last year to acquire a 41.6-percent stake in aua from the austrian state holding company oeiag for a symbolic one euro cent per share - or just over 366,000 euros in all . one of the conditions was an agreement that the austrian state would absorb 500 million euros - or just over a third - of aua 's debts . but those terms have enraged rival airlines , such as air france-klm , which had also sought to buy aua , as well as other airlines such as british airways and irish low-fares carrier ryanair . nda / afp / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" our passenger costs must fall , " lufthansa spokesperson claudia lange said in a statement , adding that details would be released in the coming weeks .
lufthansa staff were warned in a letter sent by the airline 's new chief executive christoph franz that higher fuel costs and falling passenger numbers posed a serious threat .
" this situation is forcing us to act , " franz wrote in the letter .
" air traffic is mired in the worst crisis in its history , " and the german carrier expected it to last longer than previously anticipated , he added .
the airline would reappraise all its operations , including " structures , projects and processes , " the new chief executive vowed .
after posting a first-quarter loss , lufthansa 's first-half results " will show that this negative trend is continuing , " franz said .
" unless market conditions change , our losses will increase significantly in the coming year owing especially to the rise in fuel prices .
" we must now make ever more determined efforts to counteract the trend , " he stressed , adding : " we have no other alternative but to resort to painful measures . "
analysts have expressed doubts about whether lufthansa can reach its cost-cutting target citing strong resistance from trade unions as one barrier .
the cockpit union which represents pilots has already objected to the airline 's cost-savings plans .
in mid-june , the carrier said slumping passenger and freight traffic would force it to take additional measures to avoid posting a full year loss .
analysts took this to mean job losses with forecasts predicting around 20 percent of the airline 's administrative passenger division being cut in the medium term .

" our passenger costs must fall , " lufthansa spokesperson claudia lange said in a statement , adding that details would be released in the coming weeks .
lufthansa staff were warned in a letter sent by the airline 's new chief executive christoph franz that higher fuel costs and falling passenger numbers posed a serious threat .
" this situation is forcing us to act , " franz wrote in the letter .
" air traffic is mired in the worst crisis in its history , " and the german carrier expected it to last longer than previously anticipated , he added .
the airline would reappraise all its operations , including " structures , projects and processes , " the new chief executive vowed .
after posting a first-quarter loss , lufthansa 's first-half results " will show that this negative trend is continuing , " franz said .
" unless market conditions change , our losses will increase significantly in the coming year owing especially to the rise in fuel prices .
" we must now make ever more determined efforts to counteract the trend , " he stressed , adding : " we have no other alternative but to resort to painful measures . "
analysts have expressed doubts about whether lufthansa can reach its cost-cutting target citing strong resistance from trade unions as one barrier .
the cockpit union which represents pilots has already objected to the airline 's cost-savings plans .
in mid-june , the carrier said slumping passenger and freight traffic would force it to take additional measures to avoid posting a full year loss .
analysts took this to mean job losses with forecasts predicting around 20 percent of the airline 's administrative passenger division being cut in the medium term .
the news of the cost-cutting plans comes as lufthansa continues its effort to take over two european carriers , austrian airlines and the britain 's bmi .
new proposals for austrian takeover with the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa issues new set of proposals to buy austrian meanwhile , lufthansa has sent its new proposals for a planned takeover of austrian airlines to the european commission which now consider the proposed acquisition . the commission , which has launched a probe and demanded reassurances the deal would not distort competition , said in a statement it " will study the offer carefully but can not make any further comment at this stage . " austrian finance minister josef proell told austrian news agency apa on thursday that an offer was on the table which would " get things moving " . the european commission fears the takeover could lead to higher prices for passengers or fewer flights on some routes and has demanded lufthansa make concessions to protect european air travellers . it launched an inquiry at the start of the month into the proposed link-up and has until november 6 to make a decision . but lufthansa said its takeover offer , which must be approved by brussels , would only stand until july 31 . brussels said on friday it had not received anything to address competition concerns and " without concrete proposals from lufthansa within the next few hours it would be impossible " to meet that deadline . doubts raised about lufthansa 's desire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some doubt whether lufthansa is still interested in the deal concessions already made have been deemed insufficient by the commission , which expressed scepticism on monday that the german airliner was still interested in the venture . brussels is demanding that aua surrender key take-off and landing slots for services between vienna and frankfurt , munich , stuttgart , cologne , zurich , geneva and brussels . a european commission spokesman dismissed as " rubbish " austrian press reports that it had approached air france-klm to see if it would be interested in taking over austrian airlines if the lufthansa offer fell through . lufthansa signed a deal last year to acquire a 41.6-percent stake in aua from the austrian state holding company oeiag for a symbolic one euro cent per share - or just over 366,000 euros in all . one of the conditions was an agreement that the austrian state would absorb 500 million euros - or just over a third - of aua 's debts . but those terms have enraged rival airlines , such as air france-klm , which had also sought to buy aua , as well as other airlines such as british airways and irish low-fares carrier ryanair . nda / afp / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 17.07.2009 aldi advances on wal-mart 's home turf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with revenue dropping in germany , aldi is turing abroad for growth german discounting pioneer aldi is using the economic crisis to expand its presence in the us .
the move could help mitigate the company 's troubles on its home turf . it is something that has n't happened to aldi before : in the midst of a severe economic crisis germany 's discounting pioneer is faced with declining revenues in its home market .
according to data from research company gfk , aldi 's sales in germany declined by about five percent in the first five months of this year while the german retail sector as a whole shrank by only 2.2 percent .
it 's an entirely different story in the united states .
there , aldi is rapidly expanding its reach and expects to open 75 new stores this year .
the discount retailer entered the us market back in 1976 , but its no-frills concept only really started to take off in recent years .
" and of course the current economic crisis is really helping aldi to gain more customers , but is also making some changes in its concept " , explains matthias queck , senior discount analyst at market reseach firm planet retail .
for instance , aldi has added more fresh products , especially produce , to its range of products and has spruced up its stores to make them more attractive to new customers .
while older aldi stores where often located in less affluent neighborhoods , many new stores are located in areas that attract suburban and middle class shoppers as well .
low prices for high price markets aldi traditionally does n't release financial figures , but experts believe the german discount chain is doing quite well in the us and making significant inroads in the retail sector .
how then does aldi compete against us retail behemoth wal-mart on its home turf ?
it 's very simple , say the experts , the same way aldi and other german discounters forced wal-mart to shutter its doors in germany a couple of years ago : low prices and high quality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldi is taking on retail giant wal-mart on his home turf thomas roeb , a retail expert at the university of applied sciences rhine-sieg , argues that while wal-mart is considered a discounter in the us and has an image as a low-price retailer , its general pricing level is still fairly high .
in comparison to wal-mart aldi has a lower cost structure that allows it to become very successful in higher price markets like the united states . " however , the consumers so far did n't really believe in the value proposition of aldi and it is due to the economic crisis right now that people have started to try the concept . "
and , adds roeb , more and more americans give aldi 's no-frills concept a chance and actually find it attractive .
that 's because consumers realize that they can save money when shopping at aldi .
experts estimate that aldi 's prices are generally 10 to 15 percent lower than those of other national us retailers .
how does aldi do that ?
it keeps costs down with a limited range of products , smaller stores , fewer staff , and by not staying open as late as some of its competitors . it has also developed an efficient logistics system and most of the products that it sells are its own brand .
its sheer size allows it to get discounts by buying large quantities . too successful what can happen once aldi 's value proposition catches on in a big way , is evident in germany .
there , so-called " hard discounters " like aldi , account for more than 40 percent of the country 's retail sector .
the discount model has been so successful that aldi 's many competitors in germany are finally taking a bite out of its revenues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , aldi faces stiff competition from other discounters after decades of imitating aldi , says retail expert roeb , its german competitors have finally caught on .
" so it 's less aldi 's loss in the german market , it 's less that aldi is doing something wrong , but rather the fact that the competition is doing something right . "
that 's why aldi 's future growth will come mainly from abroad with the us being a prime target for expansion , argues discount expert queck : " just imagine that in the us , aldi has just 1,000 stores spread over 29 states , so that leaves a lot of room for further expansion . "
compare that with the roughly 1,700 stores that aldi sued , the part of the aldi company that manages its us operation , owns in southern and western germany alone and you can imagine the huge growth potential for the discounter in the us .
wal-mart dwarfs aldi despite aldi 's current advances in the us market , the question remains whether it can sustain its growth and customers once the economic malaise is over .
" i do believe that aldi is going to be successful even after the crisis , " says roeb .
" because we have had the same situation in germany and in some western european countries in the past .
everywhere aldi benefitted from economic crises to increase sales and consumers found the selection of products attractive so they found no need to switch back to their former supermarket . "
while aldi in the us with an estimated revenue of about seven billion dollars last year is tiny in comparison to wal-mart with its revenue of 375 billion dollars , the german discounter could challenge wal-mart in a specific segment - food .
wal-mart , says roeb is basically a non-food retailer that carries food as an important part , but not the main attraction of its product range .
" aldi however is a food specialist .
so when we are talking about competition between aldi and wal-mart , we are talking about competition in the field of food .
and i do believe that aldi is going to cause some problems for wal-mart in the future and even today in the area of food . "
that 's because , wal-mart 's image as a discounter in the food segment could be undercut by aldi 's value proposition .
and that , adds roeb , might end up having a negative impact on wal-mart 's public image . author : michael knigge editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move could help mitigate the company 's troubles on its home turf . it is something that has n't happened to aldi before : in the midst of a severe economic crisis germany 's discounting pioneer is faced with declining revenues in its home market .
according to data from research company gfk , aldi 's sales in germany declined by about five percent in the first five months of this year while the german retail sector as a whole shrank by only 2.2 percent .
it 's an entirely different story in the united states .
there , aldi is rapidly expanding its reach and expects to open 75 new stores this year .
the discount retailer entered the us market back in 1976 , but its no-frills concept only really started to take off in recent years .
" and of course the current economic crisis is really helping aldi to gain more customers , but is also making some changes in its concept " , explains matthias queck , senior discount analyst at market reseach firm planet retail .
for instance , aldi has added more fresh products , especially produce , to its range of products and has spruced up its stores to make them more attractive to new customers .
while older aldi stores where often located in less affluent neighborhoods , many new stores are located in areas that attract suburban and middle class shoppers as well .
low prices for high price markets aldi traditionally does n't release financial figures , but experts believe the german discount chain is doing quite well in the us and making significant inroads in the retail sector .
how then does aldi compete against us retail behemoth wal-mart on its home turf ?
it 's very simple , say the experts , the same way aldi and other german discounters forced wal-mart to shutter its doors in germany a couple of years ago : low prices and high quality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldi is taking on retail giant wal-mart on his home turf thomas roeb , a retail expert at the university of applied sciences rhine-sieg , argues that while wal-mart is considered a discounter in the us and has an image as a low-price retailer , its general pricing level is still fairly high .
in comparison to wal-mart aldi has a lower cost structure that allows it to become very successful in higher price markets like the united states . " however , the consumers so far did n't really believe in the value proposition of aldi and it is due to the economic crisis right now that people have started to try the concept . "
and , adds roeb , more and more americans give aldi 's no-frills concept a chance and actually find it attractive .
that 's because consumers realize that they can save money when shopping at aldi .
experts estimate that aldi 's prices are generally 10 to 15 percent lower than those of other national us retailers .
how does aldi do that ?
it keeps costs down with a limited range of products , smaller stores , fewer staff , and by not staying open as late as some of its competitors . it has also developed an efficient logistics system and most of the products that it sells are its own brand .
its sheer size allows it to get discounts by buying large quantities . too successful what can happen once aldi 's value proposition catches on in a big way , is evident in germany .
there , so-called " hard discounters " like aldi , account for more than 40 percent of the country 's retail sector .
the discount model has been so successful that aldi 's many competitors in germany are finally taking a bite out of its revenues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , aldi faces stiff competition from other discounters after decades of imitating aldi , says retail expert roeb , its german competitors have finally caught on .
" so it 's less aldi 's loss in the german market , it 's less that aldi is doing something wrong , but rather the fact that the competition is doing something right . "
that 's why aldi 's future growth will come mainly from abroad with the us being a prime target for expansion , argues discount expert queck : " just imagine that in the us , aldi has just 1,000 stores spread over 29 states , so that leaves a lot of room for further expansion . "
compare that with the roughly 1,700 stores that aldi sued , the part of the aldi company that manages its us operation , owns in southern and western germany alone and you can imagine the huge growth potential for the discounter in the us .
wal-mart dwarfs aldi despite aldi 's current advances in the us market , the question remains whether it can sustain its growth and customers once the economic malaise is over .
" i do believe that aldi is going to be successful even after the crisis , " says roeb .
" because we have had the same situation in germany and in some western european countries in the past .
everywhere aldi benefitted from economic crises to increase sales and consumers found the selection of products attractive so they found no need to switch back to their former supermarket . "
while aldi in the us with an estimated revenue of about seven billion dollars last year is tiny in comparison to wal-mart with its revenue of 375 billion dollars , the german discounter could challenge wal-mart in a specific segment - food .
wal-mart , says roeb is basically a non-food retailer that carries food as an important part , but not the main attraction of its product range .
" aldi however is a food specialist .
so when we are talking about competition between aldi and wal-mart , we are talking about competition in the field of food .
and i do believe that aldi is going to cause some problems for wal-mart in the future and even today in the area of food . "
that 's because , wal-mart 's image as a discounter in the food segment could be undercut by aldi 's value proposition .

compare that with the roughly 1,700 stores that aldi sued , the part of the aldi company that manages its us operation , owns in southern and western germany alone and you can imagine the huge growth potential for the discounter in the us .
wal-mart dwarfs aldi despite aldi 's current advances in the us market , the question remains whether it can sustain its growth and customers once the economic malaise is over .
" i do believe that aldi is going to be successful even after the crisis , " says roeb .
" because we have had the same situation in germany and in some western european countries in the past .
everywhere aldi benefitted from economic crises to increase sales and consumers found the selection of products attractive so they found no need to switch back to their former supermarket . "
while aldi in the us with an estimated revenue of about seven billion dollars last year is tiny in comparison to wal-mart with its revenue of 375 billion dollars , the german discounter could challenge wal-mart in a specific segment - food .
wal-mart , says roeb is basically a non-food retailer that carries food as an important part , but not the main attraction of its product range .
" aldi however is a food specialist .
so when we are talking about competition between aldi and wal-mart , we are talking about competition in the field of food .
and i do believe that aldi is going to cause some problems for wal-mart in the future and even today in the area of food . "
that 's because , wal-mart 's image as a discounter in the food segment could be undercut by aldi 's value proposition .
and that , adds roeb , might end up having a negative impact on wal-mart 's public image . author : michael knigge editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 17.07.2009 little enthusiasm for " us-india 3.0 " in mumbai and delhi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indians are glad hillary clinton is touring india , but really hope for a visit by president obama soon hillary clinton is visiting india for the first time as us secretary of state .
india , which signed an historic nuclear deal with the us under president bush has felt somewhat neglected by the obama administration so far . secretary clinton has announced that us-india relations are entering a new era , which she has called " us-india 3.0 " .
this new phase of bilateral relations would come after a first phase full of mutual distrust during the cold war and a slow rapprochement process under presidents bill clinton and george w. bush .
in her council on foreign relations address in washington this week , clinton said her talks in mumbai and delhi would cover an unprecedentedly wide range of issues .
" we are delighted that our two countries will be engaging in a very broad , comprehensive dialogue .
we believe india has a tremendous opportunity and growing responsibility , which they acknowledge , to play not just a regional role , but a global one as well . "
pakistan is top regional issue the most important regional issue is considered to be pakistan .
india has generally been supportive of the obama administration 's so called afpak -lrb- afghanistan-pakistan -rrb- policies , says chintamani mahapatra , an expert in indo-us relations at delhi 's prestigious jawaharlal nehru university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : combatting islamists in pakistan is a common goal for the us and india but , he adds , there remains disagreement on some issues : " american interest is confined to making pakistan fight the taliban , who are anti-us , anti-west .
and lashkar-e-taiba and other groups of terrorists in pakistan who are fomenting problems in india , both in kashmir and elsewhere , are off the hook . "
india blames lashkar-e-taiba for the mumbai attacks that killed more than 170 people last november and has suspended the " composite dialogue " process with pakistan as a consequence .
however , at this week 's meeting between the two countries ' prime ministers in sharm-el-sheikh , the indian position seemed to have mellowed somewhat .
the us will surely be happy about this , as any indo-pakistani conflict would distract pakistan from fighting the taliban .
observers also expect clinton to try and convince delhi that the kashmir conflict needs more attention .
non-proliferation before leaving for india , the secretary of state also mentioned that she wanted to talk about nuclear non-proliferation .
a tricky affair , since india has never been officially acknowledged as a nuclear power and refuses to sign the non-proliferation treaty , which it regards as discriminatory .
clinton has signalled that the americans are ready to look for innovative solutions : " there is nothing easy about non-proliferation .
i mean , anybody who ever read strobe talbott 's book ‘ engaging india ' knows this is a very difficult issue . "
other difficult issues likely to crop up during clinton 's trip to india include climate change and the " doha round " global trade negotiations .
but clinton is also going to want to simply improve the mood in india .
buttering up the indians chintamani mahapatra says the country has felt neglected by the obama administration so far : " i think the obama administration has marginalized india for quite a few months now .
we understand why it did so because the foreign policy plate of obama was truly overflowing . "
but he adds that at a time when hillary clinton 's clout in the administration is openly questioned in the us , it is not likely that her visit alone will impress the indians .
" we know very well that hillary clinton 's position in the decision-making process in the us is not very strong . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh is expected in washington in september although she has the ear of the president and has taken many foreign policy initiatives , they have not been taken up by the white house , says mahapatra who already talks about a visit of president barack obama to india .
" our prime minister is going to visit the us in september , and he had extended an invitation to president obama .
hopefully , he will come to india not towards the end of his term , but in the middle of his term if he really wants to improve the relationship between the two countries . "
so while there might be no serious conflict between india and the united states right now , there also seems to be little enthusiasm about " us-india 3.0 " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 17.07.2009 study says large german brewers selling less beer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's national drink is finding ever fewer takers a new study shows that almost all of germany 's 16 largest breweries sold less beer in the first quarter of this year , reflecting a steady decline in beer consumption in the country . the study by the specialist magazine inside released on thursday said that just two breweries among the 16 largest in germany registered growth in the first quarter of 2009 .
they include the bavarian brand " oettinger , " whose sales were up two percent .
oettinger , which for years has been germany 's most widely consumed beer , is to take over in august the " feldschloeßchen " brewery owned by the danish beer giant carlsberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous german beer brand " krombacher " saw sales plunge by 5.3 percent in the first quarter the other brewer to show growth in the first quarter - 2.5 percent - is the " hasseröder " brand .
the beer brand is part of belgium-based ab inbev , the world 's largest brewery and the second-largest beer producer in germany .
the biggest loser in the beer market , according to the study , is the cheaply-priced " sternburg , " an east german brand whose sales plunged 11 percent in the first quarter .
the brand is part of the frankfurt-based radeberger group , germany 's largest brewer .
steady drop in beer consumption according to the federal statistical office , the german beer market shrank by four percent in the first five months of 2009 .
exports to germany 's partners in the 27-nation european union were also down 12.5 percent in the first quarter .
thursday 's study did not provide a reason for the decline .
however , beer sales have been sliding steadily in germany for more than a decade , a trend that experts have attributed to an increasingly health-conscious public as well as the different drinking habits of younger consumers .
" the market has been significantly shrinking over the last few years , " peter hahn , head of the german brewers ' association told news agency dpa earlier this year .
" the times when every german drank more than 150 liters of beer annually are definitely gone . "
some have also blamed a public smoking ban in some german states as well as a deep recession for the latest drop in beer consumption .
to add to the woes , munich 's office of tourism said in may that revelers at this year 's oktoberfest in september would have to dig deeper into their pockets .
officials said a one-liter mug of beer will cost between 8.50 euros -lrb- $ 11.63 -rrb- and 8.60 euros this year - a five percent hike over 2008 prices. sp / dpa / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 17.07.2009 new un security council resolution against north korea großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the resolution is binding on all un member states a un security council panel has put five companies , including one based in iran , and five north koreans under un sanctions because of their links to pyongyang 's nuclear and ballistic missile activities . these sanctions against north korea are just the newest in an ongoing struggle to get the asian state to abandon its nuclear ambitions .
it all started back in october 2006 when pyongyang tested a nuclear device , causing the members of the united nations security council -lrb- unsc -rrb- to issue unsc resolution 1718 , which put sanctions on trade in major weapons system , all products related to the production of weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- , and luxury goods .
but instead of convincing north korea to back off , it actually incited them to try harder ; a point that was proved when they launched a multi-stage rocket on april 5 of this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea 's explosion of a nuclear device on may 25 triggered protests in the south the newest sanctions imposed by the unsc panel on pyongyang for exploding a nuclear device on may 25 , which is completely binding for all member states , is a little bit different in that they focus not on the government as a whole , but rather on individuals and economic entities .
the list includes five companies , including one based in iran , and five north koreans .
the 15-nation council 's panel also banned two goods to be imported by north korea : graphite designed or specified for use in electrical discharge machining -lrb- edm -rrb- machines and para-aramid fiber - commonly known as kevlar - filament and tape .
the panel imposed a freeze of assets belonging to namchongang trading company , hong kong electronics , korea hyoksin trading corporation , general bureau of atomic energy and korean tangun trading corporation .
the five north koreans are : yun ho-jin , director of namchongang trading ; ri je-son and hwang suk-hwa , both directors of separate departments in the general bureau of atomic energy ; rihong-sop , former director of yongbyon nuclear research centre ; han yu-ro , director of korea ryongaksan general trading corporation .
the individuals ' assets will be frozen and they will be banned from travelling abroad .
smart sanctions according to professor michael brzoska , director of the institute for peace research and security policy at the university of hamburg , sanctions against north korea have been changed several times , but the main goal has always been to tighten the screws , particularly on the leadership , without harming the population too much .
the idea is to make life difficult for north korean president kim jong-il and those around him , as well as to limit the possibilities for state institutions , particularly in the financial field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea has been very secretive about the health of the country 's leader kim jong-il using these so-called smart sanctions to target individuals rather than entire governments is n't new ; since the early 1990s the unsc decided to try and influence the behavior of decision makers without harming the general population .
the first cases were iraq and the former yugoslavia , says brzoska , and since then there have been others , adding that the success of these actions has been very mixed .
in angola , for example , the unita rebel movement was targeted in this way and , in the end , lost the war to the government .
in liberia , where former president charles taylor , who is now at the international court of justice in the hague , became a target and that was successful in limiting his possibilities to buy arms and to pay his soldiers .
" one could also argue that in libya sanctions that harmed the leadership by making it more difficult to fly and to have money available for investment in the oil industry also helped to bring about change there .
but there are a lot of other cases where these types of smart sanctions did not have much effect , like in iran , the ivory coast or sierra leone , " says brzoska .
the china question the key to any of these sanctions being successful has always been how inclined the chinese government is to enforce them .
china is north korea 's only ally in the region , if not the world , and they have been reluctant to put pressure on pyongyang in the past .
this is mostly due to the fact that beijing uses its relationship with north korea - and the ability to bring kim jong-il to the negotiating table - to bargain with both japan and the united states , says dr. patrick koellner , acting head of the institute of asian affairs at the german institute of global and area studies .
according to koellner , china , which holds a permanent position on the security council , has the ability to bring north korea to its knees .
simply by cutting of supplies of energy and food and freezing the assets of north korean leaders , kim 's regime would have no choice but to surrender to any demands the un had of it .
however , unlike the japanese and the americans , the chinese actually have a vested financial interest in the sound future of north korea .
according to a report by the council on foreign relations , chinese trade and investment in north korea now totals $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.4 billion euros -rrb- a year . bildunterschrift : since the korean war the border between the two nations has been heavily guarded enforcement while complete chinese cooperation would make things a whole lot faster , it is n't required to put pressure on north korea .
stephan haggard and marcus noland from the peterson institute for international economics argue in a recently published report that the most interesting features of the resolution have to do with means of enforcement .
the resolution calls upon member states to inspect vessels on the high seas or escort them to port if they have reasonable grounds to believe that they are carrying prohibited cargo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any vessel heading into north korean waters suspected of carrying contraban is subject to a search however , there is a loophole in the wording , in order to intercept a ship , the country under which the vessel is flagged must give permission .
according to haggard and noland , this could provide incentives for north korea to do more shipping under its own flag ; though that is doubtful given the country 's standing in the international community .
many ships , regardless of their country of origin , sail under the auspices of countries such as liberia and panama - countries where fees , taxes , regulations , and laws protecting seafarers are often minimal or non-existent .
that means that these nations will be under more and more pressure to allow these ships to be searched , leaving north korea no choice but to use its own flag ; though this causes its own potential drama as north korea has stated in no uncertain terms that it would view such action as an act of war .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea 's explosion of a nuclear device on may 25 triggered protests in the south the newest sanctions imposed by the unsc panel on pyongyang for exploding a nuclear device on may 25 , which is completely binding for all member states , is a little bit different in that they focus not on the government as a whole , but rather on individuals and economic entities .
the list includes five companies , including one based in iran , and five north koreans .
the 15-nation council 's panel also banned two goods to be imported by north korea : graphite designed or specified for use in electrical discharge machining -lrb- edm -rrb- machines and para-aramid fiber - commonly known as kevlar - filament and tape .
the panel imposed a freeze of assets belonging to namchongang trading company , hong kong electronics , korea hyoksin trading corporation , general bureau of atomic energy and korean tangun trading corporation .
the five north koreans are : yun ho-jin , director of namchongang trading ; ri je-son and hwang suk-hwa , both directors of separate departments in the general bureau of atomic energy ; rihong-sop , former director of yongbyon nuclear research centre ; han yu-ro , director of korea ryongaksan general trading corporation .
the individuals ' assets will be frozen and they will be banned from travelling abroad .
smart sanctions according to professor michael brzoska , director of the institute for peace research and security policy at the university of hamburg , sanctions against north korea have been changed several times , but the main goal has always been to tighten the screws , particularly on the leadership , without harming the population too much .
the idea is to make life difficult for north korean president kim jong-il and those around him , as well as to limit the possibilities for state institutions , particularly in the financial field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea has been very secretive about the health of the country 's leader kim jong-il using these so-called smart sanctions to target individuals rather than entire governments is n't new ; since the early 1990s the unsc decided to try and influence the behavior of decision makers without harming the general population .
the first cases were iraq and the former yugoslavia , says brzoska , and since then there have been others , adding that the success of these actions has been very mixed .
in angola , for example , the unita rebel movement was targeted in this way and , in the end , lost the war to the government .
in liberia , where former president charles taylor , who is now at the international court of justice in the hague , became a target and that was successful in limiting his possibilities to buy arms and to pay his soldiers .
" one could also argue that in libya sanctions that harmed the leadership by making it more difficult to fly and to have money available for investment in the oil industry also helped to bring about change there .
but there are a lot of other cases where these types of smart sanctions did not have much effect , like in iran , the ivory coast or sierra leone , " says brzoska .
the china question the key to any of these sanctions being successful has always been how inclined the chinese government is to enforce them .
china is north korea 's only ally in the region , if not the world , and they have been reluctant to put pressure on pyongyang in the past .
this is mostly due to the fact that beijing uses its relationship with north korea - and the ability to bring kim jong-il to the negotiating table - to bargain with both japan and the united states , says dr. patrick koellner , acting head of the institute of asian affairs at the german institute of global and area studies .
according to koellner , china , which holds a permanent position on the security council , has the ability to bring north korea to its knees .
simply by cutting of supplies of energy and food and freezing the assets of north korean leaders , kim 's regime would have no choice but to surrender to any demands the un had of it .
however , unlike the japanese and the americans , the chinese actually have a vested financial interest in the sound future of north korea .
according to a report by the council on foreign relations , chinese trade and investment in north korea now totals $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.4 billion euros -rrb- a year . bildunterschrift : since the korean war the border between the two nations has been heavily guarded enforcement while complete chinese cooperation would make things a whole lot faster , it is n't required to put pressure on north korea .
stephan haggard and marcus noland from the peterson institute for international economics argue in a recently published report that the most interesting features of the resolution have to do with means of enforcement .
the resolution calls upon member states to inspect vessels on the high seas or escort them to port if they have reasonable grounds to believe that they are carrying prohibited cargo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any vessel heading into north korean waters suspected of carrying contraban is subject to a search however , there is a loophole in the wording , in order to intercept a ship , the country under which the vessel is flagged must give permission .
according to haggard and noland , this could provide incentives for north korea to do more shipping under its own flag ; though that is doubtful given the country 's standing in the international community .
many ships , regardless of their country of origin , sail under the auspices of countries such as liberia and panama - countries where fees , taxes , regulations , and laws protecting seafarers are often minimal or non-existent .
that means that these nations will be under more and more pressure to allow these ships to be searched , leaving north korea no choice but to use its own flag ; though this causes its own potential drama as north korea has stated in no uncertain terms that it would view such action as an act of war .

the three claimed to have more videos of susanne klatten in trysts with a swiss gigolo . in june this year , the blackmailers had written to susanne klatten and threatened to sell recordings of her with helg sgarbi to the italian media if the mother of three did not hand over 800,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.1 million -rrb- and a bmw x5 luxury sports utility vehicle .
the bwm-heiress immediately contacted the authorities .
police in the northern german city of duisburg " pretended to be acquaintances contacting them on behalf of klatten , " said thomas steinkraus-koch , a spokesman for prosecutors in munich .
police arrived in the bmw x5 to " complete the deal " as agreed on wednesday .
the three men were immediately arrested .
police said two of the three men aged 33 to 46 have a criminal history involving fraud and narcotics .
police said they had started analyzing computers and other evidence but so far no videos had been found .
not the first copy-cat attempt this is not the first copy-cat attempt to extort germany 's richest woman .
a munich newspaper reported that in march this year , klatten had received a letter from someone claiming to be sgarbi 's prison inmate who had told him where the sex-videos were hidden .
he had " only " demanded 75,000 euros .
klatten did not hesitate to pass the letter on to the authorities .
" we have a 100 percent success rate in catching any would-be blackmailers , " warned steinkraus-koch .
44-year old swiss national helg sgarbi is currently serving a six-year prison term for blackmailing the billionairess . the former investment banker met klatten in a luxury hotel in tirol in 2007 and began an affair with her and methodically videoed their private meetings .
sgarbi has refused to provide the names of any accomplices , or say where he has hidden the videos and the seven million euros he received from klatten .
police do have a seven-minute video in their possession but have not said what is on it .
no other videos of klatten and sgarbi have ever been recovered .
" we have not found any videos so far , " said steinkraus-koch .
" we can not rule out however that they do not exist .

india , which signed an historic nuclear deal with the us under president bush has felt somewhat neglected by the obama administration so far . secretary clinton has announced that us-india relations are entering a new era , which she has called " us-india 3.0 " .
this new phase of bilateral relations would come after a first phase full of mutual distrust during the cold war and a slow rapprochement process under presidents bill clinton and george w. bush .
in her council on foreign relations address in washington this week , clinton said her talks in mumbai and delhi would cover an unprecedentedly wide range of issues .
" we are delighted that our two countries will be engaging in a very broad , comprehensive dialogue .
we believe india has a tremendous opportunity and growing responsibility , which they acknowledge , to play not just a regional role , but a global one as well . "
pakistan is top regional issue the most important regional issue is considered to be pakistan .
india has generally been supportive of the obama administration 's so called afpak -lrb- afghanistan-pakistan -rrb- policies , says chintamani mahapatra , an expert in indo-us relations at delhi 's prestigious jawaharlal nehru university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : combatting islamists in pakistan is a common goal for the us and india but , he adds , there remains disagreement on some issues : " american interest is confined to making pakistan fight the taliban , who are anti-us , anti-west .
and lashkar-e-taiba and other groups of terrorists in pakistan who are fomenting problems in india , both in kashmir and elsewhere , are off the hook . "
india blames lashkar-e-taiba for the mumbai attacks that killed more than 170 people last november and has suspended the " composite dialogue " process with pakistan as a consequence .
however , at this week 's meeting between the two countries ' prime ministers in sharm-el-sheikh , the indian position seemed to have mellowed somewhat .
the us will surely be happy about this , as any indo-pakistani conflict would distract pakistan from fighting the taliban .
observers also expect clinton to try and convince delhi that the kashmir conflict needs more attention .
non-proliferation before leaving for india , the secretary of state also mentioned that she wanted to talk about nuclear non-proliferation .
a tricky affair , since india has never been officially acknowledged as a nuclear power and refuses to sign the non-proliferation treaty , which it regards as discriminatory .
clinton has signalled that the americans are ready to look for innovative solutions : " there is nothing easy about non-proliferation .
i mean , anybody who ever read strobe talbott 's book ‘ engaging india ' knows this is a very difficult issue . "
other difficult issues likely to crop up during clinton 's trip to india include climate change and the " doha round " global trade negotiations .
but clinton is also going to want to simply improve the mood in india .
buttering up the indians chintamani mahapatra says the country has felt neglected by the obama administration so far : " i think the obama administration has marginalized india for quite a few months now .
we understand why it did so because the foreign policy plate of obama was truly overflowing . "
but he adds that at a time when hillary clinton 's clout in the administration is openly questioned in the us , it is not likely that her visit alone will impress the indians .
" we know very well that hillary clinton 's position in the decision-making process in the us is not very strong . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh is expected in washington in september although she has the ear of the president and has taken many foreign policy initiatives , they have not been taken up by the white house , says mahapatra who already talks about a visit of president barack obama to india .
" our prime minister is going to visit the us in september , and he had extended an invitation to president obama .
hopefully , he will come to india not towards the end of his term , but in the middle of his term if he really wants to improve the relationship between the two countries . "
so while there might be no serious conflict between india and the united states right now , there also seems to be little enthusiasm about " us-india 3.0 " .

health and public workers , as well as chronically ill people will get the flu shots first . the german health ministry announced on friday that an estimated quarter of germany 's population will be eligible to receive the flu shots .
this confirms reports earlier this week that the government had plans to order 50 million vaccine units against swine flu .
the vaccines will be available from september , to coincide with an expected surge in flu cases .
health state ministers late on thursday agreed that chronically ill patients , health care workers , police officers , fire fighters , public workers and pregnant women can receive the injections first .
two shots are needed for the vaccination to be effective against the -lrb- a -rrb- h1n1 virus .
" the vaccinations are a precautionary measure , " said health ministry spokesman , klaus vater .
" no one can tell how the new virus will develop in the coming weeks . "
despite the priority immunization list , federal health minister ulla schmidt insists that everyone who wants to be vaccinated against swine flu , will be able to do so .
protecting the entire population is expected to cost health insurers an estimated two billion euros .
around 800 infections - none fatal - have been reported in germany .
that 's the third-highest number in europe after britain and spain .
berlin has not said when the remaining population can be vaccinated .
this largely depends on how fast pharmaceutical companies can produce the vaccine .
the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- said up to 4.9 billion doses could be produced in 12 months . the un health body has meanwhile announced that it was no longer counting individual cases of swine flu .
it said the virus is spreading so fast , it can not keep up with all the figures and is now asking national health authorities to only report clusters of severe cases , deaths caused by the new virus , or unusual clinical patterns. wl / reuters / dpa / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the chinese are really open to fashion , and let 's face it , the future of the world lies in this region , " he says as he reflects on his deal to develop a range of sportswear for the china dongxiang group .
the michalsky label might not yet be in the same league as karl lagerfeld , hugo boss or joop ! , but its namesake has always been ahead of the pack .
" i like to do things differently and i like to be the first , " he says .
" i was the first designer to move to berlin and do major shows here even before it was really on the map .
it 's part of my own nature and the character of both my company and my brand . "
shifting focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael michalsky is pushing fashion 's frontiers in these economically troubled times , thinking outside the box can make all the difference - and michael michalsky has broken with decades of fashion tradition by setting his sights on beijing and shanghai rather than paris and milan .
at the high-end of the industry , he 's one of the first to have woken up to china 's potential as more than a market for established western brands such as louis vuitton , cartier and bmw .
earlier this year , the new york times stated the obvious when it reported that china is now the world 's fastest-growing luxury market , with an estimated $ 7.6 billion in sales in 2008 .
michalsky , in the meantime , had cottoned on to a different , more significant growth - that of the domestic market .
although its love affair with imported luxury is still going strong , china is increasingly fed up being merely a production site for other countries and the home of cheap knock-offs .
these days , it 's keen to foster indigenous brands and to meet its consumer needs under its own steam .
" the domestic chinese market is expanding rapidly , " confirms rené lang , president of the association of german fashion and textile designers .
" until now , china has been known first and foremost as a supplier , but now it has greater spending power , despite the crisis , and there are some very well trained designers and fashion schools .
but they are still in a phase where they tend to rely on foreign help expertise . "
enter michalsky .
after eleven years as global creative director at adidas , he founded his own label in 2006 and his ' real clothes for real people ' approach has done much to establish berlin as an up and coming fashion capital where style reflects the street more than the catwalk . nonetheless , the michalsky label has n't yet managed to turn a profit .
in that respect , it 's in the same boat as many ailing brands .
but while hard-up veteran french labels such as lacroix are busy nursing their wounds and sulkily blaming bankruptcy on the global financial crisis , michael michalsky - like the brave young rookie he is - wasted no time identifying markets not feeling the pinch of recession quite so harshly .
traditional brands might turn their noses up at china , but where others see only a low-end market , the german designer sees real potential : " the dongxiang group is very successful locally , and the company is now looking to expand internationally , " he says .
" to begin with , the line will only be available in china because that 's where they have their own stores , but they 're planning to expand across asia and i do n't see what 's to stop them ending up in other markets futher afield . "
" china is in a transitional phase right now , it 's moving away from imported goods towards home-grown products , " agrees rené lang .
" there 's a burgeoning desire for a more personal cultural identity attached to goods that have been specially produced for the chinese market . "
hot on the heels of jil sander bildunterschrift : jil sander 's clothes are elegant and austere - and big in japan in heading east , michalsky is following in the footsteps of only one other german designer .
in march , jil sander raised eyebrows from madison avenue to avenue montaigne when she teamed up with japanese budget clothing retailer uniqlo .
the company sells $ 30 jeans and $ 15 parkas , and is one of the few companies still thriving despite japan 's recession .
" the challenge for me is to establish premium quality and democratically priced brand uniqlo , " she told reporters in tokyo in spring .
similarly , michalsky showed that he 's not too proud to take his talents wherever they 're most wanted when he launched his mitch & co range for tchibo , a german range of coffee shops that also sells clothing , household items , electronics and electrical appliances .
the collection flopped , but the tie-up helped make michalsky a household name .
unlike many designers , he 's just not that precious .
as far as china is concerned , he shrugs off the qualms some of his colleagues might have about poor working conditions .
" i have n't yet been to any of the dongxiang factories , " he says .
" i 've been to the headquarters and it 's a very modern company and very european in its thinking .
in fact , the chinese factories i 've visited in their past when i was still with my former employer , were surprisingly modern and conditions were good .
they were no different to places i 've visited in italy .
i think conditions have improved a lot . "
image boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are conditions improving in the chinese textile industry ?
rené lang says the same .
" we need to get way from the idea of cheap china , " he stresses .
" standards are changing fast and there 's a growing interest in organic textiles , sustainability and better working conditions .
the situation will inevitably improve the more money starts circulating in the market .
china is trying to shed its bad image . "
as a designer , michalsky has often demonstrated a social conscience , referencing world affairs in his shows with comments on issues such as the hypocrisy of left-wing intellectuals , the tyranny of capitalism and the profligacy of wall street .
but with the ink still drying on his latest deal , he 's reluctant to consider the political or economic ramifications of his move into china .
" my message is simply that we are all living in one world and that 's why i wanted to do something in this part of the globe , " he sums up .
" i understand that young people are influenced by the same things all over the world , and i think that 's why i got the job . "

her comments were picked up by a number of german broadcasters , as well as many german newspapers .
but it seems that german media were not the only ones listening : conservative iranian media have now attacked ebadi for the statements she made while at deutsche welle .
" feigning interest " iran 's official news agency , the islamic republic news agency -lrb- irna -rrb- , writes that shirin ebadi has assumed the view of german chancellor angela merkel , feigning in unison with her concerns about freedom and civil rights in iran .
irna adds that on the other hand , ebadil like other western media , remains silent about " murders committed by the zionists and occupiers of palastine . "
it also accuses her of being silent about the " suffering of the poor people in afghanistan and thousands of prisoners in abu ghraib , guantanamo and baghram . "
irna continues : " when ebadi aligns herself with the europeans and other western nations , and criticizes and condemns the iranian government , she provides the western media with luxurious gifts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian authorities closed down the office of ebadi 's human rights group last year iranian internet news agency raja news linked ebadi 's statements to the fatal shooting of neda agha soltan , the young female student whose face became a symbol of the anti-government protests .
raja news writes : " following the unlawful killing of our beloved citizen neda by british agents in iran , mrs ebadi was one of those who published a letter , in unison with dishonest media like deutsche welle and the bbc , accusing the iranian government of being involved in this incident . "
comments misreported during her press conference at deutsche welle , ebadi spoke out clearly against economic sanctions on iran , saying these hurt only the iranian population .
but bultan news , another iranian internet news agency , reported that ebadi had in fact said the opposite .
bultan news quoted ebadi as saying : " if negotiations with iran do not result in democracy , then western countries should impose sanctions on iran . "
it also quoted her as saying that " negotiations are always the best approach - but we ca n't go on negotiating forever . "
such attacks are part of the stardard reperatoire of iran 's conservative media .
over the past few years , president mahmoud ahmedinejad has used the dispute over iran 's nuclear program to distract the population from the country 's economic problems and maintain their support .
the election of us president barack obama has robbed ahmedinejad of his favorite enemy , george w. bush .
the diputed iranian presidential election and the use of violence to put down protests there have further weakened him politically .
now the iranian leadership is apparently seeking to make up lost ground by creating new public enemies .
among those in their sights , apart from britain and france , is germany .
so far , this strategy has n't been successful .
criticism of the election continues in iran itself .
the protests are continuing even though the government has , through the use and threat of violence , managed to keep the demonstrators off the streets . author : jamsheed faroughi / sybille golte -lrb- ca -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move could help mitigate the company 's troubles on its home turf . it is something that has n't happened to aldi before : in the midst of a severe economic crisis germany 's discounting pioneer is faced with declining revenues in its home market .
according to data from research company gfk , aldi 's sales in germany declined by about five percent in the first five months of this year while the german retail sector as a whole shrank by only 2.2 percent .
it 's an entirely different story in the united states .
there , aldi is rapidly expanding its reach and expects to open 75 new stores this year .
the discount retailer entered the us market back in 1976 , but its no-frills concept only really started to take off in recent years .
" and of course the current economic crisis is really helping aldi to gain more customers , but is also making some changes in its concept " , explains matthias queck , senior discount analyst at market reseach firm planet retail .
for instance , aldi has added more fresh products , especially produce , to its range of products and has spruced up its stores to make them more attractive to new customers .
while older aldi stores where often located in less affluent neighborhoods , many new stores are located in areas that attract suburban and middle class shoppers as well .
low prices for high price markets aldi traditionally does n't release financial figures , but experts believe the german discount chain is doing quite well in the us and making significant inroads in the retail sector .
how then does aldi compete against us retail behemoth wal-mart on its home turf ?
it 's very simple , say the experts , the same way aldi and other german discounters forced wal-mart to shutter its doors in germany a couple of years ago : low prices and high quality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldi is taking on retail giant wal-mart on his home turf thomas roeb , a retail expert at the university of applied sciences rhine-sieg , argues that while wal-mart is considered a discounter in the us and has an image as a low-price retailer , its general pricing level is still fairly high .
in comparison to wal-mart aldi has a lower cost structure that allows it to become very successful in higher price markets like the united states . " however , the consumers so far did n't really believe in the value proposition of aldi and it is due to the economic crisis right now that people have started to try the concept . "
and , adds roeb , more and more americans give aldi 's no-frills concept a chance and actually find it attractive .
that 's because consumers realize that they can save money when shopping at aldi .
experts estimate that aldi 's prices are generally 10 to 15 percent lower than those of other national us retailers .
how does aldi do that ?
it keeps costs down with a limited range of products , smaller stores , fewer staff , and by not staying open as late as some of its competitors . it has also developed an efficient logistics system and most of the products that it sells are its own brand .
its sheer size allows it to get discounts by buying large quantities . too successful what can happen once aldi 's value proposition catches on in a big way , is evident in germany .
there , so-called " hard discounters " like aldi , account for more than 40 percent of the country 's retail sector .
the discount model has been so successful that aldi 's many competitors in germany are finally taking a bite out of its revenues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , aldi faces stiff competition from other discounters after decades of imitating aldi , says retail expert roeb , its german competitors have finally caught on .
" so it 's less aldi 's loss in the german market , it 's less that aldi is doing something wrong , but rather the fact that the competition is doing something right . "
that 's why aldi 's future growth will come mainly from abroad with the us being a prime target for expansion , argues discount expert queck : " just imagine that in the us , aldi has just 1,000 stores spread over 29 states , so that leaves a lot of room for further expansion . "
compare that with the roughly 1,700 stores that aldi sued , the part of the aldi company that manages its us operation , owns in southern and western germany alone and you can imagine the huge growth potential for the discounter in the us .
wal-mart dwarfs aldi despite aldi 's current advances in the us market , the question remains whether it can sustain its growth and customers once the economic malaise is over .
" i do believe that aldi is going to be successful even after the crisis , " says roeb .
" because we have had the same situation in germany and in some western european countries in the past .
everywhere aldi benefitted from economic crises to increase sales and consumers found the selection of products attractive so they found no need to switch back to their former supermarket . "
while aldi in the us with an estimated revenue of about seven billion dollars last year is tiny in comparison to wal-mart with its revenue of 375 billion dollars , the german discounter could challenge wal-mart in a specific segment - food .
wal-mart , says roeb is basically a non-food retailer that carries food as an important part , but not the main attraction of its product range .
" aldi however is a food specialist .
so when we are talking about competition between aldi and wal-mart , we are talking about competition in the field of food .
and i do believe that aldi is going to cause some problems for wal-mart in the future and even today in the area of food . "
that 's because , wal-mart 's image as a discounter in the food segment could be undercut by aldi 's value proposition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 17.07.2009 aldi advances on wal-mart 's home turf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with revenue dropping in germany , aldi is turing abroad for growth german discounting pioneer aldi is using the economic crisis to expand its presence in the us .
the move could help mitigate the company 's troubles on its home turf . it is something that has n't happened to aldi before : in the midst of a severe economic crisis germany 's discounting pioneer is faced with declining revenues in its home market .
according to data from research company gfk , aldi 's sales in germany declined by about five percent in the first five months of this year while the german retail sector as a whole shrank by only 2.2 percent .
it 's an entirely different story in the united states .
there , aldi is rapidly expanding its reach and expects to open 75 new stores this year .
the discount retailer entered the us market back in 1976 , but its no-frills concept only really started to take off in recent years .
" and of course the current economic crisis is really helping aldi to gain more customers , but is also making some changes in its concept " , explains matthias queck , senior discount analyst at market reseach firm planet retail .
for instance , aldi has added more fresh products , especially produce , to its range of products and has spruced up its stores to make them more attractive to new customers .
while older aldi stores where often located in less affluent neighborhoods , many new stores are located in areas that attract suburban and middle class shoppers as well .
low prices for high price markets aldi traditionally does n't release financial figures , but experts believe the german discount chain is doing quite well in the us and making significant inroads in the retail sector .
how then does aldi compete against us retail behemoth wal-mart on its home turf ?
it 's very simple , say the experts , the same way aldi and other german discounters forced wal-mart to shutter its doors in germany a couple of years ago : low prices and high quality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldi is taking on retail giant wal-mart on his home turf thomas roeb , a retail expert at the university of applied sciences rhine-sieg , argues that while wal-mart is considered a discounter in the us and has an image as a low-price retailer , its general pricing level is still fairly high .
in comparison to wal-mart aldi has a lower cost structure that allows it to become very successful in higher price markets like the united states . " however , the consumers so far did n't really believe in the value proposition of aldi and it is due to the economic crisis right now that people have started to try the concept . "
and , adds roeb , more and more americans give aldi 's no-frills concept a chance and actually find it attractive .
that 's because consumers realize that they can save money when shopping at aldi .
experts estimate that aldi 's prices are generally 10 to 15 percent lower than those of other national us retailers .
how does aldi do that ?
it keeps costs down with a limited range of products , smaller stores , fewer staff , and by not staying open as late as some of its competitors . it has also developed an efficient logistics system and most of the products that it sells are its own brand .
its sheer size allows it to get discounts by buying large quantities . too successful what can happen once aldi 's value proposition catches on in a big way , is evident in germany .
there , so-called " hard discounters " like aldi , account for more than 40 percent of the country 's retail sector .
the discount model has been so successful that aldi 's many competitors in germany are finally taking a bite out of its revenues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , aldi faces stiff competition from other discounters after decades of imitating aldi , says retail expert roeb , its german competitors have finally caught on .
" so it 's less aldi 's loss in the german market , it 's less that aldi is doing something wrong , but rather the fact that the competition is doing something right . "
that 's why aldi 's future growth will come mainly from abroad with the us being a prime target for expansion , argues discount expert queck : " just imagine that in the us , aldi has just 1,000 stores spread over 29 states , so that leaves a lot of room for further expansion . "
compare that with the roughly 1,700 stores that aldi sued , the part of the aldi company that manages its us operation , owns in southern and western germany alone and you can imagine the huge growth potential for the discounter in the us .
wal-mart dwarfs aldi despite aldi 's current advances in the us market , the question remains whether it can sustain its growth and customers once the economic malaise is over .
" i do believe that aldi is going to be successful even after the crisis , " says roeb .
" because we have had the same situation in germany and in some western european countries in the past .
everywhere aldi benefitted from economic crises to increase sales and consumers found the selection of products attractive so they found no need to switch back to their former supermarket . "
while aldi in the us with an estimated revenue of about seven billion dollars last year is tiny in comparison to wal-mart with its revenue of 375 billion dollars , the german discounter could challenge wal-mart in a specific segment - food .
wal-mart , says roeb is basically a non-food retailer that carries food as an important part , but not the main attraction of its product range .
" aldi however is a food specialist .
so when we are talking about competition between aldi and wal-mart , we are talking about competition in the field of food .
and i do believe that aldi is going to cause some problems for wal-mart in the future and even today in the area of food . "
that 's because , wal-mart 's image as a discounter in the food segment could be undercut by aldi 's value proposition .
and that , adds roeb , might end up having a negative impact on wal-mart 's public image . author : michael knigge editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" what we want to see is a process that is credible to the afghans because we are talking about a very young democracy that is still in infant shoes , " said christiane hohmann , spokeswoman for the eu 's external relations section . european commitments the european commission announced late last week that it is sending about 100 election monitors to the country – 16 are on the ground now , the rest will go just before election day . all in all , the eu is spending 40 million euros on afghan election support – money that goes to train eu and afghan election monitors and helps with practicalities , like printing up ballot sheets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan policeman stands guard as officials put up election posters near kabul " the immediate priority is naturally to ensure that the upcoming presidential election brings the necessary legitimacy needed to the new government , " european commissioner for external relations benita ferrero-waldner said in a speech at a donor conference on afghanistan in march . the organization for security and cooperation in europe is sending some 20 experts to kabul at the end of this month to provide technical assistance with voter registration , vote counting and tabulation , and domestic observation teams .
while afghanistan is outside the osce 's normal purview , it is looking at helping find ways to maintain long-term political in the country . " there is a lot of international support for this election and a lot of expertise is in the country , a lot of know-how , " said jens-hagen eschenbächer of the osce 's office for democratic institutions and human rights .
" we provide advice how these structures can be integrated to make the election process more sustainable . " german fears and hopes the german presence in afghanistan is considerable .
it has 3,830 troops in afghanistan as part of the nato-led international security assistance force and has been active in training afghan police . bildunterschrift : as the german death toll in afghanistan has risen , support at home is falling but support for the mission there in germany has been slipping .
according to a recent poll by german public broadcaster zdf , 55 percent of germans are not in favor of the peacekeeping mission there while 42 percent support the operation . the country has also been involved in economic reconstruction projects through its gtz technical aid organization .
despite the worsening security situation , the group 's afghan director andreas clausing said from kabul that the upcoming elections are something of a light at the end of the tunnel . " i think it is a very positive step , " he said , adding that " we and our afghan partners are looking very hopefully forward .

her comments were picked up by a number of german broadcasters , as well as many german newspapers .
but it seems that german media were not the only ones listening : conservative iranian media have now attacked ebadi for the statements she made while at deutsche welle .
" feigning interest " iran 's official news agency , the islamic republic news agency -lrb- irna -rrb- , writes that shirin ebadi has assumed the view of german chancellor angela merkel , feigning in unison with her concerns about freedom and civil rights in iran .
irna adds that on the other hand , ebadil like other western media , remains silent about " murders committed by the zionists and occupiers of palastine . "
it also accuses her of being silent about the " suffering of the poor people in afghanistan and thousands of prisoners in abu ghraib , guantanamo and baghram . "
irna continues : " when ebadi aligns herself with the europeans and other western nations , and criticizes and condemns the iranian government , she provides the western media with luxurious gifts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian authorities closed down the office of ebadi 's human rights group last year iranian internet news agency raja news linked ebadi 's statements to the fatal shooting of neda agha soltan , the young female student whose face became a symbol of the anti-government protests .
raja news writes : " following the unlawful killing of our beloved citizen neda by british agents in iran , mrs ebadi was one of those who published a letter , in unison with dishonest media like deutsche welle and the bbc , accusing the iranian government of being involved in this incident . "
comments misreported during her press conference at deutsche welle , ebadi spoke out clearly against economic sanctions on iran , saying these hurt only the iranian population .
but bultan news , another iranian internet news agency , reported that ebadi had in fact said the opposite .
bultan news quoted ebadi as saying : " if negotiations with iran do not result in democracy , then western countries should impose sanctions on iran . "
it also quoted her as saying that " negotiations are always the best approach - but we ca n't go on negotiating forever . "
such attacks are part of the stardard reperatoire of iran 's conservative media .
over the past few years , president mahmoud ahmedinejad has used the dispute over iran 's nuclear program to distract the population from the country 's economic problems and maintain their support .
the election of us president barack obama has robbed ahmedinejad of his favorite enemy , george w. bush .
the diputed iranian presidential election and the use of violence to put down protests there have further weakened him politically .
now the iranian leadership is apparently seeking to make up lost ground by creating new public enemies .
among those in their sights , apart from britain and france , is germany .
so far , this strategy has n't been successful .
criticism of the election continues in iran itself .

irna adds that on the other hand , ebadil like other western media , remains silent about " murders committed by the zionists and occupiers of palastine . "
it also accuses her of being silent about the " suffering of the poor people in afghanistan and thousands of prisoners in abu ghraib , guantanamo and baghram . "
irna continues : " when ebadi aligns herself with the europeans and other western nations , and criticizes and condemns the iranian government , she provides the western media with luxurious gifts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian authorities closed down the office of ebadi 's human rights group last year iranian internet news agency raja news linked ebadi 's statements to the fatal shooting of neda agha soltan , the young female student whose face became a symbol of the anti-government protests .
raja news writes : " following the unlawful killing of our beloved citizen neda by british agents in iran , mrs ebadi was one of those who published a letter , in unison with dishonest media like deutsche welle and the bbc , accusing the iranian government of being involved in this incident . "
comments misreported during her press conference at deutsche welle , ebadi spoke out clearly against economic sanctions on iran , saying these hurt only the iranian population .
but bultan news , another iranian internet news agency , reported that ebadi had in fact said the opposite .
bultan news quoted ebadi as saying : " if negotiations with iran do not result in democracy , then western countries should impose sanctions on iran . "
it also quoted her as saying that " negotiations are always the best approach - but we ca n't go on negotiating forever . "
such attacks are part of the stardard reperatoire of iran 's conservative media .
over the past few years , president mahmoud ahmedinejad has used the dispute over iran 's nuclear program to distract the population from the country 's economic problems and maintain their support .
the election of us president barack obama has robbed ahmedinejad of his favorite enemy , george w. bush .
the diputed iranian presidential election and the use of violence to put down protests there have further weakened him politically .
now the iranian leadership is apparently seeking to make up lost ground by creating new public enemies .
among those in their sights , apart from britain and france , is germany .
so far , this strategy has n't been successful .
criticism of the election continues in iran itself .
the protests are continuing even though the government has , through the use and threat of violence , managed to keep the demonstrators off the streets . author : jamsheed faroughi / sybille golte -lrb- ca -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he 's among the first german designers to head east , but he wo n't be the last . " china is the most exciting market for fashion right now , " enthuses michael michalsky , the darling of the recent berlin fashion week . " the chinese are really open to fashion , and let 's face it , the future of the world lies in this region , " he says as he reflects on his deal to develop a range of sportswear for the china dongxiang group .
the michalsky label might not yet be in the same league as karl lagerfeld , hugo boss or joop ! , but its namesake has always been ahead of the pack .
" i like to do things differently and i like to be the first , " he says .
" i was the first designer to move to berlin and do major shows here even before it was really on the map .
it 's part of my own nature and the character of both my company and my brand . "
shifting focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael michalsky is pushing fashion 's frontiers in these economically troubled times , thinking outside the box can make all the difference - and michael michalsky has broken with decades of fashion tradition by setting his sights on beijing and shanghai rather than paris and milan .
at the high-end of the industry , he 's one of the first to have woken up to china 's potential as more than a market for established western brands such as louis vuitton , cartier and bmw .
earlier this year , the new york times stated the obvious when it reported that china is now the world 's fastest-growing luxury market , with an estimated $ 7.6 billion in sales in 2008 .
michalsky , in the meantime , had cottoned on to a different , more significant growth - that of the domestic market .
although its love affair with imported luxury is still going strong , china is increasingly fed up being merely a production site for other countries and the home of cheap knock-offs .
these days , it 's keen to foster indigenous brands and to meet its consumer needs under its own steam .
" the domestic chinese market is expanding rapidly , " confirms rené lang , president of the association of german fashion and textile designers .
" until now , china has been known first and foremost as a supplier , but now it has greater spending power , despite the crisis , and there are some very well trained designers and fashion schools .
but they are still in a phase where they tend to rely on foreign help expertise . "
enter michalsky .
after eleven years as global creative director at adidas , he founded his own label in 2006 and his ' real clothes for real people ' approach has done much to establish berlin as an up and coming fashion capital where style reflects the street more than the catwalk . nonetheless , the michalsky label has n't yet managed to turn a profit .
in that respect , it 's in the same boat as many ailing brands .
but while hard-up veteran french labels such as lacroix are busy nursing their wounds and sulkily blaming bankruptcy on the global financial crisis , michael michalsky - like the brave young rookie he is - wasted no time identifying markets not feeling the pinch of recession quite so harshly .
traditional brands might turn their noses up at china , but where others see only a low-end market , the german designer sees real potential : " the dongxiang group is very successful locally , and the company is now looking to expand internationally , " he says .
" to begin with , the line will only be available in china because that 's where they have their own stores , but they 're planning to expand across asia and i do n't see what 's to stop them ending up in other markets futher afield . "
" china is in a transitional phase right now , it 's moving away from imported goods towards home-grown products , " agrees rené lang .
" there 's a burgeoning desire for a more personal cultural identity attached to goods that have been specially produced for the chinese market . "
hot on the heels of jil sander bildunterschrift : jil sander 's clothes are elegant and austere - and big in japan in heading east , michalsky is following in the footsteps of only one other german designer .
in march , jil sander raised eyebrows from madison avenue to avenue montaigne when she teamed up with japanese budget clothing retailer uniqlo .
the company sells $ 30 jeans and $ 15 parkas , and is one of the few companies still thriving despite japan 's recession .
" the challenge for me is to establish premium quality and democratically priced brand uniqlo , " she told reporters in tokyo in spring .
similarly , michalsky showed that he 's not too proud to take his talents wherever they 're most wanted when he launched his mitch & co range for tchibo , a german range of coffee shops that also sells clothing , household items , electronics and electrical appliances .
the collection flopped , but the tie-up helped make michalsky a household name .
unlike many designers , he 's just not that precious .
as far as china is concerned , he shrugs off the qualms some of his colleagues might have about poor working conditions .
" i have n't yet been to any of the dongxiang factories , " he says .
" i 've been to the headquarters and it 's a very modern company and very european in its thinking .
in fact , the chinese factories i 've visited in their past when i was still with my former employer , were surprisingly modern and conditions were good .
they were no different to places i 've visited in italy .
i think conditions have improved a lot . "
image boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are conditions improving in the chinese textile industry ?
rené lang says the same .
" we need to get way from the idea of cheap china , " he stresses .
" standards are changing fast and there 's a growing interest in organic textiles , sustainability and better working conditions .
the situation will inevitably improve the more money starts circulating in the market .
china is trying to shed its bad image . "
as a designer , michalsky has often demonstrated a social conscience , referencing world affairs in his shows with comments on issues such as the hypocrisy of left-wing intellectuals , the tyranny of capitalism and the profligacy of wall street .
but with the ink still drying on his latest deal , he 's reluctant to consider the political or economic ramifications of his move into china .
" my message is simply that we are all living in one world and that 's why i wanted to do something in this part of the globe , " he sums up .
" i understand that young people are influenced by the same things all over the world , and i think that 's why i got the job . "

he 's among the first german designers to head east , but he wo n't be the last . " china is the most exciting market for fashion right now , " enthuses michael michalsky , the darling of the recent berlin fashion week . " the chinese are really open to fashion , and let 's face it , the future of the world lies in this region , " he says as he reflects on his deal to develop a range of sportswear for the china dongxiang group .
the michalsky label might not yet be in the same league as karl lagerfeld , hugo boss or joop ! , but its namesake has always been ahead of the pack .
" i like to do things differently and i like to be the first , " he says .
" i was the first designer to move to berlin and do major shows here even before it was really on the map .
it 's part of my own nature and the character of both my company and my brand . "
shifting focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael michalsky is pushing fashion 's frontiers in these economically troubled times , thinking outside the box can make all the difference - and michael michalsky has broken with decades of fashion tradition by setting his sights on beijing and shanghai rather than paris and milan .
at the high-end of the industry , he 's one of the first to have woken up to china 's potential as more than a market for established western brands such as louis vuitton , cartier and bmw .
earlier this year , the new york times stated the obvious when it reported that china is now the world 's fastest-growing luxury market , with an estimated $ 7.6 billion in sales in 2008 .
michalsky , in the meantime , had cottoned on to a different , more significant growth - that of the domestic market .
although its love affair with imported luxury is still going strong , china is increasingly fed up being merely a production site for other countries and the home of cheap knock-offs .
these days , it 's keen to foster indigenous brands and to meet its consumer needs under its own steam .
" the domestic chinese market is expanding rapidly , " confirms rené lang , president of the association of german fashion and textile designers .
" until now , china has been known first and foremost as a supplier , but now it has greater spending power , despite the crisis , and there are some very well trained designers and fashion schools .
but they are still in a phase where they tend to rely on foreign help expertise . "
enter michalsky .
after eleven years as global creative director at adidas , he founded his own label in 2006 and his ' real clothes for real people ' approach has done much to establish berlin as an up and coming fashion capital where style reflects the street more than the catwalk . nonetheless , the michalsky label has n't yet managed to turn a profit .
in that respect , it 's in the same boat as many ailing brands .
but while hard-up veteran french labels such as lacroix are busy nursing their wounds and sulkily blaming bankruptcy on the global financial crisis , michael michalsky - like the brave young rookie he is - wasted no time identifying markets not feeling the pinch of recession quite so harshly .
traditional brands might turn their noses up at china , but where others see only a low-end market , the german designer sees real potential : " the dongxiang group is very successful locally , and the company is now looking to expand internationally , " he says .
" to begin with , the line will only be available in china because that 's where they have their own stores , but they 're planning to expand across asia and i do n't see what 's to stop them ending up in other markets futher afield . "
" china is in a transitional phase right now , it 's moving away from imported goods towards home-grown products , " agrees rené lang .
" there 's a burgeoning desire for a more personal cultural identity attached to goods that have been specially produced for the chinese market . "
hot on the heels of jil sander bildunterschrift : jil sander 's clothes are elegant and austere - and big in japan in heading east , michalsky is following in the footsteps of only one other german designer .
in march , jil sander raised eyebrows from madison avenue to avenue montaigne when she teamed up with japanese budget clothing retailer uniqlo .
the company sells $ 30 jeans and $ 15 parkas , and is one of the few companies still thriving despite japan 's recession .
" the challenge for me is to establish premium quality and democratically priced brand uniqlo , " she told reporters in tokyo in spring .
similarly , michalsky showed that he 's not too proud to take his talents wherever they 're most wanted when he launched his mitch & co range for tchibo , a german range of coffee shops that also sells clothing , household items , electronics and electrical appliances .
the collection flopped , but the tie-up helped make michalsky a household name .
unlike many designers , he 's just not that precious .
as far as china is concerned , he shrugs off the qualms some of his colleagues might have about poor working conditions .
" i have n't yet been to any of the dongxiang factories , " he says .
" i 've been to the headquarters and it 's a very modern company and very european in its thinking .
in fact , the chinese factories i 've visited in their past when i was still with my former employer , were surprisingly modern and conditions were good .
they were no different to places i 've visited in italy .
i think conditions have improved a lot . "
image boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are conditions improving in the chinese textile industry ?
rené lang says the same .
" we need to get way from the idea of cheap china , " he stresses .
" standards are changing fast and there 's a growing interest in organic textiles , sustainability and better working conditions .
the situation will inevitably improve the more money starts circulating in the market .
china is trying to shed its bad image . "
as a designer , michalsky has often demonstrated a social conscience , referencing world affairs in his shows with comments on issues such as the hypocrisy of left-wing intellectuals , the tyranny of capitalism and the profligacy of wall street .
but with the ink still drying on his latest deal , he 's reluctant to consider the political or economic ramifications of his move into china .
" my message is simply that we are all living in one world and that 's why i wanted to do something in this part of the globe , " he sums up .
" i understand that young people are influenced by the same things all over the world , and i think that 's why i got the job . "

health and public workers , as well as chronically ill people will get the flu shots first . the german health ministry announced on friday that an estimated quarter of germany 's population will be eligible to receive the flu shots .
this confirms reports earlier this week that the government had plans to order 50 million vaccine units against swine flu .
the vaccines will be available from september , to coincide with an expected surge in flu cases .
health state ministers late on thursday agreed that chronically ill patients , health care workers , police officers , fire fighters , public workers and pregnant women can receive the injections first .
two shots are needed for the vaccination to be effective against the -lrb- a -rrb- h1n1 virus .
" the vaccinations are a precautionary measure , " said health ministry spokesman , klaus vater .
" no one can tell how the new virus will develop in the coming weeks . "
despite the priority immunization list , federal health minister ulla schmidt insists that everyone who wants to be vaccinated against swine flu , will be able to do so .
protecting the entire population is expected to cost health insurers an estimated two billion euros .
around 800 infections - none fatal - have been reported in germany .
that 's the third-highest number in europe after britain and spain .
berlin has not said when the remaining population can be vaccinated .
this largely depends on how fast pharmaceutical companies can produce the vaccine .
the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- said up to 4.9 billion doses could be produced in 12 months . the un health body has meanwhile announced that it was no longer counting individual cases of swine flu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 17.07.2009 little enthusiasm for " us-india 3.0 " in mumbai and delhi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indians are glad hillary clinton is touring india , but really hope for a visit by president obama soon hillary clinton is visiting india for the first time as us secretary of state .
india , which signed an historic nuclear deal with the us under president bush has felt somewhat neglected by the obama administration so far . secretary clinton has announced that us-india relations are entering a new era , which she has called " us-india 3.0 " .
this new phase of bilateral relations would come after a first phase full of mutual distrust during the cold war and a slow rapprochement process under presidents bill clinton and george w. bush .
in her council on foreign relations address in washington this week , clinton said her talks in mumbai and delhi would cover an unprecedentedly wide range of issues .
" we are delighted that our two countries will be engaging in a very broad , comprehensive dialogue .
we believe india has a tremendous opportunity and growing responsibility , which they acknowledge , to play not just a regional role , but a global one as well . "
pakistan is top regional issue the most important regional issue is considered to be pakistan .
india has generally been supportive of the obama administration 's so called afpak -lrb- afghanistan-pakistan -rrb- policies , says chintamani mahapatra , an expert in indo-us relations at delhi 's prestigious jawaharlal nehru university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : combatting islamists in pakistan is a common goal for the us and india but , he adds , there remains disagreement on some issues : " american interest is confined to making pakistan fight the taliban , who are anti-us , anti-west .
and lashkar-e-taiba and other groups of terrorists in pakistan who are fomenting problems in india , both in kashmir and elsewhere , are off the hook . "
india blames lashkar-e-taiba for the mumbai attacks that killed more than 170 people last november and has suspended the " composite dialogue " process with pakistan as a consequence .
however , at this week 's meeting between the two countries ' prime ministers in sharm-el-sheikh , the indian position seemed to have mellowed somewhat .
the us will surely be happy about this , as any indo-pakistani conflict would distract pakistan from fighting the taliban .
observers also expect clinton to try and convince delhi that the kashmir conflict needs more attention .
non-proliferation before leaving for india , the secretary of state also mentioned that she wanted to talk about nuclear non-proliferation .
a tricky affair , since india has never been officially acknowledged as a nuclear power and refuses to sign the non-proliferation treaty , which it regards as discriminatory .
clinton has signalled that the americans are ready to look for innovative solutions : " there is nothing easy about non-proliferation .
i mean , anybody who ever read strobe talbott 's book ‘ engaging india ' knows this is a very difficult issue . "
other difficult issues likely to crop up during clinton 's trip to india include climate change and the " doha round " global trade negotiations .
but clinton is also going to want to simply improve the mood in india .
buttering up the indians chintamani mahapatra says the country has felt neglected by the obama administration so far : " i think the obama administration has marginalized india for quite a few months now .
we understand why it did so because the foreign policy plate of obama was truly overflowing . "
but he adds that at a time when hillary clinton 's clout in the administration is openly questioned in the us , it is not likely that her visit alone will impress the indians .
" we know very well that hillary clinton 's position in the decision-making process in the us is not very strong . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh is expected in washington in september although she has the ear of the president and has taken many foreign policy initiatives , they have not been taken up by the white house , says mahapatra who already talks about a visit of president barack obama to india .
" our prime minister is going to visit the us in september , and he had extended an invitation to president obama .
hopefully , he will come to india not towards the end of his term , but in the middle of his term if he really wants to improve the relationship between the two countries . "
so while there might be no serious conflict between india and the united states right now , there also seems to be little enthusiasm about " us-india 3.0 " .

india , which signed an historic nuclear deal with the us under president bush has felt somewhat neglected by the obama administration so far . secretary clinton has announced that us-india relations are entering a new era , which she has called " us-india 3.0 " .
this new phase of bilateral relations would come after a first phase full of mutual distrust during the cold war and a slow rapprochement process under presidents bill clinton and george w. bush .
in her council on foreign relations address in washington this week , clinton said her talks in mumbai and delhi would cover an unprecedentedly wide range of issues .
" we are delighted that our two countries will be engaging in a very broad , comprehensive dialogue .
we believe india has a tremendous opportunity and growing responsibility , which they acknowledge , to play not just a regional role , but a global one as well . "
pakistan is top regional issue the most important regional issue is considered to be pakistan .
india has generally been supportive of the obama administration 's so called afpak -lrb- afghanistan-pakistan -rrb- policies , says chintamani mahapatra , an expert in indo-us relations at delhi 's prestigious jawaharlal nehru university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : combatting islamists in pakistan is a common goal for the us and india but , he adds , there remains disagreement on some issues : " american interest is confined to making pakistan fight the taliban , who are anti-us , anti-west .
and lashkar-e-taiba and other groups of terrorists in pakistan who are fomenting problems in india , both in kashmir and elsewhere , are off the hook . "
india blames lashkar-e-taiba for the mumbai attacks that killed more than 170 people last november and has suspended the " composite dialogue " process with pakistan as a consequence .
however , at this week 's meeting between the two countries ' prime ministers in sharm-el-sheikh , the indian position seemed to have mellowed somewhat .
the us will surely be happy about this , as any indo-pakistani conflict would distract pakistan from fighting the taliban .
observers also expect clinton to try and convince delhi that the kashmir conflict needs more attention .
non-proliferation before leaving for india , the secretary of state also mentioned that she wanted to talk about nuclear non-proliferation .
a tricky affair , since india has never been officially acknowledged as a nuclear power and refuses to sign the non-proliferation treaty , which it regards as discriminatory .
clinton has signalled that the americans are ready to look for innovative solutions : " there is nothing easy about non-proliferation .
i mean , anybody who ever read strobe talbott 's book ‘ engaging india ' knows this is a very difficult issue . "
other difficult issues likely to crop up during clinton 's trip to india include climate change and the " doha round " global trade negotiations .
but clinton is also going to want to simply improve the mood in india .
buttering up the indians chintamani mahapatra says the country has felt neglected by the obama administration so far : " i think the obama administration has marginalized india for quite a few months now .
we understand why it did so because the foreign policy plate of obama was truly overflowing . "
but he adds that at a time when hillary clinton 's clout in the administration is openly questioned in the us , it is not likely that her visit alone will impress the indians .
" we know very well that hillary clinton 's position in the decision-making process in the us is not very strong . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh is expected in washington in september although she has the ear of the president and has taken many foreign policy initiatives , they have not been taken up by the white house , says mahapatra who already talks about a visit of president barack obama to india .
" our prime minister is going to visit the us in september , and he had extended an invitation to president obama .
hopefully , he will come to india not towards the end of his term , but in the middle of his term if he really wants to improve the relationship between the two countries . "
so while there might be no serious conflict between india and the united states right now , there also seems to be little enthusiasm about " us-india 3.0 " .

other difficult issues likely to crop up during clinton 's trip to india include climate change and the " doha round " global trade negotiations .
but clinton is also going to want to simply improve the mood in india .
buttering up the indians chintamani mahapatra says the country has felt neglected by the obama administration so far : " i think the obama administration has marginalized india for quite a few months now .
we understand why it did so because the foreign policy plate of obama was truly overflowing . "
but he adds that at a time when hillary clinton 's clout in the administration is openly questioned in the us , it is not likely that her visit alone will impress the indians .
" we know very well that hillary clinton 's position in the decision-making process in the us is not very strong . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh is expected in washington in september although she has the ear of the president and has taken many foreign policy initiatives , they have not been taken up by the white house , says mahapatra who already talks about a visit of president barack obama to india .
" our prime minister is going to visit the us in september , and he had extended an invitation to president obama .
hopefully , he will come to india not towards the end of his term , but in the middle of his term if he really wants to improve the relationship between the two countries . "
so while there might be no serious conflict between india and the united states right now , there also seems to be little enthusiasm about " us-india 3.0 " .

but there are no settlements yet and the moon 's " seas " are bone dry . the earth 's satellite looks really old .
it 's turned completely grey and its face is marked with numerous wrinkles , stains and scars .
it 's visible : it 's been through a lot in its lifespan .
but given it 's been around for some 4 and a half billion years , the moon has aged with dignity .
getting a facelift is out of the question .
and it 's not even necessary – as every four weeks during the new moon phase , the moon is veiled in darkness and ca n't be spotted from earth .
we can see many big dark and lighter areas on the face of the moon .
this is due to the varied landscape on its surface .
some people see a face up there , others claim the pattern looks like a hopping rabbit .
at the time of astronomer galileo galilei , the first observers looking through their telescopes euphorically baptized the dark spots " maria " - the latin word for the seas .
they imagined huge bodies of water sloshing about what poets called the " watery planet " , and they imagined a very special lunar species living on the moon .
all that has become legend , and although astronomers still talk about " maria " , it 's quite clear that the moon is dry as a desert .
bildunterschrift : the near side of the moon looks rugged from ancient meteorite collisions just like an old bookshelf , the moon is covered in thick dust .
today , it has completely congealed .
however our celestial companion looks back at a very turbulent past .
in the first billion years of its existence , just like earth , it was exposed to a tremendous bombardment .
leftover debris from planet formation was abundant , and huge meteorites and whole asteroids were colliding with the surface .
even today , the numerous craters on the moon bear witness to the dramatic impact .
the biggest craters gradually filled up with liquid lava and welled up from what then was the hot liquid core of the moon .
so the dark spots on the moon are actually due to volcanic activity .
and the maria of the moon probably came about roughly 3 billion years ago .
that 's when the worst bombardment with space debris was over , which is why there are relatively few craters in the maria .
the lighter-coloured regions of the moon are called " terrae " , or more commonly just highlands , since they are higher than most maria .
the soil samples collected by the apollo space missions are evidence that once upon a time there was indeed volcanic activity on the moon .
it 's still unclear though how the lava reached the surface of the moon .
possibly it came up through cracks created by the impact of meteorites in the craters .
even the first scientists observing the moon have come up with colorful names for the maria , full of longing for the supposedly paradisiacal conditions on the moon : there are for instance , a sea of mirth , of nectar , of crisis , of clouds and also a ' mare fecunditiatis ' , or the sea of fertility .
bildunterschrift : the first men on the moon put an end to lunar tranquility however , the most well-known dark spot in the near side of the moon – the right eye in the moon 's face – is called mare tranquilitatis , or the sea of tranquillity .
that name is an obvious misconception because four and a half million years later the lunar peace has well and truly been disturbed .
on july 21 , 1969 , neil armstrong took his famous first step on the moon right in the sea of tranquillity .

but there are no settlements yet and the moon 's " seas " are bone dry . the earth 's satellite looks really old .
it 's turned completely grey and its face is marked with numerous wrinkles , stains and scars .
it 's visible : it 's been through a lot in its lifespan .
but given it 's been around for some 4 and a half billion years , the moon has aged with dignity .
getting a facelift is out of the question .
and it 's not even necessary – as every four weeks during the new moon phase , the moon is veiled in darkness and ca n't be spotted from earth .
we can see many big dark and lighter areas on the face of the moon .
this is due to the varied landscape on its surface .
some people see a face up there , others claim the pattern looks like a hopping rabbit .
at the time of astronomer galileo galilei , the first observers looking through their telescopes euphorically baptized the dark spots " maria " - the latin word for the seas .
they imagined huge bodies of water sloshing about what poets called the " watery planet " , and they imagined a very special lunar species living on the moon .
all that has become legend , and although astronomers still talk about " maria " , it 's quite clear that the moon is dry as a desert .
bildunterschrift : the near side of the moon looks rugged from ancient meteorite collisions just like an old bookshelf , the moon is covered in thick dust .
today , it has completely congealed .
however our celestial companion looks back at a very turbulent past .
in the first billion years of its existence , just like earth , it was exposed to a tremendous bombardment .
leftover debris from planet formation was abundant , and huge meteorites and whole asteroids were colliding with the surface .
even today , the numerous craters on the moon bear witness to the dramatic impact .
the biggest craters gradually filled up with liquid lava and welled up from what then was the hot liquid core of the moon .
so the dark spots on the moon are actually due to volcanic activity .
and the maria of the moon probably came about roughly 3 billion years ago .
that 's when the worst bombardment with space debris was over , which is why there are relatively few craters in the maria .
the lighter-coloured regions of the moon are called " terrae " , or more commonly just highlands , since they are higher than most maria .
the soil samples collected by the apollo space missions are evidence that once upon a time there was indeed volcanic activity on the moon .
it 's still unclear though how the lava reached the surface of the moon .
possibly it came up through cracks created by the impact of meteorites in the craters .
even the first scientists observing the moon have come up with colorful names for the maria , full of longing for the supposedly paradisiacal conditions on the moon : there are for instance , a sea of mirth , of nectar , of crisis , of clouds and also a ' mare fecunditiatis ' , or the sea of fertility .
bildunterschrift : the first men on the moon put an end to lunar tranquility however , the most well-known dark spot in the near side of the moon – the right eye in the moon 's face – is called mare tranquilitatis , or the sea of tranquillity .
that name is an obvious misconception because four and a half million years later the lunar peace has well and truly been disturbed .
on july 21 , 1969 , neil armstrong took his famous first step on the moon right in the sea of tranquillity .

the three claimed to have more videos of susanne klatten in trysts with a swiss gigolo . in june this year , the blackmailers had written to susanne klatten and threatened to sell recordings of her with helg sgarbi to the italian media if the mother of three did not hand over 800,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.1 million -rrb- and a bmw x5 luxury sports utility vehicle .
the bwm-heiress immediately contacted the authorities .
police in the northern german city of duisburg " pretended to be acquaintances contacting them on behalf of klatten , " said thomas steinkraus-koch , a spokesman for prosecutors in munich .
police arrived in the bmw x5 to " complete the deal " as agreed on wednesday .
the three men were immediately arrested .
police said two of the three men aged 33 to 46 have a criminal history involving fraud and narcotics .
police said they had started analyzing computers and other evidence but so far no videos had been found .
not the first copy-cat attempt this is not the first copy-cat attempt to extort germany 's richest woman .
a munich newspaper reported that in march this year , klatten had received a letter from someone claiming to be sgarbi 's prison inmate who had told him where the sex-videos were hidden .
he had " only " demanded 75,000 euros .
klatten did not hesitate to pass the letter on to the authorities .
" we have a 100 percent success rate in catching any would-be blackmailers , " warned steinkraus-koch .
44-year old swiss national helg sgarbi is currently serving a six-year prison term for blackmailing the billionairess . the former investment banker met klatten in a luxury hotel in tirol in 2007 and began an affair with her and methodically videoed their private meetings .
sgarbi has refused to provide the names of any accomplices , or say where he has hidden the videos and the seven million euros he received from klatten .
police do have a seven-minute video in their possession but have not said what is on it .
no other videos of klatten and sgarbi have ever been recovered .
" we have not found any videos so far , " said steinkraus-koch .

the three claimed to have more videos of susanne klatten in trysts with a swiss gigolo . in june this year , the blackmailers had written to susanne klatten and threatened to sell recordings of her with helg sgarbi to the italian media if the mother of three did not hand over 800,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.1 million -rrb- and a bmw x5 luxury sports utility vehicle .
the bwm-heiress immediately contacted the authorities .
police in the northern german city of duisburg " pretended to be acquaintances contacting them on behalf of klatten , " said thomas steinkraus-koch , a spokesman for prosecutors in munich .
police arrived in the bmw x5 to " complete the deal " as agreed on wednesday .
the three men were immediately arrested .
police said two of the three men aged 33 to 46 have a criminal history involving fraud and narcotics .
police said they had started analyzing computers and other evidence but so far no videos had been found .
not the first copy-cat attempt this is not the first copy-cat attempt to extort germany 's richest woman .
a munich newspaper reported that in march this year , klatten had received a letter from someone claiming to be sgarbi 's prison inmate who had told him where the sex-videos were hidden .
he had " only " demanded 75,000 euros .
klatten did not hesitate to pass the letter on to the authorities .
" we have a 100 percent success rate in catching any would-be blackmailers , " warned steinkraus-koch .
44-year old swiss national helg sgarbi is currently serving a six-year prison term for blackmailing the billionairess . the former investment banker met klatten in a luxury hotel in tirol in 2007 and began an affair with her and methodically videoed their private meetings .
sgarbi has refused to provide the names of any accomplices , or say where he has hidden the videos and the seven million euros he received from klatten .
police do have a seven-minute video in their possession but have not said what is on it .
no other videos of klatten and sgarbi have ever been recovered .
" we have not found any videos so far , " said steinkraus-koch .
" we can not rule out however that they do not exist .
we have evidence that they may have been destroyed , but this has not been confirmed . " wl / ap / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it all started back in october 2006 when pyongyang tested a nuclear device , causing the members of the united nations security council -lrb- unsc -rrb- to issue unsc resolution 1718 , which put sanctions on trade in major weapons system , all products related to the production of weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- , and luxury goods .
but instead of convincing north korea to back off , it actually incited them to try harder ; a point that was proved when they launched a multi-stage rocket on april 5 of this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea 's explosion of a nuclear device on may 25 triggered protests in the south the newest sanctions imposed by the unsc panel on pyongyang for exploding a nuclear device on may 25 , which is completely binding for all member states , is a little bit different in that they focus not on the government as a whole , but rather on individuals and economic entities .
the list includes five companies , including one based in iran , and five north koreans .
the 15-nation council 's panel also banned two goods to be imported by north korea : graphite designed or specified for use in electrical discharge machining -lrb- edm -rrb- machines and para-aramid fiber - commonly known as kevlar - filament and tape .
the panel imposed a freeze of assets belonging to namchongang trading company , hong kong electronics , korea hyoksin trading corporation , general bureau of atomic energy and korean tangun trading corporation .
the five north koreans are : yun ho-jin , director of namchongang trading ; ri je-son and hwang suk-hwa , both directors of separate departments in the general bureau of atomic energy ; rihong-sop , former director of yongbyon nuclear research centre ; han yu-ro , director of korea ryongaksan general trading corporation .
the individuals ' assets will be frozen and they will be banned from travelling abroad .
smart sanctions according to professor michael brzoska , director of the institute for peace research and security policy at the university of hamburg , sanctions against north korea have been changed several times , but the main goal has always been to tighten the screws , particularly on the leadership , without harming the population too much .
the idea is to make life difficult for north korean president kim jong-il and those around him , as well as to limit the possibilities for state institutions , particularly in the financial field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea has been very secretive about the health of the country 's leader kim jong-il using these so-called smart sanctions to target individuals rather than entire governments is n't new ; since the early 1990s the unsc decided to try and influence the behavior of decision makers without harming the general population .
the first cases were iraq and the former yugoslavia , says brzoska , and since then there have been others , adding that the success of these actions has been very mixed .
in angola , for example , the unita rebel movement was targeted in this way and , in the end , lost the war to the government .
in liberia , where former president charles taylor , who is now at the international court of justice in the hague , became a target and that was successful in limiting his possibilities to buy arms and to pay his soldiers .
" one could also argue that in libya sanctions that harmed the leadership by making it more difficult to fly and to have money available for investment in the oil industry also helped to bring about change there .
but there are a lot of other cases where these types of smart sanctions did not have much effect , like in iran , the ivory coast or sierra leone , " says brzoska .
the china question the key to any of these sanctions being successful has always been how inclined the chinese government is to enforce them .
china is north korea 's only ally in the region , if not the world , and they have been reluctant to put pressure on pyongyang in the past .
this is mostly due to the fact that beijing uses its relationship with north korea - and the ability to bring kim jong-il to the negotiating table - to bargain with both japan and the united states , says dr. patrick koellner , acting head of the institute of asian affairs at the german institute of global and area studies .
according to koellner , china , which holds a permanent position on the security council , has the ability to bring north korea to its knees .
simply by cutting of supplies of energy and food and freezing the assets of north korean leaders , kim 's regime would have no choice but to surrender to any demands the un had of it .
however , unlike the japanese and the americans , the chinese actually have a vested financial interest in the sound future of north korea .
according to a report by the council on foreign relations , chinese trade and investment in north korea now totals $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.4 billion euros -rrb- a year . bildunterschrift : since the korean war the border between the two nations has been heavily guarded enforcement while complete chinese cooperation would make things a whole lot faster , it is n't required to put pressure on north korea .
stephan haggard and marcus noland from the peterson institute for international economics argue in a recently published report that the most interesting features of the resolution have to do with means of enforcement .
the resolution calls upon member states to inspect vessels on the high seas or escort them to port if they have reasonable grounds to believe that they are carrying prohibited cargo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any vessel heading into north korean waters suspected of carrying contraban is subject to a search however , there is a loophole in the wording , in order to intercept a ship , the country under which the vessel is flagged must give permission .
according to haggard and noland , this could provide incentives for north korea to do more shipping under its own flag ; though that is doubtful given the country 's standing in the international community .
many ships , regardless of their country of origin , sail under the auspices of countries such as liberia and panama - countries where fees , taxes , regulations , and laws protecting seafarers are often minimal or non-existent .
that means that these nations will be under more and more pressure to allow these ships to be searched , leaving north korea no choice but to use its own flag ; though this causes its own potential drama as north korea has stated in no uncertain terms that it would view such action as an act of war .

the list includes five companies , including one based in iran , and five north koreans .
the 15-nation council 's panel also banned two goods to be imported by north korea : graphite designed or specified for use in electrical discharge machining -lrb- edm -rrb- machines and para-aramid fiber - commonly known as kevlar - filament and tape .
the panel imposed a freeze of assets belonging to namchongang trading company , hong kong electronics , korea hyoksin trading corporation , general bureau of atomic energy and korean tangun trading corporation .
the five north koreans are : yun ho-jin , director of namchongang trading ; ri je-son and hwang suk-hwa , both directors of separate departments in the general bureau of atomic energy ; rihong-sop , former director of yongbyon nuclear research centre ; han yu-ro , director of korea ryongaksan general trading corporation .
the individuals ' assets will be frozen and they will be banned from travelling abroad .
smart sanctions according to professor michael brzoska , director of the institute for peace research and security policy at the university of hamburg , sanctions against north korea have been changed several times , but the main goal has always been to tighten the screws , particularly on the leadership , without harming the population too much .
the idea is to make life difficult for north korean president kim jong-il and those around him , as well as to limit the possibilities for state institutions , particularly in the financial field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea has been very secretive about the health of the country 's leader kim jong-il using these so-called smart sanctions to target individuals rather than entire governments is n't new ; since the early 1990s the unsc decided to try and influence the behavior of decision makers without harming the general population .
the first cases were iraq and the former yugoslavia , says brzoska , and since then there have been others , adding that the success of these actions has been very mixed .
in angola , for example , the unita rebel movement was targeted in this way and , in the end , lost the war to the government .
in liberia , where former president charles taylor , who is now at the international court of justice in the hague , became a target and that was successful in limiting his possibilities to buy arms and to pay his soldiers .
" one could also argue that in libya sanctions that harmed the leadership by making it more difficult to fly and to have money available for investment in the oil industry also helped to bring about change there .
but there are a lot of other cases where these types of smart sanctions did not have much effect , like in iran , the ivory coast or sierra leone , " says brzoska .
the china question the key to any of these sanctions being successful has always been how inclined the chinese government is to enforce them .
china is north korea 's only ally in the region , if not the world , and they have been reluctant to put pressure on pyongyang in the past .
this is mostly due to the fact that beijing uses its relationship with north korea - and the ability to bring kim jong-il to the negotiating table - to bargain with both japan and the united states , says dr. patrick koellner , acting head of the institute of asian affairs at the german institute of global and area studies .
according to koellner , china , which holds a permanent position on the security council , has the ability to bring north korea to its knees .
simply by cutting of supplies of energy and food and freezing the assets of north korean leaders , kim 's regime would have no choice but to surrender to any demands the un had of it .
however , unlike the japanese and the americans , the chinese actually have a vested financial interest in the sound future of north korea .
according to a report by the council on foreign relations , chinese trade and investment in north korea now totals $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.4 billion euros -rrb- a year . bildunterschrift : since the korean war the border between the two nations has been heavily guarded enforcement while complete chinese cooperation would make things a whole lot faster , it is n't required to put pressure on north korea .
stephan haggard and marcus noland from the peterson institute for international economics argue in a recently published report that the most interesting features of the resolution have to do with means of enforcement .
the resolution calls upon member states to inspect vessels on the high seas or escort them to port if they have reasonable grounds to believe that they are carrying prohibited cargo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any vessel heading into north korean waters suspected of carrying contraban is subject to a search however , there is a loophole in the wording , in order to intercept a ship , the country under which the vessel is flagged must give permission .
according to haggard and noland , this could provide incentives for north korea to do more shipping under its own flag ; though that is doubtful given the country 's standing in the international community .
many ships , regardless of their country of origin , sail under the auspices of countries such as liberia and panama - countries where fees , taxes , regulations , and laws protecting seafarers are often minimal or non-existent .
that means that these nations will be under more and more pressure to allow these ships to be searched , leaving north korea no choice but to use its own flag ; though this causes its own potential drama as north korea has stated in no uncertain terms that it would view such action as an act of war .

it all started back in october 2006 when pyongyang tested a nuclear device , causing the members of the united nations security council -lrb- unsc -rrb- to issue unsc resolution 1718 , which put sanctions on trade in major weapons system , all products related to the production of weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- , and luxury goods .

they include the bavarian brand " oettinger , " whose sales were up two percent .
oettinger , which for years has been germany 's most widely consumed beer , is to take over in august the " feldschloeßchen " brewery owned by the danish beer giant carlsberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous german beer brand " krombacher " saw sales plunge by 5.3 percent in the first quarter the other brewer to show growth in the first quarter - 2.5 percent - is the " hasseröder " brand .
the beer brand is part of belgium-based ab inbev , the world 's largest brewery and the second-largest beer producer in germany .
the biggest loser in the beer market , according to the study , is the cheaply-priced " sternburg , " an east german brand whose sales plunged 11 percent in the first quarter .

" the market has been significantly shrinking over the last few years , " peter hahn , head of the german brewers ' association told news agency dpa earlier this year .
" the times when every german drank more than 150 liters of beer annually are definitely gone . "
some have also blamed a public smoking ban in some german states as well as a deep recession for the latest drop in beer consumption .
to add to the woes , munich 's office of tourism said in may that revelers at this year 's oktoberfest in september would have to dig deeper into their pockets .
officials said a one-liter mug of beer will cost between 8.50 euros -lrb- $ 11.63 -rrb- and 8.60 euros this year - a five percent hike over 2008 prices. sp / dpa / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they include the bavarian brand " oettinger , " whose sales were up two percent .
oettinger , which for years has been germany 's most widely consumed beer , is to take over in august the " feldschloeßchen " brewery owned by the danish beer giant carlsberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous german beer brand " krombacher " saw sales plunge by 5.3 percent in the first quarter the other brewer to show growth in the first quarter - 2.5 percent - is the " hasseröder " brand .
the beer brand is part of belgium-based ab inbev , the world 's largest brewery and the second-largest beer producer in germany .
the biggest loser in the beer market , according to the study , is the cheaply-priced " sternburg , " an east german brand whose sales plunged 11 percent in the first quarter .
the brand is part of the frankfurt-based radeberger group , germany 's largest brewer .
steady drop in beer consumption according to the federal statistical office , the german beer market shrank by four percent in the first five months of 2009 .
exports to germany 's partners in the 27-nation european union were also down 12.5 percent in the first quarter .
thursday 's study did not provide a reason for the decline .
however , beer sales have been sliding steadily in germany for more than a decade , a trend that experts have attributed to an increasingly health-conscious public as well as the different drinking habits of younger consumers .
" the market has been significantly shrinking over the last few years , " peter hahn , head of the german brewers ' association told news agency dpa earlier this year .
" the times when every german drank more than 150 liters of beer annually are definitely gone . "
some have also blamed a public smoking ban in some german states as well as a deep recession for the latest drop in beer consumption .
to add to the woes , munich 's office of tourism said in may that revelers at this year 's oktoberfest in september would have to dig deeper into their pockets .
officials said a one-liter mug of beer will cost between 8.50 euros -lrb- $ 11.63 -rrb- and 8.60 euros this year - a five percent hike over 2008 prices. sp / dpa / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move could help mitigate the company 's troubles on its home turf . it is something that has n't happened to aldi before : in the midst of a severe economic crisis germany 's discounting pioneer is faced with declining revenues in its home market .
according to data from research company gfk , aldi 's sales in germany declined by about five percent in the first five months of this year while the german retail sector as a whole shrank by only 2.2 percent .
it 's an entirely different story in the united states .
there , aldi is rapidly expanding its reach and expects to open 75 new stores this year .
the discount retailer entered the us market back in 1976 , but its no-frills concept only really started to take off in recent years .
" and of course the current economic crisis is really helping aldi to gain more customers , but is also making some changes in its concept " , explains matthias queck , senior discount analyst at market reseach firm planet retail .
for instance , aldi has added more fresh products , especially produce , to its range of products and has spruced up its stores to make them more attractive to new customers .
while older aldi stores where often located in less affluent neighborhoods , many new stores are located in areas that attract suburban and middle class shoppers as well .
low prices for high price markets aldi traditionally does n't release financial figures , but experts believe the german discount chain is doing quite well in the us and making significant inroads in the retail sector .
how then does aldi compete against us retail behemoth wal-mart on its home turf ?
it 's very simple , say the experts , the same way aldi and other german discounters forced wal-mart to shutter its doors in germany a couple of years ago : low prices and high quality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldi is taking on retail giant wal-mart on his home turf thomas roeb , a retail expert at the university of applied sciences rhine-sieg , argues that while wal-mart is considered a discounter in the us and has an image as a low-price retailer , its general pricing level is still fairly high .
in comparison to wal-mart aldi has a lower cost structure that allows it to become very successful in higher price markets like the united states . " however , the consumers so far did n't really believe in the value proposition of aldi and it is due to the economic crisis right now that people have started to try the concept . "
and , adds roeb , more and more americans give aldi 's no-frills concept a chance and actually find it attractive .
that 's because consumers realize that they can save money when shopping at aldi .
experts estimate that aldi 's prices are generally 10 to 15 percent lower than those of other national us retailers .
how does aldi do that ?
it keeps costs down with a limited range of products , smaller stores , fewer staff , and by not staying open as late as some of its competitors . it has also developed an efficient logistics system and most of the products that it sells are its own brand .
its sheer size allows it to get discounts by buying large quantities . too successful what can happen once aldi 's value proposition catches on in a big way , is evident in germany .
there , so-called " hard discounters " like aldi , account for more than 40 percent of the country 's retail sector .
the discount model has been so successful that aldi 's many competitors in germany are finally taking a bite out of its revenues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , aldi faces stiff competition from other discounters after decades of imitating aldi , says retail expert roeb , its german competitors have finally caught on .
" so it 's less aldi 's loss in the german market , it 's less that aldi is doing something wrong , but rather the fact that the competition is doing something right . "
that 's why aldi 's future growth will come mainly from abroad with the us being a prime target for expansion , argues discount expert queck : " just imagine that in the us , aldi has just 1,000 stores spread over 29 states , so that leaves a lot of room for further expansion . "
compare that with the roughly 1,700 stores that aldi sued , the part of the aldi company that manages its us operation , owns in southern and western germany alone and you can imagine the huge growth potential for the discounter in the us .
wal-mart dwarfs aldi despite aldi 's current advances in the us market , the question remains whether it can sustain its growth and customers once the economic malaise is over .
" i do believe that aldi is going to be successful even after the crisis , " says roeb .
" because we have had the same situation in germany and in some western european countries in the past .
everywhere aldi benefitted from economic crises to increase sales and consumers found the selection of products attractive so they found no need to switch back to their former supermarket . "
while aldi in the us with an estimated revenue of about seven billion dollars last year is tiny in comparison to wal-mart with its revenue of 375 billion dollars , the german discounter could challenge wal-mart in a specific segment - food .
wal-mart , says roeb is basically a non-food retailer that carries food as an important part , but not the main attraction of its product range .
" aldi however is a food specialist .
so when we are talking about competition between aldi and wal-mart , we are talking about competition in the field of food .
and i do believe that aldi is going to cause some problems for wal-mart in the future and even today in the area of food . "
that 's because , wal-mart 's image as a discounter in the food segment could be undercut by aldi 's value proposition .
and that , adds roeb , might end up having a negative impact on wal-mart 's public image . author : michael knigge editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move could help mitigate the company 's troubles on its home turf . it is something that has n't happened to aldi before : in the midst of a severe economic crisis germany 's discounting pioneer is faced with declining revenues in its home market .
according to data from research company gfk , aldi 's sales in germany declined by about five percent in the first five months of this year while the german retail sector as a whole shrank by only 2.2 percent .
it 's an entirely different story in the united states .
there , aldi is rapidly expanding its reach and expects to open 75 new stores this year .
the discount retailer entered the us market back in 1976 , but its no-frills concept only really started to take off in recent years .
" and of course the current economic crisis is really helping aldi to gain more customers , but is also making some changes in its concept " , explains matthias queck , senior discount analyst at market reseach firm planet retail .
for instance , aldi has added more fresh products , especially produce , to its range of products and has spruced up its stores to make them more attractive to new customers .
while older aldi stores where often located in less affluent neighborhoods , many new stores are located in areas that attract suburban and middle class shoppers as well .
low prices for high price markets aldi traditionally does n't release financial figures , but experts believe the german discount chain is doing quite well in the us and making significant inroads in the retail sector .
how then does aldi compete against us retail behemoth wal-mart on its home turf ?
it 's very simple , say the experts , the same way aldi and other german discounters forced wal-mart to shutter its doors in germany a couple of years ago : low prices and high quality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldi is taking on retail giant wal-mart on his home turf thomas roeb , a retail expert at the university of applied sciences rhine-sieg , argues that while wal-mart is considered a discounter in the us and has an image as a low-price retailer , its general pricing level is still fairly high .
in comparison to wal-mart aldi has a lower cost structure that allows it to become very successful in higher price markets like the united states . " however , the consumers so far did n't really believe in the value proposition of aldi and it is due to the economic crisis right now that people have started to try the concept . "
and , adds roeb , more and more americans give aldi 's no-frills concept a chance and actually find it attractive .
that 's because consumers realize that they can save money when shopping at aldi .
experts estimate that aldi 's prices are generally 10 to 15 percent lower than those of other national us retailers .
how does aldi do that ?
it keeps costs down with a limited range of products , smaller stores , fewer staff , and by not staying open as late as some of its competitors . it has also developed an efficient logistics system and most of the products that it sells are its own brand .
its sheer size allows it to get discounts by buying large quantities . too successful what can happen once aldi 's value proposition catches on in a big way , is evident in germany .
there , so-called " hard discounters " like aldi , account for more than 40 percent of the country 's retail sector .
the discount model has been so successful that aldi 's many competitors in germany are finally taking a bite out of its revenues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , aldi faces stiff competition from other discounters after decades of imitating aldi , says retail expert roeb , its german competitors have finally caught on .
" so it 's less aldi 's loss in the german market , it 's less that aldi is doing something wrong , but rather the fact that the competition is doing something right . "
that 's why aldi 's future growth will come mainly from abroad with the us being a prime target for expansion , argues discount expert queck : " just imagine that in the us , aldi has just 1,000 stores spread over 29 states , so that leaves a lot of room for further expansion . "
compare that with the roughly 1,700 stores that aldi sued , the part of the aldi company that manages its us operation , owns in southern and western germany alone and you can imagine the huge growth potential for the discounter in the us .
wal-mart dwarfs aldi despite aldi 's current advances in the us market , the question remains whether it can sustain its growth and customers once the economic malaise is over .
" i do believe that aldi is going to be successful even after the crisis , " says roeb .
" because we have had the same situation in germany and in some western european countries in the past .
everywhere aldi benefitted from economic crises to increase sales and consumers found the selection of products attractive so they found no need to switch back to their former supermarket . "
while aldi in the us with an estimated revenue of about seven billion dollars last year is tiny in comparison to wal-mart with its revenue of 375 billion dollars , the german discounter could challenge wal-mart in a specific segment - food .
wal-mart , says roeb is basically a non-food retailer that carries food as an important part , but not the main attraction of its product range .
" aldi however is a food specialist .
so when we are talking about competition between aldi and wal-mart , we are talking about competition in the field of food .
and i do believe that aldi is going to cause some problems for wal-mart in the future and even today in the area of food . "
that 's because , wal-mart 's image as a discounter in the food segment could be undercut by aldi 's value proposition .
and that , adds roeb , might end up having a negative impact on wal-mart 's public image . author : michael knigge editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the three claimed to have more videos of susanne klatten in trysts with a swiss gigolo . in june this year , the blackmailers had written to susanne klatten and threatened to sell recordings of her with helg sgarbi to the italian media if the mother of three did not hand over 800,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.1 million -rrb- and a bmw x5 luxury sports utility vehicle .
the bwm-heiress immediately contacted the authorities .
police in the northern german city of duisburg " pretended to be acquaintances contacting them on behalf of klatten , " said thomas steinkraus-koch , a spokesman for prosecutors in munich .
police arrived in the bmw x5 to " complete the deal " as agreed on wednesday .
the three men were immediately arrested .
police said two of the three men aged 33 to 46 have a criminal history involving fraud and narcotics .
police said they had started analyzing computers and other evidence but so far no videos had been found .
not the first copy-cat attempt this is not the first copy-cat attempt to extort germany 's richest woman .
a munich newspaper reported that in march this year , klatten had received a letter from someone claiming to be sgarbi 's prison inmate who had told him where the sex-videos were hidden .
he had " only " demanded 75,000 euros .
klatten did not hesitate to pass the letter on to the authorities .
" we have a 100 percent success rate in catching any would-be blackmailers , " warned steinkraus-koch .
44-year old swiss national helg sgarbi is currently serving a six-year prison term for blackmailing the billionairess . the former investment banker met klatten in a luxury hotel in tirol in 2007 and began an affair with her and methodically videoed their private meetings .
sgarbi has refused to provide the names of any accomplices , or say where he has hidden the videos and the seven million euros he received from klatten .
police do have a seven-minute video in their possession but have not said what is on it .
no other videos of klatten and sgarbi have ever been recovered .

but there are no settlements yet and the moon 's " seas " are bone dry . the earth 's satellite looks really old .
it 's turned completely grey and its face is marked with numerous wrinkles , stains and scars .
it 's visible : it 's been through a lot in its lifespan .
but given it 's been around for some 4 and a half billion years , the moon has aged with dignity .
getting a facelift is out of the question .
and it 's not even necessary – as every four weeks during the new moon phase , the moon is veiled in darkness and ca n't be spotted from earth .
we can see many big dark and lighter areas on the face of the moon .
this is due to the varied landscape on its surface .
some people see a face up there , others claim the pattern looks like a hopping rabbit .
at the time of astronomer galileo galilei , the first observers looking through their telescopes euphorically baptized the dark spots " maria " - the latin word for the seas .
they imagined huge bodies of water sloshing about what poets called the " watery planet " , and they imagined a very special lunar species living on the moon .
all that has become legend , and although astronomers still talk about " maria " , it 's quite clear that the moon is dry as a desert .
bildunterschrift : the near side of the moon looks rugged from ancient meteorite collisions just like an old bookshelf , the moon is covered in thick dust .
today , it has completely congealed .
however our celestial companion looks back at a very turbulent past .
in the first billion years of its existence , just like earth , it was exposed to a tremendous bombardment .
leftover debris from planet formation was abundant , and huge meteorites and whole asteroids were colliding with the surface .
even today , the numerous craters on the moon bear witness to the dramatic impact .
the biggest craters gradually filled up with liquid lava and welled up from what then was the hot liquid core of the moon .
so the dark spots on the moon are actually due to volcanic activity .
and the maria of the moon probably came about roughly 3 billion years ago .
that 's when the worst bombardment with space debris was over , which is why there are relatively few craters in the maria .
the lighter-coloured regions of the moon are called " terrae " , or more commonly just highlands , since they are higher than most maria .
the soil samples collected by the apollo space missions are evidence that once upon a time there was indeed volcanic activity on the moon .
it 's still unclear though how the lava reached the surface of the moon .
possibly it came up through cracks created by the impact of meteorites in the craters .
even the first scientists observing the moon have come up with colorful names for the maria , full of longing for the supposedly paradisiacal conditions on the moon : there are for instance , a sea of mirth , of nectar , of crisis , of clouds and also a ' mare fecunditiatis ' , or the sea of fertility .
bildunterschrift : the first men on the moon put an end to lunar tranquility however , the most well-known dark spot in the near side of the moon – the right eye in the moon 's face – is called mare tranquilitatis , or the sea of tranquillity .
that name is an obvious misconception because four and a half million years later the lunar peace has well and truly been disturbed .
on july 21 , 1969 , neil armstrong took his famous first step on the moon right in the sea of tranquillity .

it 's turned completely grey and its face is marked with numerous wrinkles , stains and scars .
it 's visible : it 's been through a lot in its lifespan .
but given it 's been around for some 4 and a half billion years , the moon has aged with dignity .
getting a facelift is out of the question .
and it 's not even necessary – as every four weeks during the new moon phase , the moon is veiled in darkness and ca n't be spotted from earth .
we can see many big dark and lighter areas on the face of the moon .
this is due to the varied landscape on its surface .
some people see a face up there , others claim the pattern looks like a hopping rabbit .
at the time of astronomer galileo galilei , the first observers looking through their telescopes euphorically baptized the dark spots " maria " - the latin word for the seas .
they imagined huge bodies of water sloshing about what poets called the " watery planet " , and they imagined a very special lunar species living on the moon .
all that has become legend , and although astronomers still talk about " maria " , it 's quite clear that the moon is dry as a desert .
bildunterschrift : the near side of the moon looks rugged from ancient meteorite collisions just like an old bookshelf , the moon is covered in thick dust .
today , it has completely congealed .
however our celestial companion looks back at a very turbulent past .
in the first billion years of its existence , just like earth , it was exposed to a tremendous bombardment .
leftover debris from planet formation was abundant , and huge meteorites and whole asteroids were colliding with the surface .
even today , the numerous craters on the moon bear witness to the dramatic impact .
the biggest craters gradually filled up with liquid lava and welled up from what then was the hot liquid core of the moon .
so the dark spots on the moon are actually due to volcanic activity .
and the maria of the moon probably came about roughly 3 billion years ago .
that 's when the worst bombardment with space debris was over , which is why there are relatively few craters in the maria .
the lighter-coloured regions of the moon are called " terrae " , or more commonly just highlands , since they are higher than most maria .
the soil samples collected by the apollo space missions are evidence that once upon a time there was indeed volcanic activity on the moon .
it 's still unclear though how the lava reached the surface of the moon .
possibly it came up through cracks created by the impact of meteorites in the craters .
even the first scientists observing the moon have come up with colorful names for the maria , full of longing for the supposedly paradisiacal conditions on the moon : there are for instance , a sea of mirth , of nectar , of crisis , of clouds and also a ' mare fecunditiatis ' , or the sea of fertility .
bildunterschrift : the first men on the moon put an end to lunar tranquility however , the most well-known dark spot in the near side of the moon – the right eye in the moon 's face – is called mare tranquilitatis , or the sea of tranquillity .
that name is an obvious misconception because four and a half million years later the lunar peace has well and truly been disturbed .
on july 21 , 1969 , neil armstrong took his famous first step on the moon right in the sea of tranquillity .

hossein shariatmadari , editor-in-chief of the kayhan daily , said rafsanjani , a moderate who backed mousavi 's election campaign , had done nothing to prevent the gathering of mousavi supporters inside and outside tehran university , where prayers are held each friday and broadcast live on state radio .
in his first friday sermon since the controversial vote , rafsanjani criticized the way authorities in iran had handled the poll and said large numbers of iranians doubted the results of the election .
" in the current situation it is not necessary for us to have a number of people in prisons ... we should allow them to return to their families , " he said in the sermon at tehran university , broadcast live on state radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafsanjani is considered a key power-broker in iranian politics " we are all members of a family .
i hope with this sermon we can pass through this period of hardships that can be called a crisis , " rafsanjani said .
large opposition rally in tehran his sermon was marked by a large opposition rally in the streets outside the university - the first such demonstration for more than a week .
many protestors were reported to be wearing green bands to indicate support for opposition leader and defeated election candidate mir hossein mousavi .
news agency reuters said some were heard chanting " death to the dictator " and " ahmadinejad , resign , resign . "
the agency also quoted an unidentified witness saying police had fired tear gas and beat up mousavi supporters .
rafsanjani is a backer of mousavi who has demanded a re-run of the vote and described the new government as illegitimate .
cleric slams security crackdown rafsanjani , who heads the powerful assembly of experts and is an influential cleric , also appealed for an open debate on radio and television about the disputed 12 june election and called for media restrictions to be eased .
" it is not necessary to pressure media .
we should allow them to work freely within the law , " he said .

" we knew what imam khomeini wanted .
he did n't want the use of terror or arms , even in fights -lrb- for the revolution -rrb- . "
rafsanjani 's remarks are seen as a challenge to supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei , who has upheld the election result and accused foreign powers of fuelling the unrest .

hossein shariatmadari , editor-in-chief of the kayhan daily , said rafsanjani , a moderate who backed mousavi 's election campaign , had done nothing to prevent the gathering of mousavi supporters inside and outside tehran university , where prayers are held each friday and broadcast live on state radio .
in his first friday sermon since the controversial vote , rafsanjani criticized the way authorities in iran had handled the poll and said large numbers of iranians doubted the results of the election .
" in the current situation it is not necessary for us to have a number of people in prisons ... we should allow them to return to their families , " he said in the sermon at tehran university , broadcast live on state radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafsanjani is considered a key power-broker in iranian politics " we are all members of a family .
i hope with this sermon we can pass through this period of hardships that can be called a crisis , " rafsanjani said .
large opposition rally in tehran his sermon was marked by a large opposition rally in the streets outside the university - the first such demonstration for more than a week .
many protestors were reported to be wearing green bands to indicate support for opposition leader and defeated election candidate mir hossein mousavi .
news agency reuters said some were heard chanting " death to the dictator " and " ahmadinejad , resign , resign . "
the agency also quoted an unidentified witness saying police had fired tear gas and beat up mousavi supporters .
rafsanjani is a backer of mousavi who has demanded a re-run of the vote and described the new government as illegitimate .
cleric slams security crackdown rafsanjani , who heads the powerful assembly of experts and is an influential cleric , also appealed for an open debate on radio and television about the disputed 12 june election and called for media restrictions to be eased .
" it is not necessary to pressure media .
we should allow them to work freely within the law , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a protestor at the opposition rally in tehran on friday although rafsanjani stayed silent during the unrest that followed the election , members of his family - including his daughter faezeh - openly supported mousavi .

" we knew what imam khomeini wanted .
he did n't want the use of terror or arms , even in fights -lrb- for the revolution -rrb- . "
rafsanjani 's remarks are seen as a challenge to supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei , who has upheld the election result and accused foreign powers of fuelling the unrest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 17.07.2009 new un security council resolution against north korea großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the resolution is binding on all un member states a un security council panel has put five companies , including one based in iran , and five north koreans under un sanctions because of their links to pyongyang 's nuclear and ballistic missile activities . these sanctions against north korea are just the newest in an ongoing struggle to get the asian state to abandon its nuclear ambitions .
it all started back in october 2006 when pyongyang tested a nuclear device , causing the members of the united nations security council -lrb- unsc -rrb- to issue unsc resolution 1718 , which put sanctions on trade in major weapons system , all products related to the production of weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- , and luxury goods .
but instead of convincing north korea to back off , it actually incited them to try harder ; a point that was proved when they launched a multi-stage rocket on april 5 of this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea 's explosion of a nuclear device on may 25 triggered protests in the south the newest sanctions imposed by the unsc panel on pyongyang for exploding a nuclear device on may 25 , which is completely binding for all member states , is a little bit different in that they focus not on the government as a whole , but rather on individuals and economic entities .
the list includes five companies , including one based in iran , and five north koreans .
the 15-nation council 's panel also banned two goods to be imported by north korea : graphite designed or specified for use in electrical discharge machining -lrb- edm -rrb- machines and para-aramid fiber - commonly known as kevlar - filament and tape .
the panel imposed a freeze of assets belonging to namchongang trading company , hong kong electronics , korea hyoksin trading corporation , general bureau of atomic energy and korean tangun trading corporation .
the five north koreans are : yun ho-jin , director of namchongang trading ; ri je-son and hwang suk-hwa , both directors of separate departments in the general bureau of atomic energy ; rihong-sop , former director of yongbyon nuclear research centre ; han yu-ro , director of korea ryongaksan general trading corporation .
the individuals ' assets will be frozen and they will be banned from travelling abroad .
smart sanctions according to professor michael brzoska , director of the institute for peace research and security policy at the university of hamburg , sanctions against north korea have been changed several times , but the main goal has always been to tighten the screws , particularly on the leadership , without harming the population too much .
the idea is to make life difficult for north korean president kim jong-il and those around him , as well as to limit the possibilities for state institutions , particularly in the financial field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea has been very secretive about the health of the country 's leader kim jong-il using these so-called smart sanctions to target individuals rather than entire governments is n't new ; since the early 1990s the unsc decided to try and influence the behavior of decision makers without harming the general population .
the first cases were iraq and the former yugoslavia , says brzoska , and since then there have been others , adding that the success of these actions has been very mixed .
in angola , for example , the unita rebel movement was targeted in this way and , in the end , lost the war to the government .
in liberia , where former president charles taylor , who is now at the international court of justice in the hague , became a target and that was successful in limiting his possibilities to buy arms and to pay his soldiers .
" one could also argue that in libya sanctions that harmed the leadership by making it more difficult to fly and to have money available for investment in the oil industry also helped to bring about change there .
but there are a lot of other cases where these types of smart sanctions did not have much effect , like in iran , the ivory coast or sierra leone , " says brzoska .
the china question the key to any of these sanctions being successful has always been how inclined the chinese government is to enforce them .
china is north korea 's only ally in the region , if not the world , and they have been reluctant to put pressure on pyongyang in the past .
this is mostly due to the fact that beijing uses its relationship with north korea - and the ability to bring kim jong-il to the negotiating table - to bargain with both japan and the united states , says dr. patrick koellner , acting head of the institute of asian affairs at the german institute of global and area studies .
according to koellner , china , which holds a permanent position on the security council , has the ability to bring north korea to its knees .
simply by cutting of supplies of energy and food and freezing the assets of north korean leaders , kim 's regime would have no choice but to surrender to any demands the un had of it .
however , unlike the japanese and the americans , the chinese actually have a vested financial interest in the sound future of north korea .
according to a report by the council on foreign relations , chinese trade and investment in north korea now totals $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.4 billion euros -rrb- a year . bildunterschrift : since the korean war the border between the two nations has been heavily guarded enforcement while complete chinese cooperation would make things a whole lot faster , it is n't required to put pressure on north korea .
stephan haggard and marcus noland from the peterson institute for international economics argue in a recently published report that the most interesting features of the resolution have to do with means of enforcement .
the resolution calls upon member states to inspect vessels on the high seas or escort them to port if they have reasonable grounds to believe that they are carrying prohibited cargo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any vessel heading into north korean waters suspected of carrying contraban is subject to a search however , there is a loophole in the wording , in order to intercept a ship , the country under which the vessel is flagged must give permission .
according to haggard and noland , this could provide incentives for north korea to do more shipping under its own flag ; though that is doubtful given the country 's standing in the international community .
many ships , regardless of their country of origin , sail under the auspices of countries such as liberia and panama - countries where fees , taxes , regulations , and laws protecting seafarers are often minimal or non-existent .
that means that these nations will be under more and more pressure to allow these ships to be searched , leaving north korea no choice but to use its own flag ; though this causes its own potential drama as north korea has stated in no uncertain terms that it would view such action as an act of war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 17.07.2009 new un security council resolution against north korea großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the resolution is binding on all un member states a un security council panel has put five companies , including one based in iran , and five north koreans under un sanctions because of their links to pyongyang 's nuclear and ballistic missile activities . these sanctions against north korea are just the newest in an ongoing struggle to get the asian state to abandon its nuclear ambitions .
it all started back in october 2006 when pyongyang tested a nuclear device , causing the members of the united nations security council -lrb- unsc -rrb- to issue unsc resolution 1718 , which put sanctions on trade in major weapons system , all products related to the production of weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- , and luxury goods .
but instead of convincing north korea to back off , it actually incited them to try harder ; a point that was proved when they launched a multi-stage rocket on april 5 of this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea 's explosion of a nuclear device on may 25 triggered protests in the south the newest sanctions imposed by the unsc panel on pyongyang for exploding a nuclear device on may 25 , which is completely binding for all member states , is a little bit different in that they focus not on the government as a whole , but rather on individuals and economic entities .
the list includes five companies , including one based in iran , and five north koreans .
the 15-nation council 's panel also banned two goods to be imported by north korea : graphite designed or specified for use in electrical discharge machining -lrb- edm -rrb- machines and para-aramid fiber - commonly known as kevlar - filament and tape .
the panel imposed a freeze of assets belonging to namchongang trading company , hong kong electronics , korea hyoksin trading corporation , general bureau of atomic energy and korean tangun trading corporation .
the five north koreans are : yun ho-jin , director of namchongang trading ; ri je-son and hwang suk-hwa , both directors of separate departments in the general bureau of atomic energy ; rihong-sop , former director of yongbyon nuclear research centre ; han yu-ro , director of korea ryongaksan general trading corporation .
the individuals ' assets will be frozen and they will be banned from travelling abroad .
smart sanctions according to professor michael brzoska , director of the institute for peace research and security policy at the university of hamburg , sanctions against north korea have been changed several times , but the main goal has always been to tighten the screws , particularly on the leadership , without harming the population too much .
the idea is to make life difficult for north korean president kim jong-il and those around him , as well as to limit the possibilities for state institutions , particularly in the financial field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea has been very secretive about the health of the country 's leader kim jong-il using these so-called smart sanctions to target individuals rather than entire governments is n't new ; since the early 1990s the unsc decided to try and influence the behavior of decision makers without harming the general population .
the first cases were iraq and the former yugoslavia , says brzoska , and since then there have been others , adding that the success of these actions has been very mixed .
in angola , for example , the unita rebel movement was targeted in this way and , in the end , lost the war to the government .
in liberia , where former president charles taylor , who is now at the international court of justice in the hague , became a target and that was successful in limiting his possibilities to buy arms and to pay his soldiers .
" one could also argue that in libya sanctions that harmed the leadership by making it more difficult to fly and to have money available for investment in the oil industry also helped to bring about change there .
but there are a lot of other cases where these types of smart sanctions did not have much effect , like in iran , the ivory coast or sierra leone , " says brzoska .
the china question the key to any of these sanctions being successful has always been how inclined the chinese government is to enforce them .
china is north korea 's only ally in the region , if not the world , and they have been reluctant to put pressure on pyongyang in the past .
this is mostly due to the fact that beijing uses its relationship with north korea - and the ability to bring kim jong-il to the negotiating table - to bargain with both japan and the united states , says dr. patrick koellner , acting head of the institute of asian affairs at the german institute of global and area studies .
according to koellner , china , which holds a permanent position on the security council , has the ability to bring north korea to its knees .
simply by cutting of supplies of energy and food and freezing the assets of north korean leaders , kim 's regime would have no choice but to surrender to any demands the un had of it .
however , unlike the japanese and the americans , the chinese actually have a vested financial interest in the sound future of north korea .
according to a report by the council on foreign relations , chinese trade and investment in north korea now totals $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.4 billion euros -rrb- a year . bildunterschrift : since the korean war the border between the two nations has been heavily guarded enforcement while complete chinese cooperation would make things a whole lot faster , it is n't required to put pressure on north korea .
stephan haggard and marcus noland from the peterson institute for international economics argue in a recently published report that the most interesting features of the resolution have to do with means of enforcement .
the resolution calls upon member states to inspect vessels on the high seas or escort them to port if they have reasonable grounds to believe that they are carrying prohibited cargo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any vessel heading into north korean waters suspected of carrying contraban is subject to a search however , there is a loophole in the wording , in order to intercept a ship , the country under which the vessel is flagged must give permission .
according to haggard and noland , this could provide incentives for north korea to do more shipping under its own flag ; though that is doubtful given the country 's standing in the international community .
many ships , regardless of their country of origin , sail under the auspices of countries such as liberia and panama - countries where fees , taxes , regulations , and laws protecting seafarers are often minimal or non-existent .
that means that these nations will be under more and more pressure to allow these ships to be searched , leaving north korea no choice but to use its own flag ; though this causes its own potential drama as north korea has stated in no uncertain terms that it would view such action as an act of war .

the first cases were iraq and the former yugoslavia , says brzoska , and since then there have been others , adding that the success of these actions has been very mixed .
in angola , for example , the unita rebel movement was targeted in this way and , in the end , lost the war to the government .
in liberia , where former president charles taylor , who is now at the international court of justice in the hague , became a target and that was successful in limiting his possibilities to buy arms and to pay his soldiers .
" one could also argue that in libya sanctions that harmed the leadership by making it more difficult to fly and to have money available for investment in the oil industry also helped to bring about change there .
but there are a lot of other cases where these types of smart sanctions did not have much effect , like in iran , the ivory coast or sierra leone , " says brzoska .
the china question the key to any of these sanctions being successful has always been how inclined the chinese government is to enforce them .
china is north korea 's only ally in the region , if not the world , and they have been reluctant to put pressure on pyongyang in the past .
this is mostly due to the fact that beijing uses its relationship with north korea - and the ability to bring kim jong-il to the negotiating table - to bargain with both japan and the united states , says dr. patrick koellner , acting head of the institute of asian affairs at the german institute of global and area studies .
according to koellner , china , which holds a permanent position on the security council , has the ability to bring north korea to its knees .
simply by cutting of supplies of energy and food and freezing the assets of north korean leaders , kim 's regime would have no choice but to surrender to any demands the un had of it .
however , unlike the japanese and the americans , the chinese actually have a vested financial interest in the sound future of north korea .
according to a report by the council on foreign relations , chinese trade and investment in north korea now totals $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.4 billion euros -rrb- a year . bildunterschrift : since the korean war the border between the two nations has been heavily guarded enforcement while complete chinese cooperation would make things a whole lot faster , it is n't required to put pressure on north korea .
stephan haggard and marcus noland from the peterson institute for international economics argue in a recently published report that the most interesting features of the resolution have to do with means of enforcement .
the resolution calls upon member states to inspect vessels on the high seas or escort them to port if they have reasonable grounds to believe that they are carrying prohibited cargo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any vessel heading into north korean waters suspected of carrying contraban is subject to a search however , there is a loophole in the wording , in order to intercept a ship , the country under which the vessel is flagged must give permission .
according to haggard and noland , this could provide incentives for north korea to do more shipping under its own flag ; though that is doubtful given the country 's standing in the international community .
many ships , regardless of their country of origin , sail under the auspices of countries such as liberia and panama - countries where fees , taxes , regulations , and laws protecting seafarers are often minimal or non-existent .
that means that these nations will be under more and more pressure to allow these ships to be searched , leaving north korea no choice but to use its own flag ; though this causes its own potential drama as north korea has stated in no uncertain terms that it would view such action as an act of war .

india , which signed an historic nuclear deal with the us under president bush has felt somewhat neglected by the obama administration so far . secretary clinton has announced that us-india relations are entering a new era , which she has called " us-india 3.0 " .
this new phase of bilateral relations would come after a first phase full of mutual distrust during the cold war and a slow rapprochement process under presidents bill clinton and george w. bush .
in her council on foreign relations address in washington this week , clinton said her talks in mumbai and delhi would cover an unprecedentedly wide range of issues .
" we are delighted that our two countries will be engaging in a very broad , comprehensive dialogue .
we believe india has a tremendous opportunity and growing responsibility , which they acknowledge , to play not just a regional role , but a global one as well . "
pakistan is top regional issue the most important regional issue is considered to be pakistan .
india has generally been supportive of the obama administration 's so called afpak -lrb- afghanistan-pakistan -rrb- policies , says chintamani mahapatra , an expert in indo-us relations at delhi 's prestigious jawaharlal nehru university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : combatting islamists in pakistan is a common goal for the us and india but , he adds , there remains disagreement on some issues : " american interest is confined to making pakistan fight the taliban , who are anti-us , anti-west .
and lashkar-e-taiba and other groups of terrorists in pakistan who are fomenting problems in india , both in kashmir and elsewhere , are off the hook . "
india blames lashkar-e-taiba for the mumbai attacks that killed more than 170 people last november and has suspended the " composite dialogue " process with pakistan as a consequence .
however , at this week 's meeting between the two countries ' prime ministers in sharm-el-sheikh , the indian position seemed to have mellowed somewhat .
the us will surely be happy about this , as any indo-pakistani conflict would distract pakistan from fighting the taliban .
observers also expect clinton to try and convince delhi that the kashmir conflict needs more attention .
non-proliferation before leaving for india , the secretary of state also mentioned that she wanted to talk about nuclear non-proliferation .
a tricky affair , since india has never been officially acknowledged as a nuclear power and refuses to sign the non-proliferation treaty , which it regards as discriminatory .
clinton has signalled that the americans are ready to look for innovative solutions : " there is nothing easy about non-proliferation .
i mean , anybody who ever read strobe talbott 's book ‘ engaging india ' knows this is a very difficult issue . "
other difficult issues likely to crop up during clinton 's trip to india include climate change and the " doha round " global trade negotiations .
but clinton is also going to want to simply improve the mood in india .
buttering up the indians chintamani mahapatra says the country has felt neglected by the obama administration so far : " i think the obama administration has marginalized india for quite a few months now .
we understand why it did so because the foreign policy plate of obama was truly overflowing . "
but he adds that at a time when hillary clinton 's clout in the administration is openly questioned in the us , it is not likely that her visit alone will impress the indians .
" we know very well that hillary clinton 's position in the decision-making process in the us is not very strong . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh is expected in washington in september although she has the ear of the president and has taken many foreign policy initiatives , they have not been taken up by the white house , says mahapatra who already talks about a visit of president barack obama to india .
" our prime minister is going to visit the us in september , and he had extended an invitation to president obama .
hopefully , he will come to india not towards the end of his term , but in the middle of his term if he really wants to improve the relationship between the two countries . "
so while there might be no serious conflict between india and the united states right now , there also seems to be little enthusiasm about " us-india 3.0 " .

they include the bavarian brand " oettinger , " whose sales were up two percent .
oettinger , which for years has been germany 's most widely consumed beer , is to take over in august the " feldschloeßchen " brewery owned by the danish beer giant carlsberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous german beer brand " krombacher " saw sales plunge by 5.3 percent in the first quarter the other brewer to show growth in the first quarter - 2.5 percent - is the " hasseröder " brand .
the beer brand is part of belgium-based ab inbev , the world 's largest brewery and the second-largest beer producer in germany .
the biggest loser in the beer market , according to the study , is the cheaply-priced " sternburg , " an east german brand whose sales plunged 11 percent in the first quarter .
the brand is part of the frankfurt-based radeberger group , germany 's largest brewer .
steady drop in beer consumption according to the federal statistical office , the german beer market shrank by four percent in the first five months of 2009 .
exports to germany 's partners in the 27-nation european union were also down 12.5 percent in the first quarter .
thursday 's study did not provide a reason for the decline .
however , beer sales have been sliding steadily in germany for more than a decade , a trend that experts have attributed to an increasingly health-conscious public as well as the different drinking habits of younger consumers .
" the market has been significantly shrinking over the last few years , " peter hahn , head of the german brewers ' association told news agency dpa earlier this year .
" the times when every german drank more than 150 liters of beer annually are definitely gone . "
some have also blamed a public smoking ban in some german states as well as a deep recession for the latest drop in beer consumption .
to add to the woes , munich 's office of tourism said in may that revelers at this year 's oktoberfest in september would have to dig deeper into their pockets .
officials said a one-liter mug of beer will cost between 8.50 euros -lrb- $ 11.63 -rrb- and 8.60 euros this year - a five percent hike over 2008 prices. sp / dpa / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

health and public workers , as well as chronically ill people will get the flu shots first . the german health ministry announced on friday that an estimated quarter of germany 's population will be eligible to receive the flu shots .
this confirms reports earlier this week that the government had plans to order 50 million vaccine units against swine flu .
the vaccines will be available from september , to coincide with an expected surge in flu cases .
health state ministers late on thursday agreed that chronically ill patients , health care workers , police officers , fire fighters , public workers and pregnant women can receive the injections first .
two shots are needed for the vaccination to be effective against the -lrb- a -rrb- h1n1 virus .
" the vaccinations are a precautionary measure , " said health ministry spokesman , klaus vater .
" no one can tell how the new virus will develop in the coming weeks . "
despite the priority immunization list , federal health minister ulla schmidt insists that everyone who wants to be vaccinated against swine flu , will be able to do so .
protecting the entire population is expected to cost health insurers an estimated two billion euros .
around 800 infections - none fatal - have been reported in germany .
that 's the third-highest number in europe after britain and spain .
berlin has not said when the remaining population can be vaccinated .
this largely depends on how fast pharmaceutical companies can produce the vaccine .
the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- said up to 4.9 billion doses could be produced in 12 months . the un health body has meanwhile announced that it was no longer counting individual cases of swine flu .
it said the virus is spreading so fast , it can not keep up with all the figures and is now asking national health authorities to only report clusters of severe cases , deaths caused by the new virus , or unusual clinical patterns. wl / reuters / dpa / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he 's among the first german designers to head east , but he wo n't be the last . " china is the most exciting market for fashion right now , " enthuses michael michalsky , the darling of the recent berlin fashion week . " the chinese are really open to fashion , and let 's face it , the future of the world lies in this region , " he says as he reflects on his deal to develop a range of sportswear for the china dongxiang group .
the michalsky label might not yet be in the same league as karl lagerfeld , hugo boss or joop ! , but its namesake has always been ahead of the pack .
" i like to do things differently and i like to be the first , " he says .
" i was the first designer to move to berlin and do major shows here even before it was really on the map .
it 's part of my own nature and the character of both my company and my brand . "
shifting focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael michalsky is pushing fashion 's frontiers in these economically troubled times , thinking outside the box can make all the difference - and michael michalsky has broken with decades of fashion tradition by setting his sights on beijing and shanghai rather than paris and milan .
at the high-end of the industry , he 's one of the first to have woken up to china 's potential as more than a market for established western brands such as louis vuitton , cartier and bmw .
earlier this year , the new york times stated the obvious when it reported that china is now the world 's fastest-growing luxury market , with an estimated $ 7.6 billion in sales in 2008 .
michalsky , in the meantime , had cottoned on to a different , more significant growth - that of the domestic market .
although its love affair with imported luxury is still going strong , china is increasingly fed up being merely a production site for other countries and the home of cheap knock-offs .
these days , it 's keen to foster indigenous brands and to meet its consumer needs under its own steam .
" the domestic chinese market is expanding rapidly , " confirms rené lang , president of the association of german fashion and textile designers .
" until now , china has been known first and foremost as a supplier , but now it has greater spending power , despite the crisis , and there are some very well trained designers and fashion schools .
but they are still in a phase where they tend to rely on foreign help expertise . "
enter michalsky .
after eleven years as global creative director at adidas , he founded his own label in 2006 and his ' real clothes for real people ' approach has done much to establish berlin as an up and coming fashion capital where style reflects the street more than the catwalk . nonetheless , the michalsky label has n't yet managed to turn a profit .
in that respect , it 's in the same boat as many ailing brands .
but while hard-up veteran french labels such as lacroix are busy nursing their wounds and sulkily blaming bankruptcy on the global financial crisis , michael michalsky - like the brave young rookie he is - wasted no time identifying markets not feeling the pinch of recession quite so harshly .
traditional brands might turn their noses up at china , but where others see only a low-end market , the german designer sees real potential : " the dongxiang group is very successful locally , and the company is now looking to expand internationally , " he says .
" to begin with , the line will only be available in china because that 's where they have their own stores , but they 're planning to expand across asia and i do n't see what 's to stop them ending up in other markets futher afield . "
" china is in a transitional phase right now , it 's moving away from imported goods towards home-grown products , " agrees rené lang .
" there 's a burgeoning desire for a more personal cultural identity attached to goods that have been specially produced for the chinese market . "
hot on the heels of jil sander bildunterschrift : jil sander 's clothes are elegant and austere - and big in japan in heading east , michalsky is following in the footsteps of only one other german designer .
in march , jil sander raised eyebrows from madison avenue to avenue montaigne when she teamed up with japanese budget clothing retailer uniqlo .
the company sells $ 30 jeans and $ 15 parkas , and is one of the few companies still thriving despite japan 's recession .
" the challenge for me is to establish premium quality and democratically priced brand uniqlo , " she told reporters in tokyo in spring .
similarly , michalsky showed that he 's not too proud to take his talents wherever they 're most wanted when he launched his mitch & co range for tchibo , a german range of coffee shops that also sells clothing , household items , electronics and electrical appliances .
the collection flopped , but the tie-up helped make michalsky a household name .
unlike many designers , he 's just not that precious .
as far as china is concerned , he shrugs off the qualms some of his colleagues might have about poor working conditions .
" i have n't yet been to any of the dongxiang factories , " he says .
" i 've been to the headquarters and it 's a very modern company and very european in its thinking .
in fact , the chinese factories i 've visited in their past when i was still with my former employer , were surprisingly modern and conditions were good .
they were no different to places i 've visited in italy .
i think conditions have improved a lot . "
image boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are conditions improving in the chinese textile industry ?
rené lang says the same .
" we need to get way from the idea of cheap china , " he stresses .
" standards are changing fast and there 's a growing interest in organic textiles , sustainability and better working conditions .
the situation will inevitably improve the more money starts circulating in the market .
china is trying to shed its bad image . "
as a designer , michalsky has often demonstrated a social conscience , referencing world affairs in his shows with comments on issues such as the hypocrisy of left-wing intellectuals , the tyranny of capitalism and the profligacy of wall street .
but with the ink still drying on his latest deal , he 's reluctant to consider the political or economic ramifications of his move into china .
" my message is simply that we are all living in one world and that 's why i wanted to do something in this part of the globe , " he sums up .
" i understand that young people are influenced by the same things all over the world , and i think that 's why i got the job . "

" i was the first designer to move to berlin and do major shows here even before it was really on the map .
it 's part of my own nature and the character of both my company and my brand . "
shifting focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael michalsky is pushing fashion 's frontiers in these economically troubled times , thinking outside the box can make all the difference - and michael michalsky has broken with decades of fashion tradition by setting his sights on beijing and shanghai rather than paris and milan .
at the high-end of the industry , he 's one of the first to have woken up to china 's potential as more than a market for established western brands such as louis vuitton , cartier and bmw .
earlier this year , the new york times stated the obvious when it reported that china is now the world 's fastest-growing luxury market , with an estimated $ 7.6 billion in sales in 2008 .
michalsky , in the meantime , had cottoned on to a different , more significant growth - that of the domestic market .
although its love affair with imported luxury is still going strong , china is increasingly fed up being merely a production site for other countries and the home of cheap knock-offs .
these days , it 's keen to foster indigenous brands and to meet its consumer needs under its own steam .
" the domestic chinese market is expanding rapidly , " confirms rené lang , president of the association of german fashion and textile designers .
" until now , china has been known first and foremost as a supplier , but now it has greater spending power , despite the crisis , and there are some very well trained designers and fashion schools .
but they are still in a phase where they tend to rely on foreign help expertise . "
enter michalsky .
after eleven years as global creative director at adidas , he founded his own label in 2006 and his ' real clothes for real people ' approach has done much to establish berlin as an up and coming fashion capital where style reflects the street more than the catwalk . nonetheless , the michalsky label has n't yet managed to turn a profit .
in that respect , it 's in the same boat as many ailing brands .
but while hard-up veteran french labels such as lacroix are busy nursing their wounds and sulkily blaming bankruptcy on the global financial crisis , michael michalsky - like the brave young rookie he is - wasted no time identifying markets not feeling the pinch of recession quite so harshly .
traditional brands might turn their noses up at china , but where others see only a low-end market , the german designer sees real potential : " the dongxiang group is very successful locally , and the company is now looking to expand internationally , " he says .
" to begin with , the line will only be available in china because that 's where they have their own stores , but they 're planning to expand across asia and i do n't see what 's to stop them ending up in other markets futher afield . "
" china is in a transitional phase right now , it 's moving away from imported goods towards home-grown products , " agrees rené lang .
" there 's a burgeoning desire for a more personal cultural identity attached to goods that have been specially produced for the chinese market . "
hot on the heels of jil sander bildunterschrift : jil sander 's clothes are elegant and austere - and big in japan in heading east , michalsky is following in the footsteps of only one other german designer .
in march , jil sander raised eyebrows from madison avenue to avenue montaigne when she teamed up with japanese budget clothing retailer uniqlo .
the company sells $ 30 jeans and $ 15 parkas , and is one of the few companies still thriving despite japan 's recession .
" the challenge for me is to establish premium quality and democratically priced brand uniqlo , " she told reporters in tokyo in spring .
similarly , michalsky showed that he 's not too proud to take his talents wherever they 're most wanted when he launched his mitch & co range for tchibo , a german range of coffee shops that also sells clothing , household items , electronics and electrical appliances .
the collection flopped , but the tie-up helped make michalsky a household name .
unlike many designers , he 's just not that precious .
as far as china is concerned , he shrugs off the qualms some of his colleagues might have about poor working conditions .
" i have n't yet been to any of the dongxiang factories , " he says .
" i 've been to the headquarters and it 's a very modern company and very european in its thinking .
in fact , the chinese factories i 've visited in their past when i was still with my former employer , were surprisingly modern and conditions were good .
they were no different to places i 've visited in italy .
i think conditions have improved a lot . "
image boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are conditions improving in the chinese textile industry ?
rené lang says the same .
" we need to get way from the idea of cheap china , " he stresses .
" standards are changing fast and there 's a growing interest in organic textiles , sustainability and better working conditions .
the situation will inevitably improve the more money starts circulating in the market .
china is trying to shed its bad image . "
as a designer , michalsky has often demonstrated a social conscience , referencing world affairs in his shows with comments on issues such as the hypocrisy of left-wing intellectuals , the tyranny of capitalism and the profligacy of wall street .
but with the ink still drying on his latest deal , he 's reluctant to consider the political or economic ramifications of his move into china .
" my message is simply that we are all living in one world and that 's why i wanted to do something in this part of the globe , " he sums up .
" i understand that young people are influenced by the same things all over the world , and i think that 's why i got the job . "

but there are no settlements yet and the moon 's " seas " are bone dry . the earth 's satellite looks really old .
it 's turned completely grey and its face is marked with numerous wrinkles , stains and scars .
it 's visible : it 's been through a lot in its lifespan .
but given it 's been around for some 4 and a half billion years , the moon has aged with dignity .
getting a facelift is out of the question .
and it 's not even necessary – as every four weeks during the new moon phase , the moon is veiled in darkness and ca n't be spotted from earth .
we can see many big dark and lighter areas on the face of the moon .
this is due to the varied landscape on its surface .
some people see a face up there , others claim the pattern looks like a hopping rabbit .
at the time of astronomer galileo galilei , the first observers looking through their telescopes euphorically baptized the dark spots " maria " - the latin word for the seas .
they imagined huge bodies of water sloshing about what poets called the " watery planet " , and they imagined a very special lunar species living on the moon .
all that has become legend , and although astronomers still talk about " maria " , it 's quite clear that the moon is dry as a desert .
bildunterschrift : the near side of the moon looks rugged from ancient meteorite collisions just like an old bookshelf , the moon is covered in thick dust .
today , it has completely congealed .
however our celestial companion looks back at a very turbulent past .
in the first billion years of its existence , just like earth , it was exposed to a tremendous bombardment .
leftover debris from planet formation was abundant , and huge meteorites and whole asteroids were colliding with the surface .
even today , the numerous craters on the moon bear witness to the dramatic impact .
the biggest craters gradually filled up with liquid lava and welled up from what then was the hot liquid core of the moon .
so the dark spots on the moon are actually due to volcanic activity .
and the maria of the moon probably came about roughly 3 billion years ago .
that 's when the worst bombardment with space debris was over , which is why there are relatively few craters in the maria .
the lighter-coloured regions of the moon are called " terrae " , or more commonly just highlands , since they are higher than most maria .
the soil samples collected by the apollo space missions are evidence that once upon a time there was indeed volcanic activity on the moon .
it 's still unclear though how the lava reached the surface of the moon .
possibly it came up through cracks created by the impact of meteorites in the craters .
even the first scientists observing the moon have come up with colorful names for the maria , full of longing for the supposedly paradisiacal conditions on the moon : there are for instance , a sea of mirth , of nectar , of crisis , of clouds and also a ' mare fecunditiatis ' , or the sea of fertility .
bildunterschrift : the first men on the moon put an end to lunar tranquility however , the most well-known dark spot in the near side of the moon – the right eye in the moon 's face – is called mare tranquilitatis , or the sea of tranquillity .
that name is an obvious misconception because four and a half million years later the lunar peace has well and truly been disturbed .
on july 21 , 1969 , neil armstrong took his famous first step on the moon right in the sea of tranquillity .

the three claimed to have more videos of susanne klatten in trysts with a swiss gigolo . in june this year , the blackmailers had written to susanne klatten and threatened to sell recordings of her with helg sgarbi to the italian media if the mother of three did not hand over 800,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.1 million -rrb- and a bmw x5 luxury sports utility vehicle .

police in the northern german city of duisburg " pretended to be acquaintances contacting them on behalf of klatten , " said thomas steinkraus-koch , a spokesman for prosecutors in munich .
police arrived in the bmw x5 to " complete the deal " as agreed on wednesday .
the three men were immediately arrested .
police said two of the three men aged 33 to 46 have a criminal history involving fraud and narcotics .
police said they had started analyzing computers and other evidence but so far no videos had been found .

klatten did not hesitate to pass the letter on to the authorities .

but there are no settlements yet and the moon 's " seas " are bone dry . the earth 's satellite looks really old .
it 's turned completely grey and its face is marked with numerous wrinkles , stains and scars .
it 's visible : it 's been through a lot in its lifespan .
but given it 's been around for some 4 and a half billion years , the moon has aged with dignity .
getting a facelift is out of the question .
and it 's not even necessary – as every four weeks during the new moon phase , the moon is veiled in darkness and ca n't be spotted from earth .
we can see many big dark and lighter areas on the face of the moon .
this is due to the varied landscape on its surface .
some people see a face up there , others claim the pattern looks like a hopping rabbit .
at the time of astronomer galileo galilei , the first observers looking through their telescopes euphorically baptized the dark spots " maria " - the latin word for the seas .
they imagined huge bodies of water sloshing about what poets called the " watery planet " , and they imagined a very special lunar species living on the moon .
all that has become legend , and although astronomers still talk about " maria " , it 's quite clear that the moon is dry as a desert .
bildunterschrift : the near side of the moon looks rugged from ancient meteorite collisions just like an old bookshelf , the moon is covered in thick dust .
today , it has completely congealed .
however our celestial companion looks back at a very turbulent past .
in the first billion years of its existence , just like earth , it was exposed to a tremendous bombardment .
leftover debris from planet formation was abundant , and huge meteorites and whole asteroids were colliding with the surface .
even today , the numerous craters on the moon bear witness to the dramatic impact .
the biggest craters gradually filled up with liquid lava and welled up from what then was the hot liquid core of the moon .
so the dark spots on the moon are actually due to volcanic activity .
and the maria of the moon probably came about roughly 3 billion years ago .
that 's when the worst bombardment with space debris was over , which is why there are relatively few craters in the maria .
the lighter-coloured regions of the moon are called " terrae " , or more commonly just highlands , since they are higher than most maria .
the soil samples collected by the apollo space missions are evidence that once upon a time there was indeed volcanic activity on the moon .
it 's still unclear though how the lava reached the surface of the moon .
possibly it came up through cracks created by the impact of meteorites in the craters .
even the first scientists observing the moon have come up with colorful names for the maria , full of longing for the supposedly paradisiacal conditions on the moon : there are for instance , a sea of mirth , of nectar , of crisis , of clouds and also a ' mare fecunditiatis ' , or the sea of fertility .
bildunterschrift : the first men on the moon put an end to lunar tranquility however , the most well-known dark spot in the near side of the moon – the right eye in the moon 's face – is called mare tranquilitatis , or the sea of tranquillity .
that name is an obvious misconception because four and a half million years later the lunar peace has well and truly been disturbed .
on july 21 , 1969 , neil armstrong took his famous first step on the moon right in the sea of tranquillity .

while national governments debate their afghan missions , international groups are working on the ground to ensure a free and fair election . the drumbeat of bad news out of afghanistan continues unabated .
july is shaping up to be one of the deadliest months for international forces fighting in afghanistan in the eight-year history of the conflict .
as of wednesday , at least 46 international troops were killed this month . the increasing death toll has reignited debate in countries such as britain and germany about whether their afghan missions are worth the high cost and new voices in both countries are calling for a reconsideration of troop deployment in a country that seems to be sinking deeper into a quagmire of militant violence . but for international groups on the ground there in the run-up to elections on august 20 , there is no doubt that a continued international presence is needed , and is vital , to ensure that the country has an election that is fair and credible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western and international groups have been helping with voter registration " the stakes are extremely high , the challenges are significant , " said aleem siddique , the united nation 's spokesperson in kabul . "
afghanistan deserves the best leaders it can possibly obtain .
the afghan people are looking to the international community to provide that oversight to ensure their rights are protected . " this is the first time the afghans are running their own presidential election .
the independent election commission of afghanistan is in charge of the polling , but the un is providing support in the run-up to the vote . the un development program is giving the election commission logistics support and is also helping train afghan police who will guard polling stations across the country on august 20 .
the global body is behind a team of 1,600 so-called civic educators , afghans who are fanning out across the country to introduce the population to the democratic process – an idea very foreign to many . " what we want to see is a process that is credible to the afghans because we are talking about a very young democracy that is still in infant shoes , " said christiane hohmann , spokeswoman for the eu 's external relations section . european commitments the european commission announced late last week that it is sending about 100 election monitors to the country – 16 are on the ground now , the rest will go just before election day . all in all , the eu is spending 40 million euros on afghan election support – money that goes to train eu and afghan election monitors and helps with practicalities , like printing up ballot sheets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan policeman stands guard as officials put up election posters near kabul " the immediate priority is naturally to ensure that the upcoming presidential election brings the necessary legitimacy needed to the new government , " european commissioner for external relations benita ferrero-waldner said in a speech at a donor conference on afghanistan in march . the organization for security and cooperation in europe is sending some 20 experts to kabul at the end of this month to provide technical assistance with voter registration , vote counting and tabulation , and domestic observation teams .
while afghanistan is outside the osce 's normal purview , it is looking at helping find ways to maintain long-term political in the country . " there is a lot of international support for this election and a lot of expertise is in the country , a lot of know-how , " said jens-hagen eschenbächer of the osce 's office for democratic institutions and human rights .
" we provide advice how these structures can be integrated to make the election process more sustainable . " german fears and hopes the german presence in afghanistan is considerable .
it has 3,830 troops in afghanistan as part of the nato-led international security assistance force and has been active in training afghan police . bildunterschrift : as the german death toll in afghanistan has risen , support at home is falling but support for the mission there in germany has been slipping .
according to a recent poll by german public broadcaster zdf , 55 percent of germans are not in favor of the peacekeeping mission there while 42 percent support the operation . the country has also been involved in economic reconstruction projects through its gtz technical aid organization .
despite the worsening security situation , the group 's afghan director andreas clausing said from kabul that the upcoming elections are something of a light at the end of the tunnel . " i think it is a very positive step , " he said , adding that " we and our afghan partners are looking very hopefully forward .

" our passenger costs must fall , " lufthansa spokesperson claudia lange said in a statement , adding that details would be released in the coming weeks .
lufthansa staff were warned in a letter sent by the airline 's new chief executive christoph franz that higher fuel costs and falling passenger numbers posed a serious threat .
" this situation is forcing us to act , " franz wrote in the letter .
" air traffic is mired in the worst crisis in its history , " and the german carrier expected it to last longer than previously anticipated , he added .
the airline would reappraise all its operations , including " structures , projects and processes , " the new chief executive vowed .
after posting a first-quarter loss , lufthansa 's first-half results " will show that this negative trend is continuing , " franz said .
" unless market conditions change , our losses will increase significantly in the coming year owing especially to the rise in fuel prices .
" we must now make ever more determined efforts to counteract the trend , " he stressed , adding : " we have no other alternative but to resort to painful measures . "
analysts have expressed doubts about whether lufthansa can reach its cost-cutting target citing strong resistance from trade unions as one barrier .
the cockpit union which represents pilots has already objected to the airline 's cost-savings plans .
in mid-june , the carrier said slumping passenger and freight traffic would force it to take additional measures to avoid posting a full year loss .
analysts took this to mean job losses with forecasts predicting around 20 percent of the airline 's administrative passenger division being cut in the medium term .
the news of the cost-cutting plans comes as lufthansa continues its effort to take over two european carriers , austrian airlines and the britain 's bmi .

" our passenger costs must fall , " lufthansa spokesperson claudia lange said in a statement , adding that details would be released in the coming weeks .
lufthansa staff were warned in a letter sent by the airline 's new chief executive christoph franz that higher fuel costs and falling passenger numbers posed a serious threat .
" this situation is forcing us to act , " franz wrote in the letter .
" air traffic is mired in the worst crisis in its history , " and the german carrier expected it to last longer than previously anticipated , he added .
the airline would reappraise all its operations , including " structures , projects and processes , " the new chief executive vowed .
after posting a first-quarter loss , lufthansa 's first-half results " will show that this negative trend is continuing , " franz said .
" unless market conditions change , our losses will increase significantly in the coming year owing especially to the rise in fuel prices .
" we must now make ever more determined efforts to counteract the trend , " he stressed , adding : " we have no other alternative but to resort to painful measures . "
analysts have expressed doubts about whether lufthansa can reach its cost-cutting target citing strong resistance from trade unions as one barrier .
the cockpit union which represents pilots has already objected to the airline 's cost-savings plans .
in mid-june , the carrier said slumping passenger and freight traffic would force it to take additional measures to avoid posting a full year loss .
analysts took this to mean job losses with forecasts predicting around 20 percent of the airline 's administrative passenger division being cut in the medium term .
the news of the cost-cutting plans comes as lufthansa continues its effort to take over two european carriers , austrian airlines and the britain 's bmi .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 17.07.2009 german designer breathes life into china 's fashion dragon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the michalsky label was the talk of berlin fashion week berlin-based designer michael michalsky has signed a deal with china 's leading sportswear brand for a range earmarked for the chinese market .
he 's among the first german designers to head east , but he wo n't be the last . " china is the most exciting market for fashion right now , " enthuses michael michalsky , the darling of the recent berlin fashion week . " the chinese are really open to fashion , and let 's face it , the future of the world lies in this region , " he says as he reflects on his deal to develop a range of sportswear for the china dongxiang group .
the michalsky label might not yet be in the same league as karl lagerfeld , hugo boss or joop ! , but its namesake has always been ahead of the pack .
" i like to do things differently and i like to be the first , " he says .
" i was the first designer to move to berlin and do major shows here even before it was really on the map .
it 's part of my own nature and the character of both my company and my brand . "
shifting focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael michalsky is pushing fashion 's frontiers in these economically troubled times , thinking outside the box can make all the difference - and michael michalsky has broken with decades of fashion tradition by setting his sights on beijing and shanghai rather than paris and milan .
at the high-end of the industry , he 's one of the first to have woken up to china 's potential as more than a market for established western brands such as louis vuitton , cartier and bmw .
earlier this year , the new york times stated the obvious when it reported that china is now the world 's fastest-growing luxury market , with an estimated $ 7.6 billion in sales in 2008 .
michalsky , in the meantime , had cottoned on to a different , more significant growth - that of the domestic market .
although its love affair with imported luxury is still going strong , china is increasingly fed up being merely a production site for other countries and the home of cheap knock-offs .
these days , it 's keen to foster indigenous brands and to meet its consumer needs under its own steam .
" the domestic chinese market is expanding rapidly , " confirms rené lang , president of the association of german fashion and textile designers .
" until now , china has been known first and foremost as a supplier , but now it has greater spending power , despite the crisis , and there are some very well trained designers and fashion schools .
but they are still in a phase where they tend to rely on foreign help expertise . "
enter michalsky .
after eleven years as global creative director at adidas , he founded his own label in 2006 and his ' real clothes for real people ' approach has done much to establish berlin as an up and coming fashion capital where style reflects the street more than the catwalk . nonetheless , the michalsky label has n't yet managed to turn a profit .
in that respect , it 's in the same boat as many ailing brands .
but while hard-up veteran french labels such as lacroix are busy nursing their wounds and sulkily blaming bankruptcy on the global financial crisis , michael michalsky - like the brave young rookie he is - wasted no time identifying markets not feeling the pinch of recession quite so harshly .
traditional brands might turn their noses up at china , but where others see only a low-end market , the german designer sees real potential : " the dongxiang group is very successful locally , and the company is now looking to expand internationally , " he says .
" to begin with , the line will only be available in china because that 's where they have their own stores , but they 're planning to expand across asia and i do n't see what 's to stop them ending up in other markets futher afield . "
" china is in a transitional phase right now , it 's moving away from imported goods towards home-grown products , " agrees rené lang .
" there 's a burgeoning desire for a more personal cultural identity attached to goods that have been specially produced for the chinese market . "
hot on the heels of jil sander bildunterschrift : jil sander 's clothes are elegant and austere - and big in japan in heading east , michalsky is following in the footsteps of only one other german designer .
in march , jil sander raised eyebrows from madison avenue to avenue montaigne when she teamed up with japanese budget clothing retailer uniqlo .
the company sells $ 30 jeans and $ 15 parkas , and is one of the few companies still thriving despite japan 's recession .
" the challenge for me is to establish premium quality and democratically priced brand uniqlo , " she told reporters in tokyo in spring .
similarly , michalsky showed that he 's not too proud to take his talents wherever they 're most wanted when he launched his mitch & co range for tchibo , a german range of coffee shops that also sells clothing , household items , electronics and electrical appliances .
the collection flopped , but the tie-up helped make michalsky a household name .
unlike many designers , he 's just not that precious .
as far as china is concerned , he shrugs off the qualms some of his colleagues might have about poor working conditions .
" i have n't yet been to any of the dongxiang factories , " he says .
" i 've been to the headquarters and it 's a very modern company and very european in its thinking .
in fact , the chinese factories i 've visited in their past when i was still with my former employer , were surprisingly modern and conditions were good .
they were no different to places i 've visited in italy .
i think conditions have improved a lot . "
image boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are conditions improving in the chinese textile industry ?
rené lang says the same .
" we need to get way from the idea of cheap china , " he stresses .
" standards are changing fast and there 's a growing interest in organic textiles , sustainability and better working conditions .
the situation will inevitably improve the more money starts circulating in the market .
china is trying to shed its bad image . "
as a designer , michalsky has often demonstrated a social conscience , referencing world affairs in his shows with comments on issues such as the hypocrisy of left-wing intellectuals , the tyranny of capitalism and the profligacy of wall street .
but with the ink still drying on his latest deal , he 's reluctant to consider the political or economic ramifications of his move into china .
" my message is simply that we are all living in one world and that 's why i wanted to do something in this part of the globe , " he sums up .
" i understand that young people are influenced by the same things all over the world , and i think that 's why i got the job . "

he 's among the first german designers to head east , but he wo n't be the last . " china is the most exciting market for fashion right now , " enthuses michael michalsky , the darling of the recent berlin fashion week . " the chinese are really open to fashion , and let 's face it , the future of the world lies in this region , " he says as he reflects on his deal to develop a range of sportswear for the china dongxiang group .
the michalsky label might not yet be in the same league as karl lagerfeld , hugo boss or joop ! , but its namesake has always been ahead of the pack .
" i like to do things differently and i like to be the first , " he says .
" i was the first designer to move to berlin and do major shows here even before it was really on the map .
it 's part of my own nature and the character of both my company and my brand . "
shifting focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael michalsky is pushing fashion 's frontiers in these economically troubled times , thinking outside the box can make all the difference - and michael michalsky has broken with decades of fashion tradition by setting his sights on beijing and shanghai rather than paris and milan .
at the high-end of the industry , he 's one of the first to have woken up to china 's potential as more than a market for established western brands such as louis vuitton , cartier and bmw .
earlier this year , the new york times stated the obvious when it reported that china is now the world 's fastest-growing luxury market , with an estimated $ 7.6 billion in sales in 2008 .
michalsky , in the meantime , had cottoned on to a different , more significant growth - that of the domestic market .
although its love affair with imported luxury is still going strong , china is increasingly fed up being merely a production site for other countries and the home of cheap knock-offs .
these days , it 's keen to foster indigenous brands and to meet its consumer needs under its own steam .
" the domestic chinese market is expanding rapidly , " confirms rené lang , president of the association of german fashion and textile designers .
" until now , china has been known first and foremost as a supplier , but now it has greater spending power , despite the crisis , and there are some very well trained designers and fashion schools .
but they are still in a phase where they tend to rely on foreign help expertise . "
enter michalsky .
after eleven years as global creative director at adidas , he founded his own label in 2006 and his ' real clothes for real people ' approach has done much to establish berlin as an up and coming fashion capital where style reflects the street more than the catwalk . nonetheless , the michalsky label has n't yet managed to turn a profit .
in that respect , it 's in the same boat as many ailing brands .
but while hard-up veteran french labels such as lacroix are busy nursing their wounds and sulkily blaming bankruptcy on the global financial crisis , michael michalsky - like the brave young rookie he is - wasted no time identifying markets not feeling the pinch of recession quite so harshly .
traditional brands might turn their noses up at china , but where others see only a low-end market , the german designer sees real potential : " the dongxiang group is very successful locally , and the company is now looking to expand internationally , " he says .
" to begin with , the line will only be available in china because that 's where they have their own stores , but they 're planning to expand across asia and i do n't see what 's to stop them ending up in other markets futher afield . "
" china is in a transitional phase right now , it 's moving away from imported goods towards home-grown products , " agrees rené lang .
" there 's a burgeoning desire for a more personal cultural identity attached to goods that have been specially produced for the chinese market . "
hot on the heels of jil sander bildunterschrift : jil sander 's clothes are elegant and austere - and big in japan in heading east , michalsky is following in the footsteps of only one other german designer .
in march , jil sander raised eyebrows from madison avenue to avenue montaigne when she teamed up with japanese budget clothing retailer uniqlo .
the company sells $ 30 jeans and $ 15 parkas , and is one of the few companies still thriving despite japan 's recession .
" the challenge for me is to establish premium quality and democratically priced brand uniqlo , " she told reporters in tokyo in spring .
similarly , michalsky showed that he 's not too proud to take his talents wherever they 're most wanted when he launched his mitch & co range for tchibo , a german range of coffee shops that also sells clothing , household items , electronics and electrical appliances .
the collection flopped , but the tie-up helped make michalsky a household name .
unlike many designers , he 's just not that precious .
as far as china is concerned , he shrugs off the qualms some of his colleagues might have about poor working conditions .
" i have n't yet been to any of the dongxiang factories , " he says .
" i 've been to the headquarters and it 's a very modern company and very european in its thinking .
in fact , the chinese factories i 've visited in their past when i was still with my former employer , were surprisingly modern and conditions were good .
they were no different to places i 've visited in italy .
i think conditions have improved a lot . "
image boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are conditions improving in the chinese textile industry ?
rené lang says the same .
" we need to get way from the idea of cheap china , " he stresses .
" standards are changing fast and there 's a growing interest in organic textiles , sustainability and better working conditions .
the situation will inevitably improve the more money starts circulating in the market .
china is trying to shed its bad image . "
as a designer , michalsky has often demonstrated a social conscience , referencing world affairs in his shows with comments on issues such as the hypocrisy of left-wing intellectuals , the tyranny of capitalism and the profligacy of wall street .
but with the ink still drying on his latest deal , he 's reluctant to consider the political or economic ramifications of his move into china .
" my message is simply that we are all living in one world and that 's why i wanted to do something in this part of the globe , " he sums up .
" i understand that young people are influenced by the same things all over the world , and i think that 's why i got the job . "

" i like to do things differently and i like to be the first , " he says .
" i was the first designer to move to berlin and do major shows here even before it was really on the map .
it 's part of my own nature and the character of both my company and my brand . "
shifting focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael michalsky is pushing fashion 's frontiers in these economically troubled times , thinking outside the box can make all the difference - and michael michalsky has broken with decades of fashion tradition by setting his sights on beijing and shanghai rather than paris and milan .
at the high-end of the industry , he 's one of the first to have woken up to china 's potential as more than a market for established western brands such as louis vuitton , cartier and bmw .
earlier this year , the new york times stated the obvious when it reported that china is now the world 's fastest-growing luxury market , with an estimated $ 7.6 billion in sales in 2008 .
michalsky , in the meantime , had cottoned on to a different , more significant growth - that of the domestic market .
although its love affair with imported luxury is still going strong , china is increasingly fed up being merely a production site for other countries and the home of cheap knock-offs .
these days , it 's keen to foster indigenous brands and to meet its consumer needs under its own steam .
" the domestic chinese market is expanding rapidly , " confirms rené lang , president of the association of german fashion and textile designers .
" until now , china has been known first and foremost as a supplier , but now it has greater spending power , despite the crisis , and there are some very well trained designers and fashion schools .
but they are still in a phase where they tend to rely on foreign help expertise . "
enter michalsky .
after eleven years as global creative director at adidas , he founded his own label in 2006 and his ' real clothes for real people ' approach has done much to establish berlin as an up and coming fashion capital where style reflects the street more than the catwalk . nonetheless , the michalsky label has n't yet managed to turn a profit .
in that respect , it 's in the same boat as many ailing brands .
but while hard-up veteran french labels such as lacroix are busy nursing their wounds and sulkily blaming bankruptcy on the global financial crisis , michael michalsky - like the brave young rookie he is - wasted no time identifying markets not feeling the pinch of recession quite so harshly .
traditional brands might turn their noses up at china , but where others see only a low-end market , the german designer sees real potential : " the dongxiang group is very successful locally , and the company is now looking to expand internationally , " he says .
" to begin with , the line will only be available in china because that 's where they have their own stores , but they 're planning to expand across asia and i do n't see what 's to stop them ending up in other markets futher afield . "
" china is in a transitional phase right now , it 's moving away from imported goods towards home-grown products , " agrees rené lang .
" there 's a burgeoning desire for a more personal cultural identity attached to goods that have been specially produced for the chinese market . "
hot on the heels of jil sander bildunterschrift : jil sander 's clothes are elegant and austere - and big in japan in heading east , michalsky is following in the footsteps of only one other german designer .
in march , jil sander raised eyebrows from madison avenue to avenue montaigne when she teamed up with japanese budget clothing retailer uniqlo .
the company sells $ 30 jeans and $ 15 parkas , and is one of the few companies still thriving despite japan 's recession .
" the challenge for me is to establish premium quality and democratically priced brand uniqlo , " she told reporters in tokyo in spring .
similarly , michalsky showed that he 's not too proud to take his talents wherever they 're most wanted when he launched his mitch & co range for tchibo , a german range of coffee shops that also sells clothing , household items , electronics and electrical appliances .
the collection flopped , but the tie-up helped make michalsky a household name .
unlike many designers , he 's just not that precious .
as far as china is concerned , he shrugs off the qualms some of his colleagues might have about poor working conditions .
" i have n't yet been to any of the dongxiang factories , " he says .
" i 've been to the headquarters and it 's a very modern company and very european in its thinking .
in fact , the chinese factories i 've visited in their past when i was still with my former employer , were surprisingly modern and conditions were good .
they were no different to places i 've visited in italy .
i think conditions have improved a lot . "
image boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are conditions improving in the chinese textile industry ?
rené lang says the same .
" we need to get way from the idea of cheap china , " he stresses .
" standards are changing fast and there 's a growing interest in organic textiles , sustainability and better working conditions .
the situation will inevitably improve the more money starts circulating in the market .
china is trying to shed its bad image . "
as a designer , michalsky has often demonstrated a social conscience , referencing world affairs in his shows with comments on issues such as the hypocrisy of left-wing intellectuals , the tyranny of capitalism and the profligacy of wall street .
but with the ink still drying on his latest deal , he 's reluctant to consider the political or economic ramifications of his move into china .
" my message is simply that we are all living in one world and that 's why i wanted to do something in this part of the globe , " he sums up .
" i understand that young people are influenced by the same things all over the world , and i think that 's why i got the job . "

they include the bavarian brand " oettinger , " whose sales were up two percent .
oettinger , which for years has been germany 's most widely consumed beer , is to take over in august the " feldschloeßchen " brewery owned by the danish beer giant carlsberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous german beer brand " krombacher " saw sales plunge by 5.3 percent in the first quarter the other brewer to show growth in the first quarter - 2.5 percent - is the " hasseröder " brand .
the beer brand is part of belgium-based ab inbev , the world 's largest brewery and the second-largest beer producer in germany .
the biggest loser in the beer market , according to the study , is the cheaply-priced " sternburg , " an east german brand whose sales plunged 11 percent in the first quarter .
the brand is part of the frankfurt-based radeberger group , germany 's largest brewer .
steady drop in beer consumption according to the federal statistical office , the german beer market shrank by four percent in the first five months of 2009 .
exports to germany 's partners in the 27-nation european union were also down 12.5 percent in the first quarter .
thursday 's study did not provide a reason for the decline .
however , beer sales have been sliding steadily in germany for more than a decade , a trend that experts have attributed to an increasingly health-conscious public as well as the different drinking habits of younger consumers .
" the market has been significantly shrinking over the last few years , " peter hahn , head of the german brewers ' association told news agency dpa earlier this year .
" the times when every german drank more than 150 liters of beer annually are definitely gone . "
some have also blamed a public smoking ban in some german states as well as a deep recession for the latest drop in beer consumption .
to add to the woes , munich 's office of tourism said in may that revelers at this year 's oktoberfest in september would have to dig deeper into their pockets .
officials said a one-liter mug of beer will cost between 8.50 euros -lrb- $ 11.63 -rrb- and 8.60 euros this year - a five percent hike over 2008 prices. sp / dpa / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hossein shariatmadari , editor-in-chief of the kayhan daily , said rafsanjani , a moderate who backed mousavi 's election campaign , had done nothing to prevent the gathering of mousavi supporters inside and outside tehran university , where prayers are held each friday and broadcast live on state radio .
in his first friday sermon since the controversial vote , rafsanjani criticized the way authorities in iran had handled the poll and said large numbers of iranians doubted the results of the election .
" in the current situation it is not necessary for us to have a number of people in prisons ... we should allow them to return to their families , " he said in the sermon at tehran university , broadcast live on state radio .

many protestors were reported to be wearing green bands to indicate support for opposition leader and defeated election candidate mir hossein mousavi .

" in the current situation it is not necessary for us to have a number of people in prisons ... we should allow them to return to their families , " he said in the sermon at tehran university , broadcast live on state radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafsanjani is considered a key power-broker in iranian politics " we are all members of a family .
i hope with this sermon we can pass through this period of hardships that can be called a crisis , " rafsanjani said .
large opposition rally in tehran his sermon was marked by a large opposition rally in the streets outside the university - the first such demonstration for more than a week .
many protestors were reported to be wearing green bands to indicate support for opposition leader and defeated election candidate mir hossein mousavi .
news agency reuters said some were heard chanting " death to the dictator " and " ahmadinejad , resign , resign . "
the agency also quoted an unidentified witness saying police had fired tear gas and beat up mousavi supporters .
rafsanjani is a backer of mousavi who has demanded a re-run of the vote and described the new government as illegitimate .
cleric slams security crackdown rafsanjani , who heads the powerful assembly of experts and is an influential cleric , also appealed for an open debate on radio and television about the disputed 12 june election and called for media restrictions to be eased .
" it is not necessary to pressure media .
we should allow them to work freely within the law , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a protestor at the opposition rally in tehran on friday although rafsanjani stayed silent during the unrest that followed the election , members of his family - including his daughter faezeh - openly supported mousavi .
rafsanjani , who was a close aide to iran 's late revolutionary founder ayatollah ruhollah khomeini , also condemned the security crackdown on demonstrators .
" we knew what imam khomeini wanted .
he did n't want the use of terror or arms , even in fights -lrb- for the revolution -rrb- . "
rafsanjani 's remarks are seen as a challenge to supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei , who has upheld the election result and accused foreign powers of fuelling the unrest .
violent street protests broke out in iran last month , as news of president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's victory was met with accusations of fraud and vote-rigging .
at least 20 people have died and hundreds have been arrested in the unrest. sp / reuters / ap / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move could help mitigate the company 's troubles on its home turf . it is something that has n't happened to aldi before : in the midst of a severe economic crisis germany 's discounting pioneer is faced with declining revenues in its home market .
according to data from research company gfk , aldi 's sales in germany declined by about five percent in the first five months of this year while the german retail sector as a whole shrank by only 2.2 percent .
it 's an entirely different story in the united states .
there , aldi is rapidly expanding its reach and expects to open 75 new stores this year .
the discount retailer entered the us market back in 1976 , but its no-frills concept only really started to take off in recent years .
" and of course the current economic crisis is really helping aldi to gain more customers , but is also making some changes in its concept " , explains matthias queck , senior discount analyst at market reseach firm planet retail .
for instance , aldi has added more fresh products , especially produce , to its range of products and has spruced up its stores to make them more attractive to new customers .
while older aldi stores where often located in less affluent neighborhoods , many new stores are located in areas that attract suburban and middle class shoppers as well .
low prices for high price markets aldi traditionally does n't release financial figures , but experts believe the german discount chain is doing quite well in the us and making significant inroads in the retail sector .
how then does aldi compete against us retail behemoth wal-mart on its home turf ?
it 's very simple , say the experts , the same way aldi and other german discounters forced wal-mart to shutter its doors in germany a couple of years ago : low prices and high quality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldi is taking on retail giant wal-mart on his home turf thomas roeb , a retail expert at the university of applied sciences rhine-sieg , argues that while wal-mart is considered a discounter in the us and has an image as a low-price retailer , its general pricing level is still fairly high .
in comparison to wal-mart aldi has a lower cost structure that allows it to become very successful in higher price markets like the united states . " however , the consumers so far did n't really believe in the value proposition of aldi and it is due to the economic crisis right now that people have started to try the concept . "
and , adds roeb , more and more americans give aldi 's no-frills concept a chance and actually find it attractive .
that 's because consumers realize that they can save money when shopping at aldi .
experts estimate that aldi 's prices are generally 10 to 15 percent lower than those of other national us retailers .
how does aldi do that ?
it keeps costs down with a limited range of products , smaller stores , fewer staff , and by not staying open as late as some of its competitors . it has also developed an efficient logistics system and most of the products that it sells are its own brand .
its sheer size allows it to get discounts by buying large quantities . too successful what can happen once aldi 's value proposition catches on in a big way , is evident in germany .
there , so-called " hard discounters " like aldi , account for more than 40 percent of the country 's retail sector .
the discount model has been so successful that aldi 's many competitors in germany are finally taking a bite out of its revenues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , aldi faces stiff competition from other discounters after decades of imitating aldi , says retail expert roeb , its german competitors have finally caught on .
" so it 's less aldi 's loss in the german market , it 's less that aldi is doing something wrong , but rather the fact that the competition is doing something right . "
that 's why aldi 's future growth will come mainly from abroad with the us being a prime target for expansion , argues discount expert queck : " just imagine that in the us , aldi has just 1,000 stores spread over 29 states , so that leaves a lot of room for further expansion . "
compare that with the roughly 1,700 stores that aldi sued , the part of the aldi company that manages its us operation , owns in southern and western germany alone and you can imagine the huge growth potential for the discounter in the us .
wal-mart dwarfs aldi despite aldi 's current advances in the us market , the question remains whether it can sustain its growth and customers once the economic malaise is over .
" i do believe that aldi is going to be successful even after the crisis , " says roeb .
" because we have had the same situation in germany and in some western european countries in the past .
everywhere aldi benefitted from economic crises to increase sales and consumers found the selection of products attractive so they found no need to switch back to their former supermarket . "
while aldi in the us with an estimated revenue of about seven billion dollars last year is tiny in comparison to wal-mart with its revenue of 375 billion dollars , the german discounter could challenge wal-mart in a specific segment - food .
wal-mart , says roeb is basically a non-food retailer that carries food as an important part , but not the main attraction of its product range .
" aldi however is a food specialist .
so when we are talking about competition between aldi and wal-mart , we are talking about competition in the field of food .
and i do believe that aldi is going to cause some problems for wal-mart in the future and even today in the area of food . "
that 's because , wal-mart 's image as a discounter in the food segment could be undercut by aldi 's value proposition .
and that , adds roeb , might end up having a negative impact on wal-mart 's public image . author : michael knigge editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move could help mitigate the company 's troubles on its home turf . it is something that has n't happened to aldi before : in the midst of a severe economic crisis germany 's discounting pioneer is faced with declining revenues in its home market .
according to data from research company gfk , aldi 's sales in germany declined by about five percent in the first five months of this year while the german retail sector as a whole shrank by only 2.2 percent .
it 's an entirely different story in the united states .
there , aldi is rapidly expanding its reach and expects to open 75 new stores this year .
the discount retailer entered the us market back in 1976 , but its no-frills concept only really started to take off in recent years .
" and of course the current economic crisis is really helping aldi to gain more customers , but is also making some changes in its concept " , explains matthias queck , senior discount analyst at market reseach firm planet retail .
for instance , aldi has added more fresh products , especially produce , to its range of products and has spruced up its stores to make them more attractive to new customers .
while older aldi stores where often located in less affluent neighborhoods , many new stores are located in areas that attract suburban and middle class shoppers as well .
low prices for high price markets aldi traditionally does n't release financial figures , but experts believe the german discount chain is doing quite well in the us and making significant inroads in the retail sector .
how then does aldi compete against us retail behemoth wal-mart on its home turf ?
it 's very simple , say the experts , the same way aldi and other german discounters forced wal-mart to shutter its doors in germany a couple of years ago : low prices and high quality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldi is taking on retail giant wal-mart on his home turf thomas roeb , a retail expert at the university of applied sciences rhine-sieg , argues that while wal-mart is considered a discounter in the us and has an image as a low-price retailer , its general pricing level is still fairly high .
in comparison to wal-mart aldi has a lower cost structure that allows it to become very successful in higher price markets like the united states . " however , the consumers so far did n't really believe in the value proposition of aldi and it is due to the economic crisis right now that people have started to try the concept . "
and , adds roeb , more and more americans give aldi 's no-frills concept a chance and actually find it attractive .
that 's because consumers realize that they can save money when shopping at aldi .
experts estimate that aldi 's prices are generally 10 to 15 percent lower than those of other national us retailers .
how does aldi do that ?
it keeps costs down with a limited range of products , smaller stores , fewer staff , and by not staying open as late as some of its competitors . it has also developed an efficient logistics system and most of the products that it sells are its own brand .
its sheer size allows it to get discounts by buying large quantities . too successful what can happen once aldi 's value proposition catches on in a big way , is evident in germany .
there , so-called " hard discounters " like aldi , account for more than 40 percent of the country 's retail sector .
the discount model has been so successful that aldi 's many competitors in germany are finally taking a bite out of its revenues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , aldi faces stiff competition from other discounters after decades of imitating aldi , says retail expert roeb , its german competitors have finally caught on .
" so it 's less aldi 's loss in the german market , it 's less that aldi is doing something wrong , but rather the fact that the competition is doing something right . "
that 's why aldi 's future growth will come mainly from abroad with the us being a prime target for expansion , argues discount expert queck : " just imagine that in the us , aldi has just 1,000 stores spread over 29 states , so that leaves a lot of room for further expansion . "
compare that with the roughly 1,700 stores that aldi sued , the part of the aldi company that manages its us operation , owns in southern and western germany alone and you can imagine the huge growth potential for the discounter in the us .
wal-mart dwarfs aldi despite aldi 's current advances in the us market , the question remains whether it can sustain its growth and customers once the economic malaise is over .
" i do believe that aldi is going to be successful even after the crisis , " says roeb .
" because we have had the same situation in germany and in some western european countries in the past .
everywhere aldi benefitted from economic crises to increase sales and consumers found the selection of products attractive so they found no need to switch back to their former supermarket . "
while aldi in the us with an estimated revenue of about seven billion dollars last year is tiny in comparison to wal-mart with its revenue of 375 billion dollars , the german discounter could challenge wal-mart in a specific segment - food .
wal-mart , says roeb is basically a non-food retailer that carries food as an important part , but not the main attraction of its product range .
" aldi however is a food specialist .
so when we are talking about competition between aldi and wal-mart , we are talking about competition in the field of food .
and i do believe that aldi is going to cause some problems for wal-mart in the future and even today in the area of food . "
that 's because , wal-mart 's image as a discounter in the food segment could be undercut by aldi 's value proposition .
and that , adds roeb , might end up having a negative impact on wal-mart 's public image . author : michael knigge editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hossein shariatmadari , editor-in-chief of the kayhan daily , said rafsanjani , a moderate who backed mousavi 's election campaign , had done nothing to prevent the gathering of mousavi supporters inside and outside tehran university , where prayers are held each friday and broadcast live on state radio .
in his first friday sermon since the controversial vote , rafsanjani criticized the way authorities in iran had handled the poll and said large numbers of iranians doubted the results of the election .
" in the current situation it is not necessary for us to have a number of people in prisons ... we should allow them to return to their families , " he said in the sermon at tehran university , broadcast live on state radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafsanjani is considered a key power-broker in iranian politics " we are all members of a family .
i hope with this sermon we can pass through this period of hardships that can be called a crisis , " rafsanjani said .
large opposition rally in tehran his sermon was marked by a large opposition rally in the streets outside the university - the first such demonstration for more than a week .
many protestors were reported to be wearing green bands to indicate support for opposition leader and defeated election candidate mir hossein mousavi .
news agency reuters said some were heard chanting " death to the dictator " and " ahmadinejad , resign , resign . "
the agency also quoted an unidentified witness saying police had fired tear gas and beat up mousavi supporters .
rafsanjani is a backer of mousavi who has demanded a re-run of the vote and described the new government as illegitimate .
cleric slams security crackdown rafsanjani , who heads the powerful assembly of experts and is an influential cleric , also appealed for an open debate on radio and television about the disputed 12 june election and called for media restrictions to be eased .
" it is not necessary to pressure media .
we should allow them to work freely within the law , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a protestor at the opposition rally in tehran on friday although rafsanjani stayed silent during the unrest that followed the election , members of his family - including his daughter faezeh - openly supported mousavi .
rafsanjani , who was a close aide to iran 's late revolutionary founder ayatollah ruhollah khomeini , also condemned the security crackdown on demonstrators .
" we knew what imam khomeini wanted .
he did n't want the use of terror or arms , even in fights -lrb- for the revolution -rrb- . "
rafsanjani 's remarks are seen as a challenge to supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei , who has upheld the election result and accused foreign powers of fuelling the unrest .
violent street protests broke out in iran last month , as news of president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's victory was met with accusations of fraud and vote-rigging .
at least 20 people have died and hundreds have been arrested in the unrest. sp / reuters / ap / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 17.07.2009 new un security council resolution against north korea großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the resolution is binding on all un member states a un security council panel has put five companies , including one based in iran , and five north koreans under un sanctions because of their links to pyongyang 's nuclear and ballistic missile activities . these sanctions against north korea are just the newest in an ongoing struggle to get the asian state to abandon its nuclear ambitions .
it all started back in october 2006 when pyongyang tested a nuclear device , causing the members of the united nations security council -lrb- unsc -rrb- to issue unsc resolution 1718 , which put sanctions on trade in major weapons system , all products related to the production of weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- , and luxury goods .
but instead of convincing north korea to back off , it actually incited them to try harder ; a point that was proved when they launched a multi-stage rocket on april 5 of this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea 's explosion of a nuclear device on may 25 triggered protests in the south the newest sanctions imposed by the unsc panel on pyongyang for exploding a nuclear device on may 25 , which is completely binding for all member states , is a little bit different in that they focus not on the government as a whole , but rather on individuals and economic entities .
the list includes five companies , including one based in iran , and five north koreans .
the 15-nation council 's panel also banned two goods to be imported by north korea : graphite designed or specified for use in electrical discharge machining -lrb- edm -rrb- machines and para-aramid fiber - commonly known as kevlar - filament and tape .
the panel imposed a freeze of assets belonging to namchongang trading company , hong kong electronics , korea hyoksin trading corporation , general bureau of atomic energy and korean tangun trading corporation .
the five north koreans are : yun ho-jin , director of namchongang trading ; ri je-son and hwang suk-hwa , both directors of separate departments in the general bureau of atomic energy ; rihong-sop , former director of yongbyon nuclear research centre ; han yu-ro , director of korea ryongaksan general trading corporation .
the individuals ' assets will be frozen and they will be banned from travelling abroad .
smart sanctions according to professor michael brzoska , director of the institute for peace research and security policy at the university of hamburg , sanctions against north korea have been changed several times , but the main goal has always been to tighten the screws , particularly on the leadership , without harming the population too much .
the idea is to make life difficult for north korean president kim jong-il and those around him , as well as to limit the possibilities for state institutions , particularly in the financial field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea has been very secretive about the health of the country 's leader kim jong-il using these so-called smart sanctions to target individuals rather than entire governments is n't new ; since the early 1990s the unsc decided to try and influence the behavior of decision makers without harming the general population .
the first cases were iraq and the former yugoslavia , says brzoska , and since then there have been others , adding that the success of these actions has been very mixed .
in angola , for example , the unita rebel movement was targeted in this way and , in the end , lost the war to the government .
in liberia , where former president charles taylor , who is now at the international court of justice in the hague , became a target and that was successful in limiting his possibilities to buy arms and to pay his soldiers .
" one could also argue that in libya sanctions that harmed the leadership by making it more difficult to fly and to have money available for investment in the oil industry also helped to bring about change there .
but there are a lot of other cases where these types of smart sanctions did not have much effect , like in iran , the ivory coast or sierra leone , " says brzoska .
the china question the key to any of these sanctions being successful has always been how inclined the chinese government is to enforce them .
china is north korea 's only ally in the region , if not the world , and they have been reluctant to put pressure on pyongyang in the past .
this is mostly due to the fact that beijing uses its relationship with north korea - and the ability to bring kim jong-il to the negotiating table - to bargain with both japan and the united states , says dr. patrick koellner , acting head of the institute of asian affairs at the german institute of global and area studies .
according to koellner , china , which holds a permanent position on the security council , has the ability to bring north korea to its knees .
simply by cutting of supplies of energy and food and freezing the assets of north korean leaders , kim 's regime would have no choice but to surrender to any demands the un had of it .
however , unlike the japanese and the americans , the chinese actually have a vested financial interest in the sound future of north korea .
according to a report by the council on foreign relations , chinese trade and investment in north korea now totals $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.4 billion euros -rrb- a year . bildunterschrift : since the korean war the border between the two nations has been heavily guarded enforcement while complete chinese cooperation would make things a whole lot faster , it is n't required to put pressure on north korea .
stephan haggard and marcus noland from the peterson institute for international economics argue in a recently published report that the most interesting features of the resolution have to do with means of enforcement .
the resolution calls upon member states to inspect vessels on the high seas or escort them to port if they have reasonable grounds to believe that they are carrying prohibited cargo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any vessel heading into north korean waters suspected of carrying contraban is subject to a search however , there is a loophole in the wording , in order to intercept a ship , the country under which the vessel is flagged must give permission .
according to haggard and noland , this could provide incentives for north korea to do more shipping under its own flag ; though that is doubtful given the country 's standing in the international community .
many ships , regardless of their country of origin , sail under the auspices of countries such as liberia and panama - countries where fees , taxes , regulations , and laws protecting seafarers are often minimal or non-existent .
that means that these nations will be under more and more pressure to allow these ships to be searched , leaving north korea no choice but to use its own flag ; though this causes its own potential drama as north korea has stated in no uncertain terms that it would view such action as an act of war .

that means that these nations will be under more and more pressure to allow these ships to be searched , leaving north korea no choice but to use its own flag ; though this causes its own potential drama as north korea has stated in no uncertain terms that it would view such action as an act of war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 17.07.2009 new un security council resolution against north korea großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the resolution is binding on all un member states a un security council panel has put five companies , including one based in iran , and five north koreans under un sanctions because of their links to pyongyang 's nuclear and ballistic missile activities . these sanctions against north korea are just the newest in an ongoing struggle to get the asian state to abandon its nuclear ambitions .
it all started back in october 2006 when pyongyang tested a nuclear device , causing the members of the united nations security council -lrb- unsc -rrb- to issue unsc resolution 1718 , which put sanctions on trade in major weapons system , all products related to the production of weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- , and luxury goods .
but instead of convincing north korea to back off , it actually incited them to try harder ; a point that was proved when they launched a multi-stage rocket on april 5 of this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea 's explosion of a nuclear device on may 25 triggered protests in the south the newest sanctions imposed by the unsc panel on pyongyang for exploding a nuclear device on may 25 , which is completely binding for all member states , is a little bit different in that they focus not on the government as a whole , but rather on individuals and economic entities .
the list includes five companies , including one based in iran , and five north koreans .
the 15-nation council 's panel also banned two goods to be imported by north korea : graphite designed or specified for use in electrical discharge machining -lrb- edm -rrb- machines and para-aramid fiber - commonly known as kevlar - filament and tape .
the panel imposed a freeze of assets belonging to namchongang trading company , hong kong electronics , korea hyoksin trading corporation , general bureau of atomic energy and korean tangun trading corporation .
the five north koreans are : yun ho-jin , director of namchongang trading ; ri je-son and hwang suk-hwa , both directors of separate departments in the general bureau of atomic energy ; rihong-sop , former director of yongbyon nuclear research centre ; han yu-ro , director of korea ryongaksan general trading corporation .
the individuals ' assets will be frozen and they will be banned from travelling abroad .
smart sanctions according to professor michael brzoska , director of the institute for peace research and security policy at the university of hamburg , sanctions against north korea have been changed several times , but the main goal has always been to tighten the screws , particularly on the leadership , without harming the population too much .
the idea is to make life difficult for north korean president kim jong-il and those around him , as well as to limit the possibilities for state institutions , particularly in the financial field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea has been very secretive about the health of the country 's leader kim jong-il using these so-called smart sanctions to target individuals rather than entire governments is n't new ; since the early 1990s the unsc decided to try and influence the behavior of decision makers without harming the general population .
the first cases were iraq and the former yugoslavia , says brzoska , and since then there have been others , adding that the success of these actions has been very mixed .
in angola , for example , the unita rebel movement was targeted in this way and , in the end , lost the war to the government .
in liberia , where former president charles taylor , who is now at the international court of justice in the hague , became a target and that was successful in limiting his possibilities to buy arms and to pay his soldiers .
" one could also argue that in libya sanctions that harmed the leadership by making it more difficult to fly and to have money available for investment in the oil industry also helped to bring about change there .
but there are a lot of other cases where these types of smart sanctions did not have much effect , like in iran , the ivory coast or sierra leone , " says brzoska .
the china question the key to any of these sanctions being successful has always been how inclined the chinese government is to enforce them .
china is north korea 's only ally in the region , if not the world , and they have been reluctant to put pressure on pyongyang in the past .
this is mostly due to the fact that beijing uses its relationship with north korea - and the ability to bring kim jong-il to the negotiating table - to bargain with both japan and the united states , says dr. patrick koellner , acting head of the institute of asian affairs at the german institute of global and area studies .
according to koellner , china , which holds a permanent position on the security council , has the ability to bring north korea to its knees .
simply by cutting of supplies of energy and food and freezing the assets of north korean leaders , kim 's regime would have no choice but to surrender to any demands the un had of it .
however , unlike the japanese and the americans , the chinese actually have a vested financial interest in the sound future of north korea .
according to a report by the council on foreign relations , chinese trade and investment in north korea now totals $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.4 billion euros -rrb- a year . bildunterschrift : since the korean war the border between the two nations has been heavily guarded enforcement while complete chinese cooperation would make things a whole lot faster , it is n't required to put pressure on north korea .
stephan haggard and marcus noland from the peterson institute for international economics argue in a recently published report that the most interesting features of the resolution have to do with means of enforcement .
the resolution calls upon member states to inspect vessels on the high seas or escort them to port if they have reasonable grounds to believe that they are carrying prohibited cargo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any vessel heading into north korean waters suspected of carrying contraban is subject to a search however , there is a loophole in the wording , in order to intercept a ship , the country under which the vessel is flagged must give permission .
according to haggard and noland , this could provide incentives for north korea to do more shipping under its own flag ; though that is doubtful given the country 's standing in the international community .
many ships , regardless of their country of origin , sail under the auspices of countries such as liberia and panama - countries where fees , taxes , regulations , and laws protecting seafarers are often minimal or non-existent .

the three claimed to have more videos of susanne klatten in trysts with a swiss gigolo . in june this year , the blackmailers had written to susanne klatten and threatened to sell recordings of her with helg sgarbi to the italian media if the mother of three did not hand over 800,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.1 million -rrb- and a bmw x5 luxury sports utility vehicle .
the bwm-heiress immediately contacted the authorities .
police in the northern german city of duisburg " pretended to be acquaintances contacting them on behalf of klatten , " said thomas steinkraus-koch , a spokesman for prosecutors in munich .
police arrived in the bmw x5 to " complete the deal " as agreed on wednesday .
the three men were immediately arrested .
police said two of the three men aged 33 to 46 have a criminal history involving fraud and narcotics .
police said they had started analyzing computers and other evidence but so far no videos had been found .
not the first copy-cat attempt this is not the first copy-cat attempt to extort germany 's richest woman .
a munich newspaper reported that in march this year , klatten had received a letter from someone claiming to be sgarbi 's prison inmate who had told him where the sex-videos were hidden .
he had " only " demanded 75,000 euros .
klatten did not hesitate to pass the letter on to the authorities .
" we have a 100 percent success rate in catching any would-be blackmailers , " warned steinkraus-koch .
44-year old swiss national helg sgarbi is currently serving a six-year prison term for blackmailing the billionairess . the former investment banker met klatten in a luxury hotel in tirol in 2007 and began an affair with her and methodically videoed their private meetings .
sgarbi has refused to provide the names of any accomplices , or say where he has hidden the videos and the seven million euros he received from klatten .
police do have a seven-minute video in their possession but have not said what is on it .
no other videos of klatten and sgarbi have ever been recovered .
" we have not found any videos so far , " said steinkraus-koch .
" we can not rule out however that they do not exist .
we have evidence that they may have been destroyed , but this has not been confirmed . " wl / ap / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

health and public workers , as well as chronically ill people will get the flu shots first . the german health ministry announced on friday that an estimated quarter of germany 's population will be eligible to receive the flu shots .
this confirms reports earlier this week that the government had plans to order 50 million vaccine units against swine flu .
the vaccines will be available from september , to coincide with an expected surge in flu cases .
health state ministers late on thursday agreed that chronically ill patients , health care workers , police officers , fire fighters , public workers and pregnant women can receive the injections first .
two shots are needed for the vaccination to be effective against the -lrb- a -rrb- h1n1 virus .
" the vaccinations are a precautionary measure , " said health ministry spokesman , klaus vater .
" no one can tell how the new virus will develop in the coming weeks . "
despite the priority immunization list , federal health minister ulla schmidt insists that everyone who wants to be vaccinated against swine flu , will be able to do so .
protecting the entire population is expected to cost health insurers an estimated two billion euros .
around 800 infections - none fatal - have been reported in germany .
that 's the third-highest number in europe after britain and spain .
berlin has not said when the remaining population can be vaccinated .
this largely depends on how fast pharmaceutical companies can produce the vaccine .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any vessel heading into north korean waters suspected of carrying contraban is subject to a search however , there is a loophole in the wording , in order to intercept a ship , the country under which the vessel is flagged must give permission .
according to haggard and noland , this could provide incentives for north korea to do more shipping under its own flag ; though that is doubtful given the country 's standing in the international community .
many ships , regardless of their country of origin , sail under the auspices of countries such as liberia and panama - countries where fees , taxes , regulations , and laws protecting seafarers are often minimal or non-existent .
that means that these nations will be under more and more pressure to allow these ships to be searched , leaving north korea no choice but to use its own flag ; though this causes its own potential drama as north korea has stated in no uncertain terms that it would view such action as an act of war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 17.07.2009 new un security council resolution against north korea großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the resolution is binding on all un member states a un security council panel has put five companies , including one based in iran , and five north koreans under un sanctions because of their links to pyongyang 's nuclear and ballistic missile activities . these sanctions against north korea are just the newest in an ongoing struggle to get the asian state to abandon its nuclear ambitions .
it all started back in october 2006 when pyongyang tested a nuclear device , causing the members of the united nations security council -lrb- unsc -rrb- to issue unsc resolution 1718 , which put sanctions on trade in major weapons system , all products related to the production of weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- , and luxury goods .
but instead of convincing north korea to back off , it actually incited them to try harder ; a point that was proved when they launched a multi-stage rocket on april 5 of this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea 's explosion of a nuclear device on may 25 triggered protests in the south the newest sanctions imposed by the unsc panel on pyongyang for exploding a nuclear device on may 25 , which is completely binding for all member states , is a little bit different in that they focus not on the government as a whole , but rather on individuals and economic entities .
the list includes five companies , including one based in iran , and five north koreans .
the 15-nation council 's panel also banned two goods to be imported by north korea : graphite designed or specified for use in electrical discharge machining -lrb- edm -rrb- machines and para-aramid fiber - commonly known as kevlar - filament and tape .
the panel imposed a freeze of assets belonging to namchongang trading company , hong kong electronics , korea hyoksin trading corporation , general bureau of atomic energy and korean tangun trading corporation .
the five north koreans are : yun ho-jin , director of namchongang trading ; ri je-son and hwang suk-hwa , both directors of separate departments in the general bureau of atomic energy ; rihong-sop , former director of yongbyon nuclear research centre ; han yu-ro , director of korea ryongaksan general trading corporation .
the individuals ' assets will be frozen and they will be banned from travelling abroad .
smart sanctions according to professor michael brzoska , director of the institute for peace research and security policy at the university of hamburg , sanctions against north korea have been changed several times , but the main goal has always been to tighten the screws , particularly on the leadership , without harming the population too much .
the idea is to make life difficult for north korean president kim jong-il and those around him , as well as to limit the possibilities for state institutions , particularly in the financial field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea has been very secretive about the health of the country 's leader kim jong-il using these so-called smart sanctions to target individuals rather than entire governments is n't new ; since the early 1990s the unsc decided to try and influence the behavior of decision makers without harming the general population .
the first cases were iraq and the former yugoslavia , says brzoska , and since then there have been others , adding that the success of these actions has been very mixed .
in angola , for example , the unita rebel movement was targeted in this way and , in the end , lost the war to the government .
in liberia , where former president charles taylor , who is now at the international court of justice in the hague , became a target and that was successful in limiting his possibilities to buy arms and to pay his soldiers .
" one could also argue that in libya sanctions that harmed the leadership by making it more difficult to fly and to have money available for investment in the oil industry also helped to bring about change there .
but there are a lot of other cases where these types of smart sanctions did not have much effect , like in iran , the ivory coast or sierra leone , " says brzoska .
the china question the key to any of these sanctions being successful has always been how inclined the chinese government is to enforce them .
china is north korea 's only ally in the region , if not the world , and they have been reluctant to put pressure on pyongyang in the past .
this is mostly due to the fact that beijing uses its relationship with north korea - and the ability to bring kim jong-il to the negotiating table - to bargain with both japan and the united states , says dr. patrick koellner , acting head of the institute of asian affairs at the german institute of global and area studies .
according to koellner , china , which holds a permanent position on the security council , has the ability to bring north korea to its knees .
simply by cutting of supplies of energy and food and freezing the assets of north korean leaders , kim 's regime would have no choice but to surrender to any demands the un had of it .
however , unlike the japanese and the americans , the chinese actually have a vested financial interest in the sound future of north korea .
according to a report by the council on foreign relations , chinese trade and investment in north korea now totals $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.4 billion euros -rrb- a year . bildunterschrift : since the korean war the border between the two nations has been heavily guarded enforcement while complete chinese cooperation would make things a whole lot faster , it is n't required to put pressure on north korea .
stephan haggard and marcus noland from the peterson institute for international economics argue in a recently published report that the most interesting features of the resolution have to do with means of enforcement .
the resolution calls upon member states to inspect vessels on the high seas or escort them to port if they have reasonable grounds to believe that they are carrying prohibited cargo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any vessel heading into north korean waters suspected of carrying contraban is subject to a search however , there is a loophole in the wording , in order to intercept a ship , the country under which the vessel is flagged must give permission .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 17.07.2009 little enthusiasm for " us-india 3.0 " in mumbai and delhi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indians are glad hillary clinton is touring india , but really hope for a visit by president obama soon hillary clinton is visiting india for the first time as us secretary of state .
india , which signed an historic nuclear deal with the us under president bush has felt somewhat neglected by the obama administration so far . secretary clinton has announced that us-india relations are entering a new era , which she has called " us-india 3.0 " .
this new phase of bilateral relations would come after a first phase full of mutual distrust during the cold war and a slow rapprochement process under presidents bill clinton and george w. bush .
in her council on foreign relations address in washington this week , clinton said her talks in mumbai and delhi would cover an unprecedentedly wide range of issues .
" we are delighted that our two countries will be engaging in a very broad , comprehensive dialogue .
we believe india has a tremendous opportunity and growing responsibility , which they acknowledge , to play not just a regional role , but a global one as well . "
pakistan is top regional issue the most important regional issue is considered to be pakistan .
india has generally been supportive of the obama administration 's so called afpak -lrb- afghanistan-pakistan -rrb- policies , says chintamani mahapatra , an expert in indo-us relations at delhi 's prestigious jawaharlal nehru university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : combatting islamists in pakistan is a common goal for the us and india but , he adds , there remains disagreement on some issues : " american interest is confined to making pakistan fight the taliban , who are anti-us , anti-west .
and lashkar-e-taiba and other groups of terrorists in pakistan who are fomenting problems in india , both in kashmir and elsewhere , are off the hook . "
india blames lashkar-e-taiba for the mumbai attacks that killed more than 170 people last november and has suspended the " composite dialogue " process with pakistan as a consequence .
however , at this week 's meeting between the two countries ' prime ministers in sharm-el-sheikh , the indian position seemed to have mellowed somewhat .
the us will surely be happy about this , as any indo-pakistani conflict would distract pakistan from fighting the taliban .
observers also expect clinton to try and convince delhi that the kashmir conflict needs more attention .
non-proliferation before leaving for india , the secretary of state also mentioned that she wanted to talk about nuclear non-proliferation .
a tricky affair , since india has never been officially acknowledged as a nuclear power and refuses to sign the non-proliferation treaty , which it regards as discriminatory .
clinton has signalled that the americans are ready to look for innovative solutions : " there is nothing easy about non-proliferation .
i mean , anybody who ever read strobe talbott 's book ‘ engaging india ' knows this is a very difficult issue . "
other difficult issues likely to crop up during clinton 's trip to india include climate change and the " doha round " global trade negotiations .
but clinton is also going to want to simply improve the mood in india .
buttering up the indians chintamani mahapatra says the country has felt neglected by the obama administration so far : " i think the obama administration has marginalized india for quite a few months now .
we understand why it did so because the foreign policy plate of obama was truly overflowing . "
but he adds that at a time when hillary clinton 's clout in the administration is openly questioned in the us , it is not likely that her visit alone will impress the indians .
" we know very well that hillary clinton 's position in the decision-making process in the us is not very strong . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh is expected in washington in september although she has the ear of the president and has taken many foreign policy initiatives , they have not been taken up by the white house , says mahapatra who already talks about a visit of president barack obama to india .
" our prime minister is going to visit the us in september , and he had extended an invitation to president obama .
hopefully , he will come to india not towards the end of his term , but in the middle of his term if he really wants to improve the relationship between the two countries . "
so while there might be no serious conflict between india and the united states right now , there also seems to be little enthusiasm about " us-india 3.0 " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 17.07.2009 german designer breathes life into china 's fashion dragon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the michalsky label was the talk of berlin fashion week berlin-based designer michael michalsky has signed a deal with china 's leading sportswear brand for a range earmarked for the chinese market .
he 's among the first german designers to head east , but he wo n't be the last . " china is the most exciting market for fashion right now , " enthuses michael michalsky , the darling of the recent berlin fashion week . " the chinese are really open to fashion , and let 's face it , the future of the world lies in this region , " he says as he reflects on his deal to develop a range of sportswear for the china dongxiang group .
the michalsky label might not yet be in the same league as karl lagerfeld , hugo boss or joop ! , but its namesake has always been ahead of the pack .
" i like to do things differently and i like to be the first , " he says .
" i was the first designer to move to berlin and do major shows here even before it was really on the map .
it 's part of my own nature and the character of both my company and my brand . "
shifting focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael michalsky is pushing fashion 's frontiers in these economically troubled times , thinking outside the box can make all the difference - and michael michalsky has broken with decades of fashion tradition by setting his sights on beijing and shanghai rather than paris and milan .
at the high-end of the industry , he 's one of the first to have woken up to china 's potential as more than a market for established western brands such as louis vuitton , cartier and bmw .
earlier this year , the new york times stated the obvious when it reported that china is now the world 's fastest-growing luxury market , with an estimated $ 7.6 billion in sales in 2008 .
michalsky , in the meantime , had cottoned on to a different , more significant growth - that of the domestic market .
although its love affair with imported luxury is still going strong , china is increasingly fed up being merely a production site for other countries and the home of cheap knock-offs .
these days , it 's keen to foster indigenous brands and to meet its consumer needs under its own steam .
" the domestic chinese market is expanding rapidly , " confirms rené lang , president of the association of german fashion and textile designers .
" until now , china has been known first and foremost as a supplier , but now it has greater spending power , despite the crisis , and there are some very well trained designers and fashion schools .
but they are still in a phase where they tend to rely on foreign help expertise . "
enter michalsky .
after eleven years as global creative director at adidas , he founded his own label in 2006 and his ' real clothes for real people ' approach has done much to establish berlin as an up and coming fashion capital where style reflects the street more than the catwalk . nonetheless , the michalsky label has n't yet managed to turn a profit .
in that respect , it 's in the same boat as many ailing brands .
but while hard-up veteran french labels such as lacroix are busy nursing their wounds and sulkily blaming bankruptcy on the global financial crisis , michael michalsky - like the brave young rookie he is - wasted no time identifying markets not feeling the pinch of recession quite so harshly .
traditional brands might turn their noses up at china , but where others see only a low-end market , the german designer sees real potential : " the dongxiang group is very successful locally , and the company is now looking to expand internationally , " he says .
" to begin with , the line will only be available in china because that 's where they have their own stores , but they 're planning to expand across asia and i do n't see what 's to stop them ending up in other markets futher afield . "
" china is in a transitional phase right now , it 's moving away from imported goods towards home-grown products , " agrees rené lang .
" there 's a burgeoning desire for a more personal cultural identity attached to goods that have been specially produced for the chinese market . "
hot on the heels of jil sander bildunterschrift : jil sander 's clothes are elegant and austere - and big in japan in heading east , michalsky is following in the footsteps of only one other german designer .
in march , jil sander raised eyebrows from madison avenue to avenue montaigne when she teamed up with japanese budget clothing retailer uniqlo .
the company sells $ 30 jeans and $ 15 parkas , and is one of the few companies still thriving despite japan 's recession .
" the challenge for me is to establish premium quality and democratically priced brand uniqlo , " she told reporters in tokyo in spring .
similarly , michalsky showed that he 's not too proud to take his talents wherever they 're most wanted when he launched his mitch & co range for tchibo , a german range of coffee shops that also sells clothing , household items , electronics and electrical appliances .
the collection flopped , but the tie-up helped make michalsky a household name .
unlike many designers , he 's just not that precious .
as far as china is concerned , he shrugs off the qualms some of his colleagues might have about poor working conditions .
" i have n't yet been to any of the dongxiang factories , " he says .
" i 've been to the headquarters and it 's a very modern company and very european in its thinking .
in fact , the chinese factories i 've visited in their past when i was still with my former employer , were surprisingly modern and conditions were good .
they were no different to places i 've visited in italy .
i think conditions have improved a lot . "
image boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are conditions improving in the chinese textile industry ?
rené lang says the same .
" we need to get way from the idea of cheap china , " he stresses .
" standards are changing fast and there 's a growing interest in organic textiles , sustainability and better working conditions .
the situation will inevitably improve the more money starts circulating in the market .
china is trying to shed its bad image . "
as a designer , michalsky has often demonstrated a social conscience , referencing world affairs in his shows with comments on issues such as the hypocrisy of left-wing intellectuals , the tyranny of capitalism and the profligacy of wall street .
but with the ink still drying on his latest deal , he 's reluctant to consider the political or economic ramifications of his move into china .
" my message is simply that we are all living in one world and that 's why i wanted to do something in this part of the globe , " he sums up .
" i understand that young people are influenced by the same things all over the world , and i think that 's why i got the job . "

they include the bavarian brand " oettinger , " whose sales were up two percent .
oettinger , which for years has been germany 's most widely consumed beer , is to take over in august the " feldschloeßchen " brewery owned by the danish beer giant carlsberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous german beer brand " krombacher " saw sales plunge by 5.3 percent in the first quarter the other brewer to show growth in the first quarter - 2.5 percent - is the " hasseröder " brand .
the beer brand is part of belgium-based ab inbev , the world 's largest brewery and the second-largest beer producer in germany .
the biggest loser in the beer market , according to the study , is the cheaply-priced " sternburg , " an east german brand whose sales plunged 11 percent in the first quarter .
the brand is part of the frankfurt-based radeberger group , germany 's largest brewer .
steady drop in beer consumption according to the federal statistical office , the german beer market shrank by four percent in the first five months of 2009 .
exports to germany 's partners in the 27-nation european union were also down 12.5 percent in the first quarter .
thursday 's study did not provide a reason for the decline .
however , beer sales have been sliding steadily in germany for more than a decade , a trend that experts have attributed to an increasingly health-conscious public as well as the different drinking habits of younger consumers .
" the market has been significantly shrinking over the last few years , " peter hahn , head of the german brewers ' association told news agency dpa earlier this year .
" the times when every german drank more than 150 liters of beer annually are definitely gone . "
some have also blamed a public smoking ban in some german states as well as a deep recession for the latest drop in beer consumption .
to add to the woes , munich 's office of tourism said in may that revelers at this year 's oktoberfest in september would have to dig deeper into their pockets .
officials said a one-liter mug of beer will cost between 8.50 euros -lrb- $ 11.63 -rrb- and 8.60 euros this year - a five percent hike over 2008 prices. sp / dpa / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

her comments were picked up by a number of german broadcasters , as well as many german newspapers .
but it seems that german media were not the only ones listening : conservative iranian media have now attacked ebadi for the statements she made while at deutsche welle .
" feigning interest " iran 's official news agency , the islamic republic news agency -lrb- irna -rrb- , writes that shirin ebadi has assumed the view of german chancellor angela merkel , feigning in unison with her concerns about freedom and civil rights in iran .
irna adds that on the other hand , ebadil like other western media , remains silent about " murders committed by the zionists and occupiers of palastine . "
it also accuses her of being silent about the " suffering of the poor people in afghanistan and thousands of prisoners in abu ghraib , guantanamo and baghram . "
irna continues : " when ebadi aligns herself with the europeans and other western nations , and criticizes and condemns the iranian government , she provides the western media with luxurious gifts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian authorities closed down the office of ebadi 's human rights group last year iranian internet news agency raja news linked ebadi 's statements to the fatal shooting of neda agha soltan , the young female student whose face became a symbol of the anti-government protests .
raja news writes : " following the unlawful killing of our beloved citizen neda by british agents in iran , mrs ebadi was one of those who published a letter , in unison with dishonest media like deutsche welle and the bbc , accusing the iranian government of being involved in this incident . "
comments misreported during her press conference at deutsche welle , ebadi spoke out clearly against economic sanctions on iran , saying these hurt only the iranian population .
but bultan news , another iranian internet news agency , reported that ebadi had in fact said the opposite .
bultan news quoted ebadi as saying : " if negotiations with iran do not result in democracy , then western countries should impose sanctions on iran . "
it also quoted her as saying that " negotiations are always the best approach - but we ca n't go on negotiating forever . "
such attacks are part of the stardard reperatoire of iran 's conservative media .
over the past few years , president mahmoud ahmedinejad has used the dispute over iran 's nuclear program to distract the population from the country 's economic problems and maintain their support .
the election of us president barack obama has robbed ahmedinejad of his favorite enemy , george w. bush .
the diputed iranian presidential election and the use of violence to put down protests there have further weakened him politically .
now the iranian leadership is apparently seeking to make up lost ground by creating new public enemies .
among those in their sights , apart from britain and france , is germany .
so far , this strategy has n't been successful .
criticism of the election continues in iran itself .

her comments were picked up by a number of german broadcasters , as well as many german newspapers .
but it seems that german media were not the only ones listening : conservative iranian media have now attacked ebadi for the statements she made while at deutsche welle .
" feigning interest " iran 's official news agency , the islamic republic news agency -lrb- irna -rrb- , writes that shirin ebadi has assumed the view of german chancellor angela merkel , feigning in unison with her concerns about freedom and civil rights in iran .
irna adds that on the other hand , ebadil like other western media , remains silent about " murders committed by the zionists and occupiers of palastine . "
it also accuses her of being silent about the " suffering of the poor people in afghanistan and thousands of prisoners in abu ghraib , guantanamo and baghram . "
irna continues : " when ebadi aligns herself with the europeans and other western nations , and criticizes and condemns the iranian government , she provides the western media with luxurious gifts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian authorities closed down the office of ebadi 's human rights group last year iranian internet news agency raja news linked ebadi 's statements to the fatal shooting of neda agha soltan , the young female student whose face became a symbol of the anti-government protests .
raja news writes : " following the unlawful killing of our beloved citizen neda by british agents in iran , mrs ebadi was one of those who published a letter , in unison with dishonest media like deutsche welle and the bbc , accusing the iranian government of being involved in this incident . "
comments misreported during her press conference at deutsche welle , ebadi spoke out clearly against economic sanctions on iran , saying these hurt only the iranian population .
but bultan news , another iranian internet news agency , reported that ebadi had in fact said the opposite .
bultan news quoted ebadi as saying : " if negotiations with iran do not result in democracy , then western countries should impose sanctions on iran . "
it also quoted her as saying that " negotiations are always the best approach - but we ca n't go on negotiating forever . "
such attacks are part of the stardard reperatoire of iran 's conservative media .
over the past few years , president mahmoud ahmedinejad has used the dispute over iran 's nuclear program to distract the population from the country 's economic problems and maintain their support .
the election of us president barack obama has robbed ahmedinejad of his favorite enemy , george w. bush .
the diputed iranian presidential election and the use of violence to put down protests there have further weakened him politically .
now the iranian leadership is apparently seeking to make up lost ground by creating new public enemies .
among those in their sights , apart from britain and france , is germany .
so far , this strategy has n't been successful .
criticism of the election continues in iran itself .
the protests are continuing even though the government has , through the use and threat of violence , managed to keep the demonstrators off the streets . author : jamsheed faroughi / sybille golte -lrb- ca -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while national governments debate their afghan missions , international groups are working on the ground to ensure a free and fair election . the drumbeat of bad news out of afghanistan continues unabated .
july is shaping up to be one of the deadliest months for international forces fighting in afghanistan in the eight-year history of the conflict .
as of wednesday , at least 46 international troops were killed this month . the increasing death toll has reignited debate in countries such as britain and germany about whether their afghan missions are worth the high cost and new voices in both countries are calling for a reconsideration of troop deployment in a country that seems to be sinking deeper into a quagmire of militant violence . but for international groups on the ground there in the run-up to elections on august 20 , there is no doubt that a continued international presence is needed , and is vital , to ensure that the country has an election that is fair and credible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western and international groups have been helping with voter registration " the stakes are extremely high , the challenges are significant , " said aleem siddique , the united nation 's spokesperson in kabul . "
afghanistan deserves the best leaders it can possibly obtain .
the afghan people are looking to the international community to provide that oversight to ensure their rights are protected . " this is the first time the afghans are running their own presidential election .
the independent election commission of afghanistan is in charge of the polling , but the un is providing support in the run-up to the vote . the un development program is giving the election commission logistics support and is also helping train afghan police who will guard polling stations across the country on august 20 .
the global body is behind a team of 1,600 so-called civic educators , afghans who are fanning out across the country to introduce the population to the democratic process – an idea very foreign to many . " what we want to see is a process that is credible to the afghans because we are talking about a very young democracy that is still in infant shoes , " said christiane hohmann , spokeswoman for the eu 's external relations section . european commitments the european commission announced late last week that it is sending about 100 election monitors to the country – 16 are on the ground now , the rest will go just before election day . all in all , the eu is spending 40 million euros on afghan election support – money that goes to train eu and afghan election monitors and helps with practicalities , like printing up ballot sheets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan policeman stands guard as officials put up election posters near kabul " the immediate priority is naturally to ensure that the upcoming presidential election brings the necessary legitimacy needed to the new government , " european commissioner for external relations benita ferrero-waldner said in a speech at a donor conference on afghanistan in march . the organization for security and cooperation in europe is sending some 20 experts to kabul at the end of this month to provide technical assistance with voter registration , vote counting and tabulation , and domestic observation teams .
while afghanistan is outside the osce 's normal purview , it is looking at helping find ways to maintain long-term political in the country . " there is a lot of international support for this election and a lot of expertise is in the country , a lot of know-how , " said jens-hagen eschenbächer of the osce 's office for democratic institutions and human rights .
" we provide advice how these structures can be integrated to make the election process more sustainable . " german fears and hopes the german presence in afghanistan is considerable .
it has 3,830 troops in afghanistan as part of the nato-led international security assistance force and has been active in training afghan police . bildunterschrift : as the german death toll in afghanistan has risen , support at home is falling but support for the mission there in germany has been slipping .
according to a recent poll by german public broadcaster zdf , 55 percent of germans are not in favor of the peacekeeping mission there while 42 percent support the operation . the country has also been involved in economic reconstruction projects through its gtz technical aid organization .
despite the worsening security situation , the group 's afghan director andreas clausing said from kabul that the upcoming elections are something of a light at the end of the tunnel . " i think it is a very positive step , " he said , adding that " we and our afghan partners are looking very hopefully forward .

july is shaping up to be one of the deadliest months for international forces fighting in afghanistan in the eight-year history of the conflict .
as of wednesday , at least 46 international troops were killed this month . the increasing death toll has reignited debate in countries such as britain and germany about whether their afghan missions are worth the high cost and new voices in both countries are calling for a reconsideration of troop deployment in a country that seems to be sinking deeper into a quagmire of militant violence . but for international groups on the ground there in the run-up to elections on august 20 , there is no doubt that a continued international presence is needed , and is vital , to ensure that the country has an election that is fair and credible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western and international groups have been helping with voter registration " the stakes are extremely high , the challenges are significant , " said aleem siddique , the united nation 's spokesperson in kabul .

german media quotes piepenburg as saying that plans to revive the company were not on a solid foundation and that there was no support from arcandor 's main shareholder sal .
oppenheim jr .
cie .
piepenburg 's departure increases the odds that arcandor 's ailing department store chain karstadt as well as its troubled mail order business primondo will be sold off in parts .
arcandor also holds 53 percent of uk travel retailer thomas cook , and it is now believed that creditors will become more aggressive in seeking to acquire a stake in cook which was used as collateral with a group of eight lenders last last year .
the departure of piepenburg is also a setback for karl-gerhard eick , arcandor 's chief executive , who wants to keep the three companies together .
but he remains optimistic .
" until the middle of august , i will welcome every opportunity for investors to implement a recovery plan , to save arcandor ag and its jobs , " eick was quoted as saying in german media .
last month , while the government refused to help out arcandor , another of arcandor 's troubled firms , mail-order retailer quelle , received government loan guarantees to the tune of 50 million euros from the german state of bavaria which allowed it to pay its bills and keep operating. av / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but there are no settlements yet and the moon 's " seas " are bone dry . the earth 's satellite looks really old .
it 's turned completely grey and its face is marked with numerous wrinkles , stains and scars .
it 's visible : it 's been through a lot in its lifespan .
but given it 's been around for some 4 and a half billion years , the moon has aged with dignity .
getting a facelift is out of the question .
and it 's not even necessary – as every four weeks during the new moon phase , the moon is veiled in darkness and ca n't be spotted from earth .
we can see many big dark and lighter areas on the face of the moon .
this is due to the varied landscape on its surface .
some people see a face up there , others claim the pattern looks like a hopping rabbit .
at the time of astronomer galileo galilei , the first observers looking through their telescopes euphorically baptized the dark spots " maria " - the latin word for the seas .
they imagined huge bodies of water sloshing about what poets called the " watery planet " , and they imagined a very special lunar species living on the moon .
all that has become legend , and although astronomers still talk about " maria " , it 's quite clear that the moon is dry as a desert .
bildunterschrift : the near side of the moon looks rugged from ancient meteorite collisions just like an old bookshelf , the moon is covered in thick dust .
today , it has completely congealed .
however our celestial companion looks back at a very turbulent past .
in the first billion years of its existence , just like earth , it was exposed to a tremendous bombardment .
leftover debris from planet formation was abundant , and huge meteorites and whole asteroids were colliding with the surface .
even today , the numerous craters on the moon bear witness to the dramatic impact .
the biggest craters gradually filled up with liquid lava and welled up from what then was the hot liquid core of the moon .
so the dark spots on the moon are actually due to volcanic activity .
and the maria of the moon probably came about roughly 3 billion years ago .
that 's when the worst bombardment with space debris was over , which is why there are relatively few craters in the maria .
the lighter-coloured regions of the moon are called " terrae " , or more commonly just highlands , since they are higher than most maria .
the soil samples collected by the apollo space missions are evidence that once upon a time there was indeed volcanic activity on the moon .
it 's still unclear though how the lava reached the surface of the moon .
possibly it came up through cracks created by the impact of meteorites in the craters .
even the first scientists observing the moon have come up with colorful names for the maria , full of longing for the supposedly paradisiacal conditions on the moon : there are for instance , a sea of mirth , of nectar , of crisis , of clouds and also a ' mare fecunditiatis ' , or the sea of fertility .
bildunterschrift : the first men on the moon put an end to lunar tranquility however , the most well-known dark spot in the near side of the moon – the right eye in the moon 's face – is called mare tranquilitatis , or the sea of tranquillity .
that name is an obvious misconception because four and a half million years later the lunar peace has well and truly been disturbed .
on july 21 , 1969 , neil armstrong took his famous first step on the moon right in the sea of tranquillity .

the soil samples collected by the apollo space missions are evidence that once upon a time there was indeed volcanic activity on the moon .
it 's still unclear though how the lava reached the surface of the moon .
possibly it came up through cracks created by the impact of meteorites in the craters .
even the first scientists observing the moon have come up with colorful names for the maria , full of longing for the supposedly paradisiacal conditions on the moon : there are for instance , a sea of mirth , of nectar , of crisis , of clouds and also a ' mare fecunditiatis ' , or the sea of fertility .
bildunterschrift : the first men on the moon put an end to lunar tranquility however , the most well-known dark spot in the near side of the moon – the right eye in the moon 's face – is called mare tranquilitatis , or the sea of tranquillity .
that name is an obvious misconception because four and a half million years later the lunar peace has well and truly been disturbed .
on july 21 , 1969 , neil armstrong took his famous first step on the moon right in the sea of tranquillity .

health and public workers , as well as chronically ill people will get the flu shots first . the german health ministry announced on friday that an estimated quarter of germany 's population will be eligible to receive the flu shots .
this confirms reports earlier this week that the government had plans to order 50 million vaccine units against swine flu .
the vaccines will be available from september , to coincide with an expected surge in flu cases .
health state ministers late on thursday agreed that chronically ill patients , health care workers , police officers , fire fighters , public workers and pregnant women can receive the injections first .
two shots are needed for the vaccination to be effective against the -lrb- a -rrb- h1n1 virus .
" the vaccinations are a precautionary measure , " said health ministry spokesman , klaus vater .
" no one can tell how the new virus will develop in the coming weeks . "
despite the priority immunization list , federal health minister ulla schmidt insists that everyone who wants to be vaccinated against swine flu , will be able to do so .
protecting the entire population is expected to cost health insurers an estimated two billion euros .
around 800 infections - none fatal - have been reported in germany .
that 's the third-highest number in europe after britain and spain .
berlin has not said when the remaining population can be vaccinated .
this largely depends on how fast pharmaceutical companies can produce the vaccine .
the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- said up to 4.9 billion doses could be produced in 12 months . the un health body has meanwhile announced that it was no longer counting individual cases of swine flu .
it said the virus is spreading so fast , it can not keep up with all the figures and is now asking national health authorities to only report clusters of severe cases , deaths caused by the new virus , or unusual clinical patterns. wl / reuters / dpa / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

india , which signed an historic nuclear deal with the us under president bush has felt somewhat neglected by the obama administration so far . secretary clinton has announced that us-india relations are entering a new era , which she has called " us-india 3.0 " .
this new phase of bilateral relations would come after a first phase full of mutual distrust during the cold war and a slow rapprochement process under presidents bill clinton and george w. bush .
in her council on foreign relations address in washington this week , clinton said her talks in mumbai and delhi would cover an unprecedentedly wide range of issues .
" we are delighted that our two countries will be engaging in a very broad , comprehensive dialogue .
we believe india has a tremendous opportunity and growing responsibility , which they acknowledge , to play not just a regional role , but a global one as well . "
pakistan is top regional issue the most important regional issue is considered to be pakistan .
india has generally been supportive of the obama administration 's so called afpak -lrb- afghanistan-pakistan -rrb- policies , says chintamani mahapatra , an expert in indo-us relations at delhi 's prestigious jawaharlal nehru university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : combatting islamists in pakistan is a common goal for the us and india but , he adds , there remains disagreement on some issues : " american interest is confined to making pakistan fight the taliban , who are anti-us , anti-west .
and lashkar-e-taiba and other groups of terrorists in pakistan who are fomenting problems in india , both in kashmir and elsewhere , are off the hook . "
india blames lashkar-e-taiba for the mumbai attacks that killed more than 170 people last november and has suspended the " composite dialogue " process with pakistan as a consequence .
however , at this week 's meeting between the two countries ' prime ministers in sharm-el-sheikh , the indian position seemed to have mellowed somewhat .
the us will surely be happy about this , as any indo-pakistani conflict would distract pakistan from fighting the taliban .
observers also expect clinton to try and convince delhi that the kashmir conflict needs more attention .
non-proliferation before leaving for india , the secretary of state also mentioned that she wanted to talk about nuclear non-proliferation .
a tricky affair , since india has never been officially acknowledged as a nuclear power and refuses to sign the non-proliferation treaty , which it regards as discriminatory .
clinton has signalled that the americans are ready to look for innovative solutions : " there is nothing easy about non-proliferation .
i mean , anybody who ever read strobe talbott 's book ‘ engaging india ' knows this is a very difficult issue . "
other difficult issues likely to crop up during clinton 's trip to india include climate change and the " doha round " global trade negotiations .
but clinton is also going to want to simply improve the mood in india .
buttering up the indians chintamani mahapatra says the country has felt neglected by the obama administration so far : " i think the obama administration has marginalized india for quite a few months now .
we understand why it did so because the foreign policy plate of obama was truly overflowing . "
but he adds that at a time when hillary clinton 's clout in the administration is openly questioned in the us , it is not likely that her visit alone will impress the indians .
" we know very well that hillary clinton 's position in the decision-making process in the us is not very strong . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh is expected in washington in september although she has the ear of the president and has taken many foreign policy initiatives , they have not been taken up by the white house , says mahapatra who already talks about a visit of president barack obama to india .
" our prime minister is going to visit the us in september , and he had extended an invitation to president obama .
hopefully , he will come to india not towards the end of his term , but in the middle of his term if he really wants to improve the relationship between the two countries . "
so while there might be no serious conflict between india and the united states right now , there also seems to be little enthusiasm about " us-india 3.0 " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 17.07.2009 study says large german brewers selling less beer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's national drink is finding ever fewer takers a new study shows that almost all of germany 's 16 largest breweries sold less beer in the first quarter of this year , reflecting a steady decline in beer consumption in the country . the study by the specialist magazine inside released on thursday said that just two breweries among the 16 largest in germany registered growth in the first quarter of 2009 .
they include the bavarian brand " oettinger , " whose sales were up two percent .
oettinger , which for years has been germany 's most widely consumed beer , is to take over in august the " feldschloeßchen " brewery owned by the danish beer giant carlsberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous german beer brand " krombacher " saw sales plunge by 5.3 percent in the first quarter the other brewer to show growth in the first quarter - 2.5 percent - is the " hasseröder " brand .
the beer brand is part of belgium-based ab inbev , the world 's largest brewery and the second-largest beer producer in germany .
the biggest loser in the beer market , according to the study , is the cheaply-priced " sternburg , " an east german brand whose sales plunged 11 percent in the first quarter .
the brand is part of the frankfurt-based radeberger group , germany 's largest brewer .
steady drop in beer consumption according to the federal statistical office , the german beer market shrank by four percent in the first five months of 2009 .
exports to germany 's partners in the 27-nation european union were also down 12.5 percent in the first quarter .
thursday 's study did not provide a reason for the decline .
however , beer sales have been sliding steadily in germany for more than a decade , a trend that experts have attributed to an increasingly health-conscious public as well as the different drinking habits of younger consumers .
" the market has been significantly shrinking over the last few years , " peter hahn , head of the german brewers ' association told news agency dpa earlier this year .
" the times when every german drank more than 150 liters of beer annually are definitely gone . "
some have also blamed a public smoking ban in some german states as well as a deep recession for the latest drop in beer consumption .
to add to the woes , munich 's office of tourism said in may that revelers at this year 's oktoberfest in september would have to dig deeper into their pockets .
officials said a one-liter mug of beer will cost between 8.50 euros -lrb- $ 11.63 -rrb- and 8.60 euros this year - a five percent hike over 2008 prices. sp / dpa / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 17.07.2009 international groups step up to help with afghan election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan will be holding crucial elections on august 20 the security situation in afghanistan is deteriorating as elections approach .
while national governments debate their afghan missions , international groups are working on the ground to ensure a free and fair election . the drumbeat of bad news out of afghanistan continues unabated .
july is shaping up to be one of the deadliest months for international forces fighting in afghanistan in the eight-year history of the conflict .
as of wednesday , at least 46 international troops were killed this month . the increasing death toll has reignited debate in countries such as britain and germany about whether their afghan missions are worth the high cost and new voices in both countries are calling for a reconsideration of troop deployment in a country that seems to be sinking deeper into a quagmire of militant violence . but for international groups on the ground there in the run-up to elections on august 20 , there is no doubt that a continued international presence is needed , and is vital , to ensure that the country has an election that is fair and credible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western and international groups have been helping with voter registration " the stakes are extremely high , the challenges are significant , " said aleem siddique , the united nation 's spokesperson in kabul . "
afghanistan deserves the best leaders it can possibly obtain .
the afghan people are looking to the international community to provide that oversight to ensure their rights are protected . " this is the first time the afghans are running their own presidential election .
the independent election commission of afghanistan is in charge of the polling , but the un is providing support in the run-up to the vote . the un development program is giving the election commission logistics support and is also helping train afghan police who will guard polling stations across the country on august 20 .
the global body is behind a team of 1,600 so-called civic educators , afghans who are fanning out across the country to introduce the population to the democratic process – an idea very foreign to many . " what we want to see is a process that is credible to the afghans because we are talking about a very young democracy that is still in infant shoes , " said christiane hohmann , spokeswoman for the eu 's external relations section . european commitments the european commission announced late last week that it is sending about 100 election monitors to the country – 16 are on the ground now , the rest will go just before election day . all in all , the eu is spending 40 million euros on afghan election support – money that goes to train eu and afghan election monitors and helps with practicalities , like printing up ballot sheets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan policeman stands guard as officials put up election posters near kabul " the immediate priority is naturally to ensure that the upcoming presidential election brings the necessary legitimacy needed to the new government , " european commissioner for external relations benita ferrero-waldner said in a speech at a donor conference on afghanistan in march . the organization for security and cooperation in europe is sending some 20 experts to kabul at the end of this month to provide technical assistance with voter registration , vote counting and tabulation , and domestic observation teams .
while afghanistan is outside the osce 's normal purview , it is looking at helping find ways to maintain long-term political in the country . " there is a lot of international support for this election and a lot of expertise is in the country , a lot of know-how , " said jens-hagen eschenbächer of the osce 's office for democratic institutions and human rights .
" we provide advice how these structures can be integrated to make the election process more sustainable . " german fears and hopes the german presence in afghanistan is considerable .
it has 3,830 troops in afghanistan as part of the nato-led international security assistance force and has been active in training afghan police . bildunterschrift : as the german death toll in afghanistan has risen , support at home is falling but support for the mission there in germany has been slipping .
according to a recent poll by german public broadcaster zdf , 55 percent of germans are not in favor of the peacekeeping mission there while 42 percent support the operation . the country has also been involved in economic reconstruction projects through its gtz technical aid organization .
despite the worsening security situation , the group 's afghan director andreas clausing said from kabul that the upcoming elections are something of a light at the end of the tunnel . " i think it is a very positive step , " he said , adding that " we and our afghan partners are looking very hopefully forward .

members of the communication workers union -lrb- cwu -rrb- in areas such as london , edinburgh and bristol will participate in the 24-hour strike .
however the royal mail said almost all postal services outside london would be operating normally despite the strike .
the cwu accused the royal mail of making " illogical and arbitrary " job cuts and called for " genuine talks " .
cwu deputy general secretary dave ward said : " there 's nothing modern in cutting jobs and hours and imposing a pay freeze .
we need genuine talks on how to modernise the royal mail . "
management accused mr ward said his union had offered a three-month no strike deal in return for modernisation talks .
he further accused the royal mail management of failing to address the serious issues facing the industry .
but a statement issued by royal mail said : " the cwu 's claim to have offered a three-month moratorium is deliberately misleading and is nothing more than an attempt , backed by the threat of escalating strike action , to actually halt the modernisation of the mails business . "
it went on to suggest that if the process of change at the royal mail was halted , it would only serve to worsen the decline it has suffered in uk mail volumes .
letters to royal mail chief executive adam crozier and business secretary lord mandelson will be delivered by the union ahead of a rally in central london later .
the direct marketing association warned that the strike would damage businesses across the uk .

members of the communication workers union -lrb- cwu -rrb- in areas such as london , edinburgh and bristol will participate in the 24-hour strike .
however the royal mail said almost all postal services outside london would be operating normally despite the strike .
the cwu accused the royal mail of making " illogical and arbitrary " job cuts and called for " genuine talks " .
cwu deputy general secretary dave ward said : " there 's nothing modern in cutting jobs and hours and imposing a pay freeze .
we need genuine talks on how to modernise the royal mail . "
management accused mr ward said his union had offered a three-month no strike deal in return for modernisation talks .
he further accused the royal mail management of failing to address the serious issues facing the industry .
but a statement issued by royal mail said : " the cwu 's claim to have offered a three-month moratorium is deliberately misleading and is nothing more than an attempt , backed by the threat of escalating strike action , to actually halt the modernisation of the mails business . "
it went on to suggest that if the process of change at the royal mail was halted , it would only serve to worsen the decline it has suffered in uk mail volumes .
letters to royal mail chief executive adam crozier and business secretary lord mandelson will be delivered by the union ahead of a rally in central london later .
the direct marketing association warned that the strike would damage businesses across the uk .
