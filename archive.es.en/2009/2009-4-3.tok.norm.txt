his first task will be to get beyond the company 's ongoing spying scandal . germany 's transport ministry on thursday endorsed fifty-seven year-old ruediger grube , a top executive at carmaker daimler , as the new head of the state-owned railway operator , deutsche bahn .
the ministry said chancellor angela merkel and key government officials had agreed wednesday evening on grube for the hot-seat , replacing hartmut mehdorn , 66 , who tendered his resignation this week after deutsche bahn admitted to the illicit surveillance of its employees .
mehdorn resigned on monday after being unable to end discussions on whether the company spied on employees ' emails from 2005 to 2008 and blocked messages from unions during a 2007 labor dispute .
grube is currently responsible for company strategy at automaker daimler .
he is also on the board of directors at european aircraft manufacturer eads .
grube has close ties to mehdorn himself , having served as his office manager at another company - and the possibility grube could become the successor to his former boss drew immediate protest from the opposition green party .

" at this summit nato must start revising its strategic concept , " merkel said in a speech at the german parliament in late march . the german government has said nato efforts to advance security and stability in afghanistan have become the litmus test of the alliance 's effectiveness . germany currently has about 3,500 troops based in the relatively peaceful northern region of afghanistan .

" germany and russia stopped being enemies 20 years ago , " she told parliamentarians .
" one should recognize once and for all that the cold war is over . " row erupts over new leader divisions within nato concerning russia are also reflected by an ongoing rift over the alliance ’ s internal decision-making structure . berlin believes that continued reliance on consensus could become a recipe for paralysis . internal bickering has erupted notably in the current search for a new secretary general . turkey rejects frontrunner anders fogh rasmussen of denmark for his position in the mohammed caricature row . germany and france dislike second choice radek sikorski , poland 's foreign minister , for his anti-russia stance . author : uwe hessler editor : susan houlton / sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his first task will be to get beyond the company 's ongoing spying scandal . germany 's transport ministry on thursday endorsed fifty-seven year-old ruediger grube , a top executive at carmaker daimler , as the new head of the state-owned railway operator , deutsche bahn .
the ministry said chancellor angela merkel and key government officials had agreed wednesday evening on grube for the hot-seat , replacing hartmut mehdorn , 66 , who tendered his resignation this week after deutsche bahn admitted to the illicit surveillance of its employees .
mehdorn resigned on monday after being unable to end discussions on whether the company spied on employees ' emails from 2005 to 2008 and blocked messages from unions during a 2007 labor dispute .
grube is currently responsible for company strategy at automaker daimler .
he is also on the board of directors at european aircraft manufacturer eads .
grube has close ties to mehdorn himself , having served as his office manager at another company - and the possibility grube could become the successor to his former boss drew immediate protest from the opposition green party .
" this is not a new beginning , mrs. merkel , " green parliamentary leader renate kuenast told news agency reporters .
" with mehdorn 's former assistant , there 's the threat of more of the same . "
the deutsche bahn in general - and mehdorn himself - are currently under investigation in relation to the spying allegations .
leading politicians and labor unions have called for thorough scrutiny into deutsche bahn 's allegedly comprehensive surveillance of its own employees .
troubleshooter ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accusations over employee surveillance are casting a shadow over deutsche bahn but beyond being an associate of mehdorn , who is ruediger grube ?
born in the northern german city of hamburg , his career began with an apprenticeship in airplane construction .
in the late 1980s and early 1990s , he began working for daimler 's aeronautics division as well as for airbus - now an eads subsidiary .
he has been on daimler 's board of directors since 2001 and a top eads executive for the past year and a half .
grube 's background has drawn criticism from people hoping someone with a background in the rail industry would take over deutsche bahn .
" after ten years of mehdorn , there 's no need for another would-be high-flyer from the aeronautics sector , " kuenast told reporters .
there has been no word on when grube will be put forward as mehdorn 's successor. nrt / jc / sh -lrb- ap / dpa / rtr / afp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nato 's partnership with russia must be rebuilt and civil reconstruction in afghanistan strengthened . the german chancellor said she believes nato must adapt to new global challenges such as terrorism and energy security as well as building new partnerships in a post-cold war world . ahead of friday 's nato anniversary summit in germany and france , merkel said the 28-member alliance must not nostalgically look back at its history , but look to the future . " at this summit nato must start revising its strategic concept , " merkel said in a speech at the german parliament in late march . the german government has said nato efforts to advance security and stability in afghanistan have become the litmus test of the alliance 's effectiveness . germany currently has about 3,500 troops based in the relatively peaceful northern region of afghanistan .
another 600 soldiers are to be deployed to safeguard afghan elections this summer and will contribute to the training program for afghan security forces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil reconstruction is important to stabilizing afghanistan german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier says that berlin 's strategy of a military-backed reconstruction effort should be emulated by other nato partners . " stabilizing afghanistan can only be achieved if the country becomes economically viable , " he says . berlin has also welcomed a shift in washington ’ s afghanistan policy . us president barack obama recently announced that he wants to speed up civil reconstruction in addition to sending further 17,000 troops to fight the resurgent taliban . reaching out to russia following talks with russian president dmitry medvedev in berlin on tuesday , merkel said that mutual trust needed to be rebuilt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants closer ties with russia ties between nato and russia are strained after spats over nato ’ s eastward expansion and american plans to station missiles and a radar base as part of an anti-missile shield in eastern europe . in attempts to help the creation of a strategic partnership with moscow , merkel has called on the former soviet satellite states in eastern europe to bury the hatchet with russia as germany has done . " germany and russia stopped being enemies 20 years ago , " she told parliamentarians .
" one should recognize once and for all that the cold war is over . " row erupts over new leader divisions within nato concerning russia are also reflected by an ongoing rift over the alliance ’ s internal decision-making structure . berlin believes that continued reliance on consensus could become a recipe for paralysis . internal bickering has erupted notably in the current search for a new secretary general . turkey rejects frontrunner anders fogh rasmussen of denmark for his position in the mohammed caricature row . germany and france dislike second choice radek sikorski , poland 's foreign minister , for his anti-russia stance . author : uwe hessler editor : susan houlton / sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 03.04.2009 german-french brigade hopes to move beyond showcase status großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two countries , one mission : the insignia of the franco-german brigade france is marking its return to the alliance 's military command at nato anniversary celebrations .
but the once independent french military already cooperates with nato members .
one example : the german-french brigade . the photos of former german chancellor helmut kohl , former french president francois mitterrand and countless defense ministers from germany and france in the brigade 's headquarters in muellheim are the proof : politicians enjoy coming to this town in the southern corner of germany that meets france and switzerland . what french and german soldiers do here is still unique in europe , even 20 years after the establishment of the german-french brigade .
europe 's only bi-national unit is made up of some 5,000 soldiers from germany and france .
when the project was conceived in 1989 by kohl and mitterrand , there was nothing else like it .
one unit , two nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl -lrb- left -rrb- and mitterand were among the many visitors to muellheim the difficulties from those days , such as language problems , are still big challenges for the unit 's current commander , gen. andreas berg . as foresighted as the brigade may be in terms of providing the basis for a future european army , language issues never seem to go away .
just look at barracks security .
the german-french security crew at the gate can often only communicate with sign language , because the german does n't speak any french , and his french comrade does n't speak german .
the troops are actually meant to be able to work in two foreign languages , with english being the lingua franca in international matters of business . for 20 years now , the troops have been practicing their cooperation , but in that time , the soldiers have only twice been sent abroad together : to bosnia-herzegovina and afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marching in unison 's no problem , but talking can be only when the ministries of defense in berlin and paris agree on a mission does the brigade get the green light .
these joint operations are now so far in the past that most of the soldiers who participated in them have since moved on to other posts . this makes veterans in muellheim , such as the french sgt. maj. robert lenhardt , impatient .
lenhardt said it bothers him that the brigade is always presented as a showcase project at official events .
in reality , he said , it 's politics that prevent more action . " we can sleep in the same barracks and eat in the same canteen , no problem , " he said .
" but anyone can do that ; just go on vacation in the summertime .
we 're soldiers and we 're there for a certain purpose , and we never get to put it to the test . " waiting for a common mission unlike many of his colleagues , lenhardt moves easily in the german-french environment .

his first task will be to get beyond the company 's ongoing spying scandal . germany 's transport ministry on thursday endorsed fifty-seven year-old ruediger grube , a top executive at carmaker daimler , as the new head of the state-owned railway operator , deutsche bahn .
the ministry said chancellor angela merkel and key government officials had agreed wednesday evening on grube for the hot-seat , replacing hartmut mehdorn , 66 , who tendered his resignation this week after deutsche bahn admitted to the illicit surveillance of its employees .
mehdorn resigned on monday after being unable to end discussions on whether the company spied on employees ' emails from 2005 to 2008 and blocked messages from unions during a 2007 labor dispute .
grube is currently responsible for company strategy at automaker daimler .
he is also on the board of directors at european aircraft manufacturer eads .
grube has close ties to mehdorn himself , having served as his office manager at another company - and the possibility grube could become the successor to his former boss drew immediate protest from the opposition green party .
" this is not a new beginning , mrs. merkel , " green parliamentary leader renate kuenast told news agency reporters .
" with mehdorn 's former assistant , there 's the threat of more of the same . "
the deutsche bahn in general - and mehdorn himself - are currently under investigation in relation to the spying allegations .
leading politicians and labor unions have called for thorough scrutiny into deutsche bahn 's allegedly comprehensive surveillance of its own employees .
troubleshooter ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accusations over employee surveillance are casting a shadow over deutsche bahn but beyond being an associate of mehdorn , who is ruediger grube ?
born in the northern german city of hamburg , his career began with an apprenticeship in airplane construction .
in the late 1980s and early 1990s , he began working for daimler 's aeronautics division as well as for airbus - now an eads subsidiary .
he has been on daimler 's board of directors since 2001 and a top eads executive for the past year and a half .
grube 's background has drawn criticism from people hoping someone with a background in the rail industry would take over deutsche bahn .
" after ten years of mehdorn , there 's no need for another would-be high-flyer from the aeronautics sector , " kuenast told reporters .
there has been no word on when grube will be put forward as mehdorn 's successor. nrt / jc / sh -lrb- ap / dpa / rtr / afp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nato 's partnership with russia must be rebuilt and civil reconstruction in afghanistan strengthened . the german chancellor said she believes nato must adapt to new global challenges such as terrorism and energy security as well as building new partnerships in a post-cold war world . ahead of friday 's nato anniversary summit in germany and france , merkel said the 28-member alliance must not nostalgically look back at its history , but look to the future . " at this summit nato must start revising its strategic concept , " merkel said in a speech at the german parliament in late march . the german government has said nato efforts to advance security and stability in afghanistan have become the litmus test of the alliance 's effectiveness . germany currently has about 3,500 troops based in the relatively peaceful northern region of afghanistan .
another 600 soldiers are to be deployed to safeguard afghan elections this summer and will contribute to the training program for afghan security forces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil reconstruction is important to stabilizing afghanistan german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier says that berlin 's strategy of a military-backed reconstruction effort should be emulated by other nato partners . " stabilizing afghanistan can only be achieved if the country becomes economically viable , " he says . berlin has also welcomed a shift in washington ’ s afghanistan policy . us president barack obama recently announced that he wants to speed up civil reconstruction in addition to sending further 17,000 troops to fight the resurgent taliban . reaching out to russia following talks with russian president dmitry medvedev in berlin on tuesday , merkel said that mutual trust needed to be rebuilt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants closer ties with russia ties between nato and russia are strained after spats over nato ’ s eastward expansion and american plans to station missiles and a radar base as part of an anti-missile shield in eastern europe . in attempts to help the creation of a strategic partnership with moscow , merkel has called on the former soviet satellite states in eastern europe to bury the hatchet with russia as germany has done . " germany and russia stopped being enemies 20 years ago , " she told parliamentarians .
" one should recognize once and for all that the cold war is over . " row erupts over new leader divisions within nato concerning russia are also reflected by an ongoing rift over the alliance ’ s internal decision-making structure . berlin believes that continued reliance on consensus could become a recipe for paralysis . internal bickering has erupted notably in the current search for a new secretary general . turkey rejects frontrunner anders fogh rasmussen of denmark for his position in the mohammed caricature row . germany and france dislike second choice radek sikorski , poland 's foreign minister , for his anti-russia stance . author : uwe hessler editor : susan houlton / sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

part one of dw-world 's nato retrospective looks at the years 1949 to 1989 . washington , april 4 , 1949 .
in a celebratory atmosphere , the foreign ministers of 12 north american and european countries signed the founding documents of the north atlantic treaty organization , or nato .
even if world war ii was still fresh in the minds of those involved , nato 's biggest enemy was n't demilitarized germany , but the soviet union .
for western europe , there was no alternative to this alliance with the united states , said former british foreign secretary ernest bevin in a radio broadcast .
“ what were peace- and freedom-loving nations to do ? ” he asked .
“ stand by and wait for one after the other to be destroyed ?
or build a system of collective security that would bind their people together in strong resistance against this threat ?
we decided in favor of this second way . ”
the nato community bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato saw itself as a group with common values central to the treaty is article 5 , which outlines the principle of collective defense .
the article says that an attack on any member shall be considered to be an attack on all .
how exactly the members contribute to the defense of the member under attack is left up to the discretion of the member states .
from its inception , nato saw itself as a community bound by common values .
despite this , non-democratic states were admitted to the fold , and not just for strategic reasons , according to the german military expert , franz-josef meiers .
“ inwardly , values play a very important role , ” he said .
“ membership was supposed to fast-track the democratization process in countries such as spain or greece . ”
germany was a special case .
though it was destroyed in the war and demilitarized , it was nonetheless indispensable to nato because of its long-term strategic value .
on may 9 , 1955 , former german chancellor konrad adenauer arrived in paris to sign the membership declaration for his country .
hans speidel , who would later serve as nato commander during the cold war before his death in 1984 , was once asked to describe the moment . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they ’ re still skeptical on keeping troops in afghanistan . germans remain impressed with barack obama , think france is their most trustworthy partner among nations , and support nato – but not their country 's participation in the alliance 's afghan military mission .
that 's according to the new deutschlandtrend survey , a bi-monthly poll that tracks german opinions on newsworthy topics conducted by the public broadcast network ard -lrb- of which deutsche welle is a member -rrb- .
a robust 84 percent of germans believe nato is important as an instrument of keeping stability and peace within europe .
and 61 percent think nato should keep looking after afghanistan .
but just 32 percent want to keep german troops in that country , a full ten percent less than the month before .
as croatia and slovenia prepare for their initiation into nato this week , germans said they were wary of expanding nato further .
only 36 percent agreed to the proposition that nato should take on additional members from eastern europe and the balkans .

the obama effect may have helped the us out in the survey 's question about which countries germans consider to be trusted partners .
78 percent said they saw the us as such , continuing an upward trend since george w. bush 's team left office .
the country that led the list , however , was france .
87 percent of germans say their western neighbor is a trusted partner , up just slightly from the previous month .
germany and france are co-hosting this weekend 's nato summit , and have forged a very close relationship in economic policy-setting in recent months .
german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy presented a forceful , united front in the run-up to this week 's g20 summit , and achieved most of their goals to tighten international financial regulation .
however , when germans were asked who they thought was most likely to come up with a solution to getting out of the global economic crisis , they went back to their first love : barack obama .

his first task will be to get beyond the company 's ongoing spying scandal . germany 's transport ministry on thursday endorsed fifty-seven year-old ruediger grube , a top executive at carmaker daimler , as the new head of the state-owned railway operator , deutsche bahn .
the ministry said chancellor angela merkel and key government officials had agreed wednesday evening on grube for the hot-seat , replacing hartmut mehdorn , 66 , who tendered his resignation this week after deutsche bahn admitted to the illicit surveillance of its employees .
mehdorn resigned on monday after being unable to end discussions on whether the company spied on employees ' emails from 2005 to 2008 and blocked messages from unions during a 2007 labor dispute .
grube is currently responsible for company strategy at automaker daimler .
he is also on the board of directors at european aircraft manufacturer eads .
grube has close ties to mehdorn himself , having served as his office manager at another company - and the possibility grube could become the successor to his former boss drew immediate protest from the opposition green party .
" this is not a new beginning , mrs. merkel , " green parliamentary leader renate kuenast told news agency reporters .
" with mehdorn 's former assistant , there 's the threat of more of the same . "
the deutsche bahn in general - and mehdorn himself - are currently under investigation in relation to the spying allegations .
leading politicians and labor unions have called for thorough scrutiny into deutsche bahn 's allegedly comprehensive surveillance of its own employees .
troubleshooter ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accusations over employee surveillance are casting a shadow over deutsche bahn but beyond being an associate of mehdorn , who is ruediger grube ?
born in the northern german city of hamburg , his career began with an apprenticeship in airplane construction .
in the late 1980s and early 1990s , he began working for daimler 's aeronautics division as well as for airbus - now an eads subsidiary .
he has been on daimler 's board of directors since 2001 and a top eads executive for the past year and a half .
grube 's background has drawn criticism from people hoping someone with a background in the rail industry would take over deutsche bahn .
" after ten years of mehdorn , there 's no need for another would-be high-flyer from the aeronautics sector , " kuenast told reporters .
there has been no word on when grube will be put forward as mehdorn 's successor. nrt / jc / sh -lrb- ap / dpa / rtr / afp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the approval , which follows similar action by the lower house 11 days ago , comes after the government took an 8.7 percent stake in the shaky lender as a first step in gaining full control .
the german government has given the munich-based bank 87 billion euros -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- in state guarantees since it got into difficulties in october 2008 .
the financial sector provided a further 15 billion euros .
nationalization deemed necessary hypo real estate chalked up a loss of 5.5 billion euros in 2008 , the biggest of any german firm .
experts have said that the bank will collapse without government intervention .
the law will expire by the end of june , meaning a takeover would have to be initiated before then .
in return for the funds it has put into the bank , the german government wants to take full control in order to ensure that shareholders can not block restructuring measures .
such a move has been opposed by us investor christopher flowers , who owns nearly 24 percent of the bank and feels a government stake of 75 percent plus one share would be sufficient .
flowers has lost 1 billion euros since he paid 22.5 euros per share for his stake at the start of the global financial crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de deutsche bahn -pipe- 03.04.2009 government proposes grube as deutsche bahn head großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grube poised to take on a new job ruediger grube - whose experience includes daimler and eads - set to take over germany 's rail company , deutsche bahn .
his first task will be to get beyond the company 's ongoing spying scandal . germany 's transport ministry on thursday endorsed fifty-seven year-old ruediger grube , a top executive at carmaker daimler , as the new head of the state-owned railway operator , deutsche bahn .
the ministry said chancellor angela merkel and key government officials had agreed wednesday evening on grube for the hot-seat , replacing hartmut mehdorn , 66 , who tendered his resignation this week after deutsche bahn admitted to the illicit surveillance of its employees .
mehdorn resigned on monday after being unable to end discussions on whether the company spied on employees ' emails from 2005 to 2008 and blocked messages from unions during a 2007 labor dispute .
grube is currently responsible for company strategy at automaker daimler .
he is also on the board of directors at european aircraft manufacturer eads .
grube has close ties to mehdorn himself , having served as his office manager at another company - and the possibility grube could become the successor to his former boss drew immediate protest from the opposition green party .
" this is not a new beginning , mrs. merkel , " green parliamentary leader renate kuenast told news agency reporters .
" with mehdorn 's former assistant , there 's the threat of more of the same . "
the deutsche bahn in general - and mehdorn himself - are currently under investigation in relation to the spying allegations .
leading politicians and labor unions have called for thorough scrutiny into deutsche bahn 's allegedly comprehensive surveillance of its own employees .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accusations over employee surveillance are casting a shadow over deutsche bahn but beyond being an associate of mehdorn , who is ruediger grube ?
born in the northern german city of hamburg , his career began with an apprenticeship in airplane construction .
in the late 1980s and early 1990s , he began working for daimler 's aeronautics division as well as for airbus - now an eads subsidiary .
he has been on daimler 's board of directors since 2001 and a top eads executive for the past year and a half .
grube 's background has drawn criticism from people hoping someone with a background in the rail industry would take over deutsche bahn .
" after ten years of mehdorn , there 's no need for another would-be high-flyer from the aeronautics sector , " kuenast told reporters .
there has been no word on when grube will be put forward as mehdorn 's successor. nrt / jc / sh -lrb- ap / dpa / rtr / afp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his first task will be to get beyond the company 's ongoing spying scandal . germany 's transport ministry on thursday endorsed fifty-seven year-old ruediger grube , a top executive at carmaker daimler , as the new head of the state-owned railway operator , deutsche bahn .
the ministry said chancellor angela merkel and key government officials had agreed wednesday evening on grube for the hot-seat , replacing hartmut mehdorn , 66 , who tendered his resignation this week after deutsche bahn admitted to the illicit surveillance of its employees .
mehdorn resigned on monday after being unable to end discussions on whether the company spied on employees ' emails from 2005 to 2008 and blocked messages from unions during a 2007 labor dispute .
grube is currently responsible for company strategy at automaker daimler .
he is also on the board of directors at european aircraft manufacturer eads .
grube has close ties to mehdorn himself , having served as his office manager at another company - and the possibility grube could become the successor to his former boss drew immediate protest from the opposition green party .

the german-french security crew at the gate can often only communicate with sign language , because the german does n't speak any french , and his french comrade does n't speak german .
the troops are actually meant to be able to work in two foreign languages , with english being the lingua franca in international matters of business . for 20 years now , the troops have been practicing their cooperation , but in that time , the soldiers have only twice been sent abroad together : to bosnia-herzegovina and afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marching in unison 's no problem , but talking can be only when the ministries of defense in berlin and paris agree on a mission does the brigade get the green light .
these joint operations are now so far in the past that most of the soldiers who participated in them have since moved on to other posts . this makes veterans in muellheim , such as the french sgt. maj. robert lenhardt , impatient .
lenhardt said it bothers him that the brigade is always presented as a showcase project at official events .
in reality , he said , it 's politics that prevent more action . " we can sleep in the same barracks and eat in the same canteen , no problem , " he said .
" but anyone can do that ; just go on vacation in the summertime .
we 're soldiers and we 're there for a certain purpose , and we never get to put it to the test . " waiting for a common mission unlike many of his colleagues , lenhardt moves easily in the german-french environment .

but the once independent french military already cooperates with nato members .
one example : the german-french brigade . the photos of former german chancellor helmut kohl , former french president francois mitterrand and countless defense ministers from germany and france in the brigade 's headquarters in muellheim are the proof : politicians enjoy coming to this town in the southern corner of germany that meets france and switzerland . what french and german soldiers do here is still unique in europe , even 20 years after the establishment of the german-french brigade .

he also found time to soak up adoration from the crowds . united states president barack obama has tried to assuage german concerns that washington will use this weekend 's nato summit to press berlin for more troops to secure afghanistan .
" i do n't come bearing grand designs , " obama said at a joint press conference with chancellor angela merkel in the western german town of baden-baden on friday .
the deteriorating situation in afghanistan was expected to be one of the main topics at nato 's 60th anniversary meeting , held symbolically in the french city of strasbourg and the german towns of baden-baden and kehl .
speaking ahead of the meeting , obama said he was " here to listen , to share ideas , and jointly - as one of many nato allies - to help shape our vision for the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato talks will focus on afghanistan security obama described germany as an exemplary ally in afghanistan , which has suffered increasing violence since the us-led invasion of 2001 .
merkel noted that germany , which currently has over 3,500 troops deployed in the country 's north , had a " huge responsibility " and would " face up to this responsibility in military terms as well . "
however , obama also held the door open for us demands from european partners in comments that signaled washington 's resolve to change strategy .
" we will all now have to make additional and sustainable efforts to succeed ...
our role is not to occupy afghanistan , " but to prevent it from becoming a safe-haven for terrorists , " the us leader said .
" if we discover that the approach we are taking is not effective , it 's not working , then we will change it . "
germany has balked at sending more troops to afghanistan , where the nato-led international security assistance force is struggling to contain an escalating taliban insurgency while reconstructing the country .
however , merkel said she " welcomed " the us plans to change its strategy there .

rasmussen 's nomination has angered the north atlantic treaty organization 's only islamic member-state , turkey .

smiling and visibly touched as he walked through the french city , obama greeted spectators with handshakes and calls of " nice to see you " and " it 's good to be here . "

he also found time to soak up adoration from the crowds . united states president barack obama has tried to assuage german concerns that washington will use this weekend 's nato summit to press berlin for more troops to secure afghanistan .
" i do n't come bearing grand designs , " obama said at a joint press conference with chancellor angela merkel in the western german town of baden-baden on friday .
the deteriorating situation in afghanistan was expected to be one of the main topics at nato 's 60th anniversary meeting , held symbolically in the french city of strasbourg and the german towns of baden-baden and kehl .
speaking ahead of the meeting , obama said he was " here to listen , to share ideas , and jointly - as one of many nato allies - to help shape our vision for the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato talks will focus on afghanistan security obama described germany as an exemplary ally in afghanistan , which has suffered increasing violence since the us-led invasion of 2001 .
merkel noted that germany , which currently has over 3,500 troops deployed in the country 's north , had a " huge responsibility " and would " face up to this responsibility in military terms as well . "
however , obama also held the door open for us demands from european partners in comments that signaled washington 's resolve to change strategy .
" we will all now have to make additional and sustainable efforts to succeed ...
our role is not to occupy afghanistan , " but to prevent it from becoming a safe-haven for terrorists , " the us leader said .
" if we discover that the approach we are taking is not effective , it 's not working , then we will change it . "
germany has balked at sending more troops to afghanistan , where the nato-led international security assistance force is struggling to contain an escalating taliban insurgency while reconstructing the country .
however , merkel said she " welcomed " the us plans to change its strategy there .
nato politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey does n't want rasmussen as nato head on a separate issue likely to plague nato leaders , merkel said the western military alliance should choose its next leader this friday .
" i am convinced we should name a new secretary-general tonight , " merkel said , adding that danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen would make an " excellent choice . "
rasmussen 's nomination has angered the north atlantic treaty organization 's only islamic member-state , turkey .

" the nato summit is not a pledging conference , but of course we 'll be talking about how our allies can match their resources to the needs identified in the -lrb- us -rrb- strategic review , " clinton said ahead of her arrival in strasbourg , france .
clinton is to accompany us president barack obama to the summit , which takes place in strasbourg and in the neighbouring german cities of kehl and baden baden .
clinton wants " highest and best " contribution the us currently provides about half of all the forces taking part in nato 's 62,000-strong international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission in afghanistan .
obama has vowed to deploy an additional 17,000 troops , as well as 4,000 more experts to train afghan security forces .
officials in washington hope that , by setting an example , their european allies will follow .
" what we decided to do was to give the nato allies , eu members , countries in the region , everyone who we think has a stake in the future of afghanistan , to do their own internal review and to take a hard look at what they believe is their highest and best contribution , " clinton said .
united states national security advisor james jones said additional help would be particularly needed in the summer , when afghans go to the polls to vote on whether to renew the mandate of president hamid karzai .
" we have a national election coming up .
allies are considering how they might reinforce themselves ... so i expect there will be additional troop contributions , " jones said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 03.04.2009 german-french brigade hopes to move beyond showcase status großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two countries , one mission : the insignia of the franco-german brigade france is marking its return to the alliance 's military command at nato anniversary celebrations .
but the once independent french military already cooperates with nato members .
one example : the german-french brigade . the photos of former german chancellor helmut kohl , former french president francois mitterrand and countless defense ministers from germany and france in the brigade 's headquarters in muellheim are the proof : politicians enjoy coming to this town in the southern corner of germany that meets france and switzerland . what french and german soldiers do here is still unique in europe , even 20 years after the establishment of the german-french brigade .
europe 's only bi-national unit is made up of some 5,000 soldiers from germany and france .
when the project was conceived in 1989 by kohl and mitterrand , there was nothing else like it .
one unit , two nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl -lrb- left -rrb- and mitterand were among the many visitors to muellheim the difficulties from those days , such as language problems , are still big challenges for the unit 's current commander , gen. andreas berg . as foresighted as the brigade may be in terms of providing the basis for a future european army , language issues never seem to go away .
just look at barracks security .
the german-french security crew at the gate can often only communicate with sign language , because the german does n't speak any french , and his french comrade does n't speak german .
the troops are actually meant to be able to work in two foreign languages , with english being the lingua franca in international matters of business . for 20 years now , the troops have been practicing their cooperation , but in that time , the soldiers have only twice been sent abroad together : to bosnia-herzegovina and afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marching in unison 's no problem , but talking can be only when the ministries of defense in berlin and paris agree on a mission does the brigade get the green light .
these joint operations are now so far in the past that most of the soldiers who participated in them have since moved on to other posts . this makes veterans in muellheim , such as the french sgt. maj. robert lenhardt , impatient .
lenhardt said it bothers him that the brigade is always presented as a showcase project at official events .
in reality , he said , it 's politics that prevent more action . " we can sleep in the same barracks and eat in the same canteen , no problem , " he said .
" but anyone can do that ; just go on vacation in the summertime .
we 're soldiers and we 're there for a certain purpose , and we never get to put it to the test . " waiting for a common mission unlike many of his colleagues , lenhardt moves easily in the german-french environment .
such " bridge builders " in the brigade are often found among the unit 's management .
there , bilateral cooperation is a matter of course , because at higher levels , there are no language difficulties .
the average soldier , on the other hand , typically only sees his colleagues from the neighboring country at meals or while playing sports . soon , the brigade will also have a location in france .
french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel plan to permanently station around 700 bundeswehr soldiers in alsace .
many in muellheim hope that the location in strasbourg will be a further symbolic step forward that will give the brigade new momentum . author : andreas noll -lrb- dc -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nato 's partnership with russia must be rebuilt and civil reconstruction in afghanistan strengthened . the german chancellor said she believes nato must adapt to new global challenges such as terrorism and energy security as well as building new partnerships in a post-cold war world . ahead of friday 's nato anniversary summit in germany and france , merkel said the 28-member alliance must not nostalgically look back at its history , but look to the future . " at this summit nato must start revising its strategic concept , " merkel said in a speech at the german parliament in late march . the german government has said nato efforts to advance security and stability in afghanistan have become the litmus test of the alliance 's effectiveness . germany currently has about 3,500 troops based in the relatively peaceful northern region of afghanistan .
another 600 soldiers are to be deployed to safeguard afghan elections this summer and will contribute to the training program for afghan security forces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil reconstruction is important to stabilizing afghanistan german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier says that berlin 's strategy of a military-backed reconstruction effort should be emulated by other nato partners . " stabilizing afghanistan can only be achieved if the country becomes economically viable , " he says . berlin has also welcomed a shift in washington ’ s afghanistan policy . us president barack obama recently announced that he wants to speed up civil reconstruction in addition to sending further 17,000 troops to fight the resurgent taliban . reaching out to russia following talks with russian president dmitry medvedev in berlin on tuesday , merkel said that mutual trust needed to be rebuilt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants closer ties with russia ties between nato and russia are strained after spats over nato ’ s eastward expansion and american plans to station missiles and a radar base as part of an anti-missile shield in eastern europe . in attempts to help the creation of a strategic partnership with moscow , merkel has called on the former soviet satellite states in eastern europe to bury the hatchet with russia as germany has done .

nato 's partnership with russia must be rebuilt and civil reconstruction in afghanistan strengthened . the german chancellor said she believes nato must adapt to new global challenges such as terrorism and energy security as well as building new partnerships in a post-cold war world . ahead of friday 's nato anniversary summit in germany and france , merkel said the 28-member alliance must not nostalgically look back at its history , but look to the future . " at this summit nato must start revising its strategic concept , " merkel said in a speech at the german parliament in late march . the german government has said nato efforts to advance security and stability in afghanistan have become the litmus test of the alliance 's effectiveness . germany currently has about 3,500 troops based in the relatively peaceful northern region of afghanistan .
another 600 soldiers are to be deployed to safeguard afghan elections this summer and will contribute to the training program for afghan security forces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil reconstruction is important to stabilizing afghanistan german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier says that berlin 's strategy of a military-backed reconstruction effort should be emulated by other nato partners . " stabilizing afghanistan can only be achieved if the country becomes economically viable , " he says . berlin has also welcomed a shift in washington ’ s afghanistan policy . us president barack obama recently announced that he wants to speed up civil reconstruction in addition to sending further 17,000 troops to fight the resurgent taliban . reaching out to russia following talks with russian president dmitry medvedev in berlin on tuesday , merkel said that mutual trust needed to be rebuilt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants closer ties with russia ties between nato and russia are strained after spats over nato ’ s eastward expansion and american plans to station missiles and a radar base as part of an anti-missile shield in eastern europe . in attempts to help the creation of a strategic partnership with moscow , merkel has called on the former soviet satellite states in eastern europe to bury the hatchet with russia as germany has done . " germany and russia stopped being enemies 20 years ago , " she told parliamentarians .
" one should recognize once and for all that the cold war is over . " row erupts over new leader divisions within nato concerning russia are also reflected by an ongoing rift over the alliance ’ s internal decision-making structure . berlin believes that continued reliance on consensus could become a recipe for paralysis . internal bickering has erupted notably in the current search for a new secretary general . turkey rejects frontrunner anders fogh rasmussen of denmark for his position in the mohammed caricature row . germany and france dislike second choice radek sikorski , poland 's foreign minister , for his anti-russia stance . author : uwe hessler editor : susan houlton / sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his first task will be to get beyond the company 's ongoing spying scandal . germany 's transport ministry on thursday endorsed fifty-seven year-old ruediger grube , a top executive at carmaker daimler , as the new head of the state-owned railway operator , deutsche bahn .
the ministry said chancellor angela merkel and key government officials had agreed wednesday evening on grube for the hot-seat , replacing hartmut mehdorn , 66 , who tendered his resignation this week after deutsche bahn admitted to the illicit surveillance of its employees .
mehdorn resigned on monday after being unable to end discussions on whether the company spied on employees ' emails from 2005 to 2008 and blocked messages from unions during a 2007 labor dispute .
grube is currently responsible for company strategy at automaker daimler .
he is also on the board of directors at european aircraft manufacturer eads .
grube has close ties to mehdorn himself , having served as his office manager at another company - and the possibility grube could become the successor to his former boss drew immediate protest from the opposition green party .
" this is not a new beginning , mrs. merkel , " green parliamentary leader renate kuenast told news agency reporters .
" with mehdorn 's former assistant , there 's the threat of more of the same . "
the deutsche bahn in general - and mehdorn himself - are currently under investigation in relation to the spying allegations .
leading politicians and labor unions have called for thorough scrutiny into deutsche bahn 's allegedly comprehensive surveillance of its own employees .
troubleshooter ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accusations over employee surveillance are casting a shadow over deutsche bahn but beyond being an associate of mehdorn , who is ruediger grube ?
born in the northern german city of hamburg , his career began with an apprenticeship in airplane construction .
in the late 1980s and early 1990s , he began working for daimler 's aeronautics division as well as for airbus - now an eads subsidiary .
he has been on daimler 's board of directors since 2001 and a top eads executive for the past year and a half .
grube 's background has drawn criticism from people hoping someone with a background in the rail industry would take over deutsche bahn .

his first task will be to get beyond the company 's ongoing spying scandal . germany 's transport ministry on thursday endorsed fifty-seven year-old ruediger grube , a top executive at carmaker daimler , as the new head of the state-owned railway operator , deutsche bahn .
the ministry said chancellor angela merkel and key government officials had agreed wednesday evening on grube for the hot-seat , replacing hartmut mehdorn , 66 , who tendered his resignation this week after deutsche bahn admitted to the illicit surveillance of its employees .
mehdorn resigned on monday after being unable to end discussions on whether the company spied on employees ' emails from 2005 to 2008 and blocked messages from unions during a 2007 labor dispute .
grube is currently responsible for company strategy at automaker daimler .
he is also on the board of directors at european aircraft manufacturer eads .
grube has close ties to mehdorn himself , having served as his office manager at another company - and the possibility grube could become the successor to his former boss drew immediate protest from the opposition green party .
" this is not a new beginning , mrs. merkel , " green parliamentary leader renate kuenast told news agency reporters .
" with mehdorn 's former assistant , there 's the threat of more of the same . "
the deutsche bahn in general - and mehdorn himself - are currently under investigation in relation to the spying allegations .
leading politicians and labor unions have called for thorough scrutiny into deutsche bahn 's allegedly comprehensive surveillance of its own employees .

his first task will be to get beyond the company 's ongoing spying scandal . germany 's transport ministry on thursday endorsed fifty-seven year-old ruediger grube , a top executive at carmaker daimler , as the new head of the state-owned railway operator , deutsche bahn .
the ministry said chancellor angela merkel and key government officials had agreed wednesday evening on grube for the hot-seat , replacing hartmut mehdorn , 66 , who tendered his resignation this week after deutsche bahn admitted to the illicit surveillance of its employees .
mehdorn resigned on monday after being unable to end discussions on whether the company spied on employees ' emails from 2005 to 2008 and blocked messages from unions during a 2007 labor dispute .
grube is currently responsible for company strategy at automaker daimler .
he is also on the board of directors at european aircraft manufacturer eads .
grube has close ties to mehdorn himself , having served as his office manager at another company - and the possibility grube could become the successor to his former boss drew immediate protest from the opposition green party .
" this is not a new beginning , mrs. merkel , " green parliamentary leader renate kuenast told news agency reporters .
" with mehdorn 's former assistant , there 's the threat of more of the same . "
the deutsche bahn in general - and mehdorn himself - are currently under investigation in relation to the spying allegations .
leading politicians and labor unions have called for thorough scrutiny into deutsche bahn 's allegedly comprehensive surveillance of its own employees .
troubleshooter ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accusations over employee surveillance are casting a shadow over deutsche bahn but beyond being an associate of mehdorn , who is ruediger grube ?
born in the northern german city of hamburg , his career began with an apprenticeship in airplane construction .
in the late 1980s and early 1990s , he began working for daimler 's aeronautics division as well as for airbus - now an eads subsidiary .
he has been on daimler 's board of directors since 2001 and a top eads executive for the past year and a half .
grube 's background has drawn criticism from people hoping someone with a background in the rail industry would take over deutsche bahn .
" after ten years of mehdorn , there 's no need for another would-be high-flyer from the aeronautics sector , " kuenast told reporters .
there has been no word on when grube will be put forward as mehdorn 's successor. nrt / jc / sh -lrb- ap / dpa / rtr / afp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 03.04.2009 german-french brigade hopes to move beyond showcase status großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two countries , one mission : the insignia of the franco-german brigade france is marking its return to the alliance 's military command at nato anniversary celebrations .
but the once independent french military already cooperates with nato members .
one example : the german-french brigade . the photos of former german chancellor helmut kohl , former french president francois mitterrand and countless defense ministers from germany and france in the brigade 's headquarters in muellheim are the proof : politicians enjoy coming to this town in the southern corner of germany that meets france and switzerland . what french and german soldiers do here is still unique in europe , even 20 years after the establishment of the german-french brigade .
europe 's only bi-national unit is made up of some 5,000 soldiers from germany and france .
when the project was conceived in 1989 by kohl and mitterrand , there was nothing else like it .
one unit , two nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl -lrb- left -rrb- and mitterand were among the many visitors to muellheim the difficulties from those days , such as language problems , are still big challenges for the unit 's current commander , gen. andreas berg . as foresighted as the brigade may be in terms of providing the basis for a future european army , language issues never seem to go away .
just look at barracks security .
the german-french security crew at the gate can often only communicate with sign language , because the german does n't speak any french , and his french comrade does n't speak german .
the troops are actually meant to be able to work in two foreign languages , with english being the lingua franca in international matters of business . for 20 years now , the troops have been practicing their cooperation , but in that time , the soldiers have only twice been sent abroad together : to bosnia-herzegovina and afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marching in unison 's no problem , but talking can be only when the ministries of defense in berlin and paris agree on a mission does the brigade get the green light .
these joint operations are now so far in the past that most of the soldiers who participated in them have since moved on to other posts . this makes veterans in muellheim , such as the french sgt. maj. robert lenhardt , impatient .
lenhardt said it bothers him that the brigade is always presented as a showcase project at official events .
in reality , he said , it 's politics that prevent more action . " we can sleep in the same barracks and eat in the same canteen , no problem , " he said .
" but anyone can do that ; just go on vacation in the summertime .
we 're soldiers and we 're there for a certain purpose , and we never get to put it to the test . " waiting for a common mission unlike many of his colleagues , lenhardt moves easily in the german-french environment .
such " bridge builders " in the brigade are often found among the unit 's management .
there , bilateral cooperation is a matter of course , because at higher levels , there are no language difficulties .
the average soldier , on the other hand , typically only sees his colleagues from the neighboring country at meals or while playing sports . soon , the brigade will also have a location in france .
french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel plan to permanently station around 700 bundeswehr soldiers in alsace .
many in muellheim hope that the location in strasbourg will be a further symbolic step forward that will give the brigade new momentum . author : andreas noll -lrb- dc -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

part one of dw-world 's nato retrospective looks at the years 1949 to 1989 . washington , april 4 , 1949 .
in a celebratory atmosphere , the foreign ministers of 12 north american and european countries signed the founding documents of the north atlantic treaty organization , or nato .
even if world war ii was still fresh in the minds of those involved , nato 's biggest enemy was n't demilitarized germany , but the soviet union .
for western europe , there was no alternative to this alliance with the united states , said former british foreign secretary ernest bevin in a radio broadcast .
“ what were peace- and freedom-loving nations to do ? ” he asked .
“ stand by and wait for one after the other to be destroyed ?
or build a system of collective security that would bind their people together in strong resistance against this threat ?
we decided in favor of this second way . ”
the nato community bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato saw itself as a group with common values central to the treaty is article 5 , which outlines the principle of collective defense .
the article says that an attack on any member shall be considered to be an attack on all .
how exactly the members contribute to the defense of the member under attack is left up to the discretion of the member states .
from its inception , nato saw itself as a community bound by common values .
despite this , non-democratic states were admitted to the fold , and not just for strategic reasons , according to the german military expert , franz-josef meiers .
“ inwardly , values play a very important role , ” he said .
“ membership was supposed to fast-track the democratization process in countries such as spain or greece . ”
germany was a special case .
though it was destroyed in the war and demilitarized , it was nonetheless indispensable to nato because of its long-term strategic value .
on may 9 , 1955 , former german chancellor konrad adenauer arrived in paris to sign the membership declaration for his country .
hans speidel , who would later serve as nato commander during the cold war before his death in 1984 , was once asked to describe the moment . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the once independent french military already cooperates with nato members .
one example : the german-french brigade . the photos of former german chancellor helmut kohl , former french president francois mitterrand and countless defense ministers from germany and france in the brigade 's headquarters in muellheim are the proof : politicians enjoy coming to this town in the southern corner of germany that meets france and switzerland . what french and german soldiers do here is still unique in europe , even 20 years after the establishment of the german-french brigade .
europe 's only bi-national unit is made up of some 5,000 soldiers from germany and france .
when the project was conceived in 1989 by kohl and mitterrand , there was nothing else like it .
one unit , two nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl -lrb- left -rrb- and mitterand were among the many visitors to muellheim the difficulties from those days , such as language problems , are still big challenges for the unit 's current commander , gen. andreas berg . as foresighted as the brigade may be in terms of providing the basis for a future european army , language issues never seem to go away .
just look at barracks security .
the german-french security crew at the gate can often only communicate with sign language , because the german does n't speak any french , and his french comrade does n't speak german .
the troops are actually meant to be able to work in two foreign languages , with english being the lingua franca in international matters of business . for 20 years now , the troops have been practicing their cooperation , but in that time , the soldiers have only twice been sent abroad together : to bosnia-herzegovina and afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marching in unison 's no problem , but talking can be only when the ministries of defense in berlin and paris agree on a mission does the brigade get the green light .
these joint operations are now so far in the past that most of the soldiers who participated in them have since moved on to other posts . this makes veterans in muellheim , such as the french sgt. maj. robert lenhardt , impatient .
lenhardt said it bothers him that the brigade is always presented as a showcase project at official events .
in reality , he said , it 's politics that prevent more action . " we can sleep in the same barracks and eat in the same canteen , no problem , " he said .
" but anyone can do that ; just go on vacation in the summertime .
we 're soldiers and we 're there for a certain purpose , and we never get to put it to the test . " waiting for a common mission unlike many of his colleagues , lenhardt moves easily in the german-french environment .
such " bridge builders " in the brigade are often found among the unit 's management .
there , bilateral cooperation is a matter of course , because at higher levels , there are no language difficulties .
the average soldier , on the other hand , typically only sees his colleagues from the neighboring country at meals or while playing sports . soon , the brigade will also have a location in france .
french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel plan to permanently station around 700 bundeswehr soldiers in alsace .
many in muellheim hope that the location in strasbourg will be a further symbolic step forward that will give the brigade new momentum . author : andreas noll -lrb- dc -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

another 600 soldiers are to be deployed to safeguard afghan elections this summer and will contribute to the training program for afghan security forces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil reconstruction is important to stabilizing afghanistan german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier says that berlin 's strategy of a military-backed reconstruction effort should be emulated by other nato partners . " stabilizing afghanistan can only be achieved if the country becomes economically viable , " he says . berlin has also welcomed a shift in washington ’ s afghanistan policy . us president barack obama recently announced that he wants to speed up civil reconstruction in addition to sending further 17,000 troops to fight the resurgent taliban . reaching out to russia following talks with russian president dmitry medvedev in berlin on tuesday , merkel said that mutual trust needed to be rebuilt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants closer ties with russia ties between nato and russia are strained after spats over nato ’ s eastward expansion and american plans to station missiles and a radar base as part of an anti-missile shield in eastern europe . in attempts to help the creation of a strategic partnership with moscow , merkel has called on the former soviet satellite states in eastern europe to bury the hatchet with russia as germany has done . " germany and russia stopped being enemies 20 years ago , " she told parliamentarians .
" one should recognize once and for all that the cold war is over . " row erupts over new leader divisions within nato concerning russia are also reflected by an ongoing rift over the alliance ’ s internal decision-making structure . berlin believes that continued reliance on consensus could become a recipe for paralysis . internal bickering has erupted notably in the current search for a new secretary general . turkey rejects frontrunner anders fogh rasmussen of denmark for his position in the mohammed caricature row . germany and france dislike second choice radek sikorski , poland 's foreign minister , for his anti-russia stance . author : uwe hessler editor : susan houlton / sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his first task will be to get beyond the company 's ongoing spying scandal . germany 's transport ministry on thursday endorsed fifty-seven year-old ruediger grube , a top executive at carmaker daimler , as the new head of the state-owned railway operator , deutsche bahn .
the ministry said chancellor angela merkel and key government officials had agreed wednesday evening on grube for the hot-seat , replacing hartmut mehdorn , 66 , who tendered his resignation this week after deutsche bahn admitted to the illicit surveillance of its employees .
mehdorn resigned on monday after being unable to end discussions on whether the company spied on employees ' emails from 2005 to 2008 and blocked messages from unions during a 2007 labor dispute .
grube is currently responsible for company strategy at automaker daimler .

his first task will be to get beyond the company 's ongoing spying scandal . germany 's transport ministry on thursday endorsed fifty-seven year-old ruediger grube , a top executive at carmaker daimler , as the new head of the state-owned railway operator , deutsche bahn .
the ministry said chancellor angela merkel and key government officials had agreed wednesday evening on grube for the hot-seat , replacing hartmut mehdorn , 66 , who tendered his resignation this week after deutsche bahn admitted to the illicit surveillance of its employees .
mehdorn resigned on monday after being unable to end discussions on whether the company spied on employees ' emails from 2005 to 2008 and blocked messages from unions during a 2007 labor dispute .
grube is currently responsible for company strategy at automaker daimler .
he is also on the board of directors at european aircraft manufacturer eads .
grube has close ties to mehdorn himself , having served as his office manager at another company - and the possibility grube could become the successor to his former boss drew immediate protest from the opposition green party .
" this is not a new beginning , mrs. merkel , " green parliamentary leader renate kuenast told news agency reporters .
" with mehdorn 's former assistant , there 's the threat of more of the same . "
the deutsche bahn in general - and mehdorn himself - are currently under investigation in relation to the spying allegations .
leading politicians and labor unions have called for thorough scrutiny into deutsche bahn 's allegedly comprehensive surveillance of its own employees .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accusations over employee surveillance are casting a shadow over deutsche bahn but beyond being an associate of mehdorn , who is ruediger grube ?
born in the northern german city of hamburg , his career began with an apprenticeship in airplane construction .
in the late 1980s and early 1990s , he began working for daimler 's aeronautics division as well as for airbus - now an eads subsidiary .
he has been on daimler 's board of directors since 2001 and a top eads executive for the past year and a half .
grube 's background has drawn criticism from people hoping someone with a background in the rail industry would take over deutsche bahn .
" after ten years of mehdorn , there 's no need for another would-be high-flyer from the aeronautics sector , " kuenast told reporters .

part one of dw-world 's nato retrospective looks at the years 1949 to 1989 . washington , april 4 , 1949 .
in a celebratory atmosphere , the foreign ministers of 12 north american and european countries signed the founding documents of the north atlantic treaty organization , or nato .
even if world war ii was still fresh in the minds of those involved , nato 's biggest enemy was n't demilitarized germany , but the soviet union .
for western europe , there was no alternative to this alliance with the united states , said former british foreign secretary ernest bevin in a radio broadcast .
“ what were peace- and freedom-loving nations to do ? ” he asked .
“ stand by and wait for one after the other to be destroyed ?
or build a system of collective security that would bind their people together in strong resistance against this threat ?
we decided in favor of this second way . ”
the nato community bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato saw itself as a group with common values central to the treaty is article 5 , which outlines the principle of collective defense .
the article says that an attack on any member shall be considered to be an attack on all .
how exactly the members contribute to the defense of the member under attack is left up to the discretion of the member states .
from its inception , nato saw itself as a community bound by common values .
despite this , non-democratic states were admitted to the fold , and not just for strategic reasons , according to the german military expert , franz-josef meiers .
“ inwardly , values play a very important role , ” he said .
“ membership was supposed to fast-track the democratization process in countries such as spain or greece . ”
germany was a special case .
though it was destroyed in the war and demilitarized , it was nonetheless indispensable to nato because of its long-term strategic value .
on may 9 , 1955 , former german chancellor konrad adenauer arrived in paris to sign the membership declaration for his country .
hans speidel , who would later serve as nato commander during the cold war before his death in 1984 , was once asked to describe the moment . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his first task will be to get beyond the company 's ongoing spying scandal . germany 's transport ministry on thursday endorsed fifty-seven year-old ruediger grube , a top executive at carmaker daimler , as the new head of the state-owned railway operator , deutsche bahn .
the ministry said chancellor angela merkel and key government officials had agreed wednesday evening on grube for the hot-seat , replacing hartmut mehdorn , 66 , who tendered his resignation this week after deutsche bahn admitted to the illicit surveillance of its employees .
mehdorn resigned on monday after being unable to end discussions on whether the company spied on employees ' emails from 2005 to 2008 and blocked messages from unions during a 2007 labor dispute .
grube is currently responsible for company strategy at automaker daimler .
he is also on the board of directors at european aircraft manufacturer eads .
grube has close ties to mehdorn himself , having served as his office manager at another company - and the possibility grube could become the successor to his former boss drew immediate protest from the opposition green party .
" this is not a new beginning , mrs. merkel , " green parliamentary leader renate kuenast told news agency reporters .
" with mehdorn 's former assistant , there 's the threat of more of the same . "
the deutsche bahn in general - and mehdorn himself - are currently under investigation in relation to the spying allegations .
leading politicians and labor unions have called for thorough scrutiny into deutsche bahn 's allegedly comprehensive surveillance of its own employees .

but the once independent french military already cooperates with nato members .
one example : the german-french brigade . the photos of former german chancellor helmut kohl , former french president francois mitterrand and countless defense ministers from germany and france in the brigade 's headquarters in muellheim are the proof : politicians enjoy coming to this town in the southern corner of germany that meets france and switzerland . what french and german soldiers do here is still unique in europe , even 20 years after the establishment of the german-french brigade .
europe 's only bi-national unit is made up of some 5,000 soldiers from germany and france .
when the project was conceived in 1989 by kohl and mitterrand , there was nothing else like it .
one unit , two nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl -lrb- left -rrb- and mitterand were among the many visitors to muellheim the difficulties from those days , such as language problems , are still big challenges for the unit 's current commander , gen. andreas berg . as foresighted as the brigade may be in terms of providing the basis for a future european army , language issues never seem to go away .
just look at barracks security .
the german-french security crew at the gate can often only communicate with sign language , because the german does n't speak any french , and his french comrade does n't speak german .
the troops are actually meant to be able to work in two foreign languages , with english being the lingua franca in international matters of business . for 20 years now , the troops have been practicing their cooperation , but in that time , the soldiers have only twice been sent abroad together : to bosnia-herzegovina and afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marching in unison 's no problem , but talking can be only when the ministries of defense in berlin and paris agree on a mission does the brigade get the green light .
these joint operations are now so far in the past that most of the soldiers who participated in them have since moved on to other posts . this makes veterans in muellheim , such as the french sgt. maj. robert lenhardt , impatient .
lenhardt said it bothers him that the brigade is always presented as a showcase project at official events .
in reality , he said , it 's politics that prevent more action . " we can sleep in the same barracks and eat in the same canteen , no problem , " he said .
" but anyone can do that ; just go on vacation in the summertime .
we 're soldiers and we 're there for a certain purpose , and we never get to put it to the test . " waiting for a common mission unlike many of his colleagues , lenhardt moves easily in the german-french environment .
such " bridge builders " in the brigade are often found among the unit 's management .
there , bilateral cooperation is a matter of course , because at higher levels , there are no language difficulties .
the average soldier , on the other hand , typically only sees his colleagues from the neighboring country at meals or while playing sports . soon , the brigade will also have a location in france .
french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel plan to permanently station around 700 bundeswehr soldiers in alsace .
many in muellheim hope that the location in strasbourg will be a further symbolic step forward that will give the brigade new momentum . author : andreas noll -lrb- dc -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the troops are actually meant to be able to work in two foreign languages , with english being the lingua franca in international matters of business . for 20 years now , the troops have been practicing their cooperation , but in that time , the soldiers have only twice been sent abroad together : to bosnia-herzegovina and afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marching in unison 's no problem , but talking can be only when the ministries of defense in berlin and paris agree on a mission does the brigade get the green light .
these joint operations are now so far in the past that most of the soldiers who participated in them have since moved on to other posts . this makes veterans in muellheim , such as the french sgt. maj. robert lenhardt , impatient .
lenhardt said it bothers him that the brigade is always presented as a showcase project at official events .
in reality , he said , it 's politics that prevent more action . " we can sleep in the same barracks and eat in the same canteen , no problem , " he said .
" but anyone can do that ; just go on vacation in the summertime .
we 're soldiers and we 're there for a certain purpose , and we never get to put it to the test . " waiting for a common mission unlike many of his colleagues , lenhardt moves easily in the german-french environment .
such " bridge builders " in the brigade are often found among the unit 's management .
there , bilateral cooperation is a matter of course , because at higher levels , there are no language difficulties .
the average soldier , on the other hand , typically only sees his colleagues from the neighboring country at meals or while playing sports . soon , the brigade will also have a location in france .
french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel plan to permanently station around 700 bundeswehr soldiers in alsace .
many in muellheim hope that the location in strasbourg will be a further symbolic step forward that will give the brigade new momentum . author : andreas noll -lrb- dc -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his first task will be to get beyond the company 's ongoing spying scandal . germany 's transport ministry on thursday endorsed fifty-seven year-old ruediger grube , a top executive at carmaker daimler , as the new head of the state-owned railway operator , deutsche bahn .
the ministry said chancellor angela merkel and key government officials had agreed wednesday evening on grube for the hot-seat , replacing hartmut mehdorn , 66 , who tendered his resignation this week after deutsche bahn admitted to the illicit surveillance of its employees .
mehdorn resigned on monday after being unable to end discussions on whether the company spied on employees ' emails from 2005 to 2008 and blocked messages from unions during a 2007 labor dispute .
grube is currently responsible for company strategy at automaker daimler .
he is also on the board of directors at european aircraft manufacturer eads .
grube has close ties to mehdorn himself , having served as his office manager at another company - and the possibility grube could become the successor to his former boss drew immediate protest from the opposition green party .
" this is not a new beginning , mrs. merkel , " green parliamentary leader renate kuenast told news agency reporters .
" with mehdorn 's former assistant , there 's the threat of more of the same . "
the deutsche bahn in general - and mehdorn himself - are currently under investigation in relation to the spying allegations .
leading politicians and labor unions have called for thorough scrutiny into deutsche bahn 's allegedly comprehensive surveillance of its own employees .

born in the northern german city of hamburg , his career began with an apprenticeship in airplane construction .
in the late 1980s and early 1990s , he began working for daimler 's aeronautics division as well as for airbus - now an eads subsidiary .
he has been on daimler 's board of directors since 2001 and a top eads executive for the past year and a half .
grube 's background has drawn criticism from people hoping someone with a background in the rail industry would take over deutsche bahn .
" after ten years of mehdorn , there 's no need for another would-be high-flyer from the aeronautics sector , " kuenast told reporters .
there has been no word on when grube will be put forward as mehdorn 's successor. nrt / jc / sh -lrb- ap / dpa / rtr / afp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 03.04.2009 german-french brigade hopes to move beyond showcase status großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two countries , one mission : the insignia of the franco-german brigade france is marking its return to the alliance 's military command at nato anniversary celebrations .
but the once independent french military already cooperates with nato members .
one example : the german-french brigade . the photos of former german chancellor helmut kohl , former french president francois mitterrand and countless defense ministers from germany and france in the brigade 's headquarters in muellheim are the proof : politicians enjoy coming to this town in the southern corner of germany that meets france and switzerland . what french and german soldiers do here is still unique in europe , even 20 years after the establishment of the german-french brigade .
europe 's only bi-national unit is made up of some 5,000 soldiers from germany and france .
when the project was conceived in 1989 by kohl and mitterrand , there was nothing else like it .
one unit , two nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl -lrb- left -rrb- and mitterand were among the many visitors to muellheim the difficulties from those days , such as language problems , are still big challenges for the unit 's current commander , gen. andreas berg . as foresighted as the brigade may be in terms of providing the basis for a future european army , language issues never seem to go away .
just look at barracks security .
the german-french security crew at the gate can often only communicate with sign language , because the german does n't speak any french , and his french comrade does n't speak german .
the troops are actually meant to be able to work in two foreign languages , with english being the lingua franca in international matters of business . for 20 years now , the troops have been practicing their cooperation , but in that time , the soldiers have only twice been sent abroad together : to bosnia-herzegovina and afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marching in unison 's no problem , but talking can be only when the ministries of defense in berlin and paris agree on a mission does the brigade get the green light .
these joint operations are now so far in the past that most of the soldiers who participated in them have since moved on to other posts . this makes veterans in muellheim , such as the french sgt. maj. robert lenhardt , impatient .
lenhardt said it bothers him that the brigade is always presented as a showcase project at official events .
in reality , he said , it 's politics that prevent more action . " we can sleep in the same barracks and eat in the same canteen , no problem , " he said .
" but anyone can do that ; just go on vacation in the summertime .
we 're soldiers and we 're there for a certain purpose , and we never get to put it to the test . " waiting for a common mission unlike many of his colleagues , lenhardt moves easily in the german-french environment .
such " bridge builders " in the brigade are often found among the unit 's management .
there , bilateral cooperation is a matter of course , because at higher levels , there are no language difficulties .
the average soldier , on the other hand , typically only sees his colleagues from the neighboring country at meals or while playing sports . soon , the brigade will also have a location in france .
french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel plan to permanently station around 700 bundeswehr soldiers in alsace .
many in muellheim hope that the location in strasbourg will be a further symbolic step forward that will give the brigade new momentum . author : andreas noll -lrb- dc -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nato 's partnership with russia must be rebuilt and civil reconstruction in afghanistan strengthened . the german chancellor said she believes nato must adapt to new global challenges such as terrorism and energy security as well as building new partnerships in a post-cold war world . ahead of friday 's nato anniversary summit in germany and france , merkel said the 28-member alliance must not nostalgically look back at its history , but look to the future . " at this summit nato must start revising its strategic concept , " merkel said in a speech at the german parliament in late march . the german government has said nato efforts to advance security and stability in afghanistan have become the litmus test of the alliance 's effectiveness . germany currently has about 3,500 troops based in the relatively peaceful northern region of afghanistan .

" germany and russia stopped being enemies 20 years ago , " she told parliamentarians .
" one should recognize once and for all that the cold war is over . " row erupts over new leader divisions within nato concerning russia are also reflected by an ongoing rift over the alliance ’ s internal decision-making structure . berlin believes that continued reliance on consensus could become a recipe for paralysis . internal bickering has erupted notably in the current search for a new secretary general . turkey rejects frontrunner anders fogh rasmussen of denmark for his position in the mohammed caricature row . germany and france dislike second choice radek sikorski , poland 's foreign minister , for his anti-russia stance . author : uwe hessler editor : susan houlton / sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nato 's partnership with russia must be rebuilt and civil reconstruction in afghanistan strengthened . the german chancellor said she believes nato must adapt to new global challenges such as terrorism and energy security as well as building new partnerships in a post-cold war world . ahead of friday 's nato anniversary summit in germany and france , merkel said the 28-member alliance must not nostalgically look back at its history , but look to the future . " at this summit nato must start revising its strategic concept , " merkel said in a speech at the german parliament in late march . the german government has said nato efforts to advance security and stability in afghanistan have become the litmus test of the alliance 's effectiveness . germany currently has about 3,500 troops based in the relatively peaceful northern region of afghanistan .
another 600 soldiers are to be deployed to safeguard afghan elections this summer and will contribute to the training program for afghan security forces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil reconstruction is important to stabilizing afghanistan german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier says that berlin 's strategy of a military-backed reconstruction effort should be emulated by other nato partners . " stabilizing afghanistan can only be achieved if the country becomes economically viable , " he says . berlin has also welcomed a shift in washington ’ s afghanistan policy . us president barack obama recently announced that he wants to speed up civil reconstruction in addition to sending further 17,000 troops to fight the resurgent taliban . reaching out to russia following talks with russian president dmitry medvedev in berlin on tuesday , merkel said that mutual trust needed to be rebuilt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants closer ties with russia ties between nato and russia are strained after spats over nato ’ s eastward expansion and american plans to station missiles and a radar base as part of an anti-missile shield in eastern europe . in attempts to help the creation of a strategic partnership with moscow , merkel has called on the former soviet satellite states in eastern europe to bury the hatchet with russia as germany has done . " germany and russia stopped being enemies 20 years ago , " she told parliamentarians .
" one should recognize once and for all that the cold war is over . " row erupts over new leader divisions within nato concerning russia are also reflected by an ongoing rift over the alliance ’ s internal decision-making structure . berlin believes that continued reliance on consensus could become a recipe for paralysis . internal bickering has erupted notably in the current search for a new secretary general . turkey rejects frontrunner anders fogh rasmussen of denmark for his position in the mohammed caricature row . germany and france dislike second choice radek sikorski , poland 's foreign minister , for his anti-russia stance . author : uwe hessler editor : susan houlton / sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the approval , which follows similar action by the lower house 11 days ago , comes after the government took an 8.7 percent stake in the shaky lender as a first step in gaining full control .

in return for the funds it has put into the bank , the german government wants to take full control in order to ensure that shareholders can not block restructuring measures .

he also found time to soak up adoration from the crowds . united states president barack obama has tried to assuage german concerns that washington will use this weekend 's nato summit to press berlin for more troops to secure afghanistan .
" i do n't come bearing grand designs , " obama said at a joint press conference with chancellor angela merkel in the western german town of baden-baden on friday .
the deteriorating situation in afghanistan was expected to be one of the main topics at nato 's 60th anniversary meeting , held symbolically in the french city of strasbourg and the german towns of baden-baden and kehl .
speaking ahead of the meeting , obama said he was " here to listen , to share ideas , and jointly - as one of many nato allies - to help shape our vision for the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato talks will focus on afghanistan security obama described germany as an exemplary ally in afghanistan , which has suffered increasing violence since the us-led invasion of 2001 .
merkel noted that germany , which currently has over 3,500 troops deployed in the country 's north , had a " huge responsibility " and would " face up to this responsibility in military terms as well . "
however , obama also held the door open for us demands from european partners in comments that signaled washington 's resolve to change strategy .
" we will all now have to make additional and sustainable efforts to succeed ...
our role is not to occupy afghanistan , " but to prevent it from becoming a safe-haven for terrorists , " the us leader said .
" if we discover that the approach we are taking is not effective , it 's not working , then we will change it . "
germany has balked at sending more troops to afghanistan , where the nato-led international security assistance force is struggling to contain an escalating taliban insurgency while reconstructing the country .
however , merkel said she " welcomed " the us plans to change its strategy there .
nato politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey does n't want rasmussen as nato head on a separate issue likely to plague nato leaders , merkel said the western military alliance should choose its next leader this friday .
" i am convinced we should name a new secretary-general tonight , " merkel said , adding that danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen would make an " excellent choice . "
rasmussen 's nomination has angered the north atlantic treaty organization 's only islamic member-state , turkey .
ankara regards the danish premier as one of turkey 's principle detractors in the european union .
obama 's star appeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama held a town-hall style meeting in france obama 's brief meeting with merkel was preceded by talks with french president nicolas sarkozy in strasbourg .
in both countries he was accompanied by cheering crowds , confirming the us leader 's superstar status in europe .
smiling and visibly touched as he walked through the french city , obama greeted spectators with handshakes and calls of " nice to see you " and " it 's good to be here . "
at one point , he even leaned into the crowd to kiss a young woman .
the latest bi-monthly tracking poll , conducted by the german public broadcast network ard -lrb- of which deutsche welle is a member -rrb- , found that 82 percent of germans were looking forward to obama 's visit this week , and just over three-quarters said they wished germany could produce a politician like him .
in a vote of confidence that german politicians could only dream of , four out of five germans said they were pleased with obama 's performance in his first two months in office , and nearly nine out of ten said that obama had set the us back on the right track. nw / sh / dpa / rtr / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 03.04.2009 germans positive about nato leaders , dislike afghanistan mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel will have to consider conflicting german opinions on nato an influential survey finds that germans support nato , and hold france and especially new us president barack obama in high esteem .
but they ’ re still skeptical on keeping troops in afghanistan . germans remain impressed with barack obama , think france is their most trustworthy partner among nations , and support nato – but not their country 's participation in the alliance 's afghan military mission .
that 's according to the new deutschlandtrend survey , a bi-monthly poll that tracks german opinions on newsworthy topics conducted by the public broadcast network ard -lrb- of which deutsche welle is a member -rrb- .
a robust 84 percent of germans believe nato is important as an instrument of keeping stability and peace within europe .
and 61 percent think nato should keep looking after afghanistan .
but just 32 percent want to keep german troops in that country , a full ten percent less than the month before .
as croatia and slovenia prepare for their initiation into nato this week , germans said they were wary of expanding nato further .
only 36 percent agreed to the proposition that nato should take on additional members from eastern europe and the balkans .
if these views seem to be at odds with the policy aims of the united states , who would like to see an expanded european military role in afghanistan and a bigger nato , that has not soured germans on the new us president barack obama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is excited to greet barack obama four out of five germans are pleased with the performance of obama in his first two months in office , and nearly nine out of ten said that obama had set the us back on the right track .
82 percent were looking forward to obama 's visit to germany this week for the nato summit , and just over three-quarters said they wished germany could produce a politician like him .
the obama effect may have helped the us out in the survey 's question about which countries germans consider to be trusted partners .
78 percent said they saw the us as such , continuing an upward trend since george w. bush 's team left office .
the country that led the list , however , was france .
87 percent of germans say their western neighbor is a trusted partner , up just slightly from the previous month .
germany and france are co-hosting this weekend 's nato summit , and have forged a very close relationship in economic policy-setting in recent months .
german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy presented a forceful , united front in the run-up to this week 's g20 summit , and achieved most of their goals to tighten international financial regulation .
however , when germans were asked who they thought was most likely to come up with a solution to getting out of the global economic crisis , they went back to their first love : barack obama .
80 percent of germans thought he was likely to devise an effective plan , compared with 58 percent for angela merkel , 55 percent for the european union , and 49 percent for social democratic challenger for the chancellorship in this autumn 's general election , frank-walter steinmeier .
the survey was conducted on the 30th and 31st of march , polled 1000 germans , and has a margin of error of 1.4-3.1 percent . mh / rg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

he also found time to soak up adoration from the crowds . united states president barack obama has tried to assuage german concerns that washington will use this weekend 's nato summit to press berlin for more troops to secure afghanistan .
" i do n't come bearing grand designs , " obama said at a joint press conference with chancellor angela merkel in the western german town of baden-baden on friday .
the deteriorating situation in afghanistan was expected to be one of the main topics at nato 's 60th anniversary meeting , held symbolically in the french city of strasbourg and the german towns of baden-baden and kehl .
speaking ahead of the meeting , obama said he was " here to listen , to share ideas , and jointly - as one of many nato allies - to help shape our vision for the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato talks will focus on afghanistan security obama described germany as an exemplary ally in afghanistan , which has suffered increasing violence since the us-led invasion of 2001 .
merkel noted that germany , which currently has over 3,500 troops deployed in the country 's north , had a " huge responsibility " and would " face up to this responsibility in military terms as well . "
however , obama also held the door open for us demands from european partners in comments that signaled washington 's resolve to change strategy .
" we will all now have to make additional and sustainable efforts to succeed ...
our role is not to occupy afghanistan , " but to prevent it from becoming a safe-haven for terrorists , " the us leader said .
" if we discover that the approach we are taking is not effective , it 's not working , then we will change it . "
germany has balked at sending more troops to afghanistan , where the nato-led international security assistance force is struggling to contain an escalating taliban insurgency while reconstructing the country .
however , merkel said she " welcomed " the us plans to change its strategy there .
nato politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey does n't want rasmussen as nato head on a separate issue likely to plague nato leaders , merkel said the western military alliance should choose its next leader this friday .
" i am convinced we should name a new secretary-general tonight , " merkel said , adding that danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen would make an " excellent choice . "
rasmussen 's nomination has angered the north atlantic treaty organization 's only islamic member-state , turkey .
ankara regards the danish premier as one of turkey 's principle detractors in the european union .
obama 's star appeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama held a town-hall style meeting in france obama 's brief meeting with merkel was preceded by talks with french president nicolas sarkozy in strasbourg .
in both countries he was accompanied by cheering crowds , confirming the us leader 's superstar status in europe .
smiling and visibly touched as he walked through the french city , obama greeted spectators with handshakes and calls of " nice to see you " and " it 's good to be here . "
at one point , he even leaned into the crowd to kiss a young woman .
the latest bi-monthly tracking poll , conducted by the german public broadcast network ard -lrb- of which deutsche welle is a member -rrb- , found that 82 percent of germans were looking forward to obama 's visit this week , and just over three-quarters said they wished germany could produce a politician like him .
in a vote of confidence that german politicians could only dream of , four out of five germans said they were pleased with obama 's performance in his first two months in office , and nearly nine out of ten said that obama had set the us back on the right track. nw / sh / dpa / rtr / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nato 's partnership with russia must be rebuilt and civil reconstruction in afghanistan strengthened . the german chancellor said she believes nato must adapt to new global challenges such as terrorism and energy security as well as building new partnerships in a post-cold war world . ahead of friday 's nato anniversary summit in germany and france , merkel said the 28-member alliance must not nostalgically look back at its history , but look to the future . " at this summit nato must start revising its strategic concept , " merkel said in a speech at the german parliament in late march . the german government has said nato efforts to advance security and stability in afghanistan have become the litmus test of the alliance 's effectiveness . germany currently has about 3,500 troops based in the relatively peaceful northern region of afghanistan .
another 600 soldiers are to be deployed to safeguard afghan elections this summer and will contribute to the training program for afghan security forces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil reconstruction is important to stabilizing afghanistan german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier says that berlin 's strategy of a military-backed reconstruction effort should be emulated by other nato partners . " stabilizing afghanistan can only be achieved if the country becomes economically viable , " he says . berlin has also welcomed a shift in washington ’ s afghanistan policy . us president barack obama recently announced that he wants to speed up civil reconstruction in addition to sending further 17,000 troops to fight the resurgent taliban . reaching out to russia following talks with russian president dmitry medvedev in berlin on tuesday , merkel said that mutual trust needed to be rebuilt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants closer ties with russia ties between nato and russia are strained after spats over nato ’ s eastward expansion and american plans to station missiles and a radar base as part of an anti-missile shield in eastern europe . in attempts to help the creation of a strategic partnership with moscow , merkel has called on the former soviet satellite states in eastern europe to bury the hatchet with russia as germany has done . " germany and russia stopped being enemies 20 years ago , " she told parliamentarians .
" one should recognize once and for all that the cold war is over . " row erupts over new leader divisions within nato concerning russia are also reflected by an ongoing rift over the alliance ’ s internal decision-making structure . berlin believes that continued reliance on consensus could become a recipe for paralysis . internal bickering has erupted notably in the current search for a new secretary general . turkey rejects frontrunner anders fogh rasmussen of denmark for his position in the mohammed caricature row . germany and france dislike second choice radek sikorski , poland 's foreign minister , for his anti-russia stance . author : uwe hessler editor : susan houlton / sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if obama had hoped for more french troop commitments , he was to be disappointed . us president barack obama and his french counterpart nicolas sarkozy have held their first face-to face meeting in the french city of strasbourg , leading up to a cross-border nato summit .
at a joint press conference after their talks , obama said he wanted europe to improve its capabilities in nato as much as possible .
" we want strong allies .
we would like to see europe have much more robust defense capabilities , " he said .
obama praised the french president 's " courageous " leadership on afghanistan , and said that france , the united states ' oldest ally , had " once again taken an extraordinary leadership role in nato . "
president sarkozy welcomed obama at a red carpet reception on friday at strasbourg 's majestic palais de rohan , where a company of soldiers accorded him full military honors .
sarkozy stressed that while there would be no french military reinforcements in afghanistan , paris was enthusiastic about contributing more to police training and providing economic aid .

but they ’ re still skeptical on keeping troops in afghanistan . germans remain impressed with barack obama , think france is their most trustworthy partner among nations , and support nato – but not their country 's participation in the alliance 's afghan military mission .
that 's according to the new deutschlandtrend survey , a bi-monthly poll that tracks german opinions on newsworthy topics conducted by the public broadcast network ard -lrb- of which deutsche welle is a member -rrb- .
a robust 84 percent of germans believe nato is important as an instrument of keeping stability and peace within europe .
and 61 percent think nato should keep looking after afghanistan .
but just 32 percent want to keep german troops in that country , a full ten percent less than the month before .
as croatia and slovenia prepare for their initiation into nato this week , germans said they were wary of expanding nato further .
only 36 percent agreed to the proposition that nato should take on additional members from eastern europe and the balkans .
if these views seem to be at odds with the policy aims of the united states , who would like to see an expanded european military role in afghanistan and a bigger nato , that has not soured germans on the new us president barack obama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is excited to greet barack obama four out of five germans are pleased with the performance of obama in his first two months in office , and nearly nine out of ten said that obama had set the us back on the right track .
82 percent were looking forward to obama 's visit to germany this week for the nato summit , and just over three-quarters said they wished germany could produce a politician like him .
the obama effect may have helped the us out in the survey 's question about which countries germans consider to be trusted partners .
78 percent said they saw the us as such , continuing an upward trend since george w. bush 's team left office .
the country that led the list , however , was france .
87 percent of germans say their western neighbor is a trusted partner , up just slightly from the previous month .
germany and france are co-hosting this weekend 's nato summit , and have forged a very close relationship in economic policy-setting in recent months .
german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy presented a forceful , united front in the run-up to this week 's g20 summit , and achieved most of their goals to tighten international financial regulation .
however , when germans were asked who they thought was most likely to come up with a solution to getting out of the global economic crisis , they went back to their first love : barack obama .
80 percent of germans thought he was likely to devise an effective plan , compared with 58 percent for angela merkel , 55 percent for the european union , and 49 percent for social democratic challenger for the chancellorship in this autumn 's general election , frank-walter steinmeier .
the survey was conducted on the 30th and 31st of march , polled 1000 germans , and has a margin of error of 1.4-3.1 percent . mh / rg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the list was endorsed by the g20 leaders at their summit in london . " president hans-rudolf merz regrets this procedure , " the swiss finance ministry said in a statement late thursday , april 2 .
" the list does not specify the criteria on the basis of which it was drawn up .
switzerland is not a tax haven .
it always meets its obligations and is always ready to engage in dialogue . "
luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker was also indignant on friday , saying his country 's inclusion on the list was " incomprehensible . "
he reiterated his criticism of the way the lists were drawn up , remarking that several us states with tax-friendly laws were not put on either list while luxembourg was .
g20 approved three-tier list the " grey list " is one part of a three-tier list categorizing tax havens and financial centers by their degree of cooperation with internationally agreed tax standards set out by the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
the list was endorsed by the group of 20 leading industrialized and emerging nations at their summit in london after they pledged to take action including sanctions against non-cooperative jurisdictions , including tax havens , using information from the oecd as its basis .
the oecd has placed costa rica , malaysia , the philippines and uruguay on its blacklist of non-cooperative tax havens .
in addition to switzerland and luxembourg , austria , belgium , singapore , chile , the cayman islands , liechtenstein and monaco are included on the grey list of countries that have agreed to improve transparency standards but have not yet signed the necessary international accords .
china is on a third " white list " of jurisdictions that have substantially implemented the tax standards .
austrian finance minister josef proell downplayed his country 's inclusion on the grey list and said it did not affect the country 's banking secrecy laws .
" the talks are over for us because the proof is there on the grey list that we have taken steps in the right direction , " he told journalists as he arrived in prague for a meeting of euro zone finance ministers . dc / th , afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 03.04.2009 germans positive about nato leaders , dislike afghanistan mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel will have to consider conflicting german opinions on nato an influential survey finds that germans support nato , and hold france and especially new us president barack obama in high esteem .
but they ’ re still skeptical on keeping troops in afghanistan . germans remain impressed with barack obama , think france is their most trustworthy partner among nations , and support nato – but not their country 's participation in the alliance 's afghan military mission .
that 's according to the new deutschlandtrend survey , a bi-monthly poll that tracks german opinions on newsworthy topics conducted by the public broadcast network ard -lrb- of which deutsche welle is a member -rrb- .
a robust 84 percent of germans believe nato is important as an instrument of keeping stability and peace within europe .
and 61 percent think nato should keep looking after afghanistan .
but just 32 percent want to keep german troops in that country , a full ten percent less than the month before .
as croatia and slovenia prepare for their initiation into nato this week , germans said they were wary of expanding nato further .
only 36 percent agreed to the proposition that nato should take on additional members from eastern europe and the balkans .
if these views seem to be at odds with the policy aims of the united states , who would like to see an expanded european military role in afghanistan and a bigger nato , that has not soured germans on the new us president barack obama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is excited to greet barack obama four out of five germans are pleased with the performance of obama in his first two months in office , and nearly nine out of ten said that obama had set the us back on the right track .
82 percent were looking forward to obama 's visit to germany this week for the nato summit , and just over three-quarters said they wished germany could produce a politician like him .
the obama effect may have helped the us out in the survey 's question about which countries germans consider to be trusted partners .
78 percent said they saw the us as such , continuing an upward trend since george w. bush 's team left office .
the country that led the list , however , was france .
87 percent of germans say their western neighbor is a trusted partner , up just slightly from the previous month .
germany and france are co-hosting this weekend 's nato summit , and have forged a very close relationship in economic policy-setting in recent months .
german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy presented a forceful , united front in the run-up to this week 's g20 summit , and achieved most of their goals to tighten international financial regulation .
however , when germans were asked who they thought was most likely to come up with a solution to getting out of the global economic crisis , they went back to their first love : barack obama .
80 percent of germans thought he was likely to devise an effective plan , compared with 58 percent for angela merkel , 55 percent for the european union , and 49 percent for social democratic challenger for the chancellorship in this autumn 's general election , frank-walter steinmeier .
the survey was conducted on the 30th and 31st of march , polled 1000 germans , and has a margin of error of 1.4-3.1 percent . mh / rg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they ’ re still skeptical on keeping troops in afghanistan . germans remain impressed with barack obama , think france is their most trustworthy partner among nations , and support nato – but not their country 's participation in the alliance 's afghan military mission .
that 's according to the new deutschlandtrend survey , a bi-monthly poll that tracks german opinions on newsworthy topics conducted by the public broadcast network ard -lrb- of which deutsche welle is a member -rrb- .
a robust 84 percent of germans believe nato is important as an instrument of keeping stability and peace within europe .
and 61 percent think nato should keep looking after afghanistan .
but just 32 percent want to keep german troops in that country , a full ten percent less than the month before .
as croatia and slovenia prepare for their initiation into nato this week , germans said they were wary of expanding nato further .
only 36 percent agreed to the proposition that nato should take on additional members from eastern europe and the balkans .
if these views seem to be at odds with the policy aims of the united states , who would like to see an expanded european military role in afghanistan and a bigger nato , that has not soured germans on the new us president barack obama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is excited to greet barack obama four out of five germans are pleased with the performance of obama in his first two months in office , and nearly nine out of ten said that obama had set the us back on the right track .
82 percent were looking forward to obama 's visit to germany this week for the nato summit , and just over three-quarters said they wished germany could produce a politician like him .
the obama effect may have helped the us out in the survey 's question about which countries germans consider to be trusted partners .
78 percent said they saw the us as such , continuing an upward trend since george w. bush 's team left office .
the country that led the list , however , was france .
87 percent of germans say their western neighbor is a trusted partner , up just slightly from the previous month .
germany and france are co-hosting this weekend 's nato summit , and have forged a very close relationship in economic policy-setting in recent months .
german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy presented a forceful , united front in the run-up to this week 's g20 summit , and achieved most of their goals to tighten international financial regulation .
however , when germans were asked who they thought was most likely to come up with a solution to getting out of the global economic crisis , they went back to their first love : barack obama .
80 percent of germans thought he was likely to devise an effective plan , compared with 58 percent for angela merkel , 55 percent for the european union , and 49 percent for social democratic challenger for the chancellorship in this autumn 's general election , frank-walter steinmeier .
the survey was conducted on the 30th and 31st of march , polled 1000 germans , and has a margin of error of 1.4-3.1 percent . mh / rg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the approval , which follows similar action by the lower house 11 days ago , comes after the government took an 8.7 percent stake in the shaky lender as a first step in gaining full control .
the german government has given the munich-based bank 87 billion euros -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- in state guarantees since it got into difficulties in october 2008 .
the financial sector provided a further 15 billion euros .
nationalization deemed necessary hypo real estate chalked up a loss of 5.5 billion euros in 2008 , the biggest of any german firm .
experts have said that the bank will collapse without government intervention .
the law will expire by the end of june , meaning a takeover would have to be initiated before then .
in return for the funds it has put into the bank , the german government wants to take full control in order to ensure that shareholders can not block restructuring measures .
such a move has been opposed by us investor christopher flowers , who owns nearly 24 percent of the bank and feels a government stake of 75 percent plus one share would be sufficient .
flowers has lost 1 billion euros since he paid 22.5 euros per share for his stake at the start of the global financial crisis .
on friday , hypo real estate 's shares stood at 1.31 euros .
hypo real estate 's main business includes lending money to municipalities to build highways , schools and other infrastructure projects . dc / sh , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the approval , which follows similar action by the lower house 11 days ago , comes after the government took an 8.7 percent stake in the shaky lender as a first step in gaining full control .
the german government has given the munich-based bank 87 billion euros -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- in state guarantees since it got into difficulties in october 2008 .
the financial sector provided a further 15 billion euros .
nationalization deemed necessary hypo real estate chalked up a loss of 5.5 billion euros in 2008 , the biggest of any german firm .
experts have said that the bank will collapse without government intervention .
the law will expire by the end of june , meaning a takeover would have to be initiated before then .
in return for the funds it has put into the bank , the german government wants to take full control in order to ensure that shareholders can not block restructuring measures .
such a move has been opposed by us investor christopher flowers , who owns nearly 24 percent of the bank and feels a government stake of 75 percent plus one share would be sufficient .
flowers has lost 1 billion euros since he paid 22.5 euros per share for his stake at the start of the global financial crisis .
on friday , hypo real estate 's shares stood at 1.31 euros .
hypo real estate 's main business includes lending money to municipalities to build highways , schools and other infrastructure projects . dc / sh , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they ’ re still skeptical on keeping troops in afghanistan . germans remain impressed with barack obama , think france is their most trustworthy partner among nations , and support nato – but not their country 's participation in the alliance 's afghan military mission .
that 's according to the new deutschlandtrend survey , a bi-monthly poll that tracks german opinions on newsworthy topics conducted by the public broadcast network ard -lrb- of which deutsche welle is a member -rrb- .
a robust 84 percent of germans believe nato is important as an instrument of keeping stability and peace within europe .
and 61 percent think nato should keep looking after afghanistan .
but just 32 percent want to keep german troops in that country , a full ten percent less than the month before .
as croatia and slovenia prepare for their initiation into nato this week , germans said they were wary of expanding nato further .
only 36 percent agreed to the proposition that nato should take on additional members from eastern europe and the balkans .
if these views seem to be at odds with the policy aims of the united states , who would like to see an expanded european military role in afghanistan and a bigger nato , that has not soured germans on the new us president barack obama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is excited to greet barack obama four out of five germans are pleased with the performance of obama in his first two months in office , and nearly nine out of ten said that obama had set the us back on the right track .
82 percent were looking forward to obama 's visit to germany this week for the nato summit , and just over three-quarters said they wished germany could produce a politician like him .
the obama effect may have helped the us out in the survey 's question about which countries germans consider to be trusted partners .
78 percent said they saw the us as such , continuing an upward trend since george w. bush 's team left office .
the country that led the list , however , was france .
87 percent of germans say their western neighbor is a trusted partner , up just slightly from the previous month .
germany and france are co-hosting this weekend 's nato summit , and have forged a very close relationship in economic policy-setting in recent months .
german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy presented a forceful , united front in the run-up to this week 's g20 summit , and achieved most of their goals to tighten international financial regulation .
however , when germans were asked who they thought was most likely to come up with a solution to getting out of the global economic crisis , they went back to their first love : barack obama .
80 percent of germans thought he was likely to devise an effective plan , compared with 58 percent for angela merkel , 55 percent for the european union , and 49 percent for social democratic challenger for the chancellorship in this autumn 's general election , frank-walter steinmeier .
the survey was conducted on the 30th and 31st of march , polled 1000 germans , and has a margin of error of 1.4-3.1 percent . mh / rg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the approval , which follows similar action by the lower house 11 days ago , comes after the government took an 8.7 percent stake in the shaky lender as a first step in gaining full control .
the german government has given the munich-based bank 87 billion euros -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- in state guarantees since it got into difficulties in october 2008 .
the financial sector provided a further 15 billion euros .
nationalization deemed necessary hypo real estate chalked up a loss of 5.5 billion euros in 2008 , the biggest of any german firm .
experts have said that the bank will collapse without government intervention .
the law will expire by the end of june , meaning a takeover would have to be initiated before then .
in return for the funds it has put into the bank , the german government wants to take full control in order to ensure that shareholders can not block restructuring measures .
such a move has been opposed by us investor christopher flowers , who owns nearly 24 percent of the bank and feels a government stake of 75 percent plus one share would be sufficient .
flowers has lost 1 billion euros since he paid 22.5 euros per share for his stake at the start of the global financial crisis .
on friday , hypo real estate 's shares stood at 1.31 euros .

" we want strong allies .
we would like to see europe have much more robust defense capabilities , " he said .
obama praised the french president 's " courageous " leadership on afghanistan , and said that france , the united states ' oldest ally , had " once again taken an extraordinary leadership role in nato . "
president sarkozy welcomed obama at a red carpet reception on friday at strasbourg 's majestic palais de rohan , where a company of soldiers accorded him full military honors .
sarkozy stressed that while there would be no french military reinforcements in afghanistan , paris was enthusiastic about contributing more to police training and providing economic aid .

the approval , which follows similar action by the lower house 11 days ago , comes after the government took an 8.7 percent stake in the shaky lender as a first step in gaining full control .
the german government has given the munich-based bank 87 billion euros -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- in state guarantees since it got into difficulties in october 2008 .

nationalization deemed necessary hypo real estate chalked up a loss of 5.5 billion euros in 2008 , the biggest of any german firm .
experts have said that the bank will collapse without government intervention .
the law will expire by the end of june , meaning a takeover would have to be initiated before then .
in return for the funds it has put into the bank , the german government wants to take full control in order to ensure that shareholders can not block restructuring measures .
such a move has been opposed by us investor christopher flowers , who owns nearly 24 percent of the bank and feels a government stake of 75 percent plus one share would be sufficient .

he also found time to soak up adoration from the crowds . united states president barack obama has tried to assuage german concerns that washington will use this weekend 's nato summit to press berlin for more troops to secure afghanistan .
" i do n't come bearing grand designs , " obama said at a joint press conference with chancellor angela merkel in the western german town of baden-baden on friday .
the deteriorating situation in afghanistan was expected to be one of the main topics at nato 's 60th anniversary meeting , held symbolically in the french city of strasbourg and the german towns of baden-baden and kehl .
speaking ahead of the meeting , obama said he was " here to listen , to share ideas , and jointly - as one of many nato allies - to help shape our vision for the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato talks will focus on afghanistan security obama described germany as an exemplary ally in afghanistan , which has suffered increasing violence since the us-led invasion of 2001 .
merkel noted that germany , which currently has over 3,500 troops deployed in the country 's north , had a " huge responsibility " and would " face up to this responsibility in military terms as well . "
however , obama also held the door open for us demands from european partners in comments that signaled washington 's resolve to change strategy .
" we will all now have to make additional and sustainable efforts to succeed ...
our role is not to occupy afghanistan , " but to prevent it from becoming a safe-haven for terrorists , " the us leader said .
" if we discover that the approach we are taking is not effective , it 's not working , then we will change it . "
germany has balked at sending more troops to afghanistan , where the nato-led international security assistance force is struggling to contain an escalating taliban insurgency while reconstructing the country .
however , merkel said she " welcomed " the us plans to change its strategy there .
nato politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey does n't want rasmussen as nato head on a separate issue likely to plague nato leaders , merkel said the western military alliance should choose its next leader this friday .
" i am convinced we should name a new secretary-general tonight , " merkel said , adding that danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen would make an " excellent choice . "
rasmussen 's nomination has angered the north atlantic treaty organization 's only islamic member-state , turkey .
ankara regards the danish premier as one of turkey 's principle detractors in the european union .
obama 's star appeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama held a town-hall style meeting in france obama 's brief meeting with merkel was preceded by talks with french president nicolas sarkozy in strasbourg .
in both countries he was accompanied by cheering crowds , confirming the us leader 's superstar status in europe .
smiling and visibly touched as he walked through the french city , obama greeted spectators with handshakes and calls of " nice to see you " and " it 's good to be here . "
at one point , he even leaned into the crowd to kiss a young woman .
the latest bi-monthly tracking poll , conducted by the german public broadcast network ard -lrb- of which deutsche welle is a member -rrb- , found that 82 percent of germans were looking forward to obama 's visit this week , and just over three-quarters said they wished germany could produce a politician like him .

nato politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey does n't want rasmussen as nato head on a separate issue likely to plague nato leaders , merkel said the western military alliance should choose its next leader this friday .
" i am convinced we should name a new secretary-general tonight , " merkel said , adding that danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen would make an " excellent choice . "

obama 's star appeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama held a town-hall style meeting in france obama 's brief meeting with merkel was preceded by talks with french president nicolas sarkozy in strasbourg .
in both countries he was accompanied by cheering crowds , confirming the us leader 's superstar status in europe .
smiling and visibly touched as he walked through the french city , obama greeted spectators with handshakes and calls of " nice to see you " and " it 's good to be here . "
at one point , he even leaned into the crowd to kiss a young woman .
the latest bi-monthly tracking poll , conducted by the german public broadcast network ard -lrb- of which deutsche welle is a member -rrb- , found that 82 percent of germans were looking forward to obama 's visit this week , and just over three-quarters said they wished germany could produce a politician like him .
in a vote of confidence that german politicians could only dream of , four out of five germans said they were pleased with obama 's performance in his first two months in office , and nearly nine out of ten said that obama had set the us back on the right track. nw / sh / dpa / rtr / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they ’ re still skeptical on keeping troops in afghanistan . germans remain impressed with barack obama , think france is their most trustworthy partner among nations , and support nato – but not their country 's participation in the alliance 's afghan military mission .
that 's according to the new deutschlandtrend survey , a bi-monthly poll that tracks german opinions on newsworthy topics conducted by the public broadcast network ard -lrb- of which deutsche welle is a member -rrb- .
a robust 84 percent of germans believe nato is important as an instrument of keeping stability and peace within europe .
and 61 percent think nato should keep looking after afghanistan .
but just 32 percent want to keep german troops in that country , a full ten percent less than the month before .
as croatia and slovenia prepare for their initiation into nato this week , germans said they were wary of expanding nato further .
only 36 percent agreed to the proposition that nato should take on additional members from eastern europe and the balkans .
if these views seem to be at odds with the policy aims of the united states , who would like to see an expanded european military role in afghanistan and a bigger nato , that has not soured germans on the new us president barack obama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is excited to greet barack obama four out of five germans are pleased with the performance of obama in his first two months in office , and nearly nine out of ten said that obama had set the us back on the right track .
82 percent were looking forward to obama 's visit to germany this week for the nato summit , and just over three-quarters said they wished germany could produce a politician like him .
the obama effect may have helped the us out in the survey 's question about which countries germans consider to be trusted partners .
78 percent said they saw the us as such , continuing an upward trend since george w. bush 's team left office .
the country that led the list , however , was france .
87 percent of germans say their western neighbor is a trusted partner , up just slightly from the previous month .
germany and france are co-hosting this weekend 's nato summit , and have forged a very close relationship in economic policy-setting in recent months .
german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy presented a forceful , united front in the run-up to this week 's g20 summit , and achieved most of their goals to tighten international financial regulation .
however , when germans were asked who they thought was most likely to come up with a solution to getting out of the global economic crisis , they went back to their first love : barack obama .
80 percent of germans thought he was likely to devise an effective plan , compared with 58 percent for angela merkel , 55 percent for the european union , and 49 percent for social democratic challenger for the chancellorship in this autumn 's general election , frank-walter steinmeier .
the survey was conducted on the 30th and 31st of march , polled 1000 germans , and has a margin of error of 1.4-3.1 percent . mh / rg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they ’ re still skeptical on keeping troops in afghanistan . germans remain impressed with barack obama , think france is their most trustworthy partner among nations , and support nato – but not their country 's participation in the alliance 's afghan military mission .
that 's according to the new deutschlandtrend survey , a bi-monthly poll that tracks german opinions on newsworthy topics conducted by the public broadcast network ard -lrb- of which deutsche welle is a member -rrb- .
a robust 84 percent of germans believe nato is important as an instrument of keeping stability and peace within europe .
and 61 percent think nato should keep looking after afghanistan .
but just 32 percent want to keep german troops in that country , a full ten percent less than the month before .
as croatia and slovenia prepare for their initiation into nato this week , germans said they were wary of expanding nato further .
only 36 percent agreed to the proposition that nato should take on additional members from eastern europe and the balkans .
if these views seem to be at odds with the policy aims of the united states , who would like to see an expanded european military role in afghanistan and a bigger nato , that has not soured germans on the new us president barack obama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is excited to greet barack obama four out of five germans are pleased with the performance of obama in his first two months in office , and nearly nine out of ten said that obama had set the us back on the right track .
82 percent were looking forward to obama 's visit to germany this week for the nato summit , and just over three-quarters said they wished germany could produce a politician like him .
the obama effect may have helped the us out in the survey 's question about which countries germans consider to be trusted partners .
78 percent said they saw the us as such , continuing an upward trend since george w. bush 's team left office .
the country that led the list , however , was france .
87 percent of germans say their western neighbor is a trusted partner , up just slightly from the previous month .
germany and france are co-hosting this weekend 's nato summit , and have forged a very close relationship in economic policy-setting in recent months .
german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy presented a forceful , united front in the run-up to this week 's g20 summit , and achieved most of their goals to tighten international financial regulation .
however , when germans were asked who they thought was most likely to come up with a solution to getting out of the global economic crisis , they went back to their first love : barack obama .
80 percent of germans thought he was likely to devise an effective plan , compared with 58 percent for angela merkel , 55 percent for the european union , and 49 percent for social democratic challenger for the chancellorship in this autumn 's general election , frank-walter steinmeier .
the survey was conducted on the 30th and 31st of march , polled 1000 germans , and has a margin of error of 1.4-3.1 percent . mh / rg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 03.04.2009 german-french brigade hopes to move beyond showcase status großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two countries , one mission : the insignia of the franco-german brigade france is marking its return to the alliance 's military command at nato anniversary celebrations .
but the once independent french military already cooperates with nato members .
one example : the german-french brigade . the photos of former german chancellor helmut kohl , former french president francois mitterrand and countless defense ministers from germany and france in the brigade 's headquarters in muellheim are the proof : politicians enjoy coming to this town in the southern corner of germany that meets france and switzerland . what french and german soldiers do here is still unique in europe , even 20 years after the establishment of the german-french brigade .
europe 's only bi-national unit is made up of some 5,000 soldiers from germany and france .
when the project was conceived in 1989 by kohl and mitterrand , there was nothing else like it .
one unit , two nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl -lrb- left -rrb- and mitterand were among the many visitors to muellheim the difficulties from those days , such as language problems , are still big challenges for the unit 's current commander , gen. andreas berg . as foresighted as the brigade may be in terms of providing the basis for a future european army , language issues never seem to go away .
just look at barracks security .
the german-french security crew at the gate can often only communicate with sign language , because the german does n't speak any french , and his french comrade does n't speak german .
the troops are actually meant to be able to work in two foreign languages , with english being the lingua franca in international matters of business . for 20 years now , the troops have been practicing their cooperation , but in that time , the soldiers have only twice been sent abroad together : to bosnia-herzegovina and afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marching in unison 's no problem , but talking can be only when the ministries of defense in berlin and paris agree on a mission does the brigade get the green light .
these joint operations are now so far in the past that most of the soldiers who participated in them have since moved on to other posts . this makes veterans in muellheim , such as the french sgt. maj. robert lenhardt , impatient .
lenhardt said it bothers him that the brigade is always presented as a showcase project at official events .
in reality , he said , it 's politics that prevent more action . " we can sleep in the same barracks and eat in the same canteen , no problem , " he said .
" but anyone can do that ; just go on vacation in the summertime .
we 're soldiers and we 're there for a certain purpose , and we never get to put it to the test . " waiting for a common mission unlike many of his colleagues , lenhardt moves easily in the german-french environment .
such " bridge builders " in the brigade are often found among the unit 's management .
there , bilateral cooperation is a matter of course , because at higher levels , there are no language difficulties .
the average soldier , on the other hand , typically only sees his colleagues from the neighboring country at meals or while playing sports . soon , the brigade will also have a location in france .
french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel plan to permanently station around 700 bundeswehr soldiers in alsace .
many in muellheim hope that the location in strasbourg will be a further symbolic step forward that will give the brigade new momentum . author : andreas noll -lrb- dc -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 03.04.2009 germans positive about nato leaders , dislike afghanistan mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel will have to consider conflicting german opinions on nato an influential survey finds that germans support nato , and hold france and especially new us president barack obama in high esteem .
but they ’ re still skeptical on keeping troops in afghanistan . germans remain impressed with barack obama , think france is their most trustworthy partner among nations , and support nato – but not their country 's participation in the alliance 's afghan military mission .
that 's according to the new deutschlandtrend survey , a bi-monthly poll that tracks german opinions on newsworthy topics conducted by the public broadcast network ard -lrb- of which deutsche welle is a member -rrb- .
a robust 84 percent of germans believe nato is important as an instrument of keeping stability and peace within europe .
and 61 percent think nato should keep looking after afghanistan .
but just 32 percent want to keep german troops in that country , a full ten percent less than the month before .
as croatia and slovenia prepare for their initiation into nato this week , germans said they were wary of expanding nato further .
only 36 percent agreed to the proposition that nato should take on additional members from eastern europe and the balkans .
if these views seem to be at odds with the policy aims of the united states , who would like to see an expanded european military role in afghanistan and a bigger nato , that has not soured germans on the new us president barack obama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is excited to greet barack obama four out of five germans are pleased with the performance of obama in his first two months in office , and nearly nine out of ten said that obama had set the us back on the right track .
82 percent were looking forward to obama 's visit to germany this week for the nato summit , and just over three-quarters said they wished germany could produce a politician like him .
the obama effect may have helped the us out in the survey 's question about which countries germans consider to be trusted partners .
78 percent said they saw the us as such , continuing an upward trend since george w. bush 's team left office .
the country that led the list , however , was france .
87 percent of germans say their western neighbor is a trusted partner , up just slightly from the previous month .
germany and france are co-hosting this weekend 's nato summit , and have forged a very close relationship in economic policy-setting in recent months .
german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy presented a forceful , united front in the run-up to this week 's g20 summit , and achieved most of their goals to tighten international financial regulation .
however , when germans were asked who they thought was most likely to come up with a solution to getting out of the global economic crisis , they went back to their first love : barack obama .
80 percent of germans thought he was likely to devise an effective plan , compared with 58 percent for angela merkel , 55 percent for the european union , and 49 percent for social democratic challenger for the chancellorship in this autumn 's general election , frank-walter steinmeier .
the survey was conducted on the 30th and 31st of march , polled 1000 germans , and has a margin of error of 1.4-3.1 percent . mh / rg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

even if world war ii was still fresh in the minds of those involved , nato 's biggest enemy was n't demilitarized germany , but the soviet union .
for western europe , there was no alternative to this alliance with the united states , said former british foreign secretary ernest bevin in a radio broadcast .
“ what were peace- and freedom-loving nations to do ? ” he asked .

the list was endorsed by the g20 leaders at their summit in london . " president hans-rudolf merz regrets this procedure , " the swiss finance ministry said in a statement late thursday , april 2 .
" the list does not specify the criteria on the basis of which it was drawn up .
switzerland is not a tax haven .
it always meets its obligations and is always ready to engage in dialogue . "
luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker was also indignant on friday , saying his country 's inclusion on the list was " incomprehensible . "
he reiterated his criticism of the way the lists were drawn up , remarking that several us states with tax-friendly laws were not put on either list while luxembourg was .
g20 approved three-tier list the " grey list " is one part of a three-tier list categorizing tax havens and financial centers by their degree of cooperation with internationally agreed tax standards set out by the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
the list was endorsed by the group of 20 leading industrialized and emerging nations at their summit in london after they pledged to take action including sanctions against non-cooperative jurisdictions , including tax havens , using information from the oecd as its basis .
the oecd has placed costa rica , malaysia , the philippines and uruguay on its blacklist of non-cooperative tax havens .
in addition to switzerland and luxembourg , austria , belgium , singapore , chile , the cayman islands , liechtenstein and monaco are included on the grey list of countries that have agreed to improve transparency standards but have not yet signed the necessary international accords .
china is on a third " white list " of jurisdictions that have substantially implemented the tax standards .
austrian finance minister josef proell downplayed his country 's inclusion on the grey list and said it did not affect the country 's banking secrecy laws .
" the talks are over for us because the proof is there on the grey list that we have taken steps in the right direction , " he told journalists as he arrived in prague for a meeting of euro zone finance ministers . dc / th , afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at one point , he even leaned into the crowd to kiss a young woman .

" i am convinced we should name a new secretary-general tonight , " merkel said , adding that danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen would make an " excellent choice . "
rasmussen 's nomination has angered the north atlantic treaty organization 's only islamic member-state , turkey .
ankara regards the danish premier as one of turkey 's principle detractors in the european union .
obama 's star appeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama held a town-hall style meeting in france obama 's brief meeting with merkel was preceded by talks with french president nicolas sarkozy in strasbourg .
in both countries he was accompanied by cheering crowds , confirming the us leader 's superstar status in europe .
smiling and visibly touched as he walked through the french city , obama greeted spectators with handshakes and calls of " nice to see you " and " it 's good to be here . "
at one point , he even leaned into the crowd to kiss a young woman .
the latest bi-monthly tracking poll , conducted by the german public broadcast network ard -lrb- of which deutsche welle is a member -rrb- , found that 82 percent of germans were looking forward to obama 's visit this week , and just over three-quarters said they wished germany could produce a politician like him .
in a vote of confidence that german politicians could only dream of , four out of five germans said they were pleased with obama 's performance in his first two months in office , and nearly nine out of ten said that obama had set the us back on the right track. nw / sh / dpa / rtr / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de deutsche bahn -pipe- 03.04.2009 government proposes grube as deutsche bahn head großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grube poised to take on a new job ruediger grube - whose experience includes daimler and eads - set to take over germany 's rail company , deutsche bahn .
his first task will be to get beyond the company 's ongoing spying scandal . germany 's transport ministry on thursday endorsed fifty-seven year-old ruediger grube , a top executive at carmaker daimler , as the new head of the state-owned railway operator , deutsche bahn .
the ministry said chancellor angela merkel and key government officials had agreed wednesday evening on grube for the hot-seat , replacing hartmut mehdorn , 66 , who tendered his resignation this week after deutsche bahn admitted to the illicit surveillance of its employees .
mehdorn resigned on monday after being unable to end discussions on whether the company spied on employees ' emails from 2005 to 2008 and blocked messages from unions during a 2007 labor dispute .
grube is currently responsible for company strategy at automaker daimler .
he is also on the board of directors at european aircraft manufacturer eads .
grube has close ties to mehdorn himself , having served as his office manager at another company - and the possibility grube could become the successor to his former boss drew immediate protest from the opposition green party .
" this is not a new beginning , mrs. merkel , " green parliamentary leader renate kuenast told news agency reporters .
" with mehdorn 's former assistant , there 's the threat of more of the same . "
the deutsche bahn in general - and mehdorn himself - are currently under investigation in relation to the spying allegations .
leading politicians and labor unions have called for thorough scrutiny into deutsche bahn 's allegedly comprehensive surveillance of its own employees .
troubleshooter ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accusations over employee surveillance are casting a shadow over deutsche bahn but beyond being an associate of mehdorn , who is ruediger grube ?
born in the northern german city of hamburg , his career began with an apprenticeship in airplane construction .
in the late 1980s and early 1990s , he began working for daimler 's aeronautics division as well as for airbus - now an eads subsidiary .
he has been on daimler 's board of directors since 2001 and a top eads executive for the past year and a half .
grube 's background has drawn criticism from people hoping someone with a background in the rail industry would take over deutsche bahn .
" after ten years of mehdorn , there 's no need for another would-be high-flyer from the aeronautics sector , " kuenast told reporters .
there has been no word on when grube will be put forward as mehdorn 's successor. nrt / jc / sh -lrb- ap / dpa / rtr / afp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ministry said chancellor angela merkel and key government officials had agreed wednesday evening on grube for the hot-seat , replacing hartmut mehdorn , 66 , who tendered his resignation this week after deutsche bahn admitted to the illicit surveillance of its employees .
mehdorn resigned on monday after being unable to end discussions on whether the company spied on employees ' emails from 2005 to 2008 and blocked messages from unions during a 2007 labor dispute .
grube is currently responsible for company strategy at automaker daimler .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 03.04.2009 german upper house approves bank takeover law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government will forcibly take control as a last resort germany 's upper house of parliament has approved controversial legislation that would enable the state to seize control of troubled mortgage lender hypo real estate . the measure , seen as a last resort to stabilize the german financial market , marks the first time in postwar germany that bank shareholders face possible expropriation .
the approval , which follows similar action by the lower house 11 days ago , comes after the government took an 8.7 percent stake in the shaky lender as a first step in gaining full control .
the german government has given the munich-based bank 87 billion euros -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- in state guarantees since it got into difficulties in october 2008 .
the financial sector provided a further 15 billion euros .
nationalization deemed necessary hypo real estate chalked up a loss of 5.5 billion euros in 2008 , the biggest of any german firm .
experts have said that the bank will collapse without government intervention .

" at this summit nato must start revising its strategic concept , " merkel said in a speech at the german parliament in late march . the german government has said nato efforts to advance security and stability in afghanistan have become the litmus test of the alliance 's effectiveness . germany currently has about 3,500 troops based in the relatively peaceful northern region of afghanistan .
another 600 soldiers are to be deployed to safeguard afghan elections this summer and will contribute to the training program for afghan security forces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil reconstruction is important to stabilizing afghanistan german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier says that berlin 's strategy of a military-backed reconstruction effort should be emulated by other nato partners .

nato 's partnership with russia must be rebuilt and civil reconstruction in afghanistan strengthened . the german chancellor said she believes nato must adapt to new global challenges such as terrorism and energy security as well as building new partnerships in a post-cold war world . ahead of friday 's nato anniversary summit in germany and france , merkel said the 28-member alliance must not nostalgically look back at its history , but look to the future . " at this summit nato must start revising its strategic concept , " merkel said in a speech at the german parliament in late march . the german government has said nato efforts to advance security and stability in afghanistan have become the litmus test of the alliance 's effectiveness . germany currently has about 3,500 troops based in the relatively peaceful northern region of afghanistan .
another 600 soldiers are to be deployed to safeguard afghan elections this summer and will contribute to the training program for afghan security forces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil reconstruction is important to stabilizing afghanistan german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier says that berlin 's strategy of a military-backed reconstruction effort should be emulated by other nato partners . " stabilizing afghanistan can only be achieved if the country becomes economically viable , " he says . berlin has also welcomed a shift in washington ’ s afghanistan policy . us president barack obama recently announced that he wants to speed up civil reconstruction in addition to sending further 17,000 troops to fight the resurgent taliban . reaching out to russia following talks with russian president dmitry medvedev in berlin on tuesday , merkel said that mutual trust needed to be rebuilt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants closer ties with russia ties between nato and russia are strained after spats over nato ’ s eastward expansion and american plans to station missiles and a radar base as part of an anti-missile shield in eastern europe . in attempts to help the creation of a strategic partnership with moscow , merkel has called on the former soviet satellite states in eastern europe to bury the hatchet with russia as germany has done .

the approval , which follows similar action by the lower house 11 days ago , comes after the government took an 8.7 percent stake in the shaky lender as a first step in gaining full control .
the german government has given the munich-based bank 87 billion euros -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- in state guarantees since it got into difficulties in october 2008 .
the financial sector provided a further 15 billion euros .
nationalization deemed necessary hypo real estate chalked up a loss of 5.5 billion euros in 2008 , the biggest of any german firm .
experts have said that the bank will collapse without government intervention .
the law will expire by the end of june , meaning a takeover would have to be initiated before then .
in return for the funds it has put into the bank , the german government wants to take full control in order to ensure that shareholders can not block restructuring measures .
such a move has been opposed by us investor christopher flowers , who owns nearly 24 percent of the bank and feels a government stake of 75 percent plus one share would be sufficient .
flowers has lost 1 billion euros since he paid 22.5 euros per share for his stake at the start of the global financial crisis .
on friday , hypo real estate 's shares stood at 1.31 euros .
hypo real estate 's main business includes lending money to municipalities to build highways , schools and other infrastructure projects . dc / sh , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 03.04.2009 obama makes a splash on whirlwind european tour großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is expected to ask for more european help in afghanistan hot on the heels of the g20 meeting , obama held talks with the leaders of france and germany ahead of nato 's 60th anniversary summit .
he also found time to soak up adoration from the crowds . united states president barack obama has tried to assuage german concerns that washington will use this weekend 's nato summit to press berlin for more troops to secure afghanistan .
" i do n't come bearing grand designs , " obama said at a joint press conference with chancellor angela merkel in the western german town of baden-baden on friday .
the deteriorating situation in afghanistan was expected to be one of the main topics at nato 's 60th anniversary meeting , held symbolically in the french city of strasbourg and the german towns of baden-baden and kehl .
speaking ahead of the meeting , obama said he was " here to listen , to share ideas , and jointly - as one of many nato allies - to help shape our vision for the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato talks will focus on afghanistan security obama described germany as an exemplary ally in afghanistan , which has suffered increasing violence since the us-led invasion of 2001 .
merkel noted that germany , which currently has over 3,500 troops deployed in the country 's north , had a " huge responsibility " and would " face up to this responsibility in military terms as well . "
however , obama also held the door open for us demands from european partners in comments that signaled washington 's resolve to change strategy .
" we will all now have to make additional and sustainable efforts to succeed ...
our role is not to occupy afghanistan , " but to prevent it from becoming a safe-haven for terrorists , " the us leader said .
" if we discover that the approach we are taking is not effective , it 's not working , then we will change it . "
germany has balked at sending more troops to afghanistan , where the nato-led international security assistance force is struggling to contain an escalating taliban insurgency while reconstructing the country .
however , merkel said she " welcomed " the us plans to change its strategy there .
nato politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey does n't want rasmussen as nato head on a separate issue likely to plague nato leaders , merkel said the western military alliance should choose its next leader this friday .
" i am convinced we should name a new secretary-general tonight , " merkel said , adding that danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen would make an " excellent choice . "
rasmussen 's nomination has angered the north atlantic treaty organization 's only islamic member-state , turkey .
ankara regards the danish premier as one of turkey 's principle detractors in the european union .
obama 's star appeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama held a town-hall style meeting in france obama 's brief meeting with merkel was preceded by talks with french president nicolas sarkozy in strasbourg .
in both countries he was accompanied by cheering crowds , confirming the us leader 's superstar status in europe .
smiling and visibly touched as he walked through the french city , obama greeted spectators with handshakes and calls of " nice to see you " and " it 's good to be here . "
at one point , he even leaned into the crowd to kiss a young woman .
the latest bi-monthly tracking poll , conducted by the german public broadcast network ard -lrb- of which deutsche welle is a member -rrb- , found that 82 percent of germans were looking forward to obama 's visit this week , and just over three-quarters said they wished germany could produce a politician like him .
in a vote of confidence that german politicians could only dream of , four out of five germans said they were pleased with obama 's performance in his first two months in office , and nearly nine out of ten said that obama had set the us back on the right track. nw / sh / dpa / rtr / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his first task will be to get beyond the company 's ongoing spying scandal . germany 's transport ministry on thursday endorsed fifty-seven year-old ruediger grube , a top executive at carmaker daimler , as the new head of the state-owned railway operator , deutsche bahn .
the ministry said chancellor angela merkel and key government officials had agreed wednesday evening on grube for the hot-seat , replacing hartmut mehdorn , 66 , who tendered his resignation this week after deutsche bahn admitted to the illicit surveillance of its employees .
mehdorn resigned on monday after being unable to end discussions on whether the company spied on employees ' emails from 2005 to 2008 and blocked messages from unions during a 2007 labor dispute .
grube is currently responsible for company strategy at automaker daimler .
he is also on the board of directors at european aircraft manufacturer eads .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accusations over employee surveillance are casting a shadow over deutsche bahn but beyond being an associate of mehdorn , who is ruediger grube ?
born in the northern german city of hamburg , his career began with an apprenticeship in airplane construction .
in the late 1980s and early 1990s , he began working for daimler 's aeronautics division as well as for airbus - now an eads subsidiary .
he has been on daimler 's board of directors since 2001 and a top eads executive for the past year and a half .

but they ’ re still skeptical on keeping troops in afghanistan . germans remain impressed with barack obama , think france is their most trustworthy partner among nations , and support nato – but not their country 's participation in the alliance 's afghan military mission .
that 's according to the new deutschlandtrend survey , a bi-monthly poll that tracks german opinions on newsworthy topics conducted by the public broadcast network ard -lrb- of which deutsche welle is a member -rrb- .
a robust 84 percent of germans believe nato is important as an instrument of keeping stability and peace within europe .

the list was endorsed by the g20 leaders at their summit in london . " president hans-rudolf merz regrets this procedure , " the swiss finance ministry said in a statement late thursday , april 2 .
" the list does not specify the criteria on the basis of which it was drawn up .
switzerland is not a tax haven .
it always meets its obligations and is always ready to engage in dialogue . "
luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker was also indignant on friday , saying his country 's inclusion on the list was " incomprehensible . "
he reiterated his criticism of the way the lists were drawn up , remarking that several us states with tax-friendly laws were not put on either list while luxembourg was .
g20 approved three-tier list the " grey list " is one part of a three-tier list categorizing tax havens and financial centers by their degree of cooperation with internationally agreed tax standards set out by the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
the list was endorsed by the group of 20 leading industrialized and emerging nations at their summit in london after they pledged to take action including sanctions against non-cooperative jurisdictions , including tax havens , using information from the oecd as its basis .
the oecd has placed costa rica , malaysia , the philippines and uruguay on its blacklist of non-cooperative tax havens .
in addition to switzerland and luxembourg , austria , belgium , singapore , chile , the cayman islands , liechtenstein and monaco are included on the grey list of countries that have agreed to improve transparency standards but have not yet signed the necessary international accords .
china is on a third " white list " of jurisdictions that have substantially implemented the tax standards .
austrian finance minister josef proell downplayed his country 's inclusion on the grey list and said it did not affect the country 's banking secrecy laws .
" the talks are over for us because the proof is there on the grey list that we have taken steps in the right direction , " he told journalists as he arrived in prague for a meeting of euro zone finance ministers . dc / th , afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also found time to soak up adoration from the crowds . united states president barack obama has tried to assuage german concerns that washington will use this weekend 's nato summit to press berlin for more troops to secure afghanistan .
" i do n't come bearing grand designs , " obama said at a joint press conference with chancellor angela merkel in the western german town of baden-baden on friday .
the deteriorating situation in afghanistan was expected to be one of the main topics at nato 's 60th anniversary meeting , held symbolically in the french city of strasbourg and the german towns of baden-baden and kehl .
speaking ahead of the meeting , obama said he was " here to listen , to share ideas , and jointly - as one of many nato allies - to help shape our vision for the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato talks will focus on afghanistan security obama described germany as an exemplary ally in afghanistan , which has suffered increasing violence since the us-led invasion of 2001 .
merkel noted that germany , which currently has over 3,500 troops deployed in the country 's north , had a " huge responsibility " and would " face up to this responsibility in military terms as well . "
however , obama also held the door open for us demands from european partners in comments that signaled washington 's resolve to change strategy .
" we will all now have to make additional and sustainable efforts to succeed ...
our role is not to occupy afghanistan , " but to prevent it from becoming a safe-haven for terrorists , " the us leader said .
" if we discover that the approach we are taking is not effective , it 's not working , then we will change it . "
germany has balked at sending more troops to afghanistan , where the nato-led international security assistance force is struggling to contain an escalating taliban insurgency while reconstructing the country .

the list was endorsed by the g20 leaders at their summit in london . " president hans-rudolf merz regrets this procedure , " the swiss finance ministry said in a statement late thursday , april 2 .
" the list does not specify the criteria on the basis of which it was drawn up .
switzerland is not a tax haven .
it always meets its obligations and is always ready to engage in dialogue . "
luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker was also indignant on friday , saying his country 's inclusion on the list was " incomprehensible . "
he reiterated his criticism of the way the lists were drawn up , remarking that several us states with tax-friendly laws were not put on either list while luxembourg was .
g20 approved three-tier list the " grey list " is one part of a three-tier list categorizing tax havens and financial centers by their degree of cooperation with internationally agreed tax standards set out by the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
the list was endorsed by the group of 20 leading industrialized and emerging nations at their summit in london after they pledged to take action including sanctions against non-cooperative jurisdictions , including tax havens , using information from the oecd as its basis .
the oecd has placed costa rica , malaysia , the philippines and uruguay on its blacklist of non-cooperative tax havens .
in addition to switzerland and luxembourg , austria , belgium , singapore , chile , the cayman islands , liechtenstein and monaco are included on the grey list of countries that have agreed to improve transparency standards but have not yet signed the necessary international accords .
china is on a third " white list " of jurisdictions that have substantially implemented the tax standards .
austrian finance minister josef proell downplayed his country 's inclusion on the grey list and said it did not affect the country 's banking secrecy laws .
" the talks are over for us because the proof is there on the grey list that we have taken steps in the right direction , " he told journalists as he arrived in prague for a meeting of euro zone finance ministers . dc / th , afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they ’ re still skeptical on keeping troops in afghanistan . germans remain impressed with barack obama , think france is their most trustworthy partner among nations , and support nato – but not their country 's participation in the alliance 's afghan military mission .
that 's according to the new deutschlandtrend survey , a bi-monthly poll that tracks german opinions on newsworthy topics conducted by the public broadcast network ard -lrb- of which deutsche welle is a member -rrb- .
a robust 84 percent of germans believe nato is important as an instrument of keeping stability and peace within europe .
and 61 percent think nato should keep looking after afghanistan .
but just 32 percent want to keep german troops in that country , a full ten percent less than the month before .
as croatia and slovenia prepare for their initiation into nato this week , germans said they were wary of expanding nato further .
only 36 percent agreed to the proposition that nato should take on additional members from eastern europe and the balkans .
if these views seem to be at odds with the policy aims of the united states , who would like to see an expanded european military role in afghanistan and a bigger nato , that has not soured germans on the new us president barack obama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is excited to greet barack obama four out of five germans are pleased with the performance of obama in his first two months in office , and nearly nine out of ten said that obama had set the us back on the right track .
82 percent were looking forward to obama 's visit to germany this week for the nato summit , and just over three-quarters said they wished germany could produce a politician like him .
the obama effect may have helped the us out in the survey 's question about which countries germans consider to be trusted partners .
78 percent said they saw the us as such , continuing an upward trend since george w. bush 's team left office .
the country that led the list , however , was france .
87 percent of germans say their western neighbor is a trusted partner , up just slightly from the previous month .
germany and france are co-hosting this weekend 's nato summit , and have forged a very close relationship in economic policy-setting in recent months .
german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy presented a forceful , united front in the run-up to this week 's g20 summit , and achieved most of their goals to tighten international financial regulation .
however , when germans were asked who they thought was most likely to come up with a solution to getting out of the global economic crisis , they went back to their first love : barack obama .
80 percent of germans thought he was likely to devise an effective plan , compared with 58 percent for angela merkel , 55 percent for the european union , and 49 percent for social democratic challenger for the chancellorship in this autumn 's general election , frank-walter steinmeier .
the survey was conducted on the 30th and 31st of march , polled 1000 germans , and has a margin of error of 1.4-3.1 percent . mh / rg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

he also found time to soak up adoration from the crowds . united states president barack obama has tried to assuage german concerns that washington will use this weekend 's nato summit to press berlin for more troops to secure afghanistan .
" i do n't come bearing grand designs , " obama said at a joint press conference with chancellor angela merkel in the western german town of baden-baden on friday .
the deteriorating situation in afghanistan was expected to be one of the main topics at nato 's 60th anniversary meeting , held symbolically in the french city of strasbourg and the german towns of baden-baden and kehl .
speaking ahead of the meeting , obama said he was " here to listen , to share ideas , and jointly - as one of many nato allies - to help shape our vision for the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato talks will focus on afghanistan security obama described germany as an exemplary ally in afghanistan , which has suffered increasing violence since the us-led invasion of 2001 .
merkel noted that germany , which currently has over 3,500 troops deployed in the country 's north , had a " huge responsibility " and would " face up to this responsibility in military terms as well . "
however , obama also held the door open for us demands from european partners in comments that signaled washington 's resolve to change strategy .
" we will all now have to make additional and sustainable efforts to succeed ...
our role is not to occupy afghanistan , " but to prevent it from becoming a safe-haven for terrorists , " the us leader said .
" if we discover that the approach we are taking is not effective , it 's not working , then we will change it . "
germany has balked at sending more troops to afghanistan , where the nato-led international security assistance force is struggling to contain an escalating taliban insurgency while reconstructing the country .
however , merkel said she " welcomed " the us plans to change its strategy there .

smiling and visibly touched as he walked through the french city , obama greeted spectators with handshakes and calls of " nice to see you " and " it 's good to be here . "

" the nato summit is not a pledging conference , but of course we 'll be talking about how our allies can match their resources to the needs identified in the -lrb- us -rrb- strategic review , " clinton said ahead of her arrival in strasbourg , france .
clinton is to accompany us president barack obama to the summit , which takes place in strasbourg and in the neighbouring german cities of kehl and baden baden .
clinton wants " highest and best " contribution the us currently provides about half of all the forces taking part in nato 's 62,000-strong international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission in afghanistan .
obama has vowed to deploy an additional 17,000 troops , as well as 4,000 more experts to train afghan security forces .
officials in washington hope that , by setting an example , their european allies will follow .
" what we decided to do was to give the nato allies , eu members , countries in the region , everyone who we think has a stake in the future of afghanistan , to do their own internal review and to take a hard look at what they believe is their highest and best contribution , " clinton said .
united states national security advisor james jones said additional help would be particularly needed in the summer , when afghans go to the polls to vote on whether to renew the mandate of president hamid karzai .
" we have a national election coming up .
allies are considering how they might reinforce themselves ... so i expect there will be additional troop contributions , " jones said .
germany and italy have already indicated they will be providing more soldiers for the election period , but nato commanders insist four additional battalions are needed . dc / th , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the approval , which follows similar action by the lower house 11 days ago , comes after the government took an 8.7 percent stake in the shaky lender as a first step in gaining full control .

the law will expire by the end of june , meaning a takeover would have to be initiated before then .
in return for the funds it has put into the bank , the german government wants to take full control in order to ensure that shareholders can not block restructuring measures .

the approval , which follows similar action by the lower house 11 days ago , comes after the government took an 8.7 percent stake in the shaky lender as a first step in gaining full control .
the german government has given the munich-based bank 87 billion euros -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- in state guarantees since it got into difficulties in october 2008 .
the financial sector provided a further 15 billion euros .
nationalization deemed necessary hypo real estate chalked up a loss of 5.5 billion euros in 2008 , the biggest of any german firm .
experts have said that the bank will collapse without government intervention .
the law will expire by the end of june , meaning a takeover would have to be initiated before then .
in return for the funds it has put into the bank , the german government wants to take full control in order to ensure that shareholders can not block restructuring measures .
such a move has been opposed by us investor christopher flowers , who owns nearly 24 percent of the bank and feels a government stake of 75 percent plus one share would be sufficient .
flowers has lost 1 billion euros since he paid 22.5 euros per share for his stake at the start of the global financial crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 03.04.2009 obama makes a splash on whirlwind european tour großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is expected to ask for more european help in afghanistan hot on the heels of the g20 meeting , obama held talks with the leaders of france and germany ahead of nato 's 60th anniversary summit .
he also found time to soak up adoration from the crowds . united states president barack obama has tried to assuage german concerns that washington will use this weekend 's nato summit to press berlin for more troops to secure afghanistan .
" i do n't come bearing grand designs , " obama said at a joint press conference with chancellor angela merkel in the western german town of baden-baden on friday .
the deteriorating situation in afghanistan was expected to be one of the main topics at nato 's 60th anniversary meeting , held symbolically in the french city of strasbourg and the german towns of baden-baden and kehl .
speaking ahead of the meeting , obama said he was " here to listen , to share ideas , and jointly - as one of many nato allies - to help shape our vision for the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato talks will focus on afghanistan security obama described germany as an exemplary ally in afghanistan , which has suffered increasing violence since the us-led invasion of 2001 .
merkel noted that germany , which currently has over 3,500 troops deployed in the country 's north , had a " huge responsibility " and would " face up to this responsibility in military terms as well . "
however , obama also held the door open for us demands from european partners in comments that signaled washington 's resolve to change strategy .
" we will all now have to make additional and sustainable efforts to succeed ...
our role is not to occupy afghanistan , " but to prevent it from becoming a safe-haven for terrorists , " the us leader said .
" if we discover that the approach we are taking is not effective , it 's not working , then we will change it . "
germany has balked at sending more troops to afghanistan , where the nato-led international security assistance force is struggling to contain an escalating taliban insurgency while reconstructing the country .
however , merkel said she " welcomed " the us plans to change its strategy there .
nato politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey does n't want rasmussen as nato head on a separate issue likely to plague nato leaders , merkel said the western military alliance should choose its next leader this friday .
" i am convinced we should name a new secretary-general tonight , " merkel said , adding that danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen would make an " excellent choice . "
rasmussen 's nomination has angered the north atlantic treaty organization 's only islamic member-state , turkey .
ankara regards the danish premier as one of turkey 's principle detractors in the european union .
obama 's star appeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama held a town-hall style meeting in france obama 's brief meeting with merkel was preceded by talks with french president nicolas sarkozy in strasbourg .
in both countries he was accompanied by cheering crowds , confirming the us leader 's superstar status in europe .
smiling and visibly touched as he walked through the french city , obama greeted spectators with handshakes and calls of " nice to see you " and " it 's good to be here . "
at one point , he even leaned into the crowd to kiss a young woman .
the latest bi-monthly tracking poll , conducted by the german public broadcast network ard -lrb- of which deutsche welle is a member -rrb- , found that 82 percent of germans were looking forward to obama 's visit this week , and just over three-quarters said they wished germany could produce a politician like him .
in a vote of confidence that german politicians could only dream of , four out of five germans said they were pleased with obama 's performance in his first two months in office , and nearly nine out of ten said that obama had set the us back on the right track. nw / sh / dpa / rtr / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

lombardi went on to question whether belgium 's lawmakers had paid enough attention to the pope 's arguments when they overwhelmingly approved the resolution .
he also inquired as to whether the belgian parliament had obtained its information from “ non-objective ” western media sources . during his trip to africa last month , benedict xvi said aids " can not be overcome by the distribution of condoms , ” adding that “ on the contrary , they increase the problem " . unprecedented condemnations the comments led to unprecedented condemnations in editorials in the new york times , the washington post and many other publications , and a storm of criticism by officials and politicians in a number of countries . the vatican , however , continues to defend the pope 's words , saying that a rejection of contraception " maintains the position of benedict 's predecessors .

the list was endorsed by the g20 leaders at their summit in london . " president hans-rudolf merz regrets this procedure , " the swiss finance ministry said in a statement late thursday , april 2 .
" the list does not specify the criteria on the basis of which it was drawn up .
switzerland is not a tax haven .
it always meets its obligations and is always ready to engage in dialogue . "
luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker was also indignant on friday , saying his country 's inclusion on the list was " incomprehensible . "
he reiterated his criticism of the way the lists were drawn up , remarking that several us states with tax-friendly laws were not put on either list while luxembourg was .
g20 approved three-tier list the " grey list " is one part of a three-tier list categorizing tax havens and financial centers by their degree of cooperation with internationally agreed tax standards set out by the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
the list was endorsed by the group of 20 leading industrialized and emerging nations at their summit in london after they pledged to take action including sanctions against non-cooperative jurisdictions , including tax havens , using information from the oecd as its basis .
the oecd has placed costa rica , malaysia , the philippines and uruguay on its blacklist of non-cooperative tax havens .
in addition to switzerland and luxembourg , austria , belgium , singapore , chile , the cayman islands , liechtenstein and monaco are included on the grey list of countries that have agreed to improve transparency standards but have not yet signed the necessary international accords .
china is on a third " white list " of jurisdictions that have substantially implemented the tax standards .
austrian finance minister josef proell downplayed his country 's inclusion on the grey list and said it did not affect the country 's banking secrecy laws .
" the talks are over for us because the proof is there on the grey list that we have taken steps in the right direction , " he told journalists as he arrived in prague for a meeting of euro zone finance ministers . dc / th , afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also found time to soak up adoration from the crowds . united states president barack obama has tried to assuage german concerns that washington will use this weekend 's nato summit to press berlin for more troops to secure afghanistan .
" i do n't come bearing grand designs , " obama said at a joint press conference with chancellor angela merkel in the western german town of baden-baden on friday .
the deteriorating situation in afghanistan was expected to be one of the main topics at nato 's 60th anniversary meeting , held symbolically in the french city of strasbourg and the german towns of baden-baden and kehl .
speaking ahead of the meeting , obama said he was " here to listen , to share ideas , and jointly - as one of many nato allies - to help shape our vision for the future . "

merkel noted that germany , which currently has over 3,500 troops deployed in the country 's north , had a " huge responsibility " and would " face up to this responsibility in military terms as well . "
however , obama also held the door open for us demands from european partners in comments that signaled washington 's resolve to change strategy .
" we will all now have to make additional and sustainable efforts to succeed ...
our role is not to occupy afghanistan , " but to prevent it from becoming a safe-haven for terrorists , " the us leader said .
" if we discover that the approach we are taking is not effective , it 's not working , then we will change it . "
germany has balked at sending more troops to afghanistan , where the nato-led international security assistance force is struggling to contain an escalating taliban insurgency while reconstructing the country .

he also found time to soak up adoration from the crowds . united states president barack obama has tried to assuage german concerns that washington will use this weekend 's nato summit to press berlin for more troops to secure afghanistan .
" i do n't come bearing grand designs , " obama said at a joint press conference with chancellor angela merkel in the western german town of baden-baden on friday .
the deteriorating situation in afghanistan was expected to be one of the main topics at nato 's 60th anniversary meeting , held symbolically in the french city of strasbourg and the german towns of baden-baden and kehl .
speaking ahead of the meeting , obama said he was " here to listen , to share ideas , and jointly - as one of many nato allies - to help shape our vision for the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato talks will focus on afghanistan security obama described germany as an exemplary ally in afghanistan , which has suffered increasing violence since the us-led invasion of 2001 .
merkel noted that germany , which currently has over 3,500 troops deployed in the country 's north , had a " huge responsibility " and would " face up to this responsibility in military terms as well . "
however , obama also held the door open for us demands from european partners in comments that signaled washington 's resolve to change strategy .
" we will all now have to make additional and sustainable efforts to succeed ...
our role is not to occupy afghanistan , " but to prevent it from becoming a safe-haven for terrorists , " the us leader said .
" if we discover that the approach we are taking is not effective , it 's not working , then we will change it . "
germany has balked at sending more troops to afghanistan , where the nato-led international security assistance force is struggling to contain an escalating taliban insurgency while reconstructing the country .
however , merkel said she " welcomed " the us plans to change its strategy there .
nato politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey does n't want rasmussen as nato head on a separate issue likely to plague nato leaders , merkel said the western military alliance should choose its next leader this friday .
" i am convinced we should name a new secretary-general tonight , " merkel said , adding that danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen would make an " excellent choice . "
rasmussen 's nomination has angered the north atlantic treaty organization 's only islamic member-state , turkey .
ankara regards the danish premier as one of turkey 's principle detractors in the european union .
obama 's star appeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama held a town-hall style meeting in france obama 's brief meeting with merkel was preceded by talks with french president nicolas sarkozy in strasbourg .
in both countries he was accompanied by cheering crowds , confirming the us leader 's superstar status in europe .
smiling and visibly touched as he walked through the french city , obama greeted spectators with handshakes and calls of " nice to see you " and " it 's good to be here . "
at one point , he even leaned into the crowd to kiss a young woman .
the latest bi-monthly tracking poll , conducted by the german public broadcast network ard -lrb- of which deutsche welle is a member -rrb- , found that 82 percent of germans were looking forward to obama 's visit this week , and just over three-quarters said they wished germany could produce a politician like him .

the approval , which follows similar action by the lower house 11 days ago , comes after the government took an 8.7 percent stake in the shaky lender as a first step in gaining full control .
the german government has given the munich-based bank 87 billion euros -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- in state guarantees since it got into difficulties in october 2008 .
the financial sector provided a further 15 billion euros .
nationalization deemed necessary hypo real estate chalked up a loss of 5.5 billion euros in 2008 , the biggest of any german firm .
experts have said that the bank will collapse without government intervention .
the law will expire by the end of june , meaning a takeover would have to be initiated before then .
in return for the funds it has put into the bank , the german government wants to take full control in order to ensure that shareholders can not block restructuring measures .
such a move has been opposed by us investor christopher flowers , who owns nearly 24 percent of the bank and feels a government stake of 75 percent plus one share would be sufficient .

the approval , which follows similar action by the lower house 11 days ago , comes after the government took an 8.7 percent stake in the shaky lender as a first step in gaining full control .
the german government has given the munich-based bank 87 billion euros -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- in state guarantees since it got into difficulties in october 2008 .
the financial sector provided a further 15 billion euros .
nationalization deemed necessary hypo real estate chalked up a loss of 5.5 billion euros in 2008 , the biggest of any german firm .
experts have said that the bank will collapse without government intervention .
the law will expire by the end of june , meaning a takeover would have to be initiated before then .
in return for the funds it has put into the bank , the german government wants to take full control in order to ensure that shareholders can not block restructuring measures .
such a move has been opposed by us investor christopher flowers , who owns nearly 24 percent of the bank and feels a government stake of 75 percent plus one share would be sufficient .
flowers has lost 1 billion euros since he paid 22.5 euros per share for his stake at the start of the global financial crisis .

but they ’ re still skeptical on keeping troops in afghanistan . germans remain impressed with barack obama , think france is their most trustworthy partner among nations , and support nato – but not their country 's participation in the alliance 's afghan military mission .
that 's according to the new deutschlandtrend survey , a bi-monthly poll that tracks german opinions on newsworthy topics conducted by the public broadcast network ard -lrb- of which deutsche welle is a member -rrb- .
a robust 84 percent of germans believe nato is important as an instrument of keeping stability and peace within europe .
and 61 percent think nato should keep looking after afghanistan .
but just 32 percent want to keep german troops in that country , a full ten percent less than the month before .
as croatia and slovenia prepare for their initiation into nato this week , germans said they were wary of expanding nato further .
only 36 percent agreed to the proposition that nato should take on additional members from eastern europe and the balkans .
if these views seem to be at odds with the policy aims of the united states , who would like to see an expanded european military role in afghanistan and a bigger nato , that has not soured germans on the new us president barack obama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is excited to greet barack obama four out of five germans are pleased with the performance of obama in his first two months in office , and nearly nine out of ten said that obama had set the us back on the right track .
82 percent were looking forward to obama 's visit to germany this week for the nato summit , and just over three-quarters said they wished germany could produce a politician like him .
the obama effect may have helped the us out in the survey 's question about which countries germans consider to be trusted partners .
78 percent said they saw the us as such , continuing an upward trend since george w. bush 's team left office .
the country that led the list , however , was france .
87 percent of germans say their western neighbor is a trusted partner , up just slightly from the previous month .
germany and france are co-hosting this weekend 's nato summit , and have forged a very close relationship in economic policy-setting in recent months .
german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy presented a forceful , united front in the run-up to this week 's g20 summit , and achieved most of their goals to tighten international financial regulation .
however , when germans were asked who they thought was most likely to come up with a solution to getting out of the global economic crisis , they went back to their first love : barack obama .
80 percent of germans thought he was likely to devise an effective plan , compared with 58 percent for angela merkel , 55 percent for the european union , and 49 percent for social democratic challenger for the chancellorship in this autumn 's general election , frank-walter steinmeier .

but they ’ re still skeptical on keeping troops in afghanistan . germans remain impressed with barack obama , think france is their most trustworthy partner among nations , and support nato – but not their country 's participation in the alliance 's afghan military mission .
that 's according to the new deutschlandtrend survey , a bi-monthly poll that tracks german opinions on newsworthy topics conducted by the public broadcast network ard -lrb- of which deutsche welle is a member -rrb- .
a robust 84 percent of germans believe nato is important as an instrument of keeping stability and peace within europe .
and 61 percent think nato should keep looking after afghanistan .
but just 32 percent want to keep german troops in that country , a full ten percent less than the month before .
as croatia and slovenia prepare for their initiation into nato this week , germans said they were wary of expanding nato further .
only 36 percent agreed to the proposition that nato should take on additional members from eastern europe and the balkans .
if these views seem to be at odds with the policy aims of the united states , who would like to see an expanded european military role in afghanistan and a bigger nato , that has not soured germans on the new us president barack obama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is excited to greet barack obama four out of five germans are pleased with the performance of obama in his first two months in office , and nearly nine out of ten said that obama had set the us back on the right track .
82 percent were looking forward to obama 's visit to germany this week for the nato summit , and just over three-quarters said they wished germany could produce a politician like him .
the obama effect may have helped the us out in the survey 's question about which countries germans consider to be trusted partners .
78 percent said they saw the us as such , continuing an upward trend since george w. bush 's team left office .
the country that led the list , however , was france .
87 percent of germans say their western neighbor is a trusted partner , up just slightly from the previous month .
germany and france are co-hosting this weekend 's nato summit , and have forged a very close relationship in economic policy-setting in recent months .
german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy presented a forceful , united front in the run-up to this week 's g20 summit , and achieved most of their goals to tighten international financial regulation .
however , when germans were asked who they thought was most likely to come up with a solution to getting out of the global economic crisis , they went back to their first love : barack obama .
80 percent of germans thought he was likely to devise an effective plan , compared with 58 percent for angela merkel , 55 percent for the european union , and 49 percent for social democratic challenger for the chancellorship in this autumn 's general election , frank-walter steinmeier .
the survey was conducted on the 30th and 31st of march , polled 1000 germans , and has a margin of error of 1.4-3.1 percent . mh / rg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 03.04.2009 obama makes a splash on whirlwind european tour großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is expected to ask for more european help in afghanistan hot on the heels of the g20 meeting , obama held talks with the leaders of france and germany ahead of nato 's 60th anniversary summit .
he also found time to soak up adoration from the crowds . united states president barack obama has tried to assuage german concerns that washington will use this weekend 's nato summit to press berlin for more troops to secure afghanistan .
" i do n't come bearing grand designs , " obama said at a joint press conference with chancellor angela merkel in the western german town of baden-baden on friday .
the deteriorating situation in afghanistan was expected to be one of the main topics at nato 's 60th anniversary meeting , held symbolically in the french city of strasbourg and the german towns of baden-baden and kehl .
speaking ahead of the meeting , obama said he was " here to listen , to share ideas , and jointly - as one of many nato allies - to help shape our vision for the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato talks will focus on afghanistan security obama described germany as an exemplary ally in afghanistan , which has suffered increasing violence since the us-led invasion of 2001 .
merkel noted that germany , which currently has over 3,500 troops deployed in the country 's north , had a " huge responsibility " and would " face up to this responsibility in military terms as well . "
however , obama also held the door open for us demands from european partners in comments that signaled washington 's resolve to change strategy .
" we will all now have to make additional and sustainable efforts to succeed ...
our role is not to occupy afghanistan , " but to prevent it from becoming a safe-haven for terrorists , " the us leader said .
" if we discover that the approach we are taking is not effective , it 's not working , then we will change it . "
germany has balked at sending more troops to afghanistan , where the nato-led international security assistance force is struggling to contain an escalating taliban insurgency while reconstructing the country .
however , merkel said she " welcomed " the us plans to change its strategy there .
nato politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey does n't want rasmussen as nato head on a separate issue likely to plague nato leaders , merkel said the western military alliance should choose its next leader this friday .
" i am convinced we should name a new secretary-general tonight , " merkel said , adding that danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen would make an " excellent choice . "
rasmussen 's nomination has angered the north atlantic treaty organization 's only islamic member-state , turkey .
ankara regards the danish premier as one of turkey 's principle detractors in the european union .
obama 's star appeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama held a town-hall style meeting in france obama 's brief meeting with merkel was preceded by talks with french president nicolas sarkozy in strasbourg .
in both countries he was accompanied by cheering crowds , confirming the us leader 's superstar status in europe .
smiling and visibly touched as he walked through the french city , obama greeted spectators with handshakes and calls of " nice to see you " and " it 's good to be here . "
at one point , he even leaned into the crowd to kiss a young woman .
the latest bi-monthly tracking poll , conducted by the german public broadcast network ard -lrb- of which deutsche welle is a member -rrb- , found that 82 percent of germans were looking forward to obama 's visit this week , and just over three-quarters said they wished germany could produce a politician like him .
in a vote of confidence that german politicians could only dream of , four out of five germans said they were pleased with obama 's performance in his first two months in office , and nearly nine out of ten said that obama had set the us back on the right track. nw / sh / dpa / rtr / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they ’ re still skeptical on keeping troops in afghanistan . germans remain impressed with barack obama , think france is their most trustworthy partner among nations , and support nato – but not their country 's participation in the alliance 's afghan military mission .
that 's according to the new deutschlandtrend survey , a bi-monthly poll that tracks german opinions on newsworthy topics conducted by the public broadcast network ard -lrb- of which deutsche welle is a member -rrb- .
a robust 84 percent of germans believe nato is important as an instrument of keeping stability and peace within europe .
and 61 percent think nato should keep looking after afghanistan .
but just 32 percent want to keep german troops in that country , a full ten percent less than the month before .
as croatia and slovenia prepare for their initiation into nato this week , germans said they were wary of expanding nato further .
only 36 percent agreed to the proposition that nato should take on additional members from eastern europe and the balkans .
if these views seem to be at odds with the policy aims of the united states , who would like to see an expanded european military role in afghanistan and a bigger nato , that has not soured germans on the new us president barack obama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is excited to greet barack obama four out of five germans are pleased with the performance of obama in his first two months in office , and nearly nine out of ten said that obama had set the us back on the right track .
82 percent were looking forward to obama 's visit to germany this week for the nato summit , and just over three-quarters said they wished germany could produce a politician like him .
the obama effect may have helped the us out in the survey 's question about which countries germans consider to be trusted partners .
78 percent said they saw the us as such , continuing an upward trend since george w. bush 's team left office .
the country that led the list , however , was france .
87 percent of germans say their western neighbor is a trusted partner , up just slightly from the previous month .
germany and france are co-hosting this weekend 's nato summit , and have forged a very close relationship in economic policy-setting in recent months .
german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy presented a forceful , united front in the run-up to this week 's g20 summit , and achieved most of their goals to tighten international financial regulation .
however , when germans were asked who they thought was most likely to come up with a solution to getting out of the global economic crisis , they went back to their first love : barack obama .
80 percent of germans thought he was likely to devise an effective plan , compared with 58 percent for angela merkel , 55 percent for the european union , and 49 percent for social democratic challenger for the chancellorship in this autumn 's general election , frank-walter steinmeier .
the survey was conducted on the 30th and 31st of march , polled 1000 germans , and has a margin of error of 1.4-3.1 percent . mh / rg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the approval , which follows similar action by the lower house 11 days ago , comes after the government took an 8.7 percent stake in the shaky lender as a first step in gaining full control .
the german government has given the munich-based bank 87 billion euros -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- in state guarantees since it got into difficulties in october 2008 .
the financial sector provided a further 15 billion euros .
nationalization deemed necessary hypo real estate chalked up a loss of 5.5 billion euros in 2008 , the biggest of any german firm .
experts have said that the bank will collapse without government intervention .
the law will expire by the end of june , meaning a takeover would have to be initiated before then .
in return for the funds it has put into the bank , the german government wants to take full control in order to ensure that shareholders can not block restructuring measures .
such a move has been opposed by us investor christopher flowers , who owns nearly 24 percent of the bank and feels a government stake of 75 percent plus one share would be sufficient .
flowers has lost 1 billion euros since he paid 22.5 euros per share for his stake at the start of the global financial crisis .
on friday , hypo real estate 's shares stood at 1.31 euros .
hypo real estate 's main business includes lending money to municipalities to build highways , schools and other infrastructure projects . dc / sh , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the approval , which follows similar action by the lower house 11 days ago , comes after the government took an 8.7 percent stake in the shaky lender as a first step in gaining full control .
the german government has given the munich-based bank 87 billion euros -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- in state guarantees since it got into difficulties in october 2008 .
the financial sector provided a further 15 billion euros .
nationalization deemed necessary hypo real estate chalked up a loss of 5.5 billion euros in 2008 , the biggest of any german firm .
experts have said that the bank will collapse without government intervention .
the law will expire by the end of june , meaning a takeover would have to be initiated before then .
in return for the funds it has put into the bank , the german government wants to take full control in order to ensure that shareholders can not block restructuring measures .
such a move has been opposed by us investor christopher flowers , who owns nearly 24 percent of the bank and feels a government stake of 75 percent plus one share would be sufficient .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 03.04.2009 germans positive about nato leaders , dislike afghanistan mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel will have to consider conflicting german opinions on nato an influential survey finds that germans support nato , and hold france and especially new us president barack obama in high esteem .
but they ’ re still skeptical on keeping troops in afghanistan . germans remain impressed with barack obama , think france is their most trustworthy partner among nations , and support nato – but not their country 's participation in the alliance 's afghan military mission .
that 's according to the new deutschlandtrend survey , a bi-monthly poll that tracks german opinions on newsworthy topics conducted by the public broadcast network ard -lrb- of which deutsche welle is a member -rrb- .
a robust 84 percent of germans believe nato is important as an instrument of keeping stability and peace within europe .
and 61 percent think nato should keep looking after afghanistan .
but just 32 percent want to keep german troops in that country , a full ten percent less than the month before .
as croatia and slovenia prepare for their initiation into nato this week , germans said they were wary of expanding nato further .

" the nato summit is not a pledging conference , but of course we 'll be talking about how our allies can match their resources to the needs identified in the -lrb- us -rrb- strategic review , " clinton said ahead of her arrival in strasbourg , france .
clinton is to accompany us president barack obama to the summit , which takes place in strasbourg and in the neighbouring german cities of kehl and baden baden .
clinton wants " highest and best " contribution the us currently provides about half of all the forces taking part in nato 's 62,000-strong international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission in afghanistan .
obama has vowed to deploy an additional 17,000 troops , as well as 4,000 more experts to train afghan security forces .
officials in washington hope that , by setting an example , their european allies will follow .
" what we decided to do was to give the nato allies , eu members , countries in the region , everyone who we think has a stake in the future of afghanistan , to do their own internal review and to take a hard look at what they believe is their highest and best contribution , " clinton said .
united states national security advisor james jones said additional help would be particularly needed in the summer , when afghans go to the polls to vote on whether to renew the mandate of president hamid karzai .
" we have a national election coming up .
allies are considering how they might reinforce themselves ... so i expect there will be additional troop contributions , " jones said .

he also found time to soak up adoration from the crowds . united states president barack obama has tried to assuage german concerns that washington will use this weekend 's nato summit to press berlin for more troops to secure afghanistan .
" i do n't come bearing grand designs , " obama said at a joint press conference with chancellor angela merkel in the western german town of baden-baden on friday .
the deteriorating situation in afghanistan was expected to be one of the main topics at nato 's 60th anniversary meeting , held symbolically in the french city of strasbourg and the german towns of baden-baden and kehl .
speaking ahead of the meeting , obama said he was " here to listen , to share ideas , and jointly - as one of many nato allies - to help shape our vision for the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato talks will focus on afghanistan security obama described germany as an exemplary ally in afghanistan , which has suffered increasing violence since the us-led invasion of 2001 .
merkel noted that germany , which currently has over 3,500 troops deployed in the country 's north , had a " huge responsibility " and would " face up to this responsibility in military terms as well . "
however , obama also held the door open for us demands from european partners in comments that signaled washington 's resolve to change strategy .
" we will all now have to make additional and sustainable efforts to succeed ...
our role is not to occupy afghanistan , " but to prevent it from becoming a safe-haven for terrorists , " the us leader said .
" if we discover that the approach we are taking is not effective , it 's not working , then we will change it . "
germany has balked at sending more troops to afghanistan , where the nato-led international security assistance force is struggling to contain an escalating taliban insurgency while reconstructing the country .
however , merkel said she " welcomed " the us plans to change its strategy there .
nato politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey does n't want rasmussen as nato head on a separate issue likely to plague nato leaders , merkel said the western military alliance should choose its next leader this friday .
" i am convinced we should name a new secretary-general tonight , " merkel said , adding that danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen would make an " excellent choice . "
rasmussen 's nomination has angered the north atlantic treaty organization 's only islamic member-state , turkey .
ankara regards the danish premier as one of turkey 's principle detractors in the european union .
obama 's star appeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama held a town-hall style meeting in france obama 's brief meeting with merkel was preceded by talks with french president nicolas sarkozy in strasbourg .
in both countries he was accompanied by cheering crowds , confirming the us leader 's superstar status in europe .
smiling and visibly touched as he walked through the french city , obama greeted spectators with handshakes and calls of " nice to see you " and " it 's good to be here . "
at one point , he even leaned into the crowd to kiss a young woman .
the latest bi-monthly tracking poll , conducted by the german public broadcast network ard -lrb- of which deutsche welle is a member -rrb- , found that 82 percent of germans were looking forward to obama 's visit this week , and just over three-quarters said they wished germany could produce a politician like him .

" i do n't come bearing grand designs , " obama said at a joint press conference with chancellor angela merkel in the western german town of baden-baden on friday .
the deteriorating situation in afghanistan was expected to be one of the main topics at nato 's 60th anniversary meeting , held symbolically in the french city of strasbourg and the german towns of baden-baden and kehl .

" the nato summit is not a pledging conference , but of course we 'll be talking about how our allies can match their resources to the needs identified in the -lrb- us -rrb- strategic review , " clinton said ahead of her arrival in strasbourg , france .
clinton is to accompany us president barack obama to the summit , which takes place in strasbourg and in the neighbouring german cities of kehl and baden baden .
clinton wants " highest and best " contribution the us currently provides about half of all the forces taking part in nato 's 62,000-strong international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission in afghanistan .
obama has vowed to deploy an additional 17,000 troops , as well as 4,000 more experts to train afghan security forces .
officials in washington hope that , by setting an example , their european allies will follow .
" what we decided to do was to give the nato allies , eu members , countries in the region , everyone who we think has a stake in the future of afghanistan , to do their own internal review and to take a hard look at what they believe is their highest and best contribution , " clinton said .
united states national security advisor james jones said additional help would be particularly needed in the summer , when afghans go to the polls to vote on whether to renew the mandate of president hamid karzai .
" we have a national election coming up .
allies are considering how they might reinforce themselves ... so i expect there will be additional troop contributions , " jones said .

but they ’ re still skeptical on keeping troops in afghanistan . germans remain impressed with barack obama , think france is their most trustworthy partner among nations , and support nato – but not their country 's participation in the alliance 's afghan military mission .
that 's according to the new deutschlandtrend survey , a bi-monthly poll that tracks german opinions on newsworthy topics conducted by the public broadcast network ard -lrb- of which deutsche welle is a member -rrb- .
a robust 84 percent of germans believe nato is important as an instrument of keeping stability and peace within europe .
and 61 percent think nato should keep looking after afghanistan .
but just 32 percent want to keep german troops in that country , a full ten percent less than the month before .
as croatia and slovenia prepare for their initiation into nato this week , germans said they were wary of expanding nato further .
only 36 percent agreed to the proposition that nato should take on additional members from eastern europe and the balkans .
if these views seem to be at odds with the policy aims of the united states , who would like to see an expanded european military role in afghanistan and a bigger nato , that has not soured germans on the new us president barack obama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is excited to greet barack obama four out of five germans are pleased with the performance of obama in his first two months in office , and nearly nine out of ten said that obama had set the us back on the right track .
82 percent were looking forward to obama 's visit to germany this week for the nato summit , and just over three-quarters said they wished germany could produce a politician like him .
the obama effect may have helped the us out in the survey 's question about which countries germans consider to be trusted partners .
78 percent said they saw the us as such , continuing an upward trend since george w. bush 's team left office .
the country that led the list , however , was france .
87 percent of germans say their western neighbor is a trusted partner , up just slightly from the previous month .
germany and france are co-hosting this weekend 's nato summit , and have forged a very close relationship in economic policy-setting in recent months .
german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy presented a forceful , united front in the run-up to this week 's g20 summit , and achieved most of their goals to tighten international financial regulation .
however , when germans were asked who they thought was most likely to come up with a solution to getting out of the global economic crisis , they went back to their first love : barack obama .
80 percent of germans thought he was likely to devise an effective plan , compared with 58 percent for angela merkel , 55 percent for the european union , and 49 percent for social democratic challenger for the chancellorship in this autumn 's general election , frank-walter steinmeier .
the survey was conducted on the 30th and 31st of march , polled 1000 germans , and has a margin of error of 1.4-3.1 percent . mh / rg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this german ad urges people to " do it safely ! "
lombardi went on to question whether belgium 's lawmakers had paid enough attention to the pope 's arguments when they overwhelmingly approved the resolution .
he also inquired as to whether the belgian parliament had obtained its information from “ non-objective ” western media sources . during his trip to africa last month , benedict xvi said aids " can not be overcome by the distribution of condoms , ” adding that “ on the contrary , they increase the problem " . unprecedented condemnations the comments led to unprecedented condemnations in editorials in the new york times , the washington post and many other publications , and a storm of criticism by officials and politicians in a number of countries . the vatican , however , continues to defend the pope 's words , saying that a rejection of contraception " maintains the position of benedict 's predecessors .

" the nato summit is not a pledging conference , but of course we 'll be talking about how our allies can match their resources to the needs identified in the -lrb- us -rrb- strategic review , " clinton said ahead of her arrival in strasbourg , france .
clinton is to accompany us president barack obama to the summit , which takes place in strasbourg and in the neighbouring german cities of kehl and baden baden .
clinton wants " highest and best " contribution the us currently provides about half of all the forces taking part in nato 's 62,000-strong international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission in afghanistan .
obama has vowed to deploy an additional 17,000 troops , as well as 4,000 more experts to train afghan security forces .
officials in washington hope that , by setting an example , their european allies will follow .
" what we decided to do was to give the nato allies , eu members , countries in the region , everyone who we think has a stake in the future of afghanistan , to do their own internal review and to take a hard look at what they believe is their highest and best contribution , " clinton said .
united states national security advisor james jones said additional help would be particularly needed in the summer , when afghans go to the polls to vote on whether to renew the mandate of president hamid karzai .
" we have a national election coming up .
allies are considering how they might reinforce themselves ... so i expect there will be additional troop contributions , " jones said .

the vote will be the first democratic national election staged in the african country in more than 20 years . " the electoral process starts this april and will finish in february 2010 , " abdullah ahmed abdullah , deputy head of the electoral commission , told news agency afp .
the sudanese people will elect a president , the head of the semi-autonomous south , the national assembly and the south sudanese parliament and local governors .
according to the 2005 comprehensive peace agreement -lrb- cpa -rrb- that ended over two decades of civil war between north and south sudan , elections were to have taken place this year .
however , a un panel of experts suggested at the end of last year that sudan delay the elections by at least four months because of expected heavy rains and logistical problems .
party officials welcomed the decision despite a lack of coordination .
" we are welcoming the decision and we respect the decision of the commission , but they did not negotiate with us the timetable , " ibrahim gandur , a senior official of incumbent president omar al-bashir 's ruling national congress party -lrb- ncp -rrb- told afp .
" there is enough time for transparent elections , and it can be monitored by -lrb- local monitors -rrb- and foreigners , " he said .

part one of dw-world 's nato retrospective looks at the years 1949 to 1989 . washington , april 4 , 1949 .
in a celebratory atmosphere , the foreign ministers of 12 north american and european countries signed the founding documents of the north atlantic treaty organization , or nato .
even if world war ii was still fresh in the minds of those involved , nato 's biggest enemy was n't demilitarized germany , but the soviet union .
for western europe , there was no alternative to this alliance with the united states , said former british foreign secretary ernest bevin in a radio broadcast .
“ what were peace- and freedom-loving nations to do ? ” he asked .
“ stand by and wait for one after the other to be destroyed ?
or build a system of collective security that would bind their people together in strong resistance against this threat ?
we decided in favor of this second way . ”
the nato community bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato saw itself as a group with common values central to the treaty is article 5 , which outlines the principle of collective defense .
the article says that an attack on any member shall be considered to be an attack on all .
how exactly the members contribute to the defense of the member under attack is left up to the discretion of the member states .
from its inception , nato saw itself as a community bound by common values .
despite this , non-democratic states were admitted to the fold , and not just for strategic reasons , according to the german military expert , franz-josef meiers .
“ inwardly , values play a very important role , ” he said .
“ membership was supposed to fast-track the democratization process in countries such as spain or greece . ”
germany was a special case .
though it was destroyed in the war and demilitarized , it was nonetheless indispensable to nato because of its long-term strategic value .
on may 9 , 1955 , former german chancellor konrad adenauer arrived in paris to sign the membership declaration for his country .
hans speidel , who would later serve as nato commander during the cold war before his death in 1984 , was once asked to describe the moment . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they ’ re still skeptical on keeping troops in afghanistan . germans remain impressed with barack obama , think france is their most trustworthy partner among nations , and support nato – but not their country 's participation in the alliance 's afghan military mission .
that 's according to the new deutschlandtrend survey , a bi-monthly poll that tracks german opinions on newsworthy topics conducted by the public broadcast network ard -lrb- of which deutsche welle is a member -rrb- .
a robust 84 percent of germans believe nato is important as an instrument of keeping stability and peace within europe .
and 61 percent think nato should keep looking after afghanistan .
but just 32 percent want to keep german troops in that country , a full ten percent less than the month before .
as croatia and slovenia prepare for their initiation into nato this week , germans said they were wary of expanding nato further .
only 36 percent agreed to the proposition that nato should take on additional members from eastern europe and the balkans .
if these views seem to be at odds with the policy aims of the united states , who would like to see an expanded european military role in afghanistan and a bigger nato , that has not soured germans on the new us president barack obama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is excited to greet barack obama four out of five germans are pleased with the performance of obama in his first two months in office , and nearly nine out of ten said that obama had set the us back on the right track .
82 percent were looking forward to obama 's visit to germany this week for the nato summit , and just over three-quarters said they wished germany could produce a politician like him .
the obama effect may have helped the us out in the survey 's question about which countries germans consider to be trusted partners .
78 percent said they saw the us as such , continuing an upward trend since george w. bush 's team left office .
the country that led the list , however , was france .
87 percent of germans say their western neighbor is a trusted partner , up just slightly from the previous month .
germany and france are co-hosting this weekend 's nato summit , and have forged a very close relationship in economic policy-setting in recent months .
german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy presented a forceful , united front in the run-up to this week 's g20 summit , and achieved most of their goals to tighten international financial regulation .
however , when germans were asked who they thought was most likely to come up with a solution to getting out of the global economic crisis , they went back to their first love : barack obama .
80 percent of germans thought he was likely to devise an effective plan , compared with 58 percent for angela merkel , 55 percent for the european union , and 49 percent for social democratic challenger for the chancellorship in this autumn 's general election , frank-walter steinmeier .
the survey was conducted on the 30th and 31st of march , polled 1000 germans , and has a margin of error of 1.4-3.1 percent . mh / rg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 07 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

his first task will be to get beyond the company 's ongoing spying scandal . germany 's transport ministry on thursday endorsed fifty-seven year-old ruediger grube , a top executive at carmaker daimler , as the new head of the state-owned railway operator , deutsche bahn .
the ministry said chancellor angela merkel and key government officials had agreed wednesday evening on grube for the hot-seat , replacing hartmut mehdorn , 66 , who tendered his resignation this week after deutsche bahn admitted to the illicit surveillance of its employees .
mehdorn resigned on monday after being unable to end discussions on whether the company spied on employees ' emails from 2005 to 2008 and blocked messages from unions during a 2007 labor dispute .
grube is currently responsible for company strategy at automaker daimler .
he is also on the board of directors at european aircraft manufacturer eads .
grube has close ties to mehdorn himself , having served as his office manager at another company - and the possibility grube could become the successor to his former boss drew immediate protest from the opposition green party .
" this is not a new beginning , mrs. merkel , " green parliamentary leader renate kuenast told news agency reporters .
" with mehdorn 's former assistant , there 's the threat of more of the same . "
the deutsche bahn in general - and mehdorn himself - are currently under investigation in relation to the spying allegations .
leading politicians and labor unions have called for thorough scrutiny into deutsche bahn 's allegedly comprehensive surveillance of its own employees .
troubleshooter ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accusations over employee surveillance are casting a shadow over deutsche bahn but beyond being an associate of mehdorn , who is ruediger grube ?
born in the northern german city of hamburg , his career began with an apprenticeship in airplane construction .
in the late 1980s and early 1990s , he began working for daimler 's aeronautics division as well as for airbus - now an eads subsidiary .
he has been on daimler 's board of directors since 2001 and a top eads executive for the past year and a half .
grube 's background has drawn criticism from people hoping someone with a background in the rail industry would take over deutsche bahn .
" after ten years of mehdorn , there 's no need for another would-be high-flyer from the aeronautics sector , " kuenast told reporters .
there has been no word on when grube will be put forward as mehdorn 's successor. nrt / jc / sh -lrb- ap / dpa / rtr / afp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the list was endorsed by the g20 leaders at their summit in london . " president hans-rudolf merz regrets this procedure , " the swiss finance ministry said in a statement late thursday , april 2 .
" the list does not specify the criteria on the basis of which it was drawn up .
switzerland is not a tax haven .
it always meets its obligations and is always ready to engage in dialogue . "
luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker was also indignant on friday , saying his country 's inclusion on the list was " incomprehensible . "
he reiterated his criticism of the way the lists were drawn up , remarking that several us states with tax-friendly laws were not put on either list while luxembourg was .
g20 approved three-tier list the " grey list " is one part of a three-tier list categorizing tax havens and financial centers by their degree of cooperation with internationally agreed tax standards set out by the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
the list was endorsed by the group of 20 leading industrialized and emerging nations at their summit in london after they pledged to take action including sanctions against non-cooperative jurisdictions , including tax havens , using information from the oecd as its basis .
the oecd has placed costa rica , malaysia , the philippines and uruguay on its blacklist of non-cooperative tax havens .
in addition to switzerland and luxembourg , austria , belgium , singapore , chile , the cayman islands , liechtenstein and monaco are included on the grey list of countries that have agreed to improve transparency standards but have not yet signed the necessary international accords .
china is on a third " white list " of jurisdictions that have substantially implemented the tax standards .
austrian finance minister josef proell downplayed his country 's inclusion on the grey list and said it did not affect the country 's banking secrecy laws .
" the talks are over for us because the proof is there on the grey list that we have taken steps in the right direction , " he told journalists as he arrived in prague for a meeting of euro zone finance ministers . dc / th , afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the once independent french military already cooperates with nato members .
one example : the german-french brigade . the photos of former german chancellor helmut kohl , former french president francois mitterrand and countless defense ministers from germany and france in the brigade 's headquarters in muellheim are the proof : politicians enjoy coming to this town in the southern corner of germany that meets france and switzerland . what french and german soldiers do here is still unique in europe , even 20 years after the establishment of the german-french brigade .
europe 's only bi-national unit is made up of some 5,000 soldiers from germany and france .
when the project was conceived in 1989 by kohl and mitterrand , there was nothing else like it .
one unit , two nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl -lrb- left -rrb- and mitterand were among the many visitors to muellheim the difficulties from those days , such as language problems , are still big challenges for the unit 's current commander , gen. andreas berg . as foresighted as the brigade may be in terms of providing the basis for a future european army , language issues never seem to go away .
just look at barracks security .
the german-french security crew at the gate can often only communicate with sign language , because the german does n't speak any french , and his french comrade does n't speak german .
the troops are actually meant to be able to work in two foreign languages , with english being the lingua franca in international matters of business . for 20 years now , the troops have been practicing their cooperation , but in that time , the soldiers have only twice been sent abroad together : to bosnia-herzegovina and afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marching in unison 's no problem , but talking can be only when the ministries of defense in berlin and paris agree on a mission does the brigade get the green light .
these joint operations are now so far in the past that most of the soldiers who participated in them have since moved on to other posts . this makes veterans in muellheim , such as the french sgt. maj. robert lenhardt , impatient .
lenhardt said it bothers him that the brigade is always presented as a showcase project at official events .
in reality , he said , it 's politics that prevent more action . " we can sleep in the same barracks and eat in the same canteen , no problem , " he said .
" but anyone can do that ; just go on vacation in the summertime .
we 're soldiers and we 're there for a certain purpose , and we never get to put it to the test . " waiting for a common mission unlike many of his colleagues , lenhardt moves easily in the german-french environment .
such " bridge builders " in the brigade are often found among the unit 's management .
there , bilateral cooperation is a matter of course , because at higher levels , there are no language difficulties .
the average soldier , on the other hand , typically only sees his colleagues from the neighboring country at meals or while playing sports . soon , the brigade will also have a location in france .
french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel plan to permanently station around 700 bundeswehr soldiers in alsace .
many in muellheim hope that the location in strasbourg will be a further symbolic step forward that will give the brigade new momentum . author : andreas noll -lrb- dc -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 03.04.2009 german-french brigade hopes to move beyond showcase status großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two countries , one mission : the insignia of the franco-german brigade france is marking its return to the alliance 's military command at nato anniversary celebrations .
but the once independent french military already cooperates with nato members .
one example : the german-french brigade . the photos of former german chancellor helmut kohl , former french president francois mitterrand and countless defense ministers from germany and france in the brigade 's headquarters in muellheim are the proof : politicians enjoy coming to this town in the southern corner of germany that meets france and switzerland . what french and german soldiers do here is still unique in europe , even 20 years after the establishment of the german-french brigade .
europe 's only bi-national unit is made up of some 5,000 soldiers from germany and france .
when the project was conceived in 1989 by kohl and mitterrand , there was nothing else like it .
one unit , two nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl -lrb- left -rrb- and mitterand were among the many visitors to muellheim the difficulties from those days , such as language problems , are still big challenges for the unit 's current commander , gen. andreas berg . as foresighted as the brigade may be in terms of providing the basis for a future european army , language issues never seem to go away .
just look at barracks security .
the german-french security crew at the gate can often only communicate with sign language , because the german does n't speak any french , and his french comrade does n't speak german .
the troops are actually meant to be able to work in two foreign languages , with english being the lingua franca in international matters of business . for 20 years now , the troops have been practicing their cooperation , but in that time , the soldiers have only twice been sent abroad together : to bosnia-herzegovina and afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marching in unison 's no problem , but talking can be only when the ministries of defense in berlin and paris agree on a mission does the brigade get the green light .
these joint operations are now so far in the past that most of the soldiers who participated in them have since moved on to other posts . this makes veterans in muellheim , such as the french sgt. maj. robert lenhardt , impatient .
lenhardt said it bothers him that the brigade is always presented as a showcase project at official events .
in reality , he said , it 's politics that prevent more action . " we can sleep in the same barracks and eat in the same canteen , no problem , " he said .
" but anyone can do that ; just go on vacation in the summertime .
we 're soldiers and we 're there for a certain purpose , and we never get to put it to the test . " waiting for a common mission unlike many of his colleagues , lenhardt moves easily in the german-french environment .
such " bridge builders " in the brigade are often found among the unit 's management .
there , bilateral cooperation is a matter of course , because at higher levels , there are no language difficulties .
the average soldier , on the other hand , typically only sees his colleagues from the neighboring country at meals or while playing sports . soon , the brigade will also have a location in france .
french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel plan to permanently station around 700 bundeswehr soldiers in alsace .
many in muellheim hope that the location in strasbourg will be a further symbolic step forward that will give the brigade new momentum . author : andreas noll -lrb- dc -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if obama had hoped for more french troop commitments , he was to be disappointed . us president barack obama and his french counterpart nicolas sarkozy have held their first face-to face meeting in the french city of strasbourg , leading up to a cross-border nato summit .
at a joint press conference after their talks , obama said he wanted europe to improve its capabilities in nato as much as possible .
" we want strong allies .
we would like to see europe have much more robust defense capabilities , " he said .
obama praised the french president 's " courageous " leadership on afghanistan , and said that france , the united states ' oldest ally , had " once again taken an extraordinary leadership role in nato . "
president sarkozy welcomed obama at a red carpet reception on friday at strasbourg 's majestic palais de rohan , where a company of soldiers accorded him full military honors .
sarkozy stressed that while there would be no french military reinforcements in afghanistan , paris was enthusiastic about contributing more to police training and providing economic aid .

the approval , which follows similar action by the lower house 11 days ago , comes after the government took an 8.7 percent stake in the shaky lender as a first step in gaining full control .
the german government has given the munich-based bank 87 billion euros -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- in state guarantees since it got into difficulties in october 2008 .
the financial sector provided a further 15 billion euros .
nationalization deemed necessary hypo real estate chalked up a loss of 5.5 billion euros in 2008 , the biggest of any german firm .
experts have said that the bank will collapse without government intervention .
the law will expire by the end of june , meaning a takeover would have to be initiated before then .
in return for the funds it has put into the bank , the german government wants to take full control in order to ensure that shareholders can not block restructuring measures .
such a move has been opposed by us investor christopher flowers , who owns nearly 24 percent of the bank and feels a government stake of 75 percent plus one share would be sufficient .
flowers has lost 1 billion euros since he paid 22.5 euros per share for his stake at the start of the global financial crisis .
on friday , hypo real estate 's shares stood at 1.31 euros .
hypo real estate 's main business includes lending money to municipalities to build highways , schools and other infrastructure projects . dc / sh , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

part one of dw-world 's nato retrospective looks at the years 1949 to 1989 . washington , april 4 , 1949 .
in a celebratory atmosphere , the foreign ministers of 12 north american and european countries signed the founding documents of the north atlantic treaty organization , or nato .
even if world war ii was still fresh in the minds of those involved , nato 's biggest enemy was n't demilitarized germany , but the soviet union .
for western europe , there was no alternative to this alliance with the united states , said former british foreign secretary ernest bevin in a radio broadcast .
“ what were peace- and freedom-loving nations to do ? ” he asked .
“ stand by and wait for one after the other to be destroyed ?
or build a system of collective security that would bind their people together in strong resistance against this threat ?
we decided in favor of this second way . ”
the nato community bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato saw itself as a group with common values central to the treaty is article 5 , which outlines the principle of collective defense .
the article says that an attack on any member shall be considered to be an attack on all .
how exactly the members contribute to the defense of the member under attack is left up to the discretion of the member states .
from its inception , nato saw itself as a community bound by common values .
despite this , non-democratic states were admitted to the fold , and not just for strategic reasons , according to the german military expert , franz-josef meiers .
“ inwardly , values play a very important role , ” he said .
“ membership was supposed to fast-track the democratization process in countries such as spain or greece . ”
germany was a special case .
though it was destroyed in the war and demilitarized , it was nonetheless indispensable to nato because of its long-term strategic value .
on may 9 , 1955 , former german chancellor konrad adenauer arrived in paris to sign the membership declaration for his country .

he takes over as leader at a time when the country and its coalition government , which has ruled since 1957 , are facing big challenges .
the malaysian economy is suffering , and last year the main ruling party - which mr najib now leads - lost its crucial two-thirds majority in parliament .
that defeat led to the decision of the previous prime minister , abdullah badawi , to resign .
mr najib is also facing claims of corruption and an opposition allegation linking him in some way with the murder of a mongolian woman - all of which he has strenuously denied .

" i will be true to malaysia and will defend and uphold the constitution , " he said .
the main ruling party , the united malays national organisation -lrb- umno -rrb- , is bitterly divided and has been told by mr badawi that it must reform or lose power .
mr najib 's challenge will be to galvanise the party and reignite its links to broader malaysian society .
recent malaysian reports suggest he has already taken steps in this direction by visiting malaysian chinese newspapers and speaking of the need to unite malaysia 's many races and groups .
malaysia also faces intense economic problems as its exports decline amid the world financial meltdown .
last month he unveiled a stimulus package worth $ 16.2bn -lrb- £ 11bn -rrb- .
mr najib 's first test of his own popularity will be during three special elections - one for parliament and two for state assemblies - on 7 april .
mr najib comes from a respected political dynasty and is the son and nephew of two former prime ministers .

do muslims vote as a community ?
political scientist yogendra yadav examines six myths surrounding the indian elections .
a myth is a story or trend that a culture believes to be true .
but it has also taken on the meaning of a popular conception that may have become exaggerated if not downright false .
the reason why there is so much myth making around politics and elections in india is partly because indians are passionate about politics .
it is also because there is very little hard evidence on political behaviour .
when it comes to politics , anything goes .
here are the six most popular myths about indian politics and elections : women vote according to the wishes of their husbands it is true that in india , like many democracies , the levels of interest and involvement of women in politics is lower than that of men .
obviously , if you are less interested in something , you tend you go by somebody else 's advice - in the case of women in india it may be the advice of men in their family .
but we can not conclude that all - or almost all - women go by whatever their husbands ask them to do and so therefore are not really an independent factor in politics .
for one , the level of involvement of women in politics has risen sharply in the past two decades or so : the turnout of women during polling used to be a good 10 percentage points below the turnout of men ; and now , the gap is barely two to three .
today , more women turn out to vote than men in many states .
second , if it were true that all women were to follow their men in their voting preference , we would not find any difference in the level of support for different parties among men and women .
but surveys over the past 40 years have consistently shown a difference in levels of support for major political parties among men and women .
congress , for example , has always got more votes from women than from men since the days of former prime minister indira gandhi or even earlier .
the communist party of india -lrb- marxist -rrb- in bengal , the regional rashtriya janata dal -lrb- rjd -rrb- in bihar , and the aiadmk party in tamil nadu led by former actress jayalalitha , are some of the parties who get more votes from women than from men .
since the early 1970s , researchers from delhi 's centre for developing societies have asked women voters whose advise they seek while casting their ballots .
the evidence shows that fewer than 50 % of women today go by the advice of their husband or any men in their family .
muslims vote heavily and as a bloc we simply have no good evidence to prove that muslims vote more than the majority hindus .
this perception comes from seeing long queues at polling stations in some muslim majority urban areas where community voters , especially the poor and women , tend to be very visible .
research shows that in most elections after 1996 , the turnout of muslim voters has actually been a little lower than that of hindus .
the other perception about muslims voting en bloc has an element of truth .
any minority community tends to flock together , consult among themselves , and has a great sense of community .
this applies to muslims as much as it applies to sikhs in delhi , hindu pundits in indian-administered kashmir and to bengalis in north-eastern india .
but it is simply not true that there is anything like a muslim bloc at national level .
if there is one striking thing about indian muslims , it is the fact that unlike most minorities in most democracies around the world , indian muslims have not voted for muslim parties .
they have had their preferred political parties - congress used to be one of those parties , and now there are many .
also , muslims in india do not vote en bloc like , say , the black vote in the us for the democratic party or the uk 's ethnic minorities who largely vote for the labour party .
politically speaking , there is no single unified muslim community in india .
muslims are fragmented along the lines of religion , sect , caste and community .
in the past two decades , muslim voters have chosen different parties in different states : the cpi -lrb- m -rrb- in bengal , the rjd in bihar , the regional samajwadi party -lrb- sp -rrb- in uttar pradesh , the dmk party in tamil nadu and the congress in other parts of the country .
in other words , it is an exaggeration to say there is one unified muslim vote in the country .
the young vote distinctly and independently there is a perception that youth constitute a distinct political bloc with unique and independent political preferences and views .
two-thirds of indians are below the age of 35 .
that itself is no basis for concluding that the young are distinct and different from the rest of the population in terms of their political opinions , attitudes and behaviour .
i guess we tend to talk about " youth voters " because we import our vocabulary of political analysis from europe where the generational divide is a significant political cleavage of that society .
where a party like the greens primarily rides on the divide of the young versus the old .
this myth also feeds on a perception that youth are supposed to be carriers of change and transformation .
the evidence in india , however , does not confirm any of these beliefs .
there is no evidence to suggest that the young are politically more active than others .
if anything , they are less politically active - obviously they have other anxieties in life , like preparing for a professional career .
indians allow their image of the young to be dominated by the image of the city-bred english-speaking youth , which is very different from the rest of the country .
but we forget that this is a tiny slice of indian youth .
there is no systematic difference between the manner in which the young and the not-so-young vote .
it is true that in many states political parties that are relatively more recent or young tend to get more votes from young people .
but that is only a function of political socialisation : simply because the young were more exposed to that party than people of an older generation who had not even heard its name .
even in terms of opinions , we have simply not found anything like a generational cleavage in indian politics .
the young support democracy in much the same way as the old do .
the young are about as traditional and conservative as the old .
even on questions like inter-caste marriage , the opinions of the young are not actually very different from the rest of the population .
high turnout leads to defeat for the ruling party it is simply a coincidence that the era which has witnessed higher voter turnout at the federal and state level is also the era which has witnessed a higher level of volatility - a tendency for voters to switch from one party to another , leading to ruling governments or incumbent representatives losing the election .
but there is little evidence to suggest that there is a linkage between the two .
it is simply not true that elections that witness high turnout lead to a loss for the ruling party .
take the latest case of madhya pradesh .
in the state elections last year there was a record turnout .
some analysts saw it as evidence of the ruling bjp being thrown out .
the bjp won the polls again .
high voter turnout can be a function of many different things - a spontaneous outpouring of the voters , of intensity of political competition , of greater mobilisation and resources put in by political parties or of greater interest on the part of the voter .
so depending on what led to the higher turnout , you would have different consequences of it .
there is widespread apathy towards politics this is one myth that comes close to being totally false .
the fact is that while in many other democracies in the world , voter turnouts have declined , in india turnouts have either remained stable or have gone up .
if we look at political associations , indians have an amazingly intense attachment to politics .
the proportion of people attached to one party , who feel close to a party , is much higher in india than in many other democracies .
the proportion of people who are members of a political party is much higher in india than in the us and most european democracies .
the proportion of voters who report that they took some part in electoral activity - going to meetings or campaigning - is quite robust .
and the number of people who report that someone came to their house to canvass for votes is very high .
in advanced democracies , as you come down the various tiers - from national to local elections - the turnout of voters goes down .
in india , it is exactly the opposite : the turnout in federal elections tends to be around 60 % , in the state elections it is around 70 % and when it comes to village council elections it is anything upwards of 80 % .
most important , our democracy defies what was once considered a law of political participation in the world : the higher up you are in the socio-economic hierarchy , the more you participate in politics and voting .
in india , evidence shows that the poor " untouchables " vote more than upper castes .
the poor vote as much , if not more , than the urban middle classes .
rural areas vote more than urban areas .
women vote almost as much as men do .
in other words there is no connection between social hierarchy and participation in politics .
rather than voter apathy and indifference , there has been a participatory upsurge for democracy in india .
indians do n't cast their vote , they vote their caste it is true that caste is one of the major determinants of voting behaviour in india .
in certain situations when voters are extremely polarised , it appears to be to the sole consideration .
but the fact is that caste is not quite the sole consideration .
it is certainly untrue that defeat and victory for political parties in elections can be explained by a few caste or community groups switching sides from one party to another .
the reason many feel that caste is powerful is because we use the phrase " caste based vote bank " to mean many things .
in delhi 's politics , the expression " punjabi " -lrb- literally , residents of punjab or people who speak the punjabi language -rrb- is used as if it is a caste .
actually , it is a linguistic group .
people use the word " bihari " -lrb- literally , residents of bihar -rrb- as if it is a caste group .
actually , it is a regional affiliation , or a moniker for poor migrants .
a caste vote can also be a vote against a candidate of a voter 's own caste in favour of a party considered closer to their caste .
so if a person belonging to the yadav caste in bihar votes for a congress party candidate because the candidate is a yadav himself , it is an example of caste voting .
if the same person were to vote for a candidate belonging to the bhumihar caste put up by the regional rashtriya janata dal -lrb- rjd -rrb- - which largely represents the yadav caste - it would be also an example of caste voting .
the evidence on caste voting suggests that caste tends to be a major determinant , specially among the large , visible and powerful caste groups .
the caste-vote trend is towards voting for a party that is considered to be close to their caste or community group .
but the fact remains that most voters in most constituencies in india do not have a simple option of voting along caste lines .
either they have more than one candidate from their own caste or they have none .
they simply can not vote according to their caste .
there has to be a consideration other than caste for almost three-quarters of the voters .
caste provides us with good information on the initial affiliations of social groups .
but across two elections , the increasing votes for one party or defeat of another is not explained by castes changing sides .
when a party goes up in popularity or declines in popularity , it usually wins and loses votes across castes .

do muslims vote as a community ?
political scientist yogendra yadav examines six myths surrounding the indian elections .
women voters outnumber men in many states a myth is a story or trend that a culture believes to be true .
but it has also taken on the meaning of a popular conception that may have become exaggerated if not downright false .
the reason why there is so much myth making around politics and elections in india is partly because indians are passionate about politics .
it is also because there is very little hard evidence on political behaviour .
when it comes to politics , anything goes .
here are the six most popular myths about indian politics and elections : women vote according to the wishes of their husbands it is true that in india , like many democracies , the levels of interest and involvement of women in politics is lower than that of men .
obviously , if you are less interested in something , you tend you go by somebody else 's advice - in the case of women in india it may be the advice of men in their family .
but we can not conclude that all - or almost all - women go by whatever their husbands ask them to do and so therefore are not really an independent factor in politics .
for one , the level of involvement of women in politics has risen sharply in the past two decades or so : the turnout of women during polling used to be a good 10 percentage points below the turnout of men ; and now , the gap is barely two to three .
today , more women turn out to vote than men in many states .
the level of involvement of women in politics has risen sharply second , if it were true that all women were to follow their men in their voting preference , we would not find any difference in the level of support for different parties among men and women .
but surveys over the past 40 years have consistently shown a difference in levels of support for major political parties among men and women .
congress , for example , has always got more votes from women than from men since the days of former prime minister indira gandhi or even earlier .
the communist party of india -lrb- marxist -rrb- in bengal , the regional rashtriya janata dal -lrb- rjd -rrb- in bihar , and the aiadmk party in tamil nadu led by former actress jayalalitha , are some of the parties who get more votes from women than from men .
since the early 1970s , researchers from delhi 's centre for developing societies have asked women voters whose advise they seek while casting their ballots .
the evidence shows that fewer than 50 % of women today go by the advice of their husband or any men in their family .
muslims vote heavily and as a bloc we simply have no good evidence to prove that muslims vote more than the majority hindus .
this perception comes from seeing long queues at polling stations in some muslim majority urban areas where community voters , especially the poor and women , tend to be very visible .
research shows that in most elections after 1996 , the turnout of muslim voters has actually been a little lower than that of hindus .
the other perception about muslims voting en bloc has an element of truth .
the perception that muslims vote en bloc has an element of truth any minority community tends to flock together , consult among themselves , and has a great sense of community .
this applies to muslims as much as it applies to sikhs in delhi , hindu pundits in indian-administered kashmir and to bengalis in north-eastern india .
but it is simply not true that there is anything like a muslim bloc at national level .
if there is one striking thing about indian muslims , it is the fact that unlike most minorities in most democracies around the world , indian muslims have not voted for muslim parties .
they have had their preferred political parties - congress used to be one of those parties , and now there are many .
also , muslims in india do not vote en bloc like , say , the black vote in the us for the democratic party or the uk 's ethnic minorities who largely vote for the labour party .
politically speaking , there is no single unified muslim community in india .
muslims are fragmented along the lines of religion , sect , caste and community .
in the past two decades , muslim voters have chosen different parties in different states : the cpi -lrb- m -rrb- in bengal , the rjd in bihar , the regional samajwadi party -lrb- sp -rrb- in uttar pradesh , the dmk party in tamil nadu and the congress in other parts of the country .
in other words , it is an exaggeration to say there is one unified muslim vote in the country .
the young vote distinctly and independently there is a perception that youth constitute a distinct political bloc with unique and independent political preferences and views .
two-thirds of indians are below the age of 35 .
the young are no more politically active than others that itself is no basis for concluding that the young are distinct and different from the rest of the population in terms of their political opinions , attitudes and behaviour .
i guess we tend to talk about " youth voters " because we import our vocabulary of political analysis from europe where the generational divide is a significant political cleavage of that society .
where a party like the greens primarily rides on the divide of the young versus the old .
this myth also feeds on a perception that youth are supposed to be carriers of change and transformation .
the evidence in india , however , does not confirm any of these beliefs .
there is no evidence to suggest that the young are politically more active than others .
if anything , they are less politically active - obviously they have other anxieties in life , like preparing for a professional career .
indians allow their image of the young to be dominated by the image of the city-bred english-speaking youth , which is very different from the rest of the country .
but we forget that this is a tiny slice of indian youth .
there is no systematic difference between the manner in which the young and the not-so-young vote .
it is true that in many states political parties that are relatively more recent or young tend to get more votes from young people .
but that is only a function of political socialisation : simply because the young were more exposed to that party than people of an older generation who had not even heard its name .
even in terms of opinions , we have simply not found anything like a generational cleavage in indian politics .
the young support democracy in much the same way as the old do .
the young are about as traditional and conservative as the old .
even on questions like inter-caste marriage , the opinions of the young are not actually very different from the rest of the population .
high turnout leads to defeat for the ruling party it is simply a coincidence that the era which has witnessed higher voter turnout at the federal and state level is also the era which has witnessed a higher level of volatility - a tendency for voters to switch from one party to another , leading to ruling governments or incumbent representatives losing the election .
turnout in village council elections is more than 80 % but there is little evidence to suggest that there is a linkage between the two .
it is simply not true that elections that witness high turnout lead to a loss for the ruling party .
take the latest case of madhya pradesh .
in the state elections last year there was a record turnout .
some analysts saw it as evidence of the ruling bjp being thrown out .
the bjp won the polls again .
high voter turnout can be a function of many different things - a spontaneous outpouring of the voters , of intensity of political competition , of greater mobilisation and resources put in by political parties or of greater interest on the part of the voter .
so depending on what led to the higher turnout , you would have different consequences of it .
there is widespread apathy towards politics this is one myth that comes close to being totally false .
the fact is that while in many other democracies in the world , voter turnouts have declined , in india turnouts have either remained stable or have gone up .
if we look at political associations , indians have an amazingly intense attachment to politics .

do muslims vote as a community ?
political scientist yogendra yadav examines six myths surrounding the indian elections .
women voters outnumber men in many states a myth is a story or trend that a culture believes to be true .
but it has also taken on the meaning of a popular conception that may have become exaggerated if not downright false .
the reason why there is so much myth making around politics and elections in india is partly because indians are passionate about politics .
it is also because there is very little hard evidence on political behaviour .
when it comes to politics , anything goes .
here are the six most popular myths about indian politics and elections : women vote according to the wishes of their husbands it is true that in india , like many democracies , the levels of interest and involvement of women in politics is lower than that of men .
obviously , if you are less interested in something , you tend you go by somebody else 's advice - in the case of women in india it may be the advice of men in their family .
but we can not conclude that all - or almost all - women go by whatever their husbands ask them to do and so therefore are not really an independent factor in politics .
for one , the level of involvement of women in politics has risen sharply in the past two decades or so : the turnout of women during polling used to be a good 10 percentage points below the turnout of men ; and now , the gap is barely two to three .
today , more women turn out to vote than men in many states .
the level of involvement of women in politics has risen sharply second , if it were true that all women were to follow their men in their voting preference , we would not find any difference in the level of support for different parties among men and women .
but surveys over the past 40 years have consistently shown a difference in levels of support for major political parties among men and women .
congress , for example , has always got more votes from women than from men since the days of former prime minister indira gandhi or even earlier .
the communist party of india -lrb- marxist -rrb- in bengal , the regional rashtriya janata dal -lrb- rjd -rrb- in bihar , and the aiadmk party in tamil nadu led by former actress jayalalitha , are some of the parties who get more votes from women than from men .
since the early 1970s , researchers from delhi 's centre for developing societies have asked women voters whose advise they seek while casting their ballots .
the evidence shows that fewer than 50 % of women today go by the advice of their husband or any men in their family .
muslims vote heavily and as a bloc we simply have no good evidence to prove that muslims vote more than the majority hindus .
this perception comes from seeing long queues at polling stations in some muslim majority urban areas where community voters , especially the poor and women , tend to be very visible .
research shows that in most elections after 1996 , the turnout of muslim voters has actually been a little lower than that of hindus .
the other perception about muslims voting en bloc has an element of truth .
the perception that muslims vote en bloc has an element of truth any minority community tends to flock together , consult among themselves , and has a great sense of community .
this applies to muslims as much as it applies to sikhs in delhi , hindu pundits in indian-administered kashmir and to bengalis in north-eastern india .
but it is simply not true that there is anything like a muslim bloc at national level .
if there is one striking thing about indian muslims , it is the fact that unlike most minorities in most democracies around the world , indian muslims have not voted for muslim parties .
they have had their preferred political parties - congress used to be one of those parties , and now there are many .
also , muslims in india do not vote en bloc like , say , the black vote in the us for the democratic party or the uk 's ethnic minorities who largely vote for the labour party .
politically speaking , there is no single unified muslim community in india .
muslims are fragmented along the lines of religion , sect , caste and community .
in the past two decades , muslim voters have chosen different parties in different states : the cpi -lrb- m -rrb- in bengal , the rjd in bihar , the regional samajwadi party -lrb- sp -rrb- in uttar pradesh , the dmk party in tamil nadu and the congress in other parts of the country .
in other words , it is an exaggeration to say there is one unified muslim vote in the country .
the young vote distinctly and independently there is a perception that youth constitute a distinct political bloc with unique and independent political preferences and views .
two-thirds of indians are below the age of 35 .
the young are no more politically active than others that itself is no basis for concluding that the young are distinct and different from the rest of the population in terms of their political opinions , attitudes and behaviour .
i guess we tend to talk about " youth voters " because we import our vocabulary of political analysis from europe where the generational divide is a significant political cleavage of that society .
where a party like the greens primarily rides on the divide of the young versus the old .
this myth also feeds on a perception that youth are supposed to be carriers of change and transformation .
the evidence in india , however , does not confirm any of these beliefs .
there is no evidence to suggest that the young are politically more active than others .
if anything , they are less politically active - obviously they have other anxieties in life , like preparing for a professional career .
indians allow their image of the young to be dominated by the image of the city-bred english-speaking youth , which is very different from the rest of the country .
but we forget that this is a tiny slice of indian youth .
there is no systematic difference between the manner in which the young and the not-so-young vote .
it is true that in many states political parties that are relatively more recent or young tend to get more votes from young people .
but that is only a function of political socialisation : simply because the young were more exposed to that party than people of an older generation who had not even heard its name .
even in terms of opinions , we have simply not found anything like a generational cleavage in indian politics .
the young support democracy in much the same way as the old do .
the young are about as traditional and conservative as the old .
even on questions like inter-caste marriage , the opinions of the young are not actually very different from the rest of the population .
high turnout leads to defeat for the ruling party it is simply a coincidence that the era which has witnessed higher voter turnout at the federal and state level is also the era which has witnessed a higher level of volatility - a tendency for voters to switch from one party to another , leading to ruling governments or incumbent representatives losing the election .
turnout in village council elections is more than 80 % but there is little evidence to suggest that there is a linkage between the two .
it is simply not true that elections that witness high turnout lead to a loss for the ruling party .
take the latest case of madhya pradesh .
in the state elections last year there was a record turnout .
some analysts saw it as evidence of the ruling bjp being thrown out .
the bjp won the polls again .
high voter turnout can be a function of many different things - a spontaneous outpouring of the voters , of intensity of political competition , of greater mobilisation and resources put in by political parties or of greater interest on the part of the voter .
so depending on what led to the higher turnout , you would have different consequences of it .
there is widespread apathy towards politics this is one myth that comes close to being totally false .
the fact is that while in many other democracies in the world , voter turnouts have declined , in india turnouts have either remained stable or have gone up .
if we look at political associations , indians have an amazingly intense attachment to politics .
the proportion of people attached to one party , who feel close to a party , is much higher in india than in many other democracies .
the proportion of people who are members of a political party is much higher in india than in the us and most european democracies .
there has been a participatory upsurge for democracy in india the proportion of voters who report that they took some part in electoral activity - going to meetings or campaigning - is quite robust .
and the number of people who report that someone came to their house to canvass for votes is very high .
in advanced democracies , as you come down the various tiers - from national to local elections - the turnout of voters goes down .
in india , it is exactly the opposite : the turnout in federal elections tends to be around 60 % , in the state elections it is around 70 % and when it comes to village council elections it is anything upwards of 80 % .
most important , our democracy defies what was once considered a law of political participation in the world : the higher up you are in the socio-economic hierarchy , the more you participate in politics and voting .
in india , evidence shows that the poor " untouchables " vote more than upper castes .
the poor vote as much , if not more , than the urban middle classes .
rural areas vote more than urban areas .
women vote almost as much as men do .
in other words there is no connection between social hierarchy and participation in politics .
rather than voter apathy and indifference , there has been a participatory upsurge for democracy in india .
indians do n't cast their vote , they vote their caste it is true that caste is one of the major determinants of voting behaviour in india .
in certain situations when voters are extremely polarised , it appears to be to the sole consideration .
but the fact is that caste is not quite the sole consideration .
it is certainly untrue that defeat and victory for political parties in elections can be explained by a few caste or community groups switching sides from one party to another .
the turnout among untouchables is high the reason many feel that caste is powerful is because we use the phrase " caste based vote bank " to mean many things .
in delhi 's politics , the expression " punjabi " -lrb- literally , residents of punjab or people who speak the punjabi language -rrb- is used as if it is a caste .
actually , it is a linguistic group .
people use the word " bihari " -lrb- literally , residents of bihar -rrb- as if it is a caste group .
actually , it is a regional affiliation , or a moniker for poor migrants .
a caste vote can also be a vote against a candidate of a voter 's own caste in favour of a party considered closer to their caste .
so if a person belonging to the yadav caste in bihar votes for a congress party candidate because the candidate is a yadav himself , it is an example of caste voting .
if the same person were to vote for a candidate belonging to the bhumihar caste put up by the regional rashtriya janata dal -lrb- rjd -rrb- - which largely represents the yadav caste - it would be also an example of caste voting .
the evidence on caste voting suggests that caste tends to be a major determinant , specially among the large , visible and powerful caste groups .
the caste-vote trend is towards voting for a party that is considered to be close to their caste or community group .
but the fact remains that most voters in most constituencies in india do not have a simple option of voting along caste lines .
either they have more than one candidate from their own caste or they have none .
they simply can not vote according to their caste .
there has to be a consideration other than caste for almost three-quarters of the voters .
caste provides us with good information on the initial affiliations of social groups .
but across two elections , the increasing votes for one party or defeat of another is not explained by castes changing sides .
when a party goes up in popularity or declines in popularity , it usually wins and loses votes across castes .

the communist party of india -lrb- marxist -rrb- in bengal , the regional rashtriya janata dal -lrb- rjd -rrb- in bihar , and the aiadmk party in tamil nadu led by former actress jayalalitha , are some of the parties who get more votes from women than from men .
since the early 1970s , researchers from delhi 's centre for developing societies have asked women voters whose advise they seek while casting their ballots .
the evidence shows that fewer than 50 % of women today go by the advice of their husband or any men in their family .
muslims vote heavily and as a bloc we simply have no good evidence to prove that muslims vote more than the majority hindus .
this perception comes from seeing long queues at polling stations in some muslim majority urban areas where community voters , especially the poor and women , tend to be very visible .
research shows that in most elections after 1996 , the turnout of muslim voters has actually been a little lower than that of hindus .
the other perception about muslims voting en bloc has an element of truth .
the perception that muslims vote en bloc has an element of truth any minority community tends to flock together , consult among themselves , and has a great sense of community .
this applies to muslims as much as it applies to sikhs in delhi , hindu pundits in indian-administered kashmir and to bengalis in north-eastern india .
but it is simply not true that there is anything like a muslim bloc at national level .
if there is one striking thing about indian muslims , it is the fact that unlike most minorities in most democracies around the world , indian muslims have not voted for muslim parties .
they have had their preferred political parties - congress used to be one of those parties , and now there are many .
also , muslims in india do not vote en bloc like , say , the black vote in the us for the democratic party or the uk 's ethnic minorities who largely vote for the labour party .
politically speaking , there is no single unified muslim community in india .
muslims are fragmented along the lines of religion , sect , caste and community .
in the past two decades , muslim voters have chosen different parties in different states : the cpi -lrb- m -rrb- in bengal , the rjd in bihar , the regional samajwadi party -lrb- sp -rrb- in uttar pradesh , the dmk party in tamil nadu and the congress in other parts of the country .
in other words , it is an exaggeration to say there is one unified muslim vote in the country .
the young vote distinctly and independently there is a perception that youth constitute a distinct political bloc with unique and independent political preferences and views .
two-thirds of indians are below the age of 35 .
the young are no more politically active than others that itself is no basis for concluding that the young are distinct and different from the rest of the population in terms of their political opinions , attitudes and behaviour .
i guess we tend to talk about " youth voters " because we import our vocabulary of political analysis from europe where the generational divide is a significant political cleavage of that society .
where a party like the greens primarily rides on the divide of the young versus the old .
this myth also feeds on a perception that youth are supposed to be carriers of change and transformation .
the evidence in india , however , does not confirm any of these beliefs .
there is no evidence to suggest that the young are politically more active than others .
if anything , they are less politically active - obviously they have other anxieties in life , like preparing for a professional career .
indians allow their image of the young to be dominated by the image of the city-bred english-speaking youth , which is very different from the rest of the country .
but we forget that this is a tiny slice of indian youth .
there is no systematic difference between the manner in which the young and the not-so-young vote .
it is true that in many states political parties that are relatively more recent or young tend to get more votes from young people .
but that is only a function of political socialisation : simply because the young were more exposed to that party than people of an older generation who had not even heard its name .
even in terms of opinions , we have simply not found anything like a generational cleavage in indian politics .
the young support democracy in much the same way as the old do .
the young are about as traditional and conservative as the old .
even on questions like inter-caste marriage , the opinions of the young are not actually very different from the rest of the population .
high turnout leads to defeat for the ruling party it is simply a coincidence that the era which has witnessed higher voter turnout at the federal and state level is also the era which has witnessed a higher level of volatility - a tendency for voters to switch from one party to another , leading to ruling governments or incumbent representatives losing the election .
turnout in village council elections is more than 80 % but there is little evidence to suggest that there is a linkage between the two .
it is simply not true that elections that witness high turnout lead to a loss for the ruling party .
take the latest case of madhya pradesh .
in the state elections last year there was a record turnout .
some analysts saw it as evidence of the ruling bjp being thrown out .
the bjp won the polls again .
high voter turnout can be a function of many different things - a spontaneous outpouring of the voters , of intensity of political competition , of greater mobilisation and resources put in by political parties or of greater interest on the part of the voter .
so depending on what led to the higher turnout , you would have different consequences of it .
there is widespread apathy towards politics this is one myth that comes close to being totally false .
the fact is that while in many other democracies in the world , voter turnouts have declined , in india turnouts have either remained stable or have gone up .
if we look at political associations , indians have an amazingly intense attachment to politics .
the proportion of people attached to one party , who feel close to a party , is much higher in india than in many other democracies .
the proportion of people who are members of a political party is much higher in india than in the us and most european democracies .
there has been a participatory upsurge for democracy in india the proportion of voters who report that they took some part in electoral activity - going to meetings or campaigning - is quite robust .
and the number of people who report that someone came to their house to canvass for votes is very high .
in advanced democracies , as you come down the various tiers - from national to local elections - the turnout of voters goes down .
in india , it is exactly the opposite : the turnout in federal elections tends to be around 60 % , in the state elections it is around 70 % and when it comes to village council elections it is anything upwards of 80 % .
most important , our democracy defies what was once considered a law of political participation in the world : the higher up you are in the socio-economic hierarchy , the more you participate in politics and voting .
in india , evidence shows that the poor " untouchables " vote more than upper castes .
the poor vote as much , if not more , than the urban middle classes .
rural areas vote more than urban areas .
women vote almost as much as men do .
in other words there is no connection between social hierarchy and participation in politics .
rather than voter apathy and indifference , there has been a participatory upsurge for democracy in india .
indians do n't cast their vote , they vote their caste it is true that caste is one of the major determinants of voting behaviour in india .
in certain situations when voters are extremely polarised , it appears to be to the sole consideration .
but the fact is that caste is not quite the sole consideration .
it is certainly untrue that defeat and victory for political parties in elections can be explained by a few caste or community groups switching sides from one party to another .
the turnout among untouchables is high the reason many feel that caste is powerful is because we use the phrase " caste based vote bank " to mean many things .
in delhi 's politics , the expression " punjabi " -lrb- literally , residents of punjab or people who speak the punjabi language -rrb- is used as if it is a caste .
actually , it is a linguistic group .
people use the word " bihari " -lrb- literally , residents of bihar -rrb- as if it is a caste group .
actually , it is a regional affiliation , or a moniker for poor migrants .
a caste vote can also be a vote against a candidate of a voter 's own caste in favour of a party considered closer to their caste .
so if a person belonging to the yadav caste in bihar votes for a congress party candidate because the candidate is a yadav himself , it is an example of caste voting .
if the same person were to vote for a candidate belonging to the bhumihar caste put up by the regional rashtriya janata dal -lrb- rjd -rrb- - which largely represents the yadav caste - it would be also an example of caste voting .
the evidence on caste voting suggests that caste tends to be a major determinant , specially among the large , visible and powerful caste groups .
the caste-vote trend is towards voting for a party that is considered to be close to their caste or community group .
but the fact remains that most voters in most constituencies in india do not have a simple option of voting along caste lines .
either they have more than one candidate from their own caste or they have none .
they simply can not vote according to their caste .
there has to be a consideration other than caste for almost three-quarters of the voters .
caste provides us with good information on the initial affiliations of social groups .
but across two elections , the increasing votes for one party or defeat of another is not explained by castes changing sides .
when a party goes up in popularity or declines in popularity , it usually wins and loses votes across castes .

do muslims vote as a community ?
political scientist yogendra yadav examines six myths surrounding the indian elections .
women voters outnumber men in many states a myth is a story or trend that a culture believes to be true .
but it has also taken on the meaning of a popular conception that may have become exaggerated if not downright false .
the reason why there is so much myth making around politics and elections in india is partly because indians are passionate about politics .
it is also because there is very little hard evidence on political behaviour .
when it comes to politics , anything goes .
here are the six most popular myths about indian politics and elections : women vote according to the wishes of their husbands it is true that in india , like many democracies , the levels of interest and involvement of women in politics is lower than that of men .
obviously , if you are less interested in something , you tend you go by somebody else 's advice - in the case of women in india it may be the advice of men in their family .
but we can not conclude that all - or almost all - women go by whatever their husbands ask them to do and so therefore are not really an independent factor in politics .
for one , the level of involvement of women in politics has risen sharply in the past two decades or so : the turnout of women during polling used to be a good 10 percentage points below the turnout of men ; and now , the gap is barely two to three .
today , more women turn out to vote than men in many states .
the level of involvement of women in politics has risen sharply second , if it were true that all women were to follow their men in their voting preference , we would not find any difference in the level of support for different parties among men and women .
but surveys over the past 40 years have consistently shown a difference in levels of support for major political parties among men and women .
congress , for example , has always got more votes from women than from men since the days of former prime minister indira gandhi or even earlier .

two-thirds of indians are below the age of 35 .
the young are no more politically active than others that itself is no basis for concluding that the young are distinct and different from the rest of the population in terms of their political opinions , attitudes and behaviour .
i guess we tend to talk about " youth voters " because we import our vocabulary of political analysis from europe where the generational divide is a significant political cleavage of that society .
where a party like the greens primarily rides on the divide of the young versus the old .
this myth also feeds on a perception that youth are supposed to be carriers of change and transformation .
the evidence in india , however , does not confirm any of these beliefs .
there is no evidence to suggest that the young are politically more active than others .
if anything , they are less politically active - obviously they have other anxieties in life , like preparing for a professional career .
indians allow their image of the young to be dominated by the image of the city-bred english-speaking youth , which is very different from the rest of the country .
but we forget that this is a tiny slice of indian youth .
there is no systematic difference between the manner in which the young and the not-so-young vote .
it is true that in many states political parties that are relatively more recent or young tend to get more votes from young people .
but that is only a function of political socialisation : simply because the young were more exposed to that party than people of an older generation who had not even heard its name .
even in terms of opinions , we have simply not found anything like a generational cleavage in indian politics .
the young support democracy in much the same way as the old do .
the young are about as traditional and conservative as the old .
even on questions like inter-caste marriage , the opinions of the young are not actually very different from the rest of the population .
high turnout leads to defeat for the ruling party it is simply a coincidence that the era which has witnessed higher voter turnout at the federal and state level is also the era which has witnessed a higher level of volatility - a tendency for voters to switch from one party to another , leading to ruling governments or incumbent representatives losing the election .
turnout in village council elections is more than 80 % but there is little evidence to suggest that there is a linkage between the two .
it is simply not true that elections that witness high turnout lead to a loss for the ruling party .
take the latest case of madhya pradesh .
in the state elections last year there was a record turnout .
some analysts saw it as evidence of the ruling bjp being thrown out .
the bjp won the polls again .
high voter turnout can be a function of many different things - a spontaneous outpouring of the voters , of intensity of political competition , of greater mobilisation and resources put in by political parties or of greater interest on the part of the voter .
so depending on what led to the higher turnout , you would have different consequences of it .
there is widespread apathy towards politics this is one myth that comes close to being totally false .
the fact is that while in many other democracies in the world , voter turnouts have declined , in india turnouts have either remained stable or have gone up .
if we look at political associations , indians have an amazingly intense attachment to politics .
the proportion of people attached to one party , who feel close to a party , is much higher in india than in many other democracies .
the proportion of people who are members of a political party is much higher in india than in the us and most european democracies .
there has been a participatory upsurge for democracy in india the proportion of voters who report that they took some part in electoral activity - going to meetings or campaigning - is quite robust .
and the number of people who report that someone came to their house to canvass for votes is very high .
in advanced democracies , as you come down the various tiers - from national to local elections - the turnout of voters goes down .
in india , it is exactly the opposite : the turnout in federal elections tends to be around 60 % , in the state elections it is around 70 % and when it comes to village council elections it is anything upwards of 80 % .
most important , our democracy defies what was once considered a law of political participation in the world : the higher up you are in the socio-economic hierarchy , the more you participate in politics and voting .
in india , evidence shows that the poor " untouchables " vote more than upper castes .
the poor vote as much , if not more , than the urban middle classes .
rural areas vote more than urban areas .
women vote almost as much as men do .
in other words there is no connection between social hierarchy and participation in politics .
rather than voter apathy and indifference , there has been a participatory upsurge for democracy in india .
indians do n't cast their vote , they vote their caste it is true that caste is one of the major determinants of voting behaviour in india .
in certain situations when voters are extremely polarised , it appears to be to the sole consideration .
but the fact is that caste is not quite the sole consideration .
it is certainly untrue that defeat and victory for political parties in elections can be explained by a few caste or community groups switching sides from one party to another .
the turnout among untouchables is high the reason many feel that caste is powerful is because we use the phrase " caste based vote bank " to mean many things .
in delhi 's politics , the expression " punjabi " -lrb- literally , residents of punjab or people who speak the punjabi language -rrb- is used as if it is a caste .
actually , it is a linguistic group .
people use the word " bihari " -lrb- literally , residents of bihar -rrb- as if it is a caste group .
actually , it is a regional affiliation , or a moniker for poor migrants .
a caste vote can also be a vote against a candidate of a voter 's own caste in favour of a party considered closer to their caste .
so if a person belonging to the yadav caste in bihar votes for a congress party candidate because the candidate is a yadav himself , it is an example of caste voting .
if the same person were to vote for a candidate belonging to the bhumihar caste put up by the regional rashtriya janata dal -lrb- rjd -rrb- - which largely represents the yadav caste - it would be also an example of caste voting .
the evidence on caste voting suggests that caste tends to be a major determinant , specially among the large , visible and powerful caste groups .
the caste-vote trend is towards voting for a party that is considered to be close to their caste or community group .
but the fact remains that most voters in most constituencies in india do not have a simple option of voting along caste lines .
either they have more than one candidate from their own caste or they have none .
they simply can not vote according to their caste .
there has to be a consideration other than caste for almost three-quarters of the voters .
caste provides us with good information on the initial affiliations of social groups .
but across two elections , the increasing votes for one party or defeat of another is not explained by castes changing sides .
when a party goes up in popularity or declines in popularity , it usually wins and loses votes across castes .

do muslims vote as a community ?
political scientist yogendra yadav examines six myths surrounding the indian elections .
women voters outnumber men in many states a myth is a story or trend that a culture believes to be true .
but it has also taken on the meaning of a popular conception that may have become exaggerated if not downright false .
the reason why there is so much myth making around politics and elections in india is partly because indians are passionate about politics .
it is also because there is very little hard evidence on political behaviour .
when it comes to politics , anything goes .
here are the six most popular myths about indian politics and elections : women vote according to the wishes of their husbands it is true that in india , like many democracies , the levels of interest and involvement of women in politics is lower than that of men .
obviously , if you are less interested in something , you tend you go by somebody else 's advice - in the case of women in india it may be the advice of men in their family .
but we can not conclude that all - or almost all - women go by whatever their husbands ask them to do and so therefore are not really an independent factor in politics .
for one , the level of involvement of women in politics has risen sharply in the past two decades or so : the turnout of women during polling used to be a good 10 percentage points below the turnout of men ; and now , the gap is barely two to three .
today , more women turn out to vote than men in many states .
the level of involvement of women in politics has risen sharply second , if it were true that all women were to follow their men in their voting preference , we would not find any difference in the level of support for different parties among men and women .
but surveys over the past 40 years have consistently shown a difference in levels of support for major political parties among men and women .
congress , for example , has always got more votes from women than from men since the days of former prime minister indira gandhi or even earlier .
the communist party of india -lrb- marxist -rrb- in bengal , the regional rashtriya janata dal -lrb- rjd -rrb- in bihar , and the aiadmk party in tamil nadu led by former actress jayalalitha , are some of the parties who get more votes from women than from men .
since the early 1970s , researchers from delhi 's centre for developing societies have asked women voters whose advise they seek while casting their ballots .
the evidence shows that fewer than 50 % of women today go by the advice of their husband or any men in their family .
muslims vote heavily and as a bloc we simply have no good evidence to prove that muslims vote more than the majority hindus .
this perception comes from seeing long queues at polling stations in some muslim majority urban areas where community voters , especially the poor and women , tend to be very visible .
research shows that in most elections after 1996 , the turnout of muslim voters has actually been a little lower than that of hindus .
the other perception about muslims voting en bloc has an element of truth .
the perception that muslims vote en bloc has an element of truth any minority community tends to flock together , consult among themselves , and has a great sense of community .
this applies to muslims as much as it applies to sikhs in delhi , hindu pundits in indian-administered kashmir and to bengalis in north-eastern india .
but it is simply not true that there is anything like a muslim bloc at national level .
if there is one striking thing about indian muslims , it is the fact that unlike most minorities in most democracies around the world , indian muslims have not voted for muslim parties .
they have had their preferred political parties - congress used to be one of those parties , and now there are many .
also , muslims in india do not vote en bloc like , say , the black vote in the us for the democratic party or the uk 's ethnic minorities who largely vote for the labour party .
politically speaking , there is no single unified muslim community in india .
muslims are fragmented along the lines of religion , sect , caste and community .
in the past two decades , muslim voters have chosen different parties in different states : the cpi -lrb- m -rrb- in bengal , the rjd in bihar , the regional samajwadi party -lrb- sp -rrb- in uttar pradesh , the dmk party in tamil nadu and the congress in other parts of the country .
in other words , it is an exaggeration to say there is one unified muslim vote in the country .
the young vote distinctly and independently there is a perception that youth constitute a distinct political bloc with unique and independent political preferences and views .
two-thirds of indians are below the age of 35 .

if we look at political associations , indians have an amazingly intense attachment to politics .
the proportion of people attached to one party , who feel close to a party , is much higher in india than in many other democracies .
the proportion of people who are members of a political party is much higher in india than in the us and most european democracies .
there has been a participatory upsurge for democracy in india the proportion of voters who report that they took some part in electoral activity - going to meetings or campaigning - is quite robust .
and the number of people who report that someone came to their house to canvass for votes is very high .
in advanced democracies , as you come down the various tiers - from national to local elections - the turnout of voters goes down .
in india , it is exactly the opposite : the turnout in federal elections tends to be around 60 % , in the state elections it is around 70 % and when it comes to village council elections it is anything upwards of 80 % .
most important , our democracy defies what was once considered a law of political participation in the world : the higher up you are in the socio-economic hierarchy , the more you participate in politics and voting .
in india , evidence shows that the poor " untouchables " vote more than upper castes .
the poor vote as much , if not more , than the urban middle classes .
rural areas vote more than urban areas .
women vote almost as much as men do .
in other words there is no connection between social hierarchy and participation in politics .
rather than voter apathy and indifference , there has been a participatory upsurge for democracy in india .
indians do n't cast their vote , they vote their caste it is true that caste is one of the major determinants of voting behaviour in india .
in certain situations when voters are extremely polarised , it appears to be to the sole consideration .
but the fact is that caste is not quite the sole consideration .
it is certainly untrue that defeat and victory for political parties in elections can be explained by a few caste or community groups switching sides from one party to another .
the turnout among untouchables is high the reason many feel that caste is powerful is because we use the phrase " caste based vote bank " to mean many things .
in delhi 's politics , the expression " punjabi " -lrb- literally , residents of punjab or people who speak the punjabi language -rrb- is used as if it is a caste .
actually , it is a linguistic group .
people use the word " bihari " -lrb- literally , residents of bihar -rrb- as if it is a caste group .
actually , it is a regional affiliation , or a moniker for poor migrants .
a caste vote can also be a vote against a candidate of a voter 's own caste in favour of a party considered closer to their caste .
so if a person belonging to the yadav caste in bihar votes for a congress party candidate because the candidate is a yadav himself , it is an example of caste voting .
if the same person were to vote for a candidate belonging to the bhumihar caste put up by the regional rashtriya janata dal -lrb- rjd -rrb- - which largely represents the yadav caste - it would be also an example of caste voting .
the evidence on caste voting suggests that caste tends to be a major determinant , specially among the large , visible and powerful caste groups .
the caste-vote trend is towards voting for a party that is considered to be close to their caste or community group .
but the fact remains that most voters in most constituencies in india do not have a simple option of voting along caste lines .
either they have more than one candidate from their own caste or they have none .
they simply can not vote according to their caste .
there has to be a consideration other than caste for almost three-quarters of the voters .
caste provides us with good information on the initial affiliations of social groups .
but across two elections , the increasing votes for one party or defeat of another is not explained by castes changing sides .
when a party goes up in popularity or declines in popularity , it usually wins and loses votes across castes .

do muslims vote as a community ?
political scientist yogendra yadav examines six myths surrounding the indian elections .
women voters outnumber men in many states a myth is a story or trend that a culture believes to be true .
but it has also taken on the meaning of a popular conception that may have become exaggerated if not downright false .
the reason why there is so much myth making around politics and elections in india is partly because indians are passionate about politics .
it is also because there is very little hard evidence on political behaviour .
when it comes to politics , anything goes .
here are the six most popular myths about indian politics and elections : women vote according to the wishes of their husbands it is true that in india , like many democracies , the levels of interest and involvement of women in politics is lower than that of men .
obviously , if you are less interested in something , you tend you go by somebody else 's advice - in the case of women in india it may be the advice of men in their family .
but we can not conclude that all - or almost all - women go by whatever their husbands ask them to do and so therefore are not really an independent factor in politics .
for one , the level of involvement of women in politics has risen sharply in the past two decades or so : the turnout of women during polling used to be a good 10 percentage points below the turnout of men ; and now , the gap is barely two to three .
today , more women turn out to vote than men in many states .
the level of involvement of women in politics has risen sharply second , if it were true that all women were to follow their men in their voting preference , we would not find any difference in the level of support for different parties among men and women .
but surveys over the past 40 years have consistently shown a difference in levels of support for major political parties among men and women .
congress , for example , has always got more votes from women than from men since the days of former prime minister indira gandhi or even earlier .
the communist party of india -lrb- marxist -rrb- in bengal , the regional rashtriya janata dal -lrb- rjd -rrb- in bihar , and the aiadmk party in tamil nadu led by former actress jayalalitha , are some of the parties who get more votes from women than from men .
since the early 1970s , researchers from delhi 's centre for developing societies have asked women voters whose advise they seek while casting their ballots .
the evidence shows that fewer than 50 % of women today go by the advice of their husband or any men in their family .
muslims vote heavily and as a bloc we simply have no good evidence to prove that muslims vote more than the majority hindus .
this perception comes from seeing long queues at polling stations in some muslim majority urban areas where community voters , especially the poor and women , tend to be very visible .
research shows that in most elections after 1996 , the turnout of muslim voters has actually been a little lower than that of hindus .
the other perception about muslims voting en bloc has an element of truth .
the perception that muslims vote en bloc has an element of truth any minority community tends to flock together , consult among themselves , and has a great sense of community .
this applies to muslims as much as it applies to sikhs in delhi , hindu pundits in indian-administered kashmir and to bengalis in north-eastern india .
but it is simply not true that there is anything like a muslim bloc at national level .
if there is one striking thing about indian muslims , it is the fact that unlike most minorities in most democracies around the world , indian muslims have not voted for muslim parties .
they have had their preferred political parties - congress used to be one of those parties , and now there are many .
also , muslims in india do not vote en bloc like , say , the black vote in the us for the democratic party or the uk 's ethnic minorities who largely vote for the labour party .
politically speaking , there is no single unified muslim community in india .
muslims are fragmented along the lines of religion , sect , caste and community .
in the past two decades , muslim voters have chosen different parties in different states : the cpi -lrb- m -rrb- in bengal , the rjd in bihar , the regional samajwadi party -lrb- sp -rrb- in uttar pradesh , the dmk party in tamil nadu and the congress in other parts of the country .
in other words , it is an exaggeration to say there is one unified muslim vote in the country .
the young vote distinctly and independently there is a perception that youth constitute a distinct political bloc with unique and independent political preferences and views .
two-thirds of indians are below the age of 35 .
the young are no more politically active than others that itself is no basis for concluding that the young are distinct and different from the rest of the population in terms of their political opinions , attitudes and behaviour .
i guess we tend to talk about " youth voters " because we import our vocabulary of political analysis from europe where the generational divide is a significant political cleavage of that society .
where a party like the greens primarily rides on the divide of the young versus the old .
this myth also feeds on a perception that youth are supposed to be carriers of change and transformation .
the evidence in india , however , does not confirm any of these beliefs .
there is no evidence to suggest that the young are politically more active than others .
if anything , they are less politically active - obviously they have other anxieties in life , like preparing for a professional career .
indians allow their image of the young to be dominated by the image of the city-bred english-speaking youth , which is very different from the rest of the country .
but we forget that this is a tiny slice of indian youth .
there is no systematic difference between the manner in which the young and the not-so-young vote .
it is true that in many states political parties that are relatively more recent or young tend to get more votes from young people .
but that is only a function of political socialisation : simply because the young were more exposed to that party than people of an older generation who had not even heard its name .
even in terms of opinions , we have simply not found anything like a generational cleavage in indian politics .
the young support democracy in much the same way as the old do .
the young are about as traditional and conservative as the old .
even on questions like inter-caste marriage , the opinions of the young are not actually very different from the rest of the population .
high turnout leads to defeat for the ruling party it is simply a coincidence that the era which has witnessed higher voter turnout at the federal and state level is also the era which has witnessed a higher level of volatility - a tendency for voters to switch from one party to another , leading to ruling governments or incumbent representatives losing the election .
turnout in village council elections is more than 80 % but there is little evidence to suggest that there is a linkage between the two .
it is simply not true that elections that witness high turnout lead to a loss for the ruling party .
take the latest case of madhya pradesh .
in the state elections last year there was a record turnout .
some analysts saw it as evidence of the ruling bjp being thrown out .
the bjp won the polls again .
high voter turnout can be a function of many different things - a spontaneous outpouring of the voters , of intensity of political competition , of greater mobilisation and resources put in by political parties or of greater interest on the part of the voter .
so depending on what led to the higher turnout , you would have different consequences of it .
there is widespread apathy towards politics this is one myth that comes close to being totally false .
the fact is that while in many other democracies in the world , voter turnouts have declined , in india turnouts have either remained stable or have gone up .
if we look at political associations , indians have an amazingly intense attachment to politics .

if the same person were to vote for a candidate belonging to the bhumihar caste put up by the regional rashtriya janata dal -lrb- rjd -rrb- - which largely represents the yadav caste - it would be also an example of caste voting .
the evidence on caste voting suggests that caste tends to be a major determinant , specially among the large , visible and powerful caste groups .
the caste-vote trend is towards voting for a party that is considered to be close to their caste or community group .
but the fact remains that most voters in most constituencies in india do not have a simple option of voting along caste lines .
either they have more than one candidate from their own caste or they have none .
they simply can not vote according to their caste .
there has to be a consideration other than caste for almost three-quarters of the voters .
caste provides us with good information on the initial affiliations of social groups .
but across two elections , the increasing votes for one party or defeat of another is not explained by castes changing sides .
when a party goes up in popularity or declines in popularity , it usually wins and loses votes across castes .

do muslims vote as a community ?
political scientist yogendra yadav examines six myths surrounding the indian elections .
women voters outnumber men in many states a myth is a story or trend that a culture believes to be true .
but it has also taken on the meaning of a popular conception that may have become exaggerated if not downright false .
the reason why there is so much myth making around politics and elections in india is partly because indians are passionate about politics .
it is also because there is very little hard evidence on political behaviour .
when it comes to politics , anything goes .
here are the six most popular myths about indian politics and elections : women vote according to the wishes of their husbands it is true that in india , like many democracies , the levels of interest and involvement of women in politics is lower than that of men .
obviously , if you are less interested in something , you tend you go by somebody else 's advice - in the case of women in india it may be the advice of men in their family .
but we can not conclude that all - or almost all - women go by whatever their husbands ask them to do and so therefore are not really an independent factor in politics .
for one , the level of involvement of women in politics has risen sharply in the past two decades or so : the turnout of women during polling used to be a good 10 percentage points below the turnout of men ; and now , the gap is barely two to three .
today , more women turn out to vote than men in many states .
the level of involvement of women in politics has risen sharply second , if it were true that all women were to follow their men in their voting preference , we would not find any difference in the level of support for different parties among men and women .
but surveys over the past 40 years have consistently shown a difference in levels of support for major political parties among men and women .
congress , for example , has always got more votes from women than from men since the days of former prime minister indira gandhi or even earlier .
the communist party of india -lrb- marxist -rrb- in bengal , the regional rashtriya janata dal -lrb- rjd -rrb- in bihar , and the aiadmk party in tamil nadu led by former actress jayalalitha , are some of the parties who get more votes from women than from men .
since the early 1970s , researchers from delhi 's centre for developing societies have asked women voters whose advise they seek while casting their ballots .
the evidence shows that fewer than 50 % of women today go by the advice of their husband or any men in their family .
muslims vote heavily and as a bloc we simply have no good evidence to prove that muslims vote more than the majority hindus .
this perception comes from seeing long queues at polling stations in some muslim majority urban areas where community voters , especially the poor and women , tend to be very visible .
research shows that in most elections after 1996 , the turnout of muslim voters has actually been a little lower than that of hindus .
the other perception about muslims voting en bloc has an element of truth .
the perception that muslims vote en bloc has an element of truth any minority community tends to flock together , consult among themselves , and has a great sense of community .
this applies to muslims as much as it applies to sikhs in delhi , hindu pundits in indian-administered kashmir and to bengalis in north-eastern india .
but it is simply not true that there is anything like a muslim bloc at national level .
if there is one striking thing about indian muslims , it is the fact that unlike most minorities in most democracies around the world , indian muslims have not voted for muslim parties .
they have had their preferred political parties - congress used to be one of those parties , and now there are many .
also , muslims in india do not vote en bloc like , say , the black vote in the us for the democratic party or the uk 's ethnic minorities who largely vote for the labour party .
politically speaking , there is no single unified muslim community in india .
muslims are fragmented along the lines of religion , sect , caste and community .
in the past two decades , muslim voters have chosen different parties in different states : the cpi -lrb- m -rrb- in bengal , the rjd in bihar , the regional samajwadi party -lrb- sp -rrb- in uttar pradesh , the dmk party in tamil nadu and the congress in other parts of the country .
in other words , it is an exaggeration to say there is one unified muslim vote in the country .
the young vote distinctly and independently there is a perception that youth constitute a distinct political bloc with unique and independent political preferences and views .
two-thirds of indians are below the age of 35 .
the young are no more politically active than others that itself is no basis for concluding that the young are distinct and different from the rest of the population in terms of their political opinions , attitudes and behaviour .
i guess we tend to talk about " youth voters " because we import our vocabulary of political analysis from europe where the generational divide is a significant political cleavage of that society .
where a party like the greens primarily rides on the divide of the young versus the old .
this myth also feeds on a perception that youth are supposed to be carriers of change and transformation .
the evidence in india , however , does not confirm any of these beliefs .
there is no evidence to suggest that the young are politically more active than others .
if anything , they are less politically active - obviously they have other anxieties in life , like preparing for a professional career .
indians allow their image of the young to be dominated by the image of the city-bred english-speaking youth , which is very different from the rest of the country .
but we forget that this is a tiny slice of indian youth .
there is no systematic difference between the manner in which the young and the not-so-young vote .
it is true that in many states political parties that are relatively more recent or young tend to get more votes from young people .
but that is only a function of political socialisation : simply because the young were more exposed to that party than people of an older generation who had not even heard its name .
even in terms of opinions , we have simply not found anything like a generational cleavage in indian politics .
the young support democracy in much the same way as the old do .
the young are about as traditional and conservative as the old .
even on questions like inter-caste marriage , the opinions of the young are not actually very different from the rest of the population .
high turnout leads to defeat for the ruling party it is simply a coincidence that the era which has witnessed higher voter turnout at the federal and state level is also the era which has witnessed a higher level of volatility - a tendency for voters to switch from one party to another , leading to ruling governments or incumbent representatives losing the election .
turnout in village council elections is more than 80 % but there is little evidence to suggest that there is a linkage between the two .
it is simply not true that elections that witness high turnout lead to a loss for the ruling party .
take the latest case of madhya pradesh .
in the state elections last year there was a record turnout .
some analysts saw it as evidence of the ruling bjp being thrown out .
the bjp won the polls again .
high voter turnout can be a function of many different things - a spontaneous outpouring of the voters , of intensity of political competition , of greater mobilisation and resources put in by political parties or of greater interest on the part of the voter .
so depending on what led to the higher turnout , you would have different consequences of it .
there is widespread apathy towards politics this is one myth that comes close to being totally false .
the fact is that while in many other democracies in the world , voter turnouts have declined , in india turnouts have either remained stable or have gone up .
if we look at political associations , indians have an amazingly intense attachment to politics .
the proportion of people attached to one party , who feel close to a party , is much higher in india than in many other democracies .
the proportion of people who are members of a political party is much higher in india than in the us and most european democracies .
there has been a participatory upsurge for democracy in india the proportion of voters who report that they took some part in electoral activity - going to meetings or campaigning - is quite robust .
and the number of people who report that someone came to their house to canvass for votes is very high .
in advanced democracies , as you come down the various tiers - from national to local elections - the turnout of voters goes down .
in india , it is exactly the opposite : the turnout in federal elections tends to be around 60 % , in the state elections it is around 70 % and when it comes to village council elections it is anything upwards of 80 % .
most important , our democracy defies what was once considered a law of political participation in the world : the higher up you are in the socio-economic hierarchy , the more you participate in politics and voting .
in india , evidence shows that the poor " untouchables " vote more than upper castes .
the poor vote as much , if not more , than the urban middle classes .
rural areas vote more than urban areas .
women vote almost as much as men do .
in other words there is no connection between social hierarchy and participation in politics .
rather than voter apathy and indifference , there has been a participatory upsurge for democracy in india .
indians do n't cast their vote , they vote their caste it is true that caste is one of the major determinants of voting behaviour in india .
in certain situations when voters are extremely polarised , it appears to be to the sole consideration .
but the fact is that caste is not quite the sole consideration .
it is certainly untrue that defeat and victory for political parties in elections can be explained by a few caste or community groups switching sides from one party to another .
the turnout among untouchables is high the reason many feel that caste is powerful is because we use the phrase " caste based vote bank " to mean many things .
in delhi 's politics , the expression " punjabi " -lrb- literally , residents of punjab or people who speak the punjabi language -rrb- is used as if it is a caste .
actually , it is a linguistic group .
people use the word " bihari " -lrb- literally , residents of bihar -rrb- as if it is a caste group .
actually , it is a regional affiliation , or a moniker for poor migrants .
a caste vote can also be a vote against a candidate of a voter 's own caste in favour of a party considered closer to their caste .
so if a person belonging to the yadav caste in bihar votes for a congress party candidate because the candidate is a yadav himself , it is an example of caste voting .

do muslims vote as a community ?
political scientist yogendra yadav examines six myths surrounding the indian elections .
women voters outnumber men in many states a myth is a story or trend that a culture believes to be true .
but it has also taken on the meaning of a popular conception that may have become exaggerated if not downright false .
the reason why there is so much myth making around politics and elections in india is partly because indians are passionate about politics .
it is also because there is very little hard evidence on political behaviour .
when it comes to politics , anything goes .
here are the six most popular myths about indian politics and elections : women vote according to the wishes of their husbands it is true that in india , like many democracies , the levels of interest and involvement of women in politics is lower than that of men .
obviously , if you are less interested in something , you tend you go by somebody else 's advice - in the case of women in india it may be the advice of men in their family .
but we can not conclude that all - or almost all - women go by whatever their husbands ask them to do and so therefore are not really an independent factor in politics .
for one , the level of involvement of women in politics has risen sharply in the past two decades or so : the turnout of women during polling used to be a good 10 percentage points below the turnout of men ; and now , the gap is barely two to three .
today , more women turn out to vote than men in many states .
the level of involvement of women in politics has risen sharply second , if it were true that all women were to follow their men in their voting preference , we would not find any difference in the level of support for different parties among men and women .
but surveys over the past 40 years have consistently shown a difference in levels of support for major political parties among men and women .
congress , for example , has always got more votes from women than from men since the days of former prime minister indira gandhi or even earlier .
the communist party of india -lrb- marxist -rrb- in bengal , the regional rashtriya janata dal -lrb- rjd -rrb- in bihar , and the aiadmk party in tamil nadu led by former actress jayalalitha , are some of the parties who get more votes from women than from men .
since the early 1970s , researchers from delhi 's centre for developing societies have asked women voters whose advise they seek while casting their ballots .
the evidence shows that fewer than 50 % of women today go by the advice of their husband or any men in their family .
muslims vote heavily and as a bloc we simply have no good evidence to prove that muslims vote more than the majority hindus .
this perception comes from seeing long queues at polling stations in some muslim majority urban areas where community voters , especially the poor and women , tend to be very visible .
research shows that in most elections after 1996 , the turnout of muslim voters has actually been a little lower than that of hindus .
the other perception about muslims voting en bloc has an element of truth .
the perception that muslims vote en bloc has an element of truth any minority community tends to flock together , consult among themselves , and has a great sense of community .
this applies to muslims as much as it applies to sikhs in delhi , hindu pundits in indian-administered kashmir and to bengalis in north-eastern india .
but it is simply not true that there is anything like a muslim bloc at national level .
if there is one striking thing about indian muslims , it is the fact that unlike most minorities in most democracies around the world , indian muslims have not voted for muslim parties .
they have had their preferred political parties - congress used to be one of those parties , and now there are many .
also , muslims in india do not vote en bloc like , say , the black vote in the us for the democratic party or the uk 's ethnic minorities who largely vote for the labour party .
politically speaking , there is no single unified muslim community in india .
muslims are fragmented along the lines of religion , sect , caste and community .
in the past two decades , muslim voters have chosen different parties in different states : the cpi -lrb- m -rrb- in bengal , the rjd in bihar , the regional samajwadi party -lrb- sp -rrb- in uttar pradesh , the dmk party in tamil nadu and the congress in other parts of the country .
in other words , it is an exaggeration to say there is one unified muslim vote in the country .
the young vote distinctly and independently there is a perception that youth constitute a distinct political bloc with unique and independent political preferences and views .
two-thirds of indians are below the age of 35 .
the young are no more politically active than others that itself is no basis for concluding that the young are distinct and different from the rest of the population in terms of their political opinions , attitudes and behaviour .
i guess we tend to talk about " youth voters " because we import our vocabulary of political analysis from europe where the generational divide is a significant political cleavage of that society .
where a party like the greens primarily rides on the divide of the young versus the old .
this myth also feeds on a perception that youth are supposed to be carriers of change and transformation .
the evidence in india , however , does not confirm any of these beliefs .
there is no evidence to suggest that the young are politically more active than others .
if anything , they are less politically active - obviously they have other anxieties in life , like preparing for a professional career .
indians allow their image of the young to be dominated by the image of the city-bred english-speaking youth , which is very different from the rest of the country .
but we forget that this is a tiny slice of indian youth .
there is no systematic difference between the manner in which the young and the not-so-young vote .
it is true that in many states political parties that are relatively more recent or young tend to get more votes from young people .
but that is only a function of political socialisation : simply because the young were more exposed to that party than people of an older generation who had not even heard its name .
even in terms of opinions , we have simply not found anything like a generational cleavage in indian politics .
the young support democracy in much the same way as the old do .
the young are about as traditional and conservative as the old .
even on questions like inter-caste marriage , the opinions of the young are not actually very different from the rest of the population .
high turnout leads to defeat for the ruling party it is simply a coincidence that the era which has witnessed higher voter turnout at the federal and state level is also the era which has witnessed a higher level of volatility - a tendency for voters to switch from one party to another , leading to ruling governments or incumbent representatives losing the election .
turnout in village council elections is more than 80 % but there is little evidence to suggest that there is a linkage between the two .
it is simply not true that elections that witness high turnout lead to a loss for the ruling party .
take the latest case of madhya pradesh .
in the state elections last year there was a record turnout .
some analysts saw it as evidence of the ruling bjp being thrown out .
the bjp won the polls again .
high voter turnout can be a function of many different things - a spontaneous outpouring of the voters , of intensity of political competition , of greater mobilisation and resources put in by political parties or of greater interest on the part of the voter .
so depending on what led to the higher turnout , you would have different consequences of it .
there is widespread apathy towards politics this is one myth that comes close to being totally false .
the fact is that while in many other democracies in the world , voter turnouts have declined , in india turnouts have either remained stable or have gone up .
if we look at political associations , indians have an amazingly intense attachment to politics .
the proportion of people attached to one party , who feel close to a party , is much higher in india than in many other democracies .
the proportion of people who are members of a political party is much higher in india than in the us and most european democracies .
there has been a participatory upsurge for democracy in india the proportion of voters who report that they took some part in electoral activity - going to meetings or campaigning - is quite robust .
and the number of people who report that someone came to their house to canvass for votes is very high .
in advanced democracies , as you come down the various tiers - from national to local elections - the turnout of voters goes down .
in india , it is exactly the opposite : the turnout in federal elections tends to be around 60 % , in the state elections it is around 70 % and when it comes to village council elections it is anything upwards of 80 % .
most important , our democracy defies what was once considered a law of political participation in the world : the higher up you are in the socio-economic hierarchy , the more you participate in politics and voting .
in india , evidence shows that the poor " untouchables " vote more than upper castes .
the poor vote as much , if not more , than the urban middle classes .
rural areas vote more than urban areas .
women vote almost as much as men do .
in other words there is no connection between social hierarchy and participation in politics .
rather than voter apathy and indifference , there has been a participatory upsurge for democracy in india .
indians do n't cast their vote , they vote their caste it is true that caste is one of the major determinants of voting behaviour in india .
in certain situations when voters are extremely polarised , it appears to be to the sole consideration .
but the fact is that caste is not quite the sole consideration .
it is certainly untrue that defeat and victory for political parties in elections can be explained by a few caste or community groups switching sides from one party to another .
the turnout among untouchables is high the reason many feel that caste is powerful is because we use the phrase " caste based vote bank " to mean many things .
in delhi 's politics , the expression " punjabi " -lrb- literally , residents of punjab or people who speak the punjabi language -rrb- is used as if it is a caste .
actually , it is a linguistic group .
people use the word " bihari " -lrb- literally , residents of bihar -rrb- as if it is a caste group .
actually , it is a regional affiliation , or a moniker for poor migrants .
a caste vote can also be a vote against a candidate of a voter 's own caste in favour of a party considered closer to their caste .
so if a person belonging to the yadav caste in bihar votes for a congress party candidate because the candidate is a yadav himself , it is an example of caste voting .
if the same person were to vote for a candidate belonging to the bhumihar caste put up by the regional rashtriya janata dal -lrb- rjd -rrb- - which largely represents the yadav caste - it would be also an example of caste voting .
the evidence on caste voting suggests that caste tends to be a major determinant , specially among the large , visible and powerful caste groups .
the caste-vote trend is towards voting for a party that is considered to be close to their caste or community group .
but the fact remains that most voters in most constituencies in india do not have a simple option of voting along caste lines .
either they have more than one candidate from their own caste or they have none .
they simply can not vote according to their caste .
there has to be a consideration other than caste for almost three-quarters of the voters .
caste provides us with good information on the initial affiliations of social groups .
but across two elections , the increasing votes for one party or defeat of another is not explained by castes changing sides .
when a party goes up in popularity or declines in popularity , it usually wins and loses votes across castes .
yogendra yadav designed and co-ordinated the largest ever series of academic surveys of the indian electorate for the centre for the study of developing societies .

the registered bee population in the uk has shrunk by between 10 % and 15 % and many have fallen victim to varroa , a parasitic mite that attacks honey bees .
brecon and radnorshire mp roger williams said a breeding project would help make them resistant to varroa .
there are fears a europe-wide shortage of bees could affect crop pollination .
mr williams , who is the liberal democrats ' food and rural affairs spokesman , said bees played a " vital role in food production " through pollination .
he made his comments during food and environment questions in the house of commons on thursday .
' move quickly ' the mp added : " the government should implement a bee breeding project to help introduce varieties of bees that are resistant to varroa and do not require chemical treatment .
" the response i received from the secretary of state was encouraging .
while he did not commit to a bee breeding programme he did offer to look into where funding was directed and see if there were any gaps that needed to be addressed .
" i hope that his department will move quickly on this issue to ensure that current bee populations do not drop further . "
last month , a top civil servant admitted research into bee disease had not been a " top priority " despite mounting concern about declining populations .
but dame helen ghosh , of the environment food and rural affairs department -lrb- defra -rrb- , said more money was now being ploughed into solving the crisis .
she said the government had woken up to beekeepers ' concerns and had recently announced a " healthy bees plan " - to cover research , husbandry and disease control - and another £ 500,000 a year from defra for the next five years , supplemented by more money from partners .

' move quickly ' the mp added : " the government should implement a bee breeding project to help introduce varieties of bees that are resistant to varroa and do not require chemical treatment .
" the response i received from the secretary of state was encouraging .
while he did not commit to a bee breeding programme he did offer to look into where funding was directed and see if there were any gaps that needed to be addressed .
" i hope that his department will move quickly on this issue to ensure that current bee populations do not drop further . "
last month , a top civil servant admitted research into bee disease had not been a " top priority " despite mounting concern about declining populations .
but dame helen ghosh , of the environment food and rural affairs department -lrb- defra -rrb- , said more money was now being ploughed into solving the crisis .
she said the government had woken up to beekeepers ' concerns and had recently announced a " healthy bees plan " - to cover research , husbandry and disease control - and another £ 500,000 a year from defra for the next five years , supplemented by more money from partners .

they called on nato leaders gathering in strasbourg to do more to protect the population .
last year more than 2,000 civilians were killed in afghanistan .
us president barack obama is to present his new afghan strategy to nato allies later on friday .
the us has promised 17,000 extra troops and has called on nato to add more .
' eroding support ' while most civilian deaths in afghanistan were caused by insurgents , a significant minority were caused by coalition forces .
the bbc 's ian pannell in kabul says civilian deaths have become a burning issue , with fears that in some cases military tactics generate public hostility which in turn feeds the insurgency .
in a report titled caught in the conflict , 11 aid groups including oxfam , actionaid and care called on nato to change the way it operates .
" the troop surge will fail to achieve greater overall security and stability unless the military prioritise the protection of afghan civilians , " matt waldman , head of policy for oxfam international on afghanistan , said .
civilian deaths have caused resentment in afghanistan " despite taking steps to reduce civilian casualties , and repeated calls for restraint , too many military operations by foreign troops involve excessive force , loss of life and damage to property .
" this is causing anger , fear and resentment among afghans , and is steadily eroding popular support for the international presence . "
nato has changed the way it conducts operations to try to minimise casualties .
but the taleban often launch attacks from populated areas making that hard to achieve , our correspondent says .
there is a general expectation that there will be a significant increase in violence this summer as more troops are met by stiffer resistance from the taleban .
if that occurs then more civilian deaths seem inevitable , he says .
president obama will present his new afghan strategy to nato at strasbourg , where its annual summit coincides with its 60th anniversary .
although european governments have been reluctant to deploy any new ground forces , they have been more willing to offer humanitarian and development assistance to kabul .
us officials say president obama is unlikely to press for any concrete commitments at the nato meeting .
he is more likely to use the summit to build ties with leaders whom he is meeting for the first time , they say .
writing in the new york times ahead of the summit , nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer said he hoped it could " find agreement on a common way forward , taking into account the new us effort including more support for pakistan , a greater effort to strengthen the -lsb- afghan -rsb- police , more coordinated aid and visible steps by kabul to fight corruption " .
nato is also expected to approve moves to normalise ties with russia .

the bbc 's ian pannell in kabul says civilian deaths have become a burning issue , with fears that in some cases military tactics generate public hostility which in turn feeds the insurgency .
in a report titled caught in the conflict , 11 aid groups including oxfam , actionaid and care called on nato to change the way it operates .
" the troop surge will fail to achieve greater overall security and stability unless the military prioritise the protection of afghan civilians , " matt waldman , head of policy for oxfam international on afghanistan , said .
civilian deaths have caused resentment in afghanistan " despite taking steps to reduce civilian casualties , and repeated calls for restraint , too many military operations by foreign troops involve excessive force , loss of life and damage to property .
" this is causing anger , fear and resentment among afghans , and is steadily eroding popular support for the international presence . "
nato has changed the way it conducts operations to try to minimise casualties .
but the taleban often launch attacks from populated areas making that hard to achieve , our correspondent says .
there is a general expectation that there will be a significant increase in violence this summer as more troops are met by stiffer resistance from the taleban .
if that occurs then more civilian deaths seem inevitable , he says .
president obama will present his new afghan strategy to nato at strasbourg , where its annual summit coincides with its 60th anniversary .
although european governments have been reluctant to deploy any new ground forces , they have been more willing to offer humanitarian and development assistance to kabul .
us officials say president obama is unlikely to press for any concrete commitments at the nato meeting .
he is more likely to use the summit to build ties with leaders whom he is meeting for the first time , they say .
writing in the new york times ahead of the summit , nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer said he hoped it could " find agreement on a common way forward , taking into account the new us effort including more support for pakistan , a greater effort to strengthen the -lsb- afghan -rsb- police , more coordinated aid and visible steps by kabul to fight corruption " .
nato is also expected to approve moves to normalise ties with russia .
moscow has agreed to allow nato to send supplies to afghanistan via its territory .

they called on nato leaders gathering in strasbourg to do more to protect the population .
last year more than 2,000 civilians were killed in afghanistan .
us president barack obama is to present his new afghan strategy to nato allies later on friday .
the us has promised 17,000 extra troops and has called on nato to add more .
' eroding support ' while most civilian deaths in afghanistan were caused by insurgents , a significant minority were caused by coalition forces .
the bbc 's ian pannell in kabul says civilian deaths have become a burning issue , with fears that in some cases military tactics generate public hostility which in turn feeds the insurgency .
in a report titled caught in the conflict , 11 aid groups including oxfam , actionaid and care called on nato to change the way it operates .
" the troop surge will fail to achieve greater overall security and stability unless the military prioritise the protection of afghan civilians , " matt waldman , head of policy for oxfam international on afghanistan , said .
civilian deaths have caused resentment in afghanistan " despite taking steps to reduce civilian casualties , and repeated calls for restraint , too many military operations by foreign troops involve excessive force , loss of life and damage to property .
" this is causing anger , fear and resentment among afghans , and is steadily eroding popular support for the international presence . "
nato has changed the way it conducts operations to try to minimise casualties .
but the taleban often launch attacks from populated areas making that hard to achieve , our correspondent says .
there is a general expectation that there will be a significant increase in violence this summer as more troops are met by stiffer resistance from the taleban .
if that occurs then more civilian deaths seem inevitable , he says .
president obama will present his new afghan strategy to nato at strasbourg , where its annual summit coincides with its 60th anniversary .
although european governments have been reluctant to deploy any new ground forces , they have been more willing to offer humanitarian and development assistance to kabul .
us officials say president obama is unlikely to press for any concrete commitments at the nato meeting .
he is more likely to use the summit to build ties with leaders whom he is meeting for the first time , they say .
writing in the new york times ahead of the summit , nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer said he hoped it could " find agreement on a common way forward , taking into account the new us effort including more support for pakistan , a greater effort to strengthen the -lsb- afghan -rsb- police , more coordinated aid and visible steps by kabul to fight corruption " .
nato is also expected to approve moves to normalise ties with russia .
moscow has agreed to allow nato to send supplies to afghanistan via its territory .

they were given sentences of six months to three years after being found guilty of obtaining state secrets .
three groups were found operating in just one school in zhejiang province .
one group of parents , some of them local officials , persuaded a teacher to fax them the questions once the exam got under way .
they had organised six university students to answer them .
they sent these answers using mobile phones to their children in the exam hall who were wearing tiny earpieces .
mini scanner another man had employed more high-tech equipment .
he bribed a student taking the same exam as his son to get him the questions using a miniature scanner .
he had nine teachers on standby to answer them .
he then transmitted the answers back to the two boys taking the exam .
a third scam involved a teacher at the school who had charged hundreds of dollars to get the answers to students but whose equipment failed .
the cheats were discovered when police nearby detected the efforts to transmit the answers to the students on their radios .
in court , one of the fathers involved said they had had high hopes for their children and the exams were vital for them to secure good futures .
this case has become infamous here because of the elaborate means used to try to cheat , but it does not appear to be that unusual .
in recent months it emerged that across china , applicants to join the civil service had cheated using similar methods .
on that occasion one state-run newspaper reminded cheats that in years gone by they would have been put to death .

the care quality commission identified 21 trusts in england which were not doing enough in areas such as cleanliness and decontamination .
the regulator said if the group did not improve they would face tough measures such as fines and closure of services .
but the government pointed out that overall infection rates were falling .
the target to halve mrsa infections was met last year and latest figures show that clostridium difficile rates are also falling .
we will monitor their performance throughout the year and will not hesitate to use our enforcement powers to protect patients ' safety where needed barbara young , of the care quality commission nonetheless , the regulator , which was only created this week following the merger of three bodies , has made infections one of its key priorities .
one of the new measures it has brought in has been a system of registration , which means nhs trusts have to meet certain criteria to even be registered with the regulator .
in the first year this only applies to infection control , but from next april it will be extended to other areas .
the cqc assessed all 388 trusts , covering hospitals , mental health units , ambulances and primary care trusts which run community services , against hygiene standards and cross-checked these with surveys and previous inspection reports .
the regulator has registered all the trusts , but attached conditions demanding improvements be made over the coming weeks and months in the 21 cases .
' slow progress ' of those 21 trusts , 13 had declared they did not meet some of the cqc 's registration criteria .

more from today programme the regulator also highlighted eight where progress in tackling the problems was said to be slow .
cqc chairman barbara young said : " while infection rates at these trusts are not necessarily higher they can do more to strengthen their approaches to infection control and help prevent outbreaks .
" we will monitor their performance throughout the year and will not hesitate to use our enforcement powers to protect patients ' safety where needed . "
a department of health spokesman said it was important to recognise that the nhs was getting better over infections .
but he added : " we expect those trusts to rapidly improve the safety of the services provided and deliver a high quality of care as expected by all patients . "
joyce robins , of patient concern , said : " i am not surprised by this .
yes , infection rates are coming down , but it was from a very high base .
" too many hospitals are not taking this seriously enough and it is having horrific results for patients . "
improvements made averil dongworth is chief executive of barnet and chase farm hospitals nhs trust , which saw one of its hospitals , chase farm , receive an improvement notice two years ago .
she said : " what i have said to staff on many occasions , and they agree , it was the worst thing that happened to us , it was the best thing that happened to us , and we have gone further , faster and deeper in changing the quality of our services in this hospital because of it . " • the eight trusts which were responding slowly were : barnet , enfield and haringey mental health , barts and the london , leeds teaching hospitals , kettering general , north bristol , plymouth hospitals , south west london and st george 's mental health , united lincolnshire hospitals . • the 13 other trusts highlighted were : alder hey , barking , havering and redbridge , coventry and warwickshire partnership trust , herefordshire pct , isle of wight , leeds partnerships mental health , lewisham pct , manchester pct , medway , royal surrey , somerset pct , west sussex pct , yorkshire ambulance . • all of the above are hospital trusts unless stated otherwise .

chief minister tony brown announced the news on thursday evening the isle of man has escaped inclusion in a so-called " blacklist " of offshore financial centres , according to government ministers .
world leaders at the g20 summit issued a communique on thursday vowing to take action against tax havens , but are yet to publicly identify them .
fears the isle of man could be targeted have been allayed by officials , finance minister allan bell has said .
the island was named on an oecd white list of responsible jurisdictions .
but mr bell told reporters : " i think had we been on the blacklist it would make it very difficult for our economy to be as successful as it has been . "
" it may well have seen the departure of certain businesses from the island in the wake of that . "
sanctions warning in their communique on thursday , world leaders said they were " ready to deploy sanctions to protect our public finances and financial systems " .
" the era of banking secrecy is over , " they added , before highlighting the oecd 's list of countries assessed for their tax co-operation , also published on thursday .
in the oecd list the isle of man was named alongside western europe 's biggest countries as jurisdictions that had " substantially implemented the internationally agreed tax standard " .
other countries in the island 's bracket include the united states , united kingdom , germany and france .
