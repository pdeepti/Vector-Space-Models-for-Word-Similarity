15 . gies will commemorate her centenary birthday quietly with family and friends , the anne frank museum said on its web site .
in a recent statement on her own web site , gies said she was proud to have lived so long .
" i am almost one hundred years old now .
that is an admirable age , and i have even reached it in fairly good health .
so then it 's fair to say you 've been fortunate , and being fortunate seems to be the red thread running through my life , " she said .
during the second world war , gies , along with johannes kleiman , victor kugler , bep voskuijl , jan gies and johan voskuijl , made up a team of helpers for the eight jewish people hiding in the secret annex at prinsengracht 263 in amsterdam .
diary guardian bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chestnut tree which comforted anne frank while she hid from the nazis one of those in hiding , anne frank , described in detail the intricacies of life in the annex from 1942 to 1944 in a personal diary , which came under the care of gies after the family was betrayed and taken into custody by authorities in occupied holland .
the anne frank diary went on to become an international bestseller and has been translated into 70 languages .
" when otto -lrb- frank , anne 's father -rrb- approached her in the spring of 1942 to help him and his family go into hiding , miep did not hesitate , " the anne frank museum said .
" for two years , together with the other helpers , she made sure that the people in hiding were supplied with food and other essentials … putting their own lives at risk . "
it is a matter of much speculation as to who betrayed the eight people in hiding , and historians say the person 's true identity may never be know .
of the eight , only otto frank survived imprisonment in a nazi concentration camp .
miep has received numerous honors in germany and the netherlands for her actions during the war . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to neil shearing of london-based capital economics , " the latvian economy is staring into the abyss . " it is , however , precisely the enormous scale of the problems in one of the european union 's smaller members that is drawing the attention of commentators across the globe .
with gdp set to drop by at least 10 percent in 2009 , according to most estimates , plus inflation that has only just returned to single digits , yawning current account and trade deficits , rising unemployment , devaluation pressure and a housing market that has gone from boom to bust , it might seem latvia 's situation could n't get worse .
but add riots by young people and blockades by angry farmers in the capital , riga , plus a huge 7.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 9.5-billion -rrb- emergency bailout by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- in recent weeks , and suddenly things get even more serious .
as a result , analysts and experts around the world are dedicating an unprecedented volume of column inches , charts , graphs , analysis and predictions to the tiny baltic state with a population of just 2.3 million .
even nobel economics laureate paul krugman commented on latvia in december 2008 , describing it as " the new argentina " in an online discussion about the effects of currency devaluation .
unprecedented , enormous deficits as a result latvia finds itself gaining the media publicity that it has been craving since it won its independence from the soviet union in 1991 - unfortunately for the wrong reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists have never seen anything like latvia 's crisis " there is no precedent for latvia in the sense that while some of the problems have happened elsewhere they have n't done so to the same extent , " shearing told dpa news service .
" the scale of the deficits in latvia is enormous - a current account deficit of 20 percent of gdp is unheard of . "
" when i quote such figures , i 've had clients phoning up and asking ' are you sure about that ? " ' he added .
roger wessman , head of research with nordic banking group nordea in finland has also noted increased interest in the baltics , in general , and latvia , in particular .
" i definitely agree that economists are in general more interested , " he said .
" in the past couple of years we 've seen heightened interest and a heightened concern .
we had a very high peak at the time of the negotiations between the latvian state and the imf .
latvia versus estonia in race to be the worst " latvia is competing for having the worst slump in the eu with estonia , but it would n't be an exaggeration to say it is at the extreme end of the economic spectrum , " wessman said .
but hopes still linger in latvia that current notoriety could be turned into something positive in the longer term .
according to ojars kalnins , director of the latvian institute which is responsible for promoting the country abroad , if the latvian story is a novel , the country is just passing the opening chapters that capture the reader 's interest .
" in a world of bad economic news , we have a unique case developing , " he said .
" if latvia were to weather this storm , a bad news story would become a good news story , " kalnins insisted .

so then it 's fair to say you 've been fortunate , and being fortunate seems to be the red thread running through my life , " she said .
during the second world war , gies , along with johannes kleiman , victor kugler , bep voskuijl , jan gies and johan voskuijl , made up a team of helpers for the eight jewish people hiding in the secret annex at prinsengracht 263 in amsterdam .

according to neil shearing of london-based capital economics , " the latvian economy is staring into the abyss . " it is , however , precisely the enormous scale of the problems in one of the european union 's smaller members that is drawing the attention of commentators across the globe .
with gdp set to drop by at least 10 percent in 2009 , according to most estimates , plus inflation that has only just returned to single digits , yawning current account and trade deficits , rising unemployment , devaluation pressure and a housing market that has gone from boom to bust , it might seem latvia 's situation could n't get worse .
but add riots by young people and blockades by angry farmers in the capital , riga , plus a huge 7.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 9.5-billion -rrb- emergency bailout by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- in recent weeks , and suddenly things get even more serious .
as a result , analysts and experts around the world are dedicating an unprecedented volume of column inches , charts , graphs , analysis and predictions to the tiny baltic state with a population of just 2.3 million .
even nobel economics laureate paul krugman commented on latvia in december 2008 , describing it as " the new argentina " in an online discussion about the effects of currency devaluation .
unprecedented , enormous deficits as a result latvia finds itself gaining the media publicity that it has been craving since it won its independence from the soviet union in 1991 - unfortunately for the wrong reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists have never seen anything like latvia 's crisis " there is no precedent for latvia in the sense that while some of the problems have happened elsewhere they have n't done so to the same extent , " shearing told dpa news service .
" the scale of the deficits in latvia is enormous - a current account deficit of 20 percent of gdp is unheard of . "
" when i quote such figures , i 've had clients phoning up and asking ' are you sure about that ? " ' he added .
roger wessman , head of research with nordic banking group nordea in finland has also noted increased interest in the baltics , in general , and latvia , in particular .
" i definitely agree that economists are in general more interested , " he said .
" in the past couple of years we 've seen heightened interest and a heightened concern .
we had a very high peak at the time of the negotiations between the latvian state and the imf .
latvia versus estonia in race to be the worst " latvia is competing for having the worst slump in the eu with estonia , but it would n't be an exaggeration to say it is at the extreme end of the economic spectrum , " wessman said .
but hopes still linger in latvia that current notoriety could be turned into something positive in the longer term .
according to ojars kalnins , director of the latvian institute which is responsible for promoting the country abroad , if the latvian story is a novel , the country is just passing the opening chapters that capture the reader 's interest .
" in a world of bad economic news , we have a unique case developing , " he said .
" if latvia were to weather this storm , a bad news story would become a good news story , " kalnins insisted .
" as in any good novel with plot twists , things may get worse before they get better , but if there is a happy ending , well , then you have a rip-roaring story !

according to neil shearing of london-based capital economics , " the latvian economy is staring into the abyss . " it is , however , precisely the enormous scale of the problems in one of the european union 's smaller members that is drawing the attention of commentators across the globe .
with gdp set to drop by at least 10 percent in 2009 , according to most estimates , plus inflation that has only just returned to single digits , yawning current account and trade deficits , rising unemployment , devaluation pressure and a housing market that has gone from boom to bust , it might seem latvia 's situation could n't get worse .
but add riots by young people and blockades by angry farmers in the capital , riga , plus a huge 7.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 9.5-billion -rrb- emergency bailout by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- in recent weeks , and suddenly things get even more serious .
as a result , analysts and experts around the world are dedicating an unprecedented volume of column inches , charts , graphs , analysis and predictions to the tiny baltic state with a population of just 2.3 million .
even nobel economics laureate paul krugman commented on latvia in december 2008 , describing it as " the new argentina " in an online discussion about the effects of currency devaluation .
unprecedented , enormous deficits as a result latvia finds itself gaining the media publicity that it has been craving since it won its independence from the soviet union in 1991 - unfortunately for the wrong reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists have never seen anything like latvia 's crisis " there is no precedent for latvia in the sense that while some of the problems have happened elsewhere they have n't done so to the same extent , " shearing told dpa news service .
" the scale of the deficits in latvia is enormous - a current account deficit of 20 percent of gdp is unheard of . "
" when i quote such figures , i 've had clients phoning up and asking ' are you sure about that ? " ' he added .
roger wessman , head of research with nordic banking group nordea in finland has also noted increased interest in the baltics , in general , and latvia , in particular .
" i definitely agree that economists are in general more interested , " he said .
" in the past couple of years we 've seen heightened interest and a heightened concern .
we had a very high peak at the time of the negotiations between the latvian state and the imf .
latvia versus estonia in race to be the worst " latvia is competing for having the worst slump in the eu with estonia , but it would n't be an exaggeration to say it is at the extreme end of the economic spectrum , " wessman said .
but hopes still linger in latvia that current notoriety could be turned into something positive in the longer term .
according to ojars kalnins , director of the latvian institute which is responsible for promoting the country abroad , if the latvian story is a novel , the country is just passing the opening chapters that capture the reader 's interest .

according to neil shearing of london-based capital economics , " the latvian economy is staring into the abyss . " it is , however , precisely the enormous scale of the problems in one of the european union 's smaller members that is drawing the attention of commentators across the globe .
with gdp set to drop by at least 10 percent in 2009 , according to most estimates , plus inflation that has only just returned to single digits , yawning current account and trade deficits , rising unemployment , devaluation pressure and a housing market that has gone from boom to bust , it might seem latvia 's situation could n't get worse .
but add riots by young people and blockades by angry farmers in the capital , riga , plus a huge 7.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 9.5-billion -rrb- emergency bailout by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- in recent weeks , and suddenly things get even more serious .
as a result , analysts and experts around the world are dedicating an unprecedented volume of column inches , charts , graphs , analysis and predictions to the tiny baltic state with a population of just 2.3 million .
even nobel economics laureate paul krugman commented on latvia in december 2008 , describing it as " the new argentina " in an online discussion about the effects of currency devaluation .
unprecedented , enormous deficits as a result latvia finds itself gaining the media publicity that it has been craving since it won its independence from the soviet union in 1991 - unfortunately for the wrong reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists have never seen anything like latvia 's crisis " there is no precedent for latvia in the sense that while some of the problems have happened elsewhere they have n't done so to the same extent , " shearing told dpa news service .
" the scale of the deficits in latvia is enormous - a current account deficit of 20 percent of gdp is unheard of . "
" when i quote such figures , i 've had clients phoning up and asking ' are you sure about that ? " ' he added .
roger wessman , head of research with nordic banking group nordea in finland has also noted increased interest in the baltics , in general , and latvia , in particular .
" i definitely agree that economists are in general more interested , " he said .
" in the past couple of years we 've seen heightened interest and a heightened concern .
we had a very high peak at the time of the negotiations between the latvian state and the imf .
latvia versus estonia in race to be the worst " latvia is competing for having the worst slump in the eu with estonia , but it would n't be an exaggeration to say it is at the extreme end of the economic spectrum , " wessman said .
but hopes still linger in latvia that current notoriety could be turned into something positive in the longer term .
according to ojars kalnins , director of the latvian institute which is responsible for promoting the country abroad , if the latvian story is a novel , the country is just passing the opening chapters that capture the reader 's interest .
" in a world of bad economic news , we have a unique case developing , " he said .
" if latvia were to weather this storm , a bad news story would become a good news story , " kalnins insisted .
" as in any good novel with plot twists , things may get worse before they get better , but if there is a happy ending , well , then you have a rip-roaring story !

according to neil shearing of london-based capital economics , " the latvian economy is staring into the abyss . " it is , however , precisely the enormous scale of the problems in one of the european union 's smaller members that is drawing the attention of commentators across the globe .
with gdp set to drop by at least 10 percent in 2009 , according to most estimates , plus inflation that has only just returned to single digits , yawning current account and trade deficits , rising unemployment , devaluation pressure and a housing market that has gone from boom to bust , it might seem latvia 's situation could n't get worse .
but add riots by young people and blockades by angry farmers in the capital , riga , plus a huge 7.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 9.5-billion -rrb- emergency bailout by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- in recent weeks , and suddenly things get even more serious .
as a result , analysts and experts around the world are dedicating an unprecedented volume of column inches , charts , graphs , analysis and predictions to the tiny baltic state with a population of just 2.3 million .
even nobel economics laureate paul krugman commented on latvia in december 2008 , describing it as " the new argentina " in an online discussion about the effects of currency devaluation .
unprecedented , enormous deficits as a result latvia finds itself gaining the media publicity that it has been craving since it won its independence from the soviet union in 1991 - unfortunately for the wrong reasons .

" when i quote such figures , i 've had clients phoning up and asking ' are you sure about that ? " ' he added .
roger wessman , head of research with nordic banking group nordea in finland has also noted increased interest in the baltics , in general , and latvia , in particular .
" i definitely agree that economists are in general more interested , " he said .
" in the past couple of years we 've seen heightened interest and a heightened concern .

but hopes still linger in latvia that current notoriety could be turned into something positive in the longer term .
according to ojars kalnins , director of the latvian institute which is responsible for promoting the country abroad , if the latvian story is a novel , the country is just passing the opening chapters that capture the reader 's interest .

15 . gies will commemorate her centenary birthday quietly with family and friends , the anne frank museum said on its web site .
in a recent statement on her own web site , gies said she was proud to have lived so long .
" i am almost one hundred years old now .
that is an admirable age , and i have even reached it in fairly good health .
so then it 's fair to say you 've been fortunate , and being fortunate seems to be the red thread running through my life , " she said .
during the second world war , gies , along with johannes kleiman , victor kugler , bep voskuijl , jan gies and johan voskuijl , made up a team of helpers for the eight jewish people hiding in the secret annex at prinsengracht 263 in amsterdam .
diary guardian bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chestnut tree which comforted anne frank while she hid from the nazis one of those in hiding , anne frank , described in detail the intricacies of life in the annex from 1942 to 1944 in a personal diary , which came under the care of gies after the family was betrayed and taken into custody by authorities in occupied holland .
the anne frank diary went on to become an international bestseller and has been translated into 70 languages .
" when otto -lrb- frank , anne 's father -rrb- approached her in the spring of 1942 to help him and his family go into hiding , miep did not hesitate , " the anne frank museum said .
" for two years , together with the other helpers , she made sure that the people in hiding were supplied with food and other essentials … putting their own lives at risk . "
it is a matter of much speculation as to who betrayed the eight people in hiding , and historians say the person 's true identity may never be know .
of the eight , only otto frank survived imprisonment in a nazi concentration camp .
miep has received numerous honors in germany and the netherlands for her actions during the war . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to neil shearing of london-based capital economics , " the latvian economy is staring into the abyss . " it is , however , precisely the enormous scale of the problems in one of the european union 's smaller members that is drawing the attention of commentators across the globe .
with gdp set to drop by at least 10 percent in 2009 , according to most estimates , plus inflation that has only just returned to single digits , yawning current account and trade deficits , rising unemployment , devaluation pressure and a housing market that has gone from boom to bust , it might seem latvia 's situation could n't get worse .
but add riots by young people and blockades by angry farmers in the capital , riga , plus a huge 7.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 9.5-billion -rrb- emergency bailout by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- in recent weeks , and suddenly things get even more serious .
as a result , analysts and experts around the world are dedicating an unprecedented volume of column inches , charts , graphs , analysis and predictions to the tiny baltic state with a population of just 2.3 million .
even nobel economics laureate paul krugman commented on latvia in december 2008 , describing it as " the new argentina " in an online discussion about the effects of currency devaluation .
unprecedented , enormous deficits as a result latvia finds itself gaining the media publicity that it has been craving since it won its independence from the soviet union in 1991 - unfortunately for the wrong reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists have never seen anything like latvia 's crisis " there is no precedent for latvia in the sense that while some of the problems have happened elsewhere they have n't done so to the same extent , " shearing told dpa news service .
" the scale of the deficits in latvia is enormous - a current account deficit of 20 percent of gdp is unheard of . "
" when i quote such figures , i 've had clients phoning up and asking ' are you sure about that ? " ' he added .
roger wessman , head of research with nordic banking group nordea in finland has also noted increased interest in the baltics , in general , and latvia , in particular .
" i definitely agree that economists are in general more interested , " he said .
" in the past couple of years we 've seen heightened interest and a heightened concern .
we had a very high peak at the time of the negotiations between the latvian state and the imf .
latvia versus estonia in race to be the worst " latvia is competing for having the worst slump in the eu with estonia , but it would n't be an exaggeration to say it is at the extreme end of the economic spectrum , " wessman said .
but hopes still linger in latvia that current notoriety could be turned into something positive in the longer term .
according to ojars kalnins , director of the latvian institute which is responsible for promoting the country abroad , if the latvian story is a novel , the country is just passing the opening chapters that capture the reader 's interest .
" in a world of bad economic news , we have a unique case developing , " he said .

according to neil shearing of london-based capital economics , " the latvian economy is staring into the abyss . " it is , however , precisely the enormous scale of the problems in one of the european union 's smaller members that is drawing the attention of commentators across the globe .
with gdp set to drop by at least 10 percent in 2009 , according to most estimates , plus inflation that has only just returned to single digits , yawning current account and trade deficits , rising unemployment , devaluation pressure and a housing market that has gone from boom to bust , it might seem latvia 's situation could n't get worse .
but add riots by young people and blockades by angry farmers in the capital , riga , plus a huge 7.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 9.5-billion -rrb- emergency bailout by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- in recent weeks , and suddenly things get even more serious .
as a result , analysts and experts around the world are dedicating an unprecedented volume of column inches , charts , graphs , analysis and predictions to the tiny baltic state with a population of just 2.3 million .
even nobel economics laureate paul krugman commented on latvia in december 2008 , describing it as " the new argentina " in an online discussion about the effects of currency devaluation .
unprecedented , enormous deficits as a result latvia finds itself gaining the media publicity that it has been craving since it won its independence from the soviet union in 1991 - unfortunately for the wrong reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists have never seen anything like latvia 's crisis " there is no precedent for latvia in the sense that while some of the problems have happened elsewhere they have n't done so to the same extent , " shearing told dpa news service .
" the scale of the deficits in latvia is enormous - a current account deficit of 20 percent of gdp is unheard of . "
" when i quote such figures , i 've had clients phoning up and asking ' are you sure about that ? " ' he added .
roger wessman , head of research with nordic banking group nordea in finland has also noted increased interest in the baltics , in general , and latvia , in particular .
" i definitely agree that economists are in general more interested , " he said .
" in the past couple of years we 've seen heightened interest and a heightened concern .
we had a very high peak at the time of the negotiations between the latvian state and the imf .
latvia versus estonia in race to be the worst " latvia is competing for having the worst slump in the eu with estonia , but it would n't be an exaggeration to say it is at the extreme end of the economic spectrum , " wessman said .
but hopes still linger in latvia that current notoriety could be turned into something positive in the longer term .
according to ojars kalnins , director of the latvian institute which is responsible for promoting the country abroad , if the latvian story is a novel , the country is just passing the opening chapters that capture the reader 's interest .
" in a world of bad economic news , we have a unique case developing , " he said .
" if latvia were to weather this storm , a bad news story would become a good news story , " kalnins insisted .
" as in any good novel with plot twists , things may get worse before they get better , but if there is a happy ending , well , then you have a rip-roaring story !

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 15.02.2009 latvia : europe 's most extreme , dramatic economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia 's dramatic economic woes have led to unrest on the streets of riga the latvian economy is in bad shape , even by the standards of the global financial crisis .
according to neil shearing of london-based capital economics , " the latvian economy is staring into the abyss . " it is , however , precisely the enormous scale of the problems in one of the european union 's smaller members that is drawing the attention of commentators across the globe .
with gdp set to drop by at least 10 percent in 2009 , according to most estimates , plus inflation that has only just returned to single digits , yawning current account and trade deficits , rising unemployment , devaluation pressure and a housing market that has gone from boom to bust , it might seem latvia 's situation could n't get worse .
but add riots by young people and blockades by angry farmers in the capital , riga , plus a huge 7.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 9.5-billion -rrb- emergency bailout by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- in recent weeks , and suddenly things get even more serious .
as a result , analysts and experts around the world are dedicating an unprecedented volume of column inches , charts , graphs , analysis and predictions to the tiny baltic state with a population of just 2.3 million .
even nobel economics laureate paul krugman commented on latvia in december 2008 , describing it as " the new argentina " in an online discussion about the effects of currency devaluation .
unprecedented , enormous deficits as a result latvia finds itself gaining the media publicity that it has been craving since it won its independence from the soviet union in 1991 - unfortunately for the wrong reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists have never seen anything like latvia 's crisis " there is no precedent for latvia in the sense that while some of the problems have happened elsewhere they have n't done so to the same extent , " shearing told dpa news service .
" the scale of the deficits in latvia is enormous - a current account deficit of 20 percent of gdp is unheard of . "
" when i quote such figures , i 've had clients phoning up and asking ' are you sure about that ? " ' he added .
roger wessman , head of research with nordic banking group nordea in finland has also noted increased interest in the baltics , in general , and latvia , in particular .
" i definitely agree that economists are in general more interested , " he said .
" in the past couple of years we 've seen heightened interest and a heightened concern .
we had a very high peak at the time of the negotiations between the latvian state and the imf .
latvia versus estonia in race to be the worst " latvia is competing for having the worst slump in the eu with estonia , but it would n't be an exaggeration to say it is at the extreme end of the economic spectrum , " wessman said .
but hopes still linger in latvia that current notoriety could be turned into something positive in the longer term .
according to ojars kalnins , director of the latvian institute which is responsible for promoting the country abroad , if the latvian story is a novel , the country is just passing the opening chapters that capture the reader 's interest .
" in a world of bad economic news , we have a unique case developing , " he said .
" if latvia were to weather this storm , a bad news story would become a good news story , " kalnins insisted .

" most of the steel deliveries contain contamination levels below the legally allowed limits , " it said in a statement on sunday . the ministry also said it would like to see an initiative developed on the international level to address the issue of irradiated goods .
in france , sweden and the netherlands , radioactive steel from india was discovered which in some cases had been used to manufacture buttons used in elevator control panels . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to neil shearing of london-based capital economics , " the latvian economy is staring into the abyss . " it is , however , precisely the enormous scale of the problems in one of the european union 's smaller members that is drawing the attention of commentators across the globe .
with gdp set to drop by at least 10 percent in 2009 , according to most estimates , plus inflation that has only just returned to single digits , yawning current account and trade deficits , rising unemployment , devaluation pressure and a housing market that has gone from boom to bust , it might seem latvia 's situation could n't get worse .
but add riots by young people and blockades by angry farmers in the capital , riga , plus a huge 7.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 9.5-billion -rrb- emergency bailout by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- in recent weeks , and suddenly things get even more serious .
as a result , analysts and experts around the world are dedicating an unprecedented volume of column inches , charts , graphs , analysis and predictions to the tiny baltic state with a population of just 2.3 million .
even nobel economics laureate paul krugman commented on latvia in december 2008 , describing it as " the new argentina " in an online discussion about the effects of currency devaluation .
unprecedented , enormous deficits as a result latvia finds itself gaining the media publicity that it has been craving since it won its independence from the soviet union in 1991 - unfortunately for the wrong reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists have never seen anything like latvia 's crisis " there is no precedent for latvia in the sense that while some of the problems have happened elsewhere they have n't done so to the same extent , " shearing told dpa news service .
" the scale of the deficits in latvia is enormous - a current account deficit of 20 percent of gdp is unheard of . "
" when i quote such figures , i 've had clients phoning up and asking ' are you sure about that ? " ' he added .
roger wessman , head of research with nordic banking group nordea in finland has also noted increased interest in the baltics , in general , and latvia , in particular .
" i definitely agree that economists are in general more interested , " he said .
" in the past couple of years we 've seen heightened interest and a heightened concern .
we had a very high peak at the time of the negotiations between the latvian state and the imf .
latvia versus estonia in race to be the worst " latvia is competing for having the worst slump in the eu with estonia , but it would n't be an exaggeration to say it is at the extreme end of the economic spectrum , " wessman said .
but hopes still linger in latvia that current notoriety could be turned into something positive in the longer term .
according to ojars kalnins , director of the latvian institute which is responsible for promoting the country abroad , if the latvian story is a novel , the country is just passing the opening chapters that capture the reader 's interest .
" in a world of bad economic news , we have a unique case developing , " he said .
" if latvia were to weather this storm , a bad news story would become a good news story , " kalnins insisted .

in a recent statement on her own web site , gies said she was proud to have lived so long .
" i am almost one hundred years old now .
that is an admirable age , and i have even reached it in fairly good health .
so then it 's fair to say you 've been fortunate , and being fortunate seems to be the red thread running through my life , " she said .
during the second world war , gies , along with johannes kleiman , victor kugler , bep voskuijl , jan gies and johan voskuijl , made up a team of helpers for the eight jewish people hiding in the secret annex at prinsengracht 263 in amsterdam .

the anne frank diary went on to become an international bestseller and has been translated into 70 languages .
" when otto -lrb- frank , anne 's father -rrb- approached her in the spring of 1942 to help him and his family go into hiding , miep did not hesitate , " the anne frank museum said .
" for two years , together with the other helpers , she made sure that the people in hiding were supplied with food and other essentials … putting their own lives at risk . "
it is a matter of much speculation as to who betrayed the eight people in hiding , and historians say the person 's true identity may never be know .
of the eight , only otto frank survived imprisonment in a nazi concentration camp .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 15.02.2009 latvia : europe 's most extreme , dramatic economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia 's dramatic economic woes have led to unrest on the streets of riga the latvian economy is in bad shape , even by the standards of the global financial crisis .
according to neil shearing of london-based capital economics , " the latvian economy is staring into the abyss . " it is , however , precisely the enormous scale of the problems in one of the european union 's smaller members that is drawing the attention of commentators across the globe .
with gdp set to drop by at least 10 percent in 2009 , according to most estimates , plus inflation that has only just returned to single digits , yawning current account and trade deficits , rising unemployment , devaluation pressure and a housing market that has gone from boom to bust , it might seem latvia 's situation could n't get worse .
but add riots by young people and blockades by angry farmers in the capital , riga , plus a huge 7.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 9.5-billion -rrb- emergency bailout by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- in recent weeks , and suddenly things get even more serious .
as a result , analysts and experts around the world are dedicating an unprecedented volume of column inches , charts , graphs , analysis and predictions to the tiny baltic state with a population of just 2.3 million .
even nobel economics laureate paul krugman commented on latvia in december 2008 , describing it as " the new argentina " in an online discussion about the effects of currency devaluation .
unprecedented , enormous deficits as a result latvia finds itself gaining the media publicity that it has been craving since it won its independence from the soviet union in 1991 - unfortunately for the wrong reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists have never seen anything like latvia 's crisis " there is no precedent for latvia in the sense that while some of the problems have happened elsewhere they have n't done so to the same extent , " shearing told dpa news service .
" the scale of the deficits in latvia is enormous - a current account deficit of 20 percent of gdp is unheard of . "
" when i quote such figures , i 've had clients phoning up and asking ' are you sure about that ? " ' he added .
roger wessman , head of research with nordic banking group nordea in finland has also noted increased interest in the baltics , in general , and latvia , in particular .
" i definitely agree that economists are in general more interested , " he said .
" in the past couple of years we 've seen heightened interest and a heightened concern .

with gdp set to drop by at least 10 percent in 2009 , according to most estimates , plus inflation that has only just returned to single digits , yawning current account and trade deficits , rising unemployment , devaluation pressure and a housing market that has gone from boom to bust , it might seem latvia 's situation could n't get worse .

during the second world war , gies , along with johannes kleiman , victor kugler , bep voskuijl , jan gies and johan voskuijl , made up a team of helpers for the eight jewish people hiding in the secret annex at prinsengracht 263 in amsterdam .
diary guardian bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chestnut tree which comforted anne frank while she hid from the nazis one of those in hiding , anne frank , described in detail the intricacies of life in the annex from 1942 to 1944 in a personal diary , which came under the care of gies after the family was betrayed and taken into custody by authorities in occupied holland .
the anne frank diary went on to become an international bestseller and has been translated into 70 languages .
" when otto -lrb- frank , anne 's father -rrb- approached her in the spring of 1942 to help him and his family go into hiding , miep did not hesitate , " the anne frank museum said .

according to neil shearing of london-based capital economics , " the latvian economy is staring into the abyss . " it is , however , precisely the enormous scale of the problems in one of the european union 's smaller members that is drawing the attention of commentators across the globe .
with gdp set to drop by at least 10 percent in 2009 , according to most estimates , plus inflation that has only just returned to single digits , yawning current account and trade deficits , rising unemployment , devaluation pressure and a housing market that has gone from boom to bust , it might seem latvia 's situation could n't get worse .

with gdp set to drop by at least 10 percent in 2009 , according to most estimates , plus inflation that has only just returned to single digits , yawning current account and trade deficits , rising unemployment , devaluation pressure and a housing market that has gone from boom to bust , it might seem latvia 's situation could n't get worse .
but add riots by young people and blockades by angry farmers in the capital , riga , plus a huge 7.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 9.5-billion -rrb- emergency bailout by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- in recent weeks , and suddenly things get even more serious .
as a result , analysts and experts around the world are dedicating an unprecedented volume of column inches , charts , graphs , analysis and predictions to the tiny baltic state with a population of just 2.3 million .
even nobel economics laureate paul krugman commented on latvia in december 2008 , describing it as " the new argentina " in an online discussion about the effects of currency devaluation .
unprecedented , enormous deficits as a result latvia finds itself gaining the media publicity that it has been craving since it won its independence from the soviet union in 1991 - unfortunately for the wrong reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists have never seen anything like latvia 's crisis " there is no precedent for latvia in the sense that while some of the problems have happened elsewhere they have n't done so to the same extent , " shearing told dpa news service .
" the scale of the deficits in latvia is enormous - a current account deficit of 20 percent of gdp is unheard of . "
" when i quote such figures , i 've had clients phoning up and asking ' are you sure about that ? " ' he added .
roger wessman , head of research with nordic banking group nordea in finland has also noted increased interest in the baltics , in general , and latvia , in particular .
" i definitely agree that economists are in general more interested , " he said .
" in the past couple of years we 've seen heightened interest and a heightened concern .
we had a very high peak at the time of the negotiations between the latvian state and the imf .
latvia versus estonia in race to be the worst " latvia is competing for having the worst slump in the eu with estonia , but it would n't be an exaggeration to say it is at the extreme end of the economic spectrum , " wessman said .
but hopes still linger in latvia that current notoriety could be turned into something positive in the longer term .
according to ojars kalnins , director of the latvian institute which is responsible for promoting the country abroad , if the latvian story is a novel , the country is just passing the opening chapters that capture the reader 's interest .
" in a world of bad economic news , we have a unique case developing , " he said .
" if latvia were to weather this storm , a bad news story would become a good news story , " kalnins insisted .
" as in any good novel with plot twists , things may get worse before they get better , but if there is a happy ending , well , then you have a rip-roaring story !

" most of the steel deliveries contain contamination levels below the legally allowed limits , " it said in a statement on sunday . the ministry also said it would like to see an initiative developed on the international level to address the issue of irradiated goods .
in france , sweden and the netherlands , radioactive steel from india was discovered which in some cases had been used to manufacture buttons used in elevator control panels . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 . gies will commemorate her centenary birthday quietly with family and friends , the anne frank museum said on its web site .
in a recent statement on her own web site , gies said she was proud to have lived so long .
" i am almost one hundred years old now .
that is an admirable age , and i have even reached it in fairly good health .
so then it 's fair to say you 've been fortunate , and being fortunate seems to be the red thread running through my life , " she said .
during the second world war , gies , along with johannes kleiman , victor kugler , bep voskuijl , jan gies and johan voskuijl , made up a team of helpers for the eight jewish people hiding in the secret annex at prinsengracht 263 in amsterdam .
diary guardian bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chestnut tree which comforted anne frank while she hid from the nazis one of those in hiding , anne frank , described in detail the intricacies of life in the annex from 1942 to 1944 in a personal diary , which came under the care of gies after the family was betrayed and taken into custody by authorities in occupied holland .
the anne frank diary went on to become an international bestseller and has been translated into 70 languages .
" when otto -lrb- frank , anne 's father -rrb- approached her in the spring of 1942 to help him and his family go into hiding , miep did not hesitate , " the anne frank museum said .
" for two years , together with the other helpers , she made sure that the people in hiding were supplied with food and other essentials … putting their own lives at risk . "
it is a matter of much speculation as to who betrayed the eight people in hiding , and historians say the person 's true identity may never be know .
of the eight , only otto frank survived imprisonment in a nazi concentration camp .
miep has received numerous honors in germany and the netherlands for her actions during the war . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 15.02.2009 latvia : europe 's most extreme , dramatic economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia 's dramatic economic woes have led to unrest on the streets of riga the latvian economy is in bad shape , even by the standards of the global financial crisis .
according to neil shearing of london-based capital economics , " the latvian economy is staring into the abyss . " it is , however , precisely the enormous scale of the problems in one of the european union 's smaller members that is drawing the attention of commentators across the globe .
with gdp set to drop by at least 10 percent in 2009 , according to most estimates , plus inflation that has only just returned to single digits , yawning current account and trade deficits , rising unemployment , devaluation pressure and a housing market that has gone from boom to bust , it might seem latvia 's situation could n't get worse .
but add riots by young people and blockades by angry farmers in the capital , riga , plus a huge 7.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 9.5-billion -rrb- emergency bailout by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- in recent weeks , and suddenly things get even more serious .
as a result , analysts and experts around the world are dedicating an unprecedented volume of column inches , charts , graphs , analysis and predictions to the tiny baltic state with a population of just 2.3 million .
even nobel economics laureate paul krugman commented on latvia in december 2008 , describing it as " the new argentina " in an online discussion about the effects of currency devaluation .
unprecedented , enormous deficits as a result latvia finds itself gaining the media publicity that it has been craving since it won its independence from the soviet union in 1991 - unfortunately for the wrong reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists have never seen anything like latvia 's crisis " there is no precedent for latvia in the sense that while some of the problems have happened elsewhere they have n't done so to the same extent , " shearing told dpa news service .
" the scale of the deficits in latvia is enormous - a current account deficit of 20 percent of gdp is unheard of . "
" when i quote such figures , i 've had clients phoning up and asking ' are you sure about that ? " ' he added .
roger wessman , head of research with nordic banking group nordea in finland has also noted increased interest in the baltics , in general , and latvia , in particular .
" i definitely agree that economists are in general more interested , " he said .
" in the past couple of years we 've seen heightened interest and a heightened concern .
we had a very high peak at the time of the negotiations between the latvian state and the imf .
latvia versus estonia in race to be the worst " latvia is competing for having the worst slump in the eu with estonia , but it would n't be an exaggeration to say it is at the extreme end of the economic spectrum , " wessman said .
but hopes still linger in latvia that current notoriety could be turned into something positive in the longer term .
according to ojars kalnins , director of the latvian institute which is responsible for promoting the country abroad , if the latvian story is a novel , the country is just passing the opening chapters that capture the reader 's interest .
" in a world of bad economic news , we have a unique case developing , " he said .
" if latvia were to weather this storm , a bad news story would become a good news story , " kalnins insisted .
" as in any good novel with plot twists , things may get worse before they get better , but if there is a happy ending , well , then you have a rip-roaring story !

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 15.02.2009 latvia : europe 's most extreme , dramatic economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia 's dramatic economic woes have led to unrest on the streets of riga the latvian economy is in bad shape , even by the standards of the global financial crisis .
according to neil shearing of london-based capital economics , " the latvian economy is staring into the abyss . " it is , however , precisely the enormous scale of the problems in one of the european union 's smaller members that is drawing the attention of commentators across the globe .
with gdp set to drop by at least 10 percent in 2009 , according to most estimates , plus inflation that has only just returned to single digits , yawning current account and trade deficits , rising unemployment , devaluation pressure and a housing market that has gone from boom to bust , it might seem latvia 's situation could n't get worse .
but add riots by young people and blockades by angry farmers in the capital , riga , plus a huge 7.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 9.5-billion -rrb- emergency bailout by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- in recent weeks , and suddenly things get even more serious .
as a result , analysts and experts around the world are dedicating an unprecedented volume of column inches , charts , graphs , analysis and predictions to the tiny baltic state with a population of just 2.3 million .
even nobel economics laureate paul krugman commented on latvia in december 2008 , describing it as " the new argentina " in an online discussion about the effects of currency devaluation .
unprecedented , enormous deficits as a result latvia finds itself gaining the media publicity that it has been craving since it won its independence from the soviet union in 1991 - unfortunately for the wrong reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists have never seen anything like latvia 's crisis " there is no precedent for latvia in the sense that while some of the problems have happened elsewhere they have n't done so to the same extent , " shearing told dpa news service .
" the scale of the deficits in latvia is enormous - a current account deficit of 20 percent of gdp is unheard of . "
" when i quote such figures , i 've had clients phoning up and asking ' are you sure about that ? " ' he added .
roger wessman , head of research with nordic banking group nordea in finland has also noted increased interest in the baltics , in general , and latvia , in particular .
" i definitely agree that economists are in general more interested , " he said .
" in the past couple of years we 've seen heightened interest and a heightened concern .
we had a very high peak at the time of the negotiations between the latvian state and the imf .
latvia versus estonia in race to be the worst " latvia is competing for having the worst slump in the eu with estonia , but it would n't be an exaggeration to say it is at the extreme end of the economic spectrum , " wessman said .
but hopes still linger in latvia that current notoriety could be turned into something positive in the longer term .
according to ojars kalnins , director of the latvian institute which is responsible for promoting the country abroad , if the latvian story is a novel , the country is just passing the opening chapters that capture the reader 's interest .
" in a world of bad economic news , we have a unique case developing , " he said .
" if latvia were to weather this storm , a bad news story would become a good news story , " kalnins insisted .
" as in any good novel with plot twists , things may get worse before they get better , but if there is a happy ending , well , then you have a rip-roaring story !

15 . gies will commemorate her centenary birthday quietly with family and friends , the anne frank museum said on its web site .
in a recent statement on her own web site , gies said she was proud to have lived so long .
" i am almost one hundred years old now .
that is an admirable age , and i have even reached it in fairly good health .
so then it 's fair to say you 've been fortunate , and being fortunate seems to be the red thread running through my life , " she said .
during the second world war , gies , along with johannes kleiman , victor kugler , bep voskuijl , jan gies and johan voskuijl , made up a team of helpers for the eight jewish people hiding in the secret annex at prinsengracht 263 in amsterdam .
diary guardian bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chestnut tree which comforted anne frank while she hid from the nazis one of those in hiding , anne frank , described in detail the intricacies of life in the annex from 1942 to 1944 in a personal diary , which came under the care of gies after the family was betrayed and taken into custody by authorities in occupied holland .
the anne frank diary went on to become an international bestseller and has been translated into 70 languages .
" when otto -lrb- frank , anne 's father -rrb- approached her in the spring of 1942 to help him and his family go into hiding , miep did not hesitate , " the anne frank museum said .
" for two years , together with the other helpers , she made sure that the people in hiding were supplied with food and other essentials … putting their own lives at risk . "
it is a matter of much speculation as to who betrayed the eight people in hiding , and historians say the person 's true identity may never be know .
of the eight , only otto frank survived imprisonment in a nazi concentration camp .

" most of the steel deliveries contain contamination levels below the legally allowed limits , " it said in a statement on sunday . the ministry also said it would like to see an initiative developed on the international level to address the issue of irradiated goods .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 15.02.2009 latvia : europe 's most extreme , dramatic economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia 's dramatic economic woes have led to unrest on the streets of riga the latvian economy is in bad shape , even by the standards of the global financial crisis .
according to neil shearing of london-based capital economics , " the latvian economy is staring into the abyss . " it is , however , precisely the enormous scale of the problems in one of the european union 's smaller members that is drawing the attention of commentators across the globe .
with gdp set to drop by at least 10 percent in 2009 , according to most estimates , plus inflation that has only just returned to single digits , yawning current account and trade deficits , rising unemployment , devaluation pressure and a housing market that has gone from boom to bust , it might seem latvia 's situation could n't get worse .
but add riots by young people and blockades by angry farmers in the capital , riga , plus a huge 7.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 9.5-billion -rrb- emergency bailout by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- in recent weeks , and suddenly things get even more serious .
as a result , analysts and experts around the world are dedicating an unprecedented volume of column inches , charts , graphs , analysis and predictions to the tiny baltic state with a population of just 2.3 million .
even nobel economics laureate paul krugman commented on latvia in december 2008 , describing it as " the new argentina " in an online discussion about the effects of currency devaluation .
unprecedented , enormous deficits as a result latvia finds itself gaining the media publicity that it has been craving since it won its independence from the soviet union in 1991 - unfortunately for the wrong reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists have never seen anything like latvia 's crisis " there is no precedent for latvia in the sense that while some of the problems have happened elsewhere they have n't done so to the same extent , " shearing told dpa news service .
" the scale of the deficits in latvia is enormous - a current account deficit of 20 percent of gdp is unheard of . "
" when i quote such figures , i 've had clients phoning up and asking ' are you sure about that ? " ' he added .
roger wessman , head of research with nordic banking group nordea in finland has also noted increased interest in the baltics , in general , and latvia , in particular .
" i definitely agree that economists are in general more interested , " he said .
" in the past couple of years we 've seen heightened interest and a heightened concern .
we had a very high peak at the time of the negotiations between the latvian state and the imf .
latvia versus estonia in race to be the worst " latvia is competing for having the worst slump in the eu with estonia , but it would n't be an exaggeration to say it is at the extreme end of the economic spectrum , " wessman said .
but hopes still linger in latvia that current notoriety could be turned into something positive in the longer term .
according to ojars kalnins , director of the latvian institute which is responsible for promoting the country abroad , if the latvian story is a novel , the country is just passing the opening chapters that capture the reader 's interest .
" in a world of bad economic news , we have a unique case developing , " he said .
" if latvia were to weather this storm , a bad news story would become a good news story , " kalnins insisted .
" as in any good novel with plot twists , things may get worse before they get better , but if there is a happy ending , well , then you have a rip-roaring story !

according to neil shearing of london-based capital economics , " the latvian economy is staring into the abyss . " it is , however , precisely the enormous scale of the problems in one of the european union 's smaller members that is drawing the attention of commentators across the globe .
with gdp set to drop by at least 10 percent in 2009 , according to most estimates , plus inflation that has only just returned to single digits , yawning current account and trade deficits , rising unemployment , devaluation pressure and a housing market that has gone from boom to bust , it might seem latvia 's situation could n't get worse .
but add riots by young people and blockades by angry farmers in the capital , riga , plus a huge 7.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 9.5-billion -rrb- emergency bailout by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- in recent weeks , and suddenly things get even more serious .
as a result , analysts and experts around the world are dedicating an unprecedented volume of column inches , charts , graphs , analysis and predictions to the tiny baltic state with a population of just 2.3 million .
even nobel economics laureate paul krugman commented on latvia in december 2008 , describing it as " the new argentina " in an online discussion about the effects of currency devaluation .
unprecedented , enormous deficits as a result latvia finds itself gaining the media publicity that it has been craving since it won its independence from the soviet union in 1991 - unfortunately for the wrong reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists have never seen anything like latvia 's crisis " there is no precedent for latvia in the sense that while some of the problems have happened elsewhere they have n't done so to the same extent , " shearing told dpa news service .
" the scale of the deficits in latvia is enormous - a current account deficit of 20 percent of gdp is unheard of . "
" when i quote such figures , i 've had clients phoning up and asking ' are you sure about that ? " ' he added .
roger wessman , head of research with nordic banking group nordea in finland has also noted increased interest in the baltics , in general , and latvia , in particular .
" i definitely agree that economists are in general more interested , " he said .
" in the past couple of years we 've seen heightened interest and a heightened concern .
we had a very high peak at the time of the negotiations between the latvian state and the imf .
latvia versus estonia in race to be the worst " latvia is competing for having the worst slump in the eu with estonia , but it would n't be an exaggeration to say it is at the extreme end of the economic spectrum , " wessman said .
but hopes still linger in latvia that current notoriety could be turned into something positive in the longer term .
according to ojars kalnins , director of the latvian institute which is responsible for promoting the country abroad , if the latvian story is a novel , the country is just passing the opening chapters that capture the reader 's interest .
" in a world of bad economic news , we have a unique case developing , " he said .
" if latvia were to weather this storm , a bad news story would become a good news story , " kalnins insisted .

" most of the steel deliveries contain contamination levels below the legally allowed limits , " it said in a statement on sunday . the ministry also said it would like to see an initiative developed on the international level to address the issue of irradiated goods .
in france , sweden and the netherlands , radioactive steel from india was discovered which in some cases had been used to manufacture buttons used in elevator control panels . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dr alan boss of the carnegie institution of science said many of these worlds could be inhabited by simple lifeforms .
he was speaking at the annual meeting of the american association for the advancement of science in chicago .
so far , telescopes have been able to detect just over 300 planets outside our solar system .
very few of these would be capable of supporting life , however .
most are gas giants like our jupiter , and many orbit so close to their parent stars that any microbes would have to survive roasting temperatures .
but , based on the limited numbers of planets found so far , dr boss has estimated that each sun-like star has on average one " earth-like " planet .
this simple calculation means there would be huge numbers capable of supporting life .
" not only are they probably habitable but they probably are also going to be inhabited , " dr boss told bbc news .
" but i think that most likely the nearby ' earths ' are going to be inhabited with things which are perhaps more common to what earth was like three or four billion years ago . "
that means bacterial lifeforms .
dr boss estimates that nasa 's kepler mission , due for launch in march , should begin finding some of these earth-like planets within the next few years .
recent work at edinburgh university tried to quantify how many intelligent civilisations might be out there .
the research suggested there could be thousands of them .
