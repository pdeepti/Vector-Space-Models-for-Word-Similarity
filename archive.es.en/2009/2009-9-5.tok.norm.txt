the accusations are based on western intelligence reports suggesting that the tehran government secretly combined uranium processing , airborne high-explosive tests and work to remodel a missile cone in a way that would fit a nuclear warhead .
" the government of the united states has not handed over original documents to the agency since it does not in fact have any authenticated document and all it has are forged documents , " soltanieh wrote in a letter to iaea chief mohamed elbaradei .
" the alleged studies are politically motivated and baseless allegations . "
west shows united front in frankfurt at a meeting held near frankfurt this week , germany joined the five members of the un security council in calling on iran to negotiate with the un about its nuclear program .
germany , france , britain and the united states have also threatened iran with a fourth round of sanctions if it continues enriching uranium and refuses to resolve concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier echoed eu and un threats on new sanctions german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier aligned himself with its un allies in an interview in saturday 's hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" at the moment , i am sceptical .
if the situation stays as it is , we will have to enter a new round of sanctions .
we will have to increase the pressure . "
despite the latest spat , steinmeier said he remained optimistic that iran 's alleged nuclear weapons program could still be stopped .
the european union also leant its weight to the growing western pressure on iran at a meeting of european foreign ministers in stockholm this week .
iran is currently refusing to bow to all demands , and has stated that it will only speak to the iaea .
iaea urges iran to clear up questions while the iaea has admitted that it does not have proof of an iranian weapons plan , it urged iran to clear up questions rather than dismiss intelligence reports as forgeries .
according iaea , tehran is not cooperating sufficiently with its enquiries , and has consistently denied the agency access to sites .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soltanieh refuses to accept the legitimacy of western intelligence us state department spokesman ian kelly told reporters , " we have provided a path whereby iran can become a full and respected member of the international community .
it is up to iran to make a decision as to whether it chooses that path . "
a us official who wished to remain anonymous also stated that soltanieh 's accusation of forgery was baseless .
the new exchange of accusations follows a week of mixed signals from the iranian government , whose chief nuclear negotiator saeed jalili issued a statement saying iran was ready to talk to world powers about an updated nuclear proposal for the country .
on thursday , after both the usa and the eu claimed they had not received any official notification of such a proposal , foreign ministry spokesman hassan ghashghavi declared that iran would only speak to the iaea. bk / reuters / dpa editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 05.09.2009 anti-nuclear rally in berlin becomes campaign issue großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marchers protesting against a german nuclear storage facility thousands of people from across germany , including farmers on tractors , are in berlin this saturday to protest against the nuclear energy industry and in support of a plan to shut down the country 's nuclear reactors . the future of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants , due to be shut down by the early 2020s , is one of the major issues that separates chancellor angela merkel 's center-right christian democrats from the center-left social democrats .
the cdu , along with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , would like to extend that deadline , a move that is opposed by the spd and environmentalist greens .
the issue has been largely ignored in pre-election campaigning for the sept .
27 general election .
but that may now change with saturday 's rally in berlin , led by farmers from wendland , a region in north-central germany , where plans call for permanent waste disposal sites .
the spd chancellor candidate , frank-walter steinmeier , on friday accused the cdu and fdp " of leading the country into an energy policy dead-end and endangering domestic security . "
but merkel has said it 's too early to turn off the switch on all nuclear power in germany .
" we can not phase out nuclear energy as quickly as some imagine , " merkel said .
" but in the long term , that 's to say in the second half of the century , we will experience a large amount of renewable energy sources .
we are convinced that we will be able to stop using nuclear energy at some point . "
a divisive issue and maybe a rallying cry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tractors heading to berlin for saturday 's rally political analysts have said that even though the dispute between the cdu and spd has had little effect on the campaign , the nuclear issue could mobilize voters in both camps .
" so far , it has played almost no role at all , which is a bit surprising , considering it 's one of the few issues where the cdu and spd are completely at odds , " said dietmar herz , a political scientist at erfurt university .
the spd and greens point to polls showing that a majority of germans - around 59 percent - oppose nuclear energy and want the plants shut down , while the cdu and fdp emphasize that until germany has built up a significant infrastructure of alternative energies , nuclear power plants should remain on line .
in 2001 , the spd-green government under former chancellor gerhard schroeder pushed through legislation to phase out the use of nuclear energy within two decades , despite protests from the industry and power utilities .
germany at odds with most other developed countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear waste is transported under heavy guard in special containers the spd and the greens had hoped that germany would lead the way into a " post-nuclear age , " but instead much of the developed world has embraced the use of nuclear power as part of a climate-friendly energy mix .
france , for example , gets 80 percent of its power from nuclear energy and even exports a significant amount of it to germany .
germany covers about 23 percent of its energy consumption with nuclear power , compared to 42 percent with coal-fired power stations , 14 percent with natural gas and 15 percent with renewable energy sources , such as wind , solar and thermal .
nils diedrich , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , said he expects discussions about nuclear issue to heat up if merkel is able to form a coalition with the free democrats after the september election .
" if the cdu and fdp do actually win power and push through an extension of nuclear power we 'll see a real battle , " he said .
" then there will be massive demonstrations . " gb / dpa / reuters / afp editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 05.09.2009 wto issues long-awaited ruling on airbus subsidy dispute großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the subsidy dispute concerns loans given to build the airbus a380 the wto released its confidential decision to both us and european diplomats , but said the findings would n't be made public for months .
american media is reporting that washington contends the wto ruled against europe . according to us lawmakers , the over 1,000-page ruling says that the funds given to airbus by the european union were in breach of anti-competition laws .
" i applaud the wto 's decision that government subsidies of airbus are illegal , " said senator maria cantwell of washington state , where much of boeing 's production takes place .
" when finalized , this long-awaited ruling will help restore true competition in the commercial aviation market . "
however , european officials say the wto ruling is much more complex than that .
the document is not expected to be made public for several months . the american aviation giant , boeing , made an initial complaint in 2004 .
it said that the " launch aid " given to airbus by several european governments , including france , germany , spain , and britain , was anti-competitive and illegal .
the complaint referred to $ 205 billion -lrb- 143 billion euros -rrb- of aid received by airbus over two decades while it was building its a380 and other top-selling models .
the three-member wto panel was widely believed to rule in favor of washington .
ruling only " half the story " brussels , meanwhile , has stressed the findings must be looked at in a larger context .
it contends the wto must also take into account its complaint made against boeing for subsidies it received from the us government .
" it is important to recall that this report is only half the case against the us over aid to boeing , " said luiz guellner , spokesman for the eu trade commissioner catherine ashton .
it could take years for the wto to reach a final decision on the transatlantic subsidies battle between the two aviation giants , but many industry analysts expect boeing and airbus to negotiate a settlement in the long-running dispute before the matter ever reaches the wto top court .

american media is reporting that washington contends the wto ruled against europe . according to us lawmakers , the over 1,000-page ruling says that the funds given to airbus by the european union were in breach of anti-competition laws .
" i applaud the wto 's decision that government subsidies of airbus are illegal , " said senator maria cantwell of washington state , where much of boeing 's production takes place .
" when finalized , this long-awaited ruling will help restore true competition in the commercial aviation market . "
however , european officials say the wto ruling is much more complex than that .
the document is not expected to be made public for several months . the american aviation giant , boeing , made an initial complaint in 2004 .
it said that the " launch aid " given to airbus by several european governments , including france , germany , spain , and britain , was anti-competitive and illegal .
the complaint referred to $ 205 billion -lrb- 143 billion euros -rrb- of aid received by airbus over two decades while it was building its a380 and other top-selling models .
the three-member wto panel was widely believed to rule in favor of washington .
ruling only " half the story " brussels , meanwhile , has stressed the findings must be looked at in a larger context .
it contends the wto must also take into account its complaint made against boeing for subsidies it received from the us government .
" it is important to recall that this report is only half the case against the us over aid to boeing , " said luiz guellner , spokesman for the eu trade commissioner catherine ashton .
it could take years for the wto to reach a final decision on the transatlantic subsidies battle between the two aviation giants , but many industry analysts expect boeing and airbus to negotiate a settlement in the long-running dispute before the matter ever reaches the wto top court .
" we look forward to a negotiated settlement in which both sides recognize the way this industry is supposed to work , " said airbus spokeswoman maggie bergsma .

the spd , which is the main opponent to ruettgers ’ christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , have argued that the remarks were not just spoken in the heat of a campaign speech , but form part of ruettger 's election strategy .
commenting on the removal of a nokia mobile phone factory from bochum in north rhine-westphalia to romania , ruettgers said : " in romania , the workers do n't come at seven in the morning like they do here in north rhine-westphalia , and they do n't stay until the factory closes . ...
they come when they want and go when they want , and that 's why they do n't get any mobile phones built . "
social democrats leader and chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier said the comments would damage germany 's image abroad and were a " grist in the mill of extremists . "
renate kuenast , parliamentary head of the green party , labeled the remarks " pure racism " and called on german chancellor angela merkel to " draw the consequences swiftly and unambiguously . "
gregor gysi , co-head of the left party , said the comments were " racist … dangerous and pathetic . "
premature apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers was angered by closure of the nokia factory in bochum ruettgers had apologized for the duisburg speech on friday evening , saying : " i did not intend to offend anyone , and if i did , i am sorry . "
he explained the remarks by referring to the redundancies suffered by some of his audience .
" i was standing in front of north rhine-westphalian workers , whose amazing efforts are globally acknowledged , and who have lost their jobs because of bad decisions taken at company headquarters , " he said .
apparently attempting to demonstrate his determination to bring chinese money to duisburg , ruettgers is also heard on the video saying : " and if we have to , we 'll meet some chinese people in the town hall .
and if they still do n't want to invest , we 'll strangle them until they find duisburg beautiful . "
ruettgers intends to travel to china in november in order to seek investors .
the state premier has a history of insulting non-german workers in his speeches .
he caused a media storm in 2000 for campaigning in his state election under the slogan " kinder statt inder " -lrb- children not indians -rrb- , in protest at the spd government 's attempts to attract skilled workers from southern asia to work in germany 's technology sector .
the leader of the local cdu hendrik wuest defended ruettgers , saying : " the video unduly shortens the speech and rips ruettgers ' remarks completely out of their context . "
north rhine-westphalia integration minister armin laschet said it was " absurd " to accuse ruettgers of hostility towards foreigners , and that the german state had done a lot to help foreigners integrate . dfm / bk / dpa / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the accusations are based on western intelligence reports suggesting that the tehran government secretly combined uranium processing , airborne high-explosive tests and work to remodel a missile cone in a way that would fit a nuclear warhead .
" the government of the united states has not handed over original documents to the agency since it does not in fact have any authenticated document and all it has are forged documents , " soltanieh wrote in a letter to iaea chief mohamed elbaradei .
" the alleged studies are politically motivated and baseless allegations . "
west shows united front in frankfurt at a meeting held near frankfurt this week , germany joined the five members of the un security council in calling on iran to negotiate with the un about its nuclear program .
germany , france , britain and the united states have also threatened iran with a fourth round of sanctions if it continues enriching uranium and refuses to resolve concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier echoed eu and un threats on new sanctions german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier aligned himself with its un allies in an interview in saturday 's hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" at the moment , i am sceptical .
if the situation stays as it is , we will have to enter a new round of sanctions .
we will have to increase the pressure . "
despite the latest spat , steinmeier said he remained optimistic that iran 's alleged nuclear weapons program could still be stopped .
the european union also leant its weight to the growing western pressure on iran at a meeting of european foreign ministers in stockholm this week .
iran is currently refusing to bow to all demands , and has stated that it will only speak to the iaea .
iaea urges iran to clear up questions while the iaea has admitted that it does not have proof of an iranian weapons plan , it urged iran to clear up questions rather than dismiss intelligence reports as forgeries .
according iaea , tehran is not cooperating sufficiently with its enquiries , and has consistently denied the agency access to sites .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soltanieh refuses to accept the legitimacy of western intelligence us state department spokesman ian kelly told reporters , " we have provided a path whereby iran can become a full and respected member of the international community .
it is up to iran to make a decision as to whether it chooses that path . "
a us official who wished to remain anonymous also stated that soltanieh 's accusation of forgery was baseless .
the new exchange of accusations follows a week of mixed signals from the iranian government , whose chief nuclear negotiator saeed jalili issued a statement saying iran was ready to talk to world powers about an updated nuclear proposal for the country .
on thursday , after both the usa and the eu claimed they had not received any official notification of such a proposal , foreign ministry spokesman hassan ghashghavi declared that iran would only speak to the iaea. bk / reuters / dpa editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the cdu , along with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , would like to extend that deadline , a move that is opposed by the spd and environmentalist greens .
the issue has been largely ignored in pre-election campaigning for the sept .
27 general election .
but that may now change with saturday 's rally in berlin , led by farmers from wendland , a region in north-central germany , where plans call for permanent waste disposal sites .
the spd chancellor candidate , frank-walter steinmeier , on friday accused the cdu and fdp " of leading the country into an energy policy dead-end and endangering domestic security . "
but merkel has said it 's too early to turn off the switch on all nuclear power in germany .
" we can not phase out nuclear energy as quickly as some imagine , " merkel said .
" but in the long term , that 's to say in the second half of the century , we will experience a large amount of renewable energy sources .
we are convinced that we will be able to stop using nuclear energy at some point . "
a divisive issue and maybe a rallying cry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tractors heading to berlin for saturday 's rally political analysts have said that even though the dispute between the cdu and spd has had little effect on the campaign , the nuclear issue could mobilize voters in both camps .
" so far , it has played almost no role at all , which is a bit surprising , considering it 's one of the few issues where the cdu and spd are completely at odds , " said dietmar herz , a political scientist at erfurt university .
the spd and greens point to polls showing that a majority of germans - around 59 percent - oppose nuclear energy and want the plants shut down , while the cdu and fdp emphasize that until germany has built up a significant infrastructure of alternative energies , nuclear power plants should remain on line .
in 2001 , the spd-green government under former chancellor gerhard schroeder pushed through legislation to phase out the use of nuclear energy within two decades , despite protests from the industry and power utilities .
germany at odds with most other developed countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear waste is transported under heavy guard in special containers the spd and the greens had hoped that germany would lead the way into a " post-nuclear age , " but instead much of the developed world has embraced the use of nuclear power as part of a climate-friendly energy mix .
france , for example , gets 80 percent of its power from nuclear energy and even exports a significant amount of it to germany .
germany covers about 23 percent of its energy consumption with nuclear power , compared to 42 percent with coal-fired power stations , 14 percent with natural gas and 15 percent with renewable energy sources , such as wind , solar and thermal .
nils diedrich , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , said he expects discussions about nuclear issue to heat up if merkel is able to form a coalition with the free democrats after the september election .
" if the cdu and fdp do actually win power and push through an extension of nuclear power we 'll see a real battle , " he said .
" then there will be massive demonstrations . " gb / dpa / reuters / afp editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 05.09.2009 anti-nuclear rally in berlin becomes campaign issue großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marchers protesting against a german nuclear storage facility thousands of people from across germany , including farmers on tractors , are in berlin this saturday to protest against the nuclear energy industry and in support of a plan to shut down the country 's nuclear reactors . the future of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants , due to be shut down by the early 2020s , is one of the major issues that separates chancellor angela merkel 's center-right christian democrats from the center-left social democrats .
the cdu , along with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , would like to extend that deadline , a move that is opposed by the spd and environmentalist greens .
the issue has been largely ignored in pre-election campaigning for the sept .
27 general election .
but that may now change with saturday 's rally in berlin , led by farmers from wendland , a region in north-central germany , where plans call for permanent waste disposal sites .
the spd chancellor candidate , frank-walter steinmeier , on friday accused the cdu and fdp " of leading the country into an energy policy dead-end and endangering domestic security . "
but merkel has said it 's too early to turn off the switch on all nuclear power in germany .
" we can not phase out nuclear energy as quickly as some imagine , " merkel said .
" but in the long term , that 's to say in the second half of the century , we will experience a large amount of renewable energy sources .
we are convinced that we will be able to stop using nuclear energy at some point . "
a divisive issue and maybe a rallying cry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tractors heading to berlin for saturday 's rally political analysts have said that even though the dispute between the cdu and spd has had little effect on the campaign , the nuclear issue could mobilize voters in both camps .
" so far , it has played almost no role at all , which is a bit surprising , considering it 's one of the few issues where the cdu and spd are completely at odds , " said dietmar herz , a political scientist at erfurt university .
the spd and greens point to polls showing that a majority of germans - around 59 percent - oppose nuclear energy and want the plants shut down , while the cdu and fdp emphasize that until germany has built up a significant infrastructure of alternative energies , nuclear power plants should remain on line .
in 2001 , the spd-green government under former chancellor gerhard schroeder pushed through legislation to phase out the use of nuclear energy within two decades , despite protests from the industry and power utilities .
germany at odds with most other developed countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear waste is transported under heavy guard in special containers the spd and the greens had hoped that germany would lead the way into a " post-nuclear age , " but instead much of the developed world has embraced the use of nuclear power as part of a climate-friendly energy mix .
france , for example , gets 80 percent of its power from nuclear energy and even exports a significant amount of it to germany .
germany covers about 23 percent of its energy consumption with nuclear power , compared to 42 percent with coal-fired power stations , 14 percent with natural gas and 15 percent with renewable energy sources , such as wind , solar and thermal .
nils diedrich , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , said he expects discussions about nuclear issue to heat up if merkel is able to form a coalition with the free democrats after the september election .
" if the cdu and fdp do actually win power and push through an extension of nuclear power we 'll see a real battle , " he said .
" then there will be massive demonstrations . " gb / dpa / reuters / afp editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" german investment in malta has been present for a long time and the double taxation agreement with germany is there to facilitate taxation between the two countries and promote investment , " he said .
closing the loopholes in may this year , steinbrueck presented a bill to the german parliament meant to crack down on german companies exploiting foreign tax havens , and caused a diplomatic row after accusing neighboring countries luxembourg , liechtenstein and switzerland of aiding tax-dodging german companies .

an army transporter carrying german troops was damaged and at least three soldiers inside the vehicle were slightly injured , according to the german military operations command in potsdam .
german officials in afghanistan said the target of the attack was the bundeswehr military base .
two ap reporters at the base later said the shock wave was felt inside the compound .
a taliban spokesman said the fundamentalist islamist militia was responsible for the attack and that the bomber came from the chardarah district of kunduz , where the taliban is active .
kunduz area becomes more dangerous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan forces still rely on nato and german support the area around kunduz has become increasingly dangerous for the approximately 4,000-strong german troop contingent stationed there .
in recent weeks , insurgents have repeatedly ambushed patrols and engaged german soldiers in hours-long firefights .
the german defense ministry has attributed the spate of recent attacks as an effort by the taliban to influence the outcome of the german federal election at the end of september .
meanwhile , in berlin , defense minister franz-josef jung sought to justify a nato air strike on two hijacked fuel trucks in kunduz on friday .
that attack , requested by german forces , left up to 90 people dead or injured , according to afghan president hamid karzai .
afghan officials and local residents said the dead included up to 40 civilians .
the german army has so far said that more than 50 taliban militants died , but that no civilians were involved .
minister jung was quoted on the bild zeitung website as saying that " when just six kilometers away from us , the taliban take two fuel tankers , that represents a serious danger for us .

the accusations are based on western intelligence reports suggesting that the tehran government secretly combined uranium processing , airborne high-explosive tests and work to remodel a missile cone in a way that would fit a nuclear warhead .
" the government of the united states has not handed over original documents to the agency since it does not in fact have any authenticated document and all it has are forged documents , " soltanieh wrote in a letter to iaea chief mohamed elbaradei .

the cdu , along with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , would like to extend that deadline , a move that is opposed by the spd and environmentalist greens .
the issue has been largely ignored in pre-election campaigning for the sept .
27 general election .
but that may now change with saturday 's rally in berlin , led by farmers from wendland , a region in north-central germany , where plans call for permanent waste disposal sites .
the spd chancellor candidate , frank-walter steinmeier , on friday accused the cdu and fdp " of leading the country into an energy policy dead-end and endangering domestic security . "
but merkel has said it 's too early to turn off the switch on all nuclear power in germany .
" we can not phase out nuclear energy as quickly as some imagine , " merkel said .
" but in the long term , that 's to say in the second half of the century , we will experience a large amount of renewable energy sources .
we are convinced that we will be able to stop using nuclear energy at some point . "
a divisive issue and maybe a rallying cry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tractors heading to berlin for saturday 's rally political analysts have said that even though the dispute between the cdu and spd has had little effect on the campaign , the nuclear issue could mobilize voters in both camps .
" so far , it has played almost no role at all , which is a bit surprising , considering it 's one of the few issues where the cdu and spd are completely at odds , " said dietmar herz , a political scientist at erfurt university .
the spd and greens point to polls showing that a majority of germans - around 59 percent - oppose nuclear energy and want the plants shut down , while the cdu and fdp emphasize that until germany has built up a significant infrastructure of alternative energies , nuclear power plants should remain on line .
in 2001 , the spd-green government under former chancellor gerhard schroeder pushed through legislation to phase out the use of nuclear energy within two decades , despite protests from the industry and power utilities .
germany at odds with most other developed countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear waste is transported under heavy guard in special containers the spd and the greens had hoped that germany would lead the way into a " post-nuclear age , " but instead much of the developed world has embraced the use of nuclear power as part of a climate-friendly energy mix .
france , for example , gets 80 percent of its power from nuclear energy and even exports a significant amount of it to germany .
germany covers about 23 percent of its energy consumption with nuclear power , compared to 42 percent with coal-fired power stations , 14 percent with natural gas and 15 percent with renewable energy sources , such as wind , solar and thermal .
nils diedrich , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , said he expects discussions about nuclear issue to heat up if merkel is able to form a coalition with the free democrats after the september election .
" if the cdu and fdp do actually win power and push through an extension of nuclear power we 'll see a real battle , " he said .

american media is reporting that washington contends the wto ruled against europe . according to us lawmakers , the over 1,000-page ruling says that the funds given to airbus by the european union were in breach of anti-competition laws .
" i applaud the wto 's decision that government subsidies of airbus are illegal , " said senator maria cantwell of washington state , where much of boeing 's production takes place .
" when finalized , this long-awaited ruling will help restore true competition in the commercial aviation market . "
however , european officials say the wto ruling is much more complex than that .
the document is not expected to be made public for several months . the american aviation giant , boeing , made an initial complaint in 2004 .
it said that the " launch aid " given to airbus by several european governments , including france , germany , spain , and britain , was anti-competitive and illegal .
the complaint referred to $ 205 billion -lrb- 143 billion euros -rrb- of aid received by airbus over two decades while it was building its a380 and other top-selling models .
the three-member wto panel was widely believed to rule in favor of washington .
ruling only " half the story " brussels , meanwhile , has stressed the findings must be looked at in a larger context .
it contends the wto must also take into account its complaint made against boeing for subsidies it received from the us government .
" it is important to recall that this report is only half the case against the us over aid to boeing , " said luiz guellner , spokesman for the eu trade commissioner catherine ashton .
it could take years for the wto to reach a final decision on the transatlantic subsidies battle between the two aviation giants , but many industry analysts expect boeing and airbus to negotiate a settlement in the long-running dispute before the matter ever reaches the wto top court .
" we look forward to a negotiated settlement in which both sides recognize the way this industry is supposed to work , " said airbus spokeswoman maggie bergsma .
if the wto panel strikes down future airbus aid , the company could find difficulties in financing its new airliners , such as the wide-body a350 due in the next decade .
such a decision would also affect how rivals in brazil , canada , china , russia , and japan fuel their expansion. glb / vj / reuters / dpa / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the accusations are based on western intelligence reports suggesting that the tehran government secretly combined uranium processing , airborne high-explosive tests and work to remodel a missile cone in a way that would fit a nuclear warhead .
" the government of the united states has not handed over original documents to the agency since it does not in fact have any authenticated document and all it has are forged documents , " soltanieh wrote in a letter to iaea chief mohamed elbaradei .
" the alleged studies are politically motivated and baseless allegations . "
west shows united front in frankfurt at a meeting held near frankfurt this week , germany joined the five members of the un security council in calling on iran to negotiate with the un about its nuclear program .
germany , france , britain and the united states have also threatened iran with a fourth round of sanctions if it continues enriching uranium and refuses to resolve concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier echoed eu and un threats on new sanctions german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier aligned himself with its un allies in an interview in saturday 's hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" at the moment , i am sceptical .
if the situation stays as it is , we will have to enter a new round of sanctions .
we will have to increase the pressure . "
despite the latest spat , steinmeier said he remained optimistic that iran 's alleged nuclear weapons program could still be stopped .
the european union also leant its weight to the growing western pressure on iran at a meeting of european foreign ministers in stockholm this week .
iran is currently refusing to bow to all demands , and has stated that it will only speak to the iaea .
iaea urges iran to clear up questions while the iaea has admitted that it does not have proof of an iranian weapons plan , it urged iran to clear up questions rather than dismiss intelligence reports as forgeries .
according iaea , tehran is not cooperating sufficiently with its enquiries , and has consistently denied the agency access to sites .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soltanieh refuses to accept the legitimacy of western intelligence us state department spokesman ian kelly told reporters , " we have provided a path whereby iran can become a full and respected member of the international community .
it is up to iran to make a decision as to whether it chooses that path . "
a us official who wished to remain anonymous also stated that soltanieh 's accusation of forgery was baseless .
the new exchange of accusations follows a week of mixed signals from the iranian government , whose chief nuclear negotiator saeed jalili issued a statement saying iran was ready to talk to world powers about an updated nuclear proposal for the country .
on thursday , after both the usa and the eu claimed they had not received any official notification of such a proposal , foreign ministry spokesman hassan ghashghavi declared that iran would only speak to the iaea. bk / reuters / dpa editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bringing down the number of civilian casualties is a chief concern . eu foreign ministers meeting in stockholm are set to discuss their joint strategy on afghanistan a day after a massive nato airstrike killed around 90 people , according to afghan officials .
the european governments are concerned that the incident could undermine their mission in afghanistan – where they have been trying to garner public support - and they have urged a speedy inquiry .
" it 's vital that nato and the afghanistan people come together .
we need a very strong nato commitment but we need a very strong afghan commitment also , " britian 's foreign minister david miliband told reporters in stockholm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nato airstrike sparked international outrage " and obviously incidents like this undermine that , " he added .
" that 's why it 's important that we are open and clear about what happened and make sure it does not happen again . "
on friday , two fuel tankers hijacked by the taliban were bombed in northern kunduz , killing insurgents and dozens of civilians .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country holds the eu presidency , called the loss of human life " regrettable " .
" we do n't know the details yet .
what we do know is that there are too many casualties , be that taliban or civilian casualties or be that something else , " he said .
afghan people are said to be growing impatient with the country 's fragile security situation and mounting civilian deaths , despite the military presence there .
eu governments , however , show no signs of abandoning the mission , instead expressing their continued support .
" what is very important is for the international community to continue to be united ... we will stay -lrb- as long as -rrb- necessary , " said italian foreing minister franco frattini .
meanwhile , three weeks after afghanistan 's disputed presidential elections , the un says it is planning a summit there for next year to discuss the country 's political and economic future .
according to un spokesman ari gaitanis , " the summit has been proposed as a means of bringing the next afghan government and its international partners together around a common agenda for afghanistan over the next few years .

steinbrueck turns a blind eye der spiegel claims that the small mediterranean country has become one of german industry 's preferred locations ever since it joined the eu in 2004 .
the magazine goes on to accuse german finance minister peer steinbrueck of ignoring the problem even though the finance ministry has long been aware of it .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank is considering opening a subsidiary in malta .
one of the magazine 's sources , from an accounting firm based in malta , confirmed that there had been a marked increase in the number of german companies with representation on the island in the last few years .
in addition to basf , lufthansa and puma , who already have maltese branches , deutsche bank is also said to be considering opening a subsidiary on the island .
fenech acknowledged this recent surge in investment , but insisted that it was well-known , and that all transactions were above board .
" german investment in malta has been present for a long time and the double taxation agreement with germany is there to facilitate taxation between the two countries and promote investment , " he said .
closing the loopholes in may this year , steinbrueck presented a bill to the german parliament meant to crack down on german companies exploiting foreign tax havens , and caused a diplomatic row after accusing neighboring countries luxembourg , liechtenstein and switzerland of aiding tax-dodging german companies .
the finance minister estimates that germany loses 100 billion euros of revenue through tax havens every year. bk / dpa / spiegel editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
ruettgers had previously apologized for making offensive comments . the remarks were made during a speech in the western town of muenster on aug .
28 , which was filmed and posted on video sharing website youtube by rivals the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- on saturday .
the video comments resembled those made two days earlier in duisburg , which forced an apology from ruettgers on friday , aug .
4 .
the spd , which is the main opponent to ruettgers ’ christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , have argued that the remarks were not just spoken in the heat of a campaign speech , but form part of ruettger 's election strategy .
commenting on the removal of a nokia mobile phone factory from bochum in north rhine-westphalia to romania , ruettgers said : " in romania , the workers do n't come at seven in the morning like they do here in north rhine-westphalia , and they do n't stay until the factory closes . ...
they come when they want and go when they want , and that 's why they do n't get any mobile phones built . "
social democrats leader and chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier said the comments would damage germany 's image abroad and were a " grist in the mill of extremists . "
renate kuenast , parliamentary head of the green party , labeled the remarks " pure racism " and called on german chancellor angela merkel to " draw the consequences swiftly and unambiguously . "
gregor gysi , co-head of the left party , said the comments were " racist … dangerous and pathetic . "
premature apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers was angered by closure of the nokia factory in bochum ruettgers had apologized for the duisburg speech on friday evening , saying : " i did not intend to offend anyone , and if i did , i am sorry . "
he explained the remarks by referring to the redundancies suffered by some of his audience .
" i was standing in front of north rhine-westphalian workers , whose amazing efforts are globally acknowledged , and who have lost their jobs because of bad decisions taken at company headquarters , " he said .
apparently attempting to demonstrate his determination to bring chinese money to duisburg , ruettgers is also heard on the video saying : " and if we have to , we 'll meet some chinese people in the town hall .
and if they still do n't want to invest , we 'll strangle them until they find duisburg beautiful . "
ruettgers intends to travel to china in november in order to seek investors .
the state premier has a history of insulting non-german workers in his speeches .
he caused a media storm in 2000 for campaigning in his state election under the slogan " kinder statt inder " -lrb- children not indians -rrb- , in protest at the spd government 's attempts to attract skilled workers from southern asia to work in germany 's technology sector .
the leader of the local cdu hendrik wuest defended ruettgers , saying : " the video unduly shortens the speech and rips ruettgers ' remarks completely out of their context . "
north rhine-westphalia integration minister armin laschet said it was " absurd " to accuse ruettgers of hostility towards foreigners , and that the german state had done a lot to help foreigners integrate . dfm / bk / dpa / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the cdu , along with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , would like to extend that deadline , a move that is opposed by the spd and environmentalist greens .
the issue has been largely ignored in pre-election campaigning for the sept .
27 general election .
but that may now change with saturday 's rally in berlin , led by farmers from wendland , a region in north-central germany , where plans call for permanent waste disposal sites .
the spd chancellor candidate , frank-walter steinmeier , on friday accused the cdu and fdp " of leading the country into an energy policy dead-end and endangering domestic security . "
but merkel has said it 's too early to turn off the switch on all nuclear power in germany .
" we can not phase out nuclear energy as quickly as some imagine , " merkel said .
" but in the long term , that 's to say in the second half of the century , we will experience a large amount of renewable energy sources .
we are convinced that we will be able to stop using nuclear energy at some point . "
a divisive issue and maybe a rallying cry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tractors heading to berlin for saturday 's rally political analysts have said that even though the dispute between the cdu and spd has had little effect on the campaign , the nuclear issue could mobilize voters in both camps .
" so far , it has played almost no role at all , which is a bit surprising , considering it 's one of the few issues where the cdu and spd are completely at odds , " said dietmar herz , a political scientist at erfurt university .
the spd and greens point to polls showing that a majority of germans - around 59 percent - oppose nuclear energy and want the plants shut down , while the cdu and fdp emphasize that until germany has built up a significant infrastructure of alternative energies , nuclear power plants should remain on line .
in 2001 , the spd-green government under former chancellor gerhard schroeder pushed through legislation to phase out the use of nuclear energy within two decades , despite protests from the industry and power utilities .
germany at odds with most other developed countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear waste is transported under heavy guard in special containers the spd and the greens had hoped that germany would lead the way into a " post-nuclear age , " but instead much of the developed world has embraced the use of nuclear power as part of a climate-friendly energy mix .
france , for example , gets 80 percent of its power from nuclear energy and even exports a significant amount of it to germany .
germany covers about 23 percent of its energy consumption with nuclear power , compared to 42 percent with coal-fired power stations , 14 percent with natural gas and 15 percent with renewable energy sources , such as wind , solar and thermal .
nils diedrich , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , said he expects discussions about nuclear issue to heat up if merkel is able to form a coalition with the free democrats after the september election .
" if the cdu and fdp do actually win power and push through an extension of nuclear power we 'll see a real battle , " he said .
" then there will be massive demonstrations . " gb / dpa / reuters / afp editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an army transporter carrying german troops was damaged and at least three soldiers inside the vehicle were slightly injured , according to the german military operations command in potsdam .
german officials in afghanistan said the target of the attack was the bundeswehr military base .
two ap reporters at the base later said the shock wave was felt inside the compound .
a taliban spokesman said the fundamentalist islamist militia was responsible for the attack and that the bomber came from the chardarah district of kunduz , where the taliban is active .
kunduz area becomes more dangerous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan forces still rely on nato and german support the area around kunduz has become increasingly dangerous for the approximately 4,000-strong german troop contingent stationed there .
in recent weeks , insurgents have repeatedly ambushed patrols and engaged german soldiers in hours-long firefights .
the german defense ministry has attributed the spate of recent attacks as an effort by the taliban to influence the outcome of the german federal election at the end of september .
meanwhile , in berlin , defense minister franz-josef jung sought to justify a nato air strike on two hijacked fuel trucks in kunduz on friday .
that attack , requested by german forces , left up to 90 people dead or injured , according to afghan president hamid karzai .
afghan officials and local residents said the dead included up to 40 civilians .
the german army has so far said that more than 50 taliban militants died , but that no civilians were involved .
minister jung was quoted on the bild zeitung website as saying that " when just six kilometers away from us , the taliban take two fuel tankers , that represents a serious danger for us .

this , he hopes , will precipitate what he calls a fair distribution of the massive burdens of the financial crisis .
steinbrueck 's tax , inspired by a proposal made in 1970 by american economist james tobin to impose a tax on currency speculation , would be levied on all financial products in all the markets in the world .
the reaction of other members of the g-20 group to this idea is unclear as yet .

" the government of the united states has not handed over original documents to the agency since it does not in fact have any authenticated document and all it has are forged documents , " soltanieh wrote in a letter to iaea chief mohamed elbaradei .

speaking to the times of malta newspaper on saturday , fenech called the report " sensationalism , " adding , " this is all above board and according to eu laws .
we have never had any negative reaction by the german government on this front . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck is accused of turning a blind eye by establishing a subsidiary on the island , shareholders of major german are allowed to claim back six sevenths of their maltese income tax , reducing their taxable income in germany .
the result is a tax saving of 23.6 million euros -lrb- $ 33.7 million -rrb- for every 100 million euros of profit .
steinbrueck turns a blind eye der spiegel claims that the small mediterranean country has become one of german industry 's preferred locations ever since it joined the eu in 2004 .
the magazine goes on to accuse german finance minister peer steinbrueck of ignoring the problem even though the finance ministry has long been aware of it .
according to the magazine , the german embassy in malta is also culpable for the huge loss of revenue , since it actively encourages german companies to take advantage of the law and invest in malta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank is considering opening a subsidiary in malta .
one of the magazine 's sources , from an accounting firm based in malta , confirmed that there had been a marked increase in the number of german companies with representation on the island in the last few years .
in addition to basf , lufthansa and puma , who already have maltese branches , deutsche bank is also said to be considering opening a subsidiary on the island .
fenech acknowledged this recent surge in investment , but insisted that it was well-known , and that all transactions were above board .
" german investment in malta has been present for a long time and the double taxation agreement with germany is there to facilitate taxation between the two countries and promote investment , " he said .
closing the loopholes in may this year , steinbrueck presented a bill to the german parliament meant to crack down on german companies exploiting foreign tax havens , and caused a diplomatic row after accusing neighboring countries luxembourg , liechtenstein and switzerland of aiding tax-dodging german companies .
the finance minister estimates that germany loses 100 billion euros of revenue through tax havens every year. bk / dpa / spiegel editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : iran 's nuclear ambitions western nations must get china on board on iran issue iaea denies allegations of iran cover-up highly symbolic meeting with world powers puts pressure on iran tehran continues to obfuscate , says social democrats ' foreign affairs expert iran -pipe- 05.09.2009 iran refuses to bow to west , accuses us of forging intelligence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran rejects pressure for the un and intelligence from the us a senior iranian official has accused the us of feeding forged intelligence on iran 's nuclear program to the international atomic energy agency , following a damning statement from the un security council this week . the diplomatic row between iran and the united nations security council intensified on saturday when iranian envoy ali asghar soltanieh told the iaea that the agency had not provided genuine documents to back up fresh accusations about iran 's nuclear program , and that the matter was " closed " .
the accusations are based on western intelligence reports suggesting that the tehran government secretly combined uranium processing , airborne high-explosive tests and work to remodel a missile cone in a way that would fit a nuclear warhead .
" the government of the united states has not handed over original documents to the agency since it does not in fact have any authenticated document and all it has are forged documents , " soltanieh wrote in a letter to iaea chief mohamed elbaradei .
" the alleged studies are politically motivated and baseless allegations . "
west shows united front in frankfurt at a meeting held near frankfurt this week , germany joined the five members of the un security council in calling on iran to negotiate with the un about its nuclear program .
germany , france , britain and the united states have also threatened iran with a fourth round of sanctions if it continues enriching uranium and refuses to resolve concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier echoed eu and un threats on new sanctions german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier aligned himself with its un allies in an interview in saturday 's hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" at the moment , i am sceptical .
if the situation stays as it is , we will have to enter a new round of sanctions .
we will have to increase the pressure . "
despite the latest spat , steinmeier said he remained optimistic that iran 's alleged nuclear weapons program could still be stopped .
the european union also leant its weight to the growing western pressure on iran at a meeting of european foreign ministers in stockholm this week .
iran is currently refusing to bow to all demands , and has stated that it will only speak to the iaea .
iaea urges iran to clear up questions while the iaea has admitted that it does not have proof of an iranian weapons plan , it urged iran to clear up questions rather than dismiss intelligence reports as forgeries .
according iaea , tehran is not cooperating sufficiently with its enquiries , and has consistently denied the agency access to sites .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soltanieh refuses to accept the legitimacy of western intelligence us state department spokesman ian kelly told reporters , " we have provided a path whereby iran can become a full and respected member of the international community .
it is up to iran to make a decision as to whether it chooses that path . "
a us official who wished to remain anonymous also stated that soltanieh 's accusation of forgery was baseless .
the new exchange of accusations follows a week of mixed signals from the iranian government , whose chief nuclear negotiator saeed jalili issued a statement saying iran was ready to talk to world powers about an updated nuclear proposal for the country .
on thursday , after both the usa and the eu claimed they had not received any official notification of such a proposal , foreign ministry spokesman hassan ghashghavi declared that iran would only speak to the iaea. bk / reuters / dpa editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
ruettgers had previously apologized for making offensive comments . the remarks were made during a speech in the western town of muenster on aug .
28 , which was filmed and posted on video sharing website youtube by rivals the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- on saturday .
the video comments resembled those made two days earlier in duisburg , which forced an apology from ruettgers on friday , aug .
4 .
the spd , which is the main opponent to ruettgers ’ christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , have argued that the remarks were not just spoken in the heat of a campaign speech , but form part of ruettger 's election strategy .
commenting on the removal of a nokia mobile phone factory from bochum in north rhine-westphalia to romania , ruettgers said : " in romania , the workers do n't come at seven in the morning like they do here in north rhine-westphalia , and they do n't stay until the factory closes . ...
they come when they want and go when they want , and that 's why they do n't get any mobile phones built . "
social democrats leader and chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier said the comments would damage germany 's image abroad and were a " grist in the mill of extremists . "
renate kuenast , parliamentary head of the green party , labeled the remarks " pure racism " and called on german chancellor angela merkel to " draw the consequences swiftly and unambiguously . "
gregor gysi , co-head of the left party , said the comments were " racist … dangerous and pathetic . "

he explained the remarks by referring to the redundancies suffered by some of his audience .
" i was standing in front of north rhine-westphalian workers , whose amazing efforts are globally acknowledged , and who have lost their jobs because of bad decisions taken at company headquarters , " he said .
apparently attempting to demonstrate his determination to bring chinese money to duisburg , ruettgers is also heard on the video saying : " and if we have to , we 'll meet some chinese people in the town hall .
and if they still do n't want to invest , we 'll strangle them until they find duisburg beautiful . "
ruettgers intends to travel to china in november in order to seek investors .
the state premier has a history of insulting non-german workers in his speeches .
he caused a media storm in 2000 for campaigning in his state election under the slogan " kinder statt inder " -lrb- children not indians -rrb- , in protest at the spd government 's attempts to attract skilled workers from southern asia to work in germany 's technology sector .
the leader of the local cdu hendrik wuest defended ruettgers , saying : " the video unduly shortens the speech and rips ruettgers ' remarks completely out of their context . "

an army transporter carrying german troops was damaged and at least three soldiers inside the vehicle were slightly injured , according to the german military operations command in potsdam .
german officials in afghanistan said the target of the attack was the bundeswehr military base .
two ap reporters at the base later said the shock wave was felt inside the compound .
a taliban spokesman said the fundamentalist islamist militia was responsible for the attack and that the bomber came from the chardarah district of kunduz , where the taliban is active .
kunduz area becomes more dangerous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan forces still rely on nato and german support the area around kunduz has become increasingly dangerous for the approximately 4,000-strong german troop contingent stationed there .
in recent weeks , insurgents have repeatedly ambushed patrols and engaged german soldiers in hours-long firefights .
the german defense ministry has attributed the spate of recent attacks as an effort by the taliban to influence the outcome of the german federal election at the end of september .
meanwhile , in berlin , defense minister franz-josef jung sought to justify a nato air strike on two hijacked fuel trucks in kunduz on friday .
that attack , requested by german forces , left up to 90 people dead or injured , according to afghan president hamid karzai .
afghan officials and local residents said the dead included up to 40 civilians .
the german army has so far said that more than 50 taliban militants died , but that no civilians were involved .
minister jung was quoted on the bild zeitung website as saying that " when just six kilometers away from us , the taliban take two fuel tankers , that represents a serious danger for us .

the cdu , along with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , would like to extend that deadline , a move that is opposed by the spd and environmentalist greens .
the issue has been largely ignored in pre-election campaigning for the sept .
27 general election .
but that may now change with saturday 's rally in berlin , led by farmers from wendland , a region in north-central germany , where plans call for permanent waste disposal sites .
the spd chancellor candidate , frank-walter steinmeier , on friday accused the cdu and fdp " of leading the country into an energy policy dead-end and endangering domestic security . "
but merkel has said it 's too early to turn off the switch on all nuclear power in germany .
" we can not phase out nuclear energy as quickly as some imagine , " merkel said .
" but in the long term , that 's to say in the second half of the century , we will experience a large amount of renewable energy sources .
we are convinced that we will be able to stop using nuclear energy at some point . "
a divisive issue and maybe a rallying cry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tractors heading to berlin for saturday 's rally political analysts have said that even though the dispute between the cdu and spd has had little effect on the campaign , the nuclear issue could mobilize voters in both camps .
" so far , it has played almost no role at all , which is a bit surprising , considering it 's one of the few issues where the cdu and spd are completely at odds , " said dietmar herz , a political scientist at erfurt university .
the spd and greens point to polls showing that a majority of germans - around 59 percent - oppose nuclear energy and want the plants shut down , while the cdu and fdp emphasize that until germany has built up a significant infrastructure of alternative energies , nuclear power plants should remain on line .
in 2001 , the spd-green government under former chancellor gerhard schroeder pushed through legislation to phase out the use of nuclear energy within two decades , despite protests from the industry and power utilities .
germany at odds with most other developed countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear waste is transported under heavy guard in special containers the spd and the greens had hoped that germany would lead the way into a " post-nuclear age , " but instead much of the developed world has embraced the use of nuclear power as part of a climate-friendly energy mix .
france , for example , gets 80 percent of its power from nuclear energy and even exports a significant amount of it to germany .
germany covers about 23 percent of its energy consumption with nuclear power , compared to 42 percent with coal-fired power stations , 14 percent with natural gas and 15 percent with renewable energy sources , such as wind , solar and thermal .
nils diedrich , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , said he expects discussions about nuclear issue to heat up if merkel is able to form a coalition with the free democrats after the september election .
" if the cdu and fdp do actually win power and push through an extension of nuclear power we 'll see a real battle , " he said .
" then there will be massive demonstrations . " gb / dpa / reuters / afp editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the spd and greens point to polls showing that a majority of germans - around 59 percent - oppose nuclear energy and want the plants shut down , while the cdu and fdp emphasize that until germany has built up a significant infrastructure of alternative energies , nuclear power plants should remain on line .
in 2001 , the spd-green government under former chancellor gerhard schroeder pushed through legislation to phase out the use of nuclear energy within two decades , despite protests from the industry and power utilities .
germany at odds with most other developed countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear waste is transported under heavy guard in special containers the spd and the greens had hoped that germany would lead the way into a " post-nuclear age , " but instead much of the developed world has embraced the use of nuclear power as part of a climate-friendly energy mix .
france , for example , gets 80 percent of its power from nuclear energy and even exports a significant amount of it to germany .
germany covers about 23 percent of its energy consumption with nuclear power , compared to 42 percent with coal-fired power stations , 14 percent with natural gas and 15 percent with renewable energy sources , such as wind , solar and thermal .
nils diedrich , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , said he expects discussions about nuclear issue to heat up if merkel is able to form a coalition with the free democrats after the september election .
" if the cdu and fdp do actually win power and push through an extension of nuclear power we 'll see a real battle , " he said .
" then there will be massive demonstrations . " gb / dpa / reuters / afp editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an army transporter carrying german troops was damaged and at least three soldiers inside the vehicle were slightly injured , according to the german military operations command in potsdam .
german officials in afghanistan said the target of the attack was the bundeswehr military base .

"
ruettgers had previously apologized for making offensive comments . the remarks were made during a speech in the western town of muenster on aug .
28 , which was filmed and posted on video sharing website youtube by rivals the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- on saturday .
the video comments resembled those made two days earlier in duisburg , which forced an apology from ruettgers on friday , aug .
4 .
the spd , which is the main opponent to ruettgers ’ christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , have argued that the remarks were not just spoken in the heat of a campaign speech , but form part of ruettger 's election strategy .
commenting on the removal of a nokia mobile phone factory from bochum in north rhine-westphalia to romania , ruettgers said : " in romania , the workers do n't come at seven in the morning like they do here in north rhine-westphalia , and they do n't stay until the factory closes . ...
they come when they want and go when they want , and that 's why they do n't get any mobile phones built . "
social democrats leader and chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier said the comments would damage germany 's image abroad and were a " grist in the mill of extremists . "
renate kuenast , parliamentary head of the green party , labeled the remarks " pure racism " and called on german chancellor angela merkel to " draw the consequences swiftly and unambiguously . "
gregor gysi , co-head of the left party , said the comments were " racist … dangerous and pathetic . "
premature apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers was angered by closure of the nokia factory in bochum ruettgers had apologized for the duisburg speech on friday evening , saying : " i did not intend to offend anyone , and if i did , i am sorry . "
he explained the remarks by referring to the redundancies suffered by some of his audience .
" i was standing in front of north rhine-westphalian workers , whose amazing efforts are globally acknowledged , and who have lost their jobs because of bad decisions taken at company headquarters , " he said .
apparently attempting to demonstrate his determination to bring chinese money to duisburg , ruettgers is also heard on the video saying : " and if we have to , we 'll meet some chinese people in the town hall .
and if they still do n't want to invest , we 'll strangle them until they find duisburg beautiful . "
ruettgers intends to travel to china in november in order to seek investors .
the state premier has a history of insulting non-german workers in his speeches .
he caused a media storm in 2000 for campaigning in his state election under the slogan " kinder statt inder " -lrb- children not indians -rrb- , in protest at the spd government 's attempts to attract skilled workers from southern asia to work in germany 's technology sector .
the leader of the local cdu hendrik wuest defended ruettgers , saying : " the video unduly shortens the speech and rips ruettgers ' remarks completely out of their context . "
north rhine-westphalia integration minister armin laschet said it was " absurd " to accuse ruettgers of hostility towards foreigners , and that the german state had done a lot to help foreigners integrate . dfm / bk / dpa / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an army transporter carrying german troops was damaged and at least three soldiers inside the vehicle were slightly injured , according to the german military operations command in potsdam .
german officials in afghanistan said the target of the attack was the bundeswehr military base .
two ap reporters at the base later said the shock wave was felt inside the compound .
a taliban spokesman said the fundamentalist islamist militia was responsible for the attack and that the bomber came from the chardarah district of kunduz , where the taliban is active .
kunduz area becomes more dangerous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan forces still rely on nato and german support the area around kunduz has become increasingly dangerous for the approximately 4,000-strong german troop contingent stationed there .
in recent weeks , insurgents have repeatedly ambushed patrols and engaged german soldiers in hours-long firefights .
the german defense ministry has attributed the spate of recent attacks as an effort by the taliban to influence the outcome of the german federal election at the end of september .
meanwhile , in berlin , defense minister franz-josef jung sought to justify a nato air strike on two hijacked fuel trucks in kunduz on friday .
that attack , requested by german forces , left up to 90 people dead or injured , according to afghan president hamid karzai .
afghan officials and local residents said the dead included up to 40 civilians .
the german army has so far said that more than 50 taliban militants died , but that no civilians were involved .
minister jung was quoted on the bild zeitung website as saying that " when just six kilometers away from us , the taliban take two fuel tankers , that represents a serious danger for us .

"
ruettgers had previously apologized for making offensive comments . the remarks were made during a speech in the western town of muenster on aug .
28 , which was filmed and posted on video sharing website youtube by rivals the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- on saturday .
the video comments resembled those made two days earlier in duisburg , which forced an apology from ruettgers on friday , aug .
4 .
the spd , which is the main opponent to ruettgers ’ christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , have argued that the remarks were not just spoken in the heat of a campaign speech , but form part of ruettger 's election strategy .
commenting on the removal of a nokia mobile phone factory from bochum in north rhine-westphalia to romania , ruettgers said : " in romania , the workers do n't come at seven in the morning like they do here in north rhine-westphalia , and they do n't stay until the factory closes . ...
they come when they want and go when they want , and that 's why they do n't get any mobile phones built . "
social democrats leader and chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier said the comments would damage germany 's image abroad and were a " grist in the mill of extremists . "
renate kuenast , parliamentary head of the green party , labeled the remarks " pure racism " and called on german chancellor angela merkel to " draw the consequences swiftly and unambiguously . "
gregor gysi , co-head of the left party , said the comments were " racist … dangerous and pathetic . "
premature apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers was angered by closure of the nokia factory in bochum ruettgers had apologized for the duisburg speech on friday evening , saying : " i did not intend to offend anyone , and if i did , i am sorry . "
he explained the remarks by referring to the redundancies suffered by some of his audience .
" i was standing in front of north rhine-westphalian workers , whose amazing efforts are globally acknowledged , and who have lost their jobs because of bad decisions taken at company headquarters , " he said .
apparently attempting to demonstrate his determination to bring chinese money to duisburg , ruettgers is also heard on the video saying : " and if we have to , we 'll meet some chinese people in the town hall .
and if they still do n't want to invest , we 'll strangle them until they find duisburg beautiful . "
ruettgers intends to travel to china in november in order to seek investors .
the state premier has a history of insulting non-german workers in his speeches .
he caused a media storm in 2000 for campaigning in his state election under the slogan " kinder statt inder " -lrb- children not indians -rrb- , in protest at the spd government 's attempts to attract skilled workers from southern asia to work in germany 's technology sector .
the leader of the local cdu hendrik wuest defended ruettgers , saying : " the video unduly shortens the speech and rips ruettgers ' remarks completely out of their context . "
north rhine-westphalia integration minister armin laschet said it was " absurd " to accuse ruettgers of hostility towards foreigners , and that the german state had done a lot to help foreigners integrate . dfm / bk / dpa / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

france and germany , along with five other countries , are united in calling for a stringent crackdown on bankers ' bonuses , but so far british support for such a measure has been cautious .
britain and the usa are keen to protect their powerful banking communities in london and new york , and have so far opposed any drastic sweeping measures that may provoke the banks .
britain warns against german complacency german finance minister peer steinbrueck is also keen to discuss when and how countries will withdraw state stimulus packages .
but this proposal has elicited only a lukewarm response from other countries , with french finance minister christine lagarde saying that while she would welcome discussing an exit strategy , the timing for an end to the financial crisis was something that " god only knows " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : darling warns of complacency about the financial crisis .
steinbrueck 's british counterpart alistair darling warned against complacency and over-optimism in the week leading up to the meeting in london , after positive economic indicators in germany and france suggested that the world had weathered the worst of the global financial crisis .
in an interview with britain 's newspaper the independent , darling expressed fears that optimism may lead to some countries stopping their fiscal stimulus programs prematurely .
steinbrueck 's international transaction tax according to saturday 's edition of the german berliner zeitung newspaper , steinbrueck also intends to use the g-20 meeting to propose a new international transaction tax on the world 's financial markets .
this , he hopes , will precipitate what he calls a fair distribution of the massive burdens of the financial crisis .
steinbrueck 's tax , inspired by a proposal made in 1970 by american economist james tobin to impose a tax on currency speculation , would be levied on all financial products in all the markets in the world .
the reaction of other members of the g-20 group to this idea is unclear as yet .
the main purpose of the short weekend meeting is to agree an agenda for the major g-20 summit in pittsburgh at the end of september. bk / ap / afp / dpa editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what we do know is that there are too many casualties , be that taliban or civilian casualties or be that something else , " he said .
afghan people are said to be growing impatient with the country 's fragile security situation and mounting civilian deaths , despite the military presence there .
eu governments , however , show no signs of abandoning the mission , instead expressing their continued support .

american media is reporting that washington contends the wto ruled against europe . according to us lawmakers , the over 1,000-page ruling says that the funds given to airbus by the european union were in breach of anti-competition laws .
" i applaud the wto 's decision that government subsidies of airbus are illegal , " said senator maria cantwell of washington state , where much of boeing 's production takes place .
" when finalized , this long-awaited ruling will help restore true competition in the commercial aviation market . "
however , european officials say the wto ruling is much more complex than that .
the document is not expected to be made public for several months . the american aviation giant , boeing , made an initial complaint in 2004 .
it said that the " launch aid " given to airbus by several european governments , including france , germany , spain , and britain , was anti-competitive and illegal .
the complaint referred to $ 205 billion -lrb- 143 billion euros -rrb- of aid received by airbus over two decades while it was building its a380 and other top-selling models .
the three-member wto panel was widely believed to rule in favor of washington .
ruling only " half the story " brussels , meanwhile , has stressed the findings must be looked at in a larger context .
it contends the wto must also take into account its complaint made against boeing for subsidies it received from the us government .
" it is important to recall that this report is only half the case against the us over aid to boeing , " said luiz guellner , spokesman for the eu trade commissioner catherine ashton .
it could take years for the wto to reach a final decision on the transatlantic subsidies battle between the two aviation giants , but many industry analysts expect boeing and airbus to negotiate a settlement in the long-running dispute before the matter ever reaches the wto top court .
" we look forward to a negotiated settlement in which both sides recognize the way this industry is supposed to work , " said airbus spokeswoman maggie bergsma .
if the wto panel strikes down future airbus aid , the company could find difficulties in financing its new airliners , such as the wide-body a350 due in the next decade .
such a decision would also affect how rivals in brazil , canada , china , russia , and japan fuel their expansion. glb / vj / reuters / dpa / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bringing down the number of civilian casualties is a chief concern . eu foreign ministers meeting in stockholm are set to discuss their joint strategy on afghanistan a day after a massive nato airstrike killed around 90 people , according to afghan officials .

on friday , two fuel tankers hijacked by the taliban were bombed in northern kunduz , killing insurgents and dozens of civilians .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country holds the eu presidency , called the loss of human life " regrettable " .
" we do n't know the details yet .
what we do know is that there are too many casualties , be that taliban or civilian casualties or be that something else , " he said .
afghan people are said to be growing impatient with the country 's fragile security situation and mounting civilian deaths , despite the military presence there .
eu governments , however , show no signs of abandoning the mission , instead expressing their continued support .
" what is very important is for the international community to continue to be united ... we will stay -lrb- as long as -rrb- necessary , " said italian foreing minister franco frattini .
meanwhile , three weeks after afghanistan 's disputed presidential elections , the un says it is planning a summit there for next year to discuss the country 's political and economic future .
according to un spokesman ari gaitanis , " the summit has been proposed as a means of bringing the next afghan government and its international partners together around a common agenda for afghanistan over the next few years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 05.09.2009 anti-nuclear rally in berlin becomes campaign issue großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marchers protesting against a german nuclear storage facility thousands of people from across germany , including farmers on tractors , are in berlin this saturday to protest against the nuclear energy industry and in support of a plan to shut down the country 's nuclear reactors . the future of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants , due to be shut down by the early 2020s , is one of the major issues that separates chancellor angela merkel 's center-right christian democrats from the center-left social democrats .
the cdu , along with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , would like to extend that deadline , a move that is opposed by the spd and environmentalist greens .
the issue has been largely ignored in pre-election campaigning for the sept .
27 general election .
but that may now change with saturday 's rally in berlin , led by farmers from wendland , a region in north-central germany , where plans call for permanent waste disposal sites .
the spd chancellor candidate , frank-walter steinmeier , on friday accused the cdu and fdp " of leading the country into an energy policy dead-end and endangering domestic security . "
but merkel has said it 's too early to turn off the switch on all nuclear power in germany .
" we can not phase out nuclear energy as quickly as some imagine , " merkel said .
" but in the long term , that 's to say in the second half of the century , we will experience a large amount of renewable energy sources .
we are convinced that we will be able to stop using nuclear energy at some point . "
a divisive issue and maybe a rallying cry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tractors heading to berlin for saturday 's rally political analysts have said that even though the dispute between the cdu and spd has had little effect on the campaign , the nuclear issue could mobilize voters in both camps .
" so far , it has played almost no role at all , which is a bit surprising , considering it 's one of the few issues where the cdu and spd are completely at odds , " said dietmar herz , a political scientist at erfurt university .
the spd and greens point to polls showing that a majority of germans - around 59 percent - oppose nuclear energy and want the plants shut down , while the cdu and fdp emphasize that until germany has built up a significant infrastructure of alternative energies , nuclear power plants should remain on line .
in 2001 , the spd-green government under former chancellor gerhard schroeder pushed through legislation to phase out the use of nuclear energy within two decades , despite protests from the industry and power utilities .
germany at odds with most other developed countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear waste is transported under heavy guard in special containers the spd and the greens had hoped that germany would lead the way into a " post-nuclear age , " but instead much of the developed world has embraced the use of nuclear power as part of a climate-friendly energy mix .
france , for example , gets 80 percent of its power from nuclear energy and even exports a significant amount of it to germany .
germany covers about 23 percent of its energy consumption with nuclear power , compared to 42 percent with coal-fired power stations , 14 percent with natural gas and 15 percent with renewable energy sources , such as wind , solar and thermal .

the cdu , along with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , would like to extend that deadline , a move that is opposed by the spd and environmentalist greens .
the issue has been largely ignored in pre-election campaigning for the sept .
27 general election .
but that may now change with saturday 's rally in berlin , led by farmers from wendland , a region in north-central germany , where plans call for permanent waste disposal sites .
the spd chancellor candidate , frank-walter steinmeier , on friday accused the cdu and fdp " of leading the country into an energy policy dead-end and endangering domestic security . "
but merkel has said it 's too early to turn off the switch on all nuclear power in germany .
" we can not phase out nuclear energy as quickly as some imagine , " merkel said .
" but in the long term , that 's to say in the second half of the century , we will experience a large amount of renewable energy sources .
we are convinced that we will be able to stop using nuclear energy at some point . "
a divisive issue and maybe a rallying cry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tractors heading to berlin for saturday 's rally political analysts have said that even though the dispute between the cdu and spd has had little effect on the campaign , the nuclear issue could mobilize voters in both camps .
" so far , it has played almost no role at all , which is a bit surprising , considering it 's one of the few issues where the cdu and spd are completely at odds , " said dietmar herz , a political scientist at erfurt university .
the spd and greens point to polls showing that a majority of germans - around 59 percent - oppose nuclear energy and want the plants shut down , while the cdu and fdp emphasize that until germany has built up a significant infrastructure of alternative energies , nuclear power plants should remain on line .
in 2001 , the spd-green government under former chancellor gerhard schroeder pushed through legislation to phase out the use of nuclear energy within two decades , despite protests from the industry and power utilities .
germany at odds with most other developed countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear waste is transported under heavy guard in special containers the spd and the greens had hoped that germany would lead the way into a " post-nuclear age , " but instead much of the developed world has embraced the use of nuclear power as part of a climate-friendly energy mix .
france , for example , gets 80 percent of its power from nuclear energy and even exports a significant amount of it to germany .
germany covers about 23 percent of its energy consumption with nuclear power , compared to 42 percent with coal-fired power stations , 14 percent with natural gas and 15 percent with renewable energy sources , such as wind , solar and thermal .
nils diedrich , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , said he expects discussions about nuclear issue to heat up if merkel is able to form a coalition with the free democrats after the september election .

the spd chancellor candidate , frank-walter steinmeier , on friday accused the cdu and fdp " of leading the country into an energy policy dead-end and endangering domestic security . "
but merkel has said it 's too early to turn off the switch on all nuclear power in germany .
" we can not phase out nuclear energy as quickly as some imagine , " merkel said .
" but in the long term , that 's to say in the second half of the century , we will experience a large amount of renewable energy sources .
we are convinced that we will be able to stop using nuclear energy at some point . "
a divisive issue and maybe a rallying cry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tractors heading to berlin for saturday 's rally political analysts have said that even though the dispute between the cdu and spd has had little effect on the campaign , the nuclear issue could mobilize voters in both camps .
" so far , it has played almost no role at all , which is a bit surprising , considering it 's one of the few issues where the cdu and spd are completely at odds , " said dietmar herz , a political scientist at erfurt university .
the spd and greens point to polls showing that a majority of germans - around 59 percent - oppose nuclear energy and want the plants shut down , while the cdu and fdp emphasize that until germany has built up a significant infrastructure of alternative energies , nuclear power plants should remain on line .
in 2001 , the spd-green government under former chancellor gerhard schroeder pushed through legislation to phase out the use of nuclear energy within two decades , despite protests from the industry and power utilities .
germany at odds with most other developed countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear waste is transported under heavy guard in special containers the spd and the greens had hoped that germany would lead the way into a " post-nuclear age , " but instead much of the developed world has embraced the use of nuclear power as part of a climate-friendly energy mix .
france , for example , gets 80 percent of its power from nuclear energy and even exports a significant amount of it to germany .
germany covers about 23 percent of its energy consumption with nuclear power , compared to 42 percent with coal-fired power stations , 14 percent with natural gas and 15 percent with renewable energy sources , such as wind , solar and thermal .
nils diedrich , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , said he expects discussions about nuclear issue to heat up if merkel is able to form a coalition with the free democrats after the september election .
" if the cdu and fdp do actually win power and push through an extension of nuclear power we 'll see a real battle , " he said .
" then there will be massive demonstrations . " gb / dpa / reuters / afp editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an army transporter carrying german troops was damaged and at least three soldiers inside the vehicle were slightly injured , according to the german military operations command in potsdam .

the accusations are based on western intelligence reports suggesting that the tehran government secretly combined uranium processing , airborne high-explosive tests and work to remodel a missile cone in a way that would fit a nuclear warhead .
" the government of the united states has not handed over original documents to the agency since it does not in fact have any authenticated document and all it has are forged documents , " soltanieh wrote in a letter to iaea chief mohamed elbaradei .
" the alleged studies are politically motivated and baseless allegations . "
west shows united front in frankfurt at a meeting held near frankfurt this week , germany joined the five members of the un security council in calling on iran to negotiate with the un about its nuclear program .
germany , france , britain and the united states have also threatened iran with a fourth round of sanctions if it continues enriching uranium and refuses to resolve concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier echoed eu and un threats on new sanctions german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier aligned himself with its un allies in an interview in saturday 's hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" at the moment , i am sceptical .
if the situation stays as it is , we will have to enter a new round of sanctions .
we will have to increase the pressure . "
despite the latest spat , steinmeier said he remained optimistic that iran 's alleged nuclear weapons program could still be stopped .
the european union also leant its weight to the growing western pressure on iran at a meeting of european foreign ministers in stockholm this week .
iran is currently refusing to bow to all demands , and has stated that it will only speak to the iaea .
iaea urges iran to clear up questions while the iaea has admitted that it does not have proof of an iranian weapons plan , it urged iran to clear up questions rather than dismiss intelligence reports as forgeries .
according iaea , tehran is not cooperating sufficiently with its enquiries , and has consistently denied the agency access to sites .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soltanieh refuses to accept the legitimacy of western intelligence us state department spokesman ian kelly told reporters , " we have provided a path whereby iran can become a full and respected member of the international community .
it is up to iran to make a decision as to whether it chooses that path . "
a us official who wished to remain anonymous also stated that soltanieh 's accusation of forgery was baseless .
the new exchange of accusations follows a week of mixed signals from the iranian government , whose chief nuclear negotiator saeed jalili issued a statement saying iran was ready to talk to world powers about an updated nuclear proposal for the country .
on thursday , after both the usa and the eu claimed they had not received any official notification of such a proposal , foreign ministry spokesman hassan ghashghavi declared that iran would only speak to the iaea. bk / reuters / dpa editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
ruettgers had previously apologized for making offensive comments . the remarks were made during a speech in the western town of muenster on aug .
28 , which was filmed and posted on video sharing website youtube by rivals the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- on saturday .
the video comments resembled those made two days earlier in duisburg , which forced an apology from ruettgers on friday , aug .
4 .
the spd , which is the main opponent to ruettgers ’ christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , have argued that the remarks were not just spoken in the heat of a campaign speech , but form part of ruettger 's election strategy .
commenting on the removal of a nokia mobile phone factory from bochum in north rhine-westphalia to romania , ruettgers said : " in romania , the workers do n't come at seven in the morning like they do here in north rhine-westphalia , and they do n't stay until the factory closes . ...
they come when they want and go when they want , and that 's why they do n't get any mobile phones built . "
social democrats leader and chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier said the comments would damage germany 's image abroad and were a " grist in the mill of extremists . "
renate kuenast , parliamentary head of the green party , labeled the remarks " pure racism " and called on german chancellor angela merkel to " draw the consequences swiftly and unambiguously . "
gregor gysi , co-head of the left party , said the comments were " racist … dangerous and pathetic . "
premature apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers was angered by closure of the nokia factory in bochum ruettgers had apologized for the duisburg speech on friday evening , saying : " i did not intend to offend anyone , and if i did , i am sorry . "
he explained the remarks by referring to the redundancies suffered by some of his audience .
" i was standing in front of north rhine-westphalian workers , whose amazing efforts are globally acknowledged , and who have lost their jobs because of bad decisions taken at company headquarters , " he said .
apparently attempting to demonstrate his determination to bring chinese money to duisburg , ruettgers is also heard on the video saying : " and if we have to , we 'll meet some chinese people in the town hall .
and if they still do n't want to invest , we 'll strangle them until they find duisburg beautiful . "
ruettgers intends to travel to china in november in order to seek investors .
the state premier has a history of insulting non-german workers in his speeches .
he caused a media storm in 2000 for campaigning in his state election under the slogan " kinder statt inder " -lrb- children not indians -rrb- , in protest at the spd government 's attempts to attract skilled workers from southern asia to work in germany 's technology sector .
the leader of the local cdu hendrik wuest defended ruettgers , saying : " the video unduly shortens the speech and rips ruettgers ' remarks completely out of their context . "

the spd , which is the main opponent to ruettgers ’ christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , have argued that the remarks were not just spoken in the heat of a campaign speech , but form part of ruettger 's election strategy .
commenting on the removal of a nokia mobile phone factory from bochum in north rhine-westphalia to romania , ruettgers said : " in romania , the workers do n't come at seven in the morning like they do here in north rhine-westphalia , and they do n't stay until the factory closes . ...
they come when they want and go when they want , and that 's why they do n't get any mobile phones built . "
social democrats leader and chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier said the comments would damage germany 's image abroad and were a " grist in the mill of extremists . "
renate kuenast , parliamentary head of the green party , labeled the remarks " pure racism " and called on german chancellor angela merkel to " draw the consequences swiftly and unambiguously . "

an army transporter carrying german troops was damaged and at least three soldiers inside the vehicle were slightly injured , according to the german military operations command in potsdam .
german officials in afghanistan said the target of the attack was the bundeswehr military base .
two ap reporters at the base later said the shock wave was felt inside the compound .
a taliban spokesman said the fundamentalist islamist militia was responsible for the attack and that the bomber came from the chardarah district of kunduz , where the taliban is active .
kunduz area becomes more dangerous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan forces still rely on nato and german support the area around kunduz has become increasingly dangerous for the approximately 4,000-strong german troop contingent stationed there .
in recent weeks , insurgents have repeatedly ambushed patrols and engaged german soldiers in hours-long firefights .
the german defense ministry has attributed the spate of recent attacks as an effort by the taliban to influence the outcome of the german federal election at the end of september .
meanwhile , in berlin , defense minister franz-josef jung sought to justify a nato air strike on two hijacked fuel trucks in kunduz on friday .
that attack , requested by german forces , left up to 90 people dead or injured , according to afghan president hamid karzai .
afghan officials and local residents said the dead included up to 40 civilians .
the german army has so far said that more than 50 taliban militants died , but that no civilians were involved .
minister jung was quoted on the bild zeitung website as saying that " when just six kilometers away from us , the taliban take two fuel tankers , that represents a serious danger for us .

american media is reporting that washington contends the wto ruled against europe . according to us lawmakers , the over 1,000-page ruling says that the funds given to airbus by the european union were in breach of anti-competition laws .
" i applaud the wto 's decision that government subsidies of airbus are illegal , " said senator maria cantwell of washington state , where much of boeing 's production takes place .
" when finalized , this long-awaited ruling will help restore true competition in the commercial aviation market . "
however , european officials say the wto ruling is much more complex than that .
the document is not expected to be made public for several months . the american aviation giant , boeing , made an initial complaint in 2004 .
it said that the " launch aid " given to airbus by several european governments , including france , germany , spain , and britain , was anti-competitive and illegal .
the complaint referred to $ 205 billion -lrb- 143 billion euros -rrb- of aid received by airbus over two decades while it was building its a380 and other top-selling models .
the three-member wto panel was widely believed to rule in favor of washington .
ruling only " half the story " brussels , meanwhile , has stressed the findings must be looked at in a larger context .
it contends the wto must also take into account its complaint made against boeing for subsidies it received from the us government .
" it is important to recall that this report is only half the case against the us over aid to boeing , " said luiz guellner , spokesman for the eu trade commissioner catherine ashton .
it could take years for the wto to reach a final decision on the transatlantic subsidies battle between the two aviation giants , but many industry analysts expect boeing and airbus to negotiate a settlement in the long-running dispute before the matter ever reaches the wto top court .
" we look forward to a negotiated settlement in which both sides recognize the way this industry is supposed to work , " said airbus spokeswoman maggie bergsma .
if the wto panel strikes down future airbus aid , the company could find difficulties in financing its new airliners , such as the wide-body a350 due in the next decade .
such a decision would also affect how rivals in brazil , canada , china , russia , and japan fuel their expansion. glb / vj / reuters / dpa / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

american media is reporting that washington contends the wto ruled against europe . according to us lawmakers , the over 1,000-page ruling says that the funds given to airbus by the european union were in breach of anti-competition laws .
" i applaud the wto 's decision that government subsidies of airbus are illegal , " said senator maria cantwell of washington state , where much of boeing 's production takes place .
" when finalized , this long-awaited ruling will help restore true competition in the commercial aviation market . "
however , european officials say the wto ruling is much more complex than that .
the document is not expected to be made public for several months . the american aviation giant , boeing , made an initial complaint in 2004 .
it said that the " launch aid " given to airbus by several european governments , including france , germany , spain , and britain , was anti-competitive and illegal .
the complaint referred to $ 205 billion -lrb- 143 billion euros -rrb- of aid received by airbus over two decades while it was building its a380 and other top-selling models .
the three-member wto panel was widely believed to rule in favor of washington .
ruling only " half the story " brussels , meanwhile , has stressed the findings must be looked at in a larger context .
it contends the wto must also take into account its complaint made against boeing for subsidies it received from the us government .
" it is important to recall that this report is only half the case against the us over aid to boeing , " said luiz guellner , spokesman for the eu trade commissioner catherine ashton .
it could take years for the wto to reach a final decision on the transatlantic subsidies battle between the two aviation giants , but many industry analysts expect boeing and airbus to negotiate a settlement in the long-running dispute before the matter ever reaches the wto top court .
" we look forward to a negotiated settlement in which both sides recognize the way this industry is supposed to work , " said airbus spokeswoman maggie bergsma .
if the wto panel strikes down future airbus aid , the company could find difficulties in financing its new airliners , such as the wide-body a350 due in the next decade .
such a decision would also affect how rivals in brazil , canada , china , russia , and japan fuel their expansion. glb / vj / reuters / dpa / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the cdu , along with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , would like to extend that deadline , a move that is opposed by the spd and environmentalist greens .
the issue has been largely ignored in pre-election campaigning for the sept .
27 general election .
but that may now change with saturday 's rally in berlin , led by farmers from wendland , a region in north-central germany , where plans call for permanent waste disposal sites .
the spd chancellor candidate , frank-walter steinmeier , on friday accused the cdu and fdp " of leading the country into an energy policy dead-end and endangering domestic security . "
but merkel has said it 's too early to turn off the switch on all nuclear power in germany .
" we can not phase out nuclear energy as quickly as some imagine , " merkel said .
" but in the long term , that 's to say in the second half of the century , we will experience a large amount of renewable energy sources .
we are convinced that we will be able to stop using nuclear energy at some point . "
a divisive issue and maybe a rallying cry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tractors heading to berlin for saturday 's rally political analysts have said that even though the dispute between the cdu and spd has had little effect on the campaign , the nuclear issue could mobilize voters in both camps .
" so far , it has played almost no role at all , which is a bit surprising , considering it 's one of the few issues where the cdu and spd are completely at odds , " said dietmar herz , a political scientist at erfurt university .
the spd and greens point to polls showing that a majority of germans - around 59 percent - oppose nuclear energy and want the plants shut down , while the cdu and fdp emphasize that until germany has built up a significant infrastructure of alternative energies , nuclear power plants should remain on line .
in 2001 , the spd-green government under former chancellor gerhard schroeder pushed through legislation to phase out the use of nuclear energy within two decades , despite protests from the industry and power utilities .
germany at odds with most other developed countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear waste is transported under heavy guard in special containers the spd and the greens had hoped that germany would lead the way into a " post-nuclear age , " but instead much of the developed world has embraced the use of nuclear power as part of a climate-friendly energy mix .
france , for example , gets 80 percent of its power from nuclear energy and even exports a significant amount of it to germany .
germany covers about 23 percent of its energy consumption with nuclear power , compared to 42 percent with coal-fired power stations , 14 percent with natural gas and 15 percent with renewable energy sources , such as wind , solar and thermal .
nils diedrich , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , said he expects discussions about nuclear issue to heat up if merkel is able to form a coalition with the free democrats after the september election .
" if the cdu and fdp do actually win power and push through an extension of nuclear power we 'll see a real battle , " he said .

the cdu , along with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , would like to extend that deadline , a move that is opposed by the spd and environmentalist greens .
the issue has been largely ignored in pre-election campaigning for the sept .
27 general election .
but that may now change with saturday 's rally in berlin , led by farmers from wendland , a region in north-central germany , where plans call for permanent waste disposal sites .
the spd chancellor candidate , frank-walter steinmeier , on friday accused the cdu and fdp " of leading the country into an energy policy dead-end and endangering domestic security . "
but merkel has said it 's too early to turn off the switch on all nuclear power in germany .
" we can not phase out nuclear energy as quickly as some imagine , " merkel said .
" but in the long term , that 's to say in the second half of the century , we will experience a large amount of renewable energy sources .
we are convinced that we will be able to stop using nuclear energy at some point . "
a divisive issue and maybe a rallying cry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tractors heading to berlin for saturday 's rally political analysts have said that even though the dispute between the cdu and spd has had little effect on the campaign , the nuclear issue could mobilize voters in both camps .
" so far , it has played almost no role at all , which is a bit surprising , considering it 's one of the few issues where the cdu and spd are completely at odds , " said dietmar herz , a political scientist at erfurt university .
the spd and greens point to polls showing that a majority of germans - around 59 percent - oppose nuclear energy and want the plants shut down , while the cdu and fdp emphasize that until germany has built up a significant infrastructure of alternative energies , nuclear power plants should remain on line .
in 2001 , the spd-green government under former chancellor gerhard schroeder pushed through legislation to phase out the use of nuclear energy within two decades , despite protests from the industry and power utilities .
germany at odds with most other developed countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear waste is transported under heavy guard in special containers the spd and the greens had hoped that germany would lead the way into a " post-nuclear age , " but instead much of the developed world has embraced the use of nuclear power as part of a climate-friendly energy mix .
france , for example , gets 80 percent of its power from nuclear energy and even exports a significant amount of it to germany .
germany covers about 23 percent of its energy consumption with nuclear power , compared to 42 percent with coal-fired power stations , 14 percent with natural gas and 15 percent with renewable energy sources , such as wind , solar and thermal .
nils diedrich , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , said he expects discussions about nuclear issue to heat up if merkel is able to form a coalition with the free democrats after the september election .
" if the cdu and fdp do actually win power and push through an extension of nuclear power we 'll see a real battle , " he said .
" then there will be massive demonstrations . " gb / dpa / reuters / afp editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

steinbrueck 's british counterpart alistair darling warned against complacency and over-optimism in the week leading up to the meeting in london , after positive economic indicators in germany and france suggested that the world had weathered the worst of the global financial crisis .

this , he hopes , will precipitate what he calls a fair distribution of the massive burdens of the financial crisis .
steinbrueck 's tax , inspired by a proposal made in 1970 by american economist james tobin to impose a tax on currency speculation , would be levied on all financial products in all the markets in the world .

france and germany , along with five other countries , are united in calling for a stringent crackdown on bankers ' bonuses , but so far british support for such a measure has been cautious .
britain and the usa are keen to protect their powerful banking communities in london and new york , and have so far opposed any drastic sweeping measures that may provoke the banks .

an army transporter carrying german troops was damaged and at least three soldiers inside the vehicle were slightly injured , according to the german military operations command in potsdam .
german officials in afghanistan said the target of the attack was the bundeswehr military base .
two ap reporters at the base later said the shock wave was felt inside the compound .
a taliban spokesman said the fundamentalist islamist militia was responsible for the attack and that the bomber came from the chardarah district of kunduz , where the taliban is active .

in recent weeks , insurgents have repeatedly ambushed patrols and engaged german soldiers in hours-long firefights .
the german defense ministry has attributed the spate of recent attacks as an effort by the taliban to influence the outcome of the german federal election at the end of september .
meanwhile , in berlin , defense minister franz-josef jung sought to justify a nato air strike on two hijacked fuel trucks in kunduz on friday .
that attack , requested by german forces , left up to 90 people dead or injured , according to afghan president hamid karzai .
afghan officials and local residents said the dead included up to 40 civilians .
the german army has so far said that more than 50 taliban militants died , but that no civilians were involved .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 05.09.2009 anti-nuclear rally in berlin becomes campaign issue großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marchers protesting against a german nuclear storage facility thousands of people from across germany , including farmers on tractors , are in berlin this saturday to protest against the nuclear energy industry and in support of a plan to shut down the country 's nuclear reactors . the future of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants , due to be shut down by the early 2020s , is one of the major issues that separates chancellor angela merkel 's center-right christian democrats from the center-left social democrats .
the cdu , along with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , would like to extend that deadline , a move that is opposed by the spd and environmentalist greens .
the issue has been largely ignored in pre-election campaigning for the sept .
27 general election .
but that may now change with saturday 's rally in berlin , led by farmers from wendland , a region in north-central germany , where plans call for permanent waste disposal sites .
the spd chancellor candidate , frank-walter steinmeier , on friday accused the cdu and fdp " of leading the country into an energy policy dead-end and endangering domestic security . "
but merkel has said it 's too early to turn off the switch on all nuclear power in germany .
" we can not phase out nuclear energy as quickly as some imagine , " merkel said .
" but in the long term , that 's to say in the second half of the century , we will experience a large amount of renewable energy sources .
we are convinced that we will be able to stop using nuclear energy at some point . "
a divisive issue and maybe a rallying cry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tractors heading to berlin for saturday 's rally political analysts have said that even though the dispute between the cdu and spd has had little effect on the campaign , the nuclear issue could mobilize voters in both camps .
" so far , it has played almost no role at all , which is a bit surprising , considering it 's one of the few issues where the cdu and spd are completely at odds , " said dietmar herz , a political scientist at erfurt university .
the spd and greens point to polls showing that a majority of germans - around 59 percent - oppose nuclear energy and want the plants shut down , while the cdu and fdp emphasize that until germany has built up a significant infrastructure of alternative energies , nuclear power plants should remain on line .
in 2001 , the spd-green government under former chancellor gerhard schroeder pushed through legislation to phase out the use of nuclear energy within two decades , despite protests from the industry and power utilities .
germany at odds with most other developed countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear waste is transported under heavy guard in special containers the spd and the greens had hoped that germany would lead the way into a " post-nuclear age , " but instead much of the developed world has embraced the use of nuclear power as part of a climate-friendly energy mix .
france , for example , gets 80 percent of its power from nuclear energy and even exports a significant amount of it to germany .
germany covers about 23 percent of its energy consumption with nuclear power , compared to 42 percent with coal-fired power stations , 14 percent with natural gas and 15 percent with renewable energy sources , such as wind , solar and thermal .
nils diedrich , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , said he expects discussions about nuclear issue to heat up if merkel is able to form a coalition with the free democrats after the september election .
" if the cdu and fdp do actually win power and push through an extension of nuclear power we 'll see a real battle , " he said .
" then there will be massive demonstrations . " gb / dpa / reuters / afp editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an army transporter carrying german troops was damaged and at least three soldiers inside the vehicle were slightly injured , according to the german military operations command in potsdam .
german officials in afghanistan said the target of the attack was the bundeswehr military base .
two ap reporters at the base later said the shock wave was felt inside the compound .
a taliban spokesman said the fundamentalist islamist militia was responsible for the attack and that the bomber came from the chardarah district of kunduz , where the taliban is active .
kunduz area becomes more dangerous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan forces still rely on nato and german support the area around kunduz has become increasingly dangerous for the approximately 4,000-strong german troop contingent stationed there .
in recent weeks , insurgents have repeatedly ambushed patrols and engaged german soldiers in hours-long firefights .
the german defense ministry has attributed the spate of recent attacks as an effort by the taliban to influence the outcome of the german federal election at the end of september .
meanwhile , in berlin , defense minister franz-josef jung sought to justify a nato air strike on two hijacked fuel trucks in kunduz on friday .
that attack , requested by german forces , left up to 90 people dead or injured , according to afghan president hamid karzai .
afghan officials and local residents said the dead included up to 40 civilians .
the german army has so far said that more than 50 taliban militants died , but that no civilians were involved .
minister jung was quoted on the bild zeitung website as saying that " when just six kilometers away from us , the taliban take two fuel tankers , that represents a serious danger for us .

"
ruettgers had previously apologized for making offensive comments . the remarks were made during a speech in the western town of muenster on aug .
28 , which was filmed and posted on video sharing website youtube by rivals the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- on saturday .
the video comments resembled those made two days earlier in duisburg , which forced an apology from ruettgers on friday , aug .
4 .
the spd , which is the main opponent to ruettgers ’ christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , have argued that the remarks were not just spoken in the heat of a campaign speech , but form part of ruettger 's election strategy .
commenting on the removal of a nokia mobile phone factory from bochum in north rhine-westphalia to romania , ruettgers said : " in romania , the workers do n't come at seven in the morning like they do here in north rhine-westphalia , and they do n't stay until the factory closes . ...
they come when they want and go when they want , and that 's why they do n't get any mobile phones built . "
social democrats leader and chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier said the comments would damage germany 's image abroad and were a " grist in the mill of extremists . "
renate kuenast , parliamentary head of the green party , labeled the remarks " pure racism " and called on german chancellor angela merkel to " draw the consequences swiftly and unambiguously . "
gregor gysi , co-head of the left party , said the comments were " racist … dangerous and pathetic . "
premature apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers was angered by closure of the nokia factory in bochum ruettgers had apologized for the duisburg speech on friday evening , saying : " i did not intend to offend anyone , and if i did , i am sorry . "
he explained the remarks by referring to the redundancies suffered by some of his audience .
" i was standing in front of north rhine-westphalian workers , whose amazing efforts are globally acknowledged , and who have lost their jobs because of bad decisions taken at company headquarters , " he said .
apparently attempting to demonstrate his determination to bring chinese money to duisburg , ruettgers is also heard on the video saying : " and if we have to , we 'll meet some chinese people in the town hall .
and if they still do n't want to invest , we 'll strangle them until they find duisburg beautiful . "
ruettgers intends to travel to china in november in order to seek investors .
the state premier has a history of insulting non-german workers in his speeches .
he caused a media storm in 2000 for campaigning in his state election under the slogan " kinder statt inder " -lrb- children not indians -rrb- , in protest at the spd government 's attempts to attract skilled workers from southern asia to work in germany 's technology sector .
the leader of the local cdu hendrik wuest defended ruettgers , saying : " the video unduly shortens the speech and rips ruettgers ' remarks completely out of their context . "
north rhine-westphalia integration minister armin laschet said it was " absurd " to accuse ruettgers of hostility towards foreigners , and that the german state had done a lot to help foreigners integrate . dfm / bk / dpa / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
ruettgers had previously apologized for making offensive comments . the remarks were made during a speech in the western town of muenster on aug .
28 , which was filmed and posted on video sharing website youtube by rivals the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- on saturday .
the video comments resembled those made two days earlier in duisburg , which forced an apology from ruettgers on friday , aug .
4 .
the spd , which is the main opponent to ruettgers ’ christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , have argued that the remarks were not just spoken in the heat of a campaign speech , but form part of ruettger 's election strategy .
commenting on the removal of a nokia mobile phone factory from bochum in north rhine-westphalia to romania , ruettgers said : " in romania , the workers do n't come at seven in the morning like they do here in north rhine-westphalia , and they do n't stay until the factory closes . ...
they come when they want and go when they want , and that 's why they do n't get any mobile phones built . "
social democrats leader and chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier said the comments would damage germany 's image abroad and were a " grist in the mill of extremists . "
renate kuenast , parliamentary head of the green party , labeled the remarks " pure racism " and called on german chancellor angela merkel to " draw the consequences swiftly and unambiguously . "
gregor gysi , co-head of the left party , said the comments were " racist … dangerous and pathetic . "
premature apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers was angered by closure of the nokia factory in bochum ruettgers had apologized for the duisburg speech on friday evening , saying : " i did not intend to offend anyone , and if i did , i am sorry . "
he explained the remarks by referring to the redundancies suffered by some of his audience .
" i was standing in front of north rhine-westphalian workers , whose amazing efforts are globally acknowledged , and who have lost their jobs because of bad decisions taken at company headquarters , " he said .
apparently attempting to demonstrate his determination to bring chinese money to duisburg , ruettgers is also heard on the video saying : " and if we have to , we 'll meet some chinese people in the town hall .
and if they still do n't want to invest , we 'll strangle them until they find duisburg beautiful . "
ruettgers intends to travel to china in november in order to seek investors .
the state premier has a history of insulting non-german workers in his speeches .
he caused a media storm in 2000 for campaigning in his state election under the slogan " kinder statt inder " -lrb- children not indians -rrb- , in protest at the spd government 's attempts to attract skilled workers from southern asia to work in germany 's technology sector .
the leader of the local cdu hendrik wuest defended ruettgers , saying : " the video unduly shortens the speech and rips ruettgers ' remarks completely out of their context . "
north rhine-westphalia integration minister armin laschet said it was " absurd " to accuse ruettgers of hostility towards foreigners , and that the german state had done a lot to help foreigners integrate . dfm / bk / dpa / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an army transporter carrying german troops was damaged and at least three soldiers inside the vehicle were slightly injured , according to the german military operations command in potsdam .
german officials in afghanistan said the target of the attack was the bundeswehr military base .
two ap reporters at the base later said the shock wave was felt inside the compound .
a taliban spokesman said the fundamentalist islamist militia was responsible for the attack and that the bomber came from the chardarah district of kunduz , where the taliban is active .
kunduz area becomes more dangerous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan forces still rely on nato and german support the area around kunduz has become increasingly dangerous for the approximately 4,000-strong german troop contingent stationed there .
in recent weeks , insurgents have repeatedly ambushed patrols and engaged german soldiers in hours-long firefights .
the german defense ministry has attributed the spate of recent attacks as an effort by the taliban to influence the outcome of the german federal election at the end of september .
meanwhile , in berlin , defense minister franz-josef jung sought to justify a nato air strike on two hijacked fuel trucks in kunduz on friday .
that attack , requested by german forces , left up to 90 people dead or injured , according to afghan president hamid karzai .
afghan officials and local residents said the dead included up to 40 civilians .
the german army has so far said that more than 50 taliban militants died , but that no civilians were involved .
minister jung was quoted on the bild zeitung website as saying that " when just six kilometers away from us , the taliban take two fuel tankers , that represents a serious danger for us .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 05.09.2009 anti-nuclear rally in berlin becomes campaign issue großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marchers protesting against a german nuclear storage facility thousands of people from across germany , including farmers on tractors , are in berlin this saturday to protest against the nuclear energy industry and in support of a plan to shut down the country 's nuclear reactors . the future of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants , due to be shut down by the early 2020s , is one of the major issues that separates chancellor angela merkel 's center-right christian democrats from the center-left social democrats .
the cdu , along with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , would like to extend that deadline , a move that is opposed by the spd and environmentalist greens .
the issue has been largely ignored in pre-election campaigning for the sept .
27 general election .
but that may now change with saturday 's rally in berlin , led by farmers from wendland , a region in north-central germany , where plans call for permanent waste disposal sites .
the spd chancellor candidate , frank-walter steinmeier , on friday accused the cdu and fdp " of leading the country into an energy policy dead-end and endangering domestic security . "
but merkel has said it 's too early to turn off the switch on all nuclear power in germany .
" we can not phase out nuclear energy as quickly as some imagine , " merkel said .
" but in the long term , that 's to say in the second half of the century , we will experience a large amount of renewable energy sources .
we are convinced that we will be able to stop using nuclear energy at some point . "
a divisive issue and maybe a rallying cry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tractors heading to berlin for saturday 's rally political analysts have said that even though the dispute between the cdu and spd has had little effect on the campaign , the nuclear issue could mobilize voters in both camps .
" so far , it has played almost no role at all , which is a bit surprising , considering it 's one of the few issues where the cdu and spd are completely at odds , " said dietmar herz , a political scientist at erfurt university .
the spd and greens point to polls showing that a majority of germans - around 59 percent - oppose nuclear energy and want the plants shut down , while the cdu and fdp emphasize that until germany has built up a significant infrastructure of alternative energies , nuclear power plants should remain on line .
in 2001 , the spd-green government under former chancellor gerhard schroeder pushed through legislation to phase out the use of nuclear energy within two decades , despite protests from the industry and power utilities .
germany at odds with most other developed countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear waste is transported under heavy guard in special containers the spd and the greens had hoped that germany would lead the way into a " post-nuclear age , " but instead much of the developed world has embraced the use of nuclear power as part of a climate-friendly energy mix .
france , for example , gets 80 percent of its power from nuclear energy and even exports a significant amount of it to germany .
germany covers about 23 percent of its energy consumption with nuclear power , compared to 42 percent with coal-fired power stations , 14 percent with natural gas and 15 percent with renewable energy sources , such as wind , solar and thermal .
nils diedrich , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , said he expects discussions about nuclear issue to heat up if merkel is able to form a coalition with the free democrats after the september election .
" if the cdu and fdp do actually win power and push through an extension of nuclear power we 'll see a real battle , " he said .
" then there will be massive demonstrations . " gb / dpa / reuters / afp editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

american media is reporting that washington contends the wto ruled against europe . according to us lawmakers , the over 1,000-page ruling says that the funds given to airbus by the european union were in breach of anti-competition laws .
" i applaud the wto 's decision that government subsidies of airbus are illegal , " said senator maria cantwell of washington state , where much of boeing 's production takes place .
" when finalized , this long-awaited ruling will help restore true competition in the commercial aviation market . "
however , european officials say the wto ruling is much more complex than that .
the document is not expected to be made public for several months . the american aviation giant , boeing , made an initial complaint in 2004 .
it said that the " launch aid " given to airbus by several european governments , including france , germany , spain , and britain , was anti-competitive and illegal .
the complaint referred to $ 205 billion -lrb- 143 billion euros -rrb- of aid received by airbus over two decades while it was building its a380 and other top-selling models .
the three-member wto panel was widely believed to rule in favor of washington .
ruling only " half the story " brussels , meanwhile , has stressed the findings must be looked at in a larger context .
it contends the wto must also take into account its complaint made against boeing for subsidies it received from the us government .
" it is important to recall that this report is only half the case against the us over aid to boeing , " said luiz guellner , spokesman for the eu trade commissioner catherine ashton .
it could take years for the wto to reach a final decision on the transatlantic subsidies battle between the two aviation giants , but many industry analysts expect boeing and airbus to negotiate a settlement in the long-running dispute before the matter ever reaches the wto top court .
" we look forward to a negotiated settlement in which both sides recognize the way this industry is supposed to work , " said airbus spokeswoman maggie bergsma .
if the wto panel strikes down future airbus aid , the company could find difficulties in financing its new airliners , such as the wide-body a350 due in the next decade .
such a decision would also affect how rivals in brazil , canada , china , russia , and japan fuel their expansion. glb / vj / reuters / dpa / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 05.09.2009 anti-nuclear rally in berlin becomes campaign issue großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marchers protesting against a german nuclear storage facility thousands of people from across germany , including farmers on tractors , are in berlin this saturday to protest against the nuclear energy industry and in support of a plan to shut down the country 's nuclear reactors . the future of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants , due to be shut down by the early 2020s , is one of the major issues that separates chancellor angela merkel 's center-right christian democrats from the center-left social democrats .
the cdu , along with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , would like to extend that deadline , a move that is opposed by the spd and environmentalist greens .
the issue has been largely ignored in pre-election campaigning for the sept .
27 general election .
but that may now change with saturday 's rally in berlin , led by farmers from wendland , a region in north-central germany , where plans call for permanent waste disposal sites .
the spd chancellor candidate , frank-walter steinmeier , on friday accused the cdu and fdp " of leading the country into an energy policy dead-end and endangering domestic security . "
but merkel has said it 's too early to turn off the switch on all nuclear power in germany .
" we can not phase out nuclear energy as quickly as some imagine , " merkel said .
" but in the long term , that 's to say in the second half of the century , we will experience a large amount of renewable energy sources .
we are convinced that we will be able to stop using nuclear energy at some point . "
a divisive issue and maybe a rallying cry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tractors heading to berlin for saturday 's rally political analysts have said that even though the dispute between the cdu and spd has had little effect on the campaign , the nuclear issue could mobilize voters in both camps .
" so far , it has played almost no role at all , which is a bit surprising , considering it 's one of the few issues where the cdu and spd are completely at odds , " said dietmar herz , a political scientist at erfurt university .
the spd and greens point to polls showing that a majority of germans - around 59 percent - oppose nuclear energy and want the plants shut down , while the cdu and fdp emphasize that until germany has built up a significant infrastructure of alternative energies , nuclear power plants should remain on line .
in 2001 , the spd-green government under former chancellor gerhard schroeder pushed through legislation to phase out the use of nuclear energy within two decades , despite protests from the industry and power utilities .
germany at odds with most other developed countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear waste is transported under heavy guard in special containers the spd and the greens had hoped that germany would lead the way into a " post-nuclear age , " but instead much of the developed world has embraced the use of nuclear power as part of a climate-friendly energy mix .
france , for example , gets 80 percent of its power from nuclear energy and even exports a significant amount of it to germany .
germany covers about 23 percent of its energy consumption with nuclear power , compared to 42 percent with coal-fired power stations , 14 percent with natural gas and 15 percent with renewable energy sources , such as wind , solar and thermal .
nils diedrich , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , said he expects discussions about nuclear issue to heat up if merkel is able to form a coalition with the free democrats after the september election .
" if the cdu and fdp do actually win power and push through an extension of nuclear power we 'll see a real battle , " he said .
" then there will be massive demonstrations . " gb / dpa / reuters / afp editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

france and germany , along with five other countries , are united in calling for a stringent crackdown on bankers ' bonuses , but so far british support for such a measure has been cautious .
britain and the usa are keen to protect their powerful banking communities in london and new york , and have so far opposed any drastic sweeping measures that may provoke the banks .
britain warns against german complacency german finance minister peer steinbrueck is also keen to discuss when and how countries will withdraw state stimulus packages .
but this proposal has elicited only a lukewarm response from other countries , with french finance minister christine lagarde saying that while she would welcome discussing an exit strategy , the timing for an end to the financial crisis was something that " god only knows " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : darling warns of complacency about the financial crisis .
steinbrueck 's british counterpart alistair darling warned against complacency and over-optimism in the week leading up to the meeting in london , after positive economic indicators in germany and france suggested that the world had weathered the worst of the global financial crisis .
in an interview with britain 's newspaper the independent , darling expressed fears that optimism may lead to some countries stopping their fiscal stimulus programs prematurely .
steinbrueck 's international transaction tax according to saturday 's edition of the german berliner zeitung newspaper , steinbrueck also intends to use the g-20 meeting to propose a new international transaction tax on the world 's financial markets .
this , he hopes , will precipitate what he calls a fair distribution of the massive burdens of the financial crisis .
steinbrueck 's tax , inspired by a proposal made in 1970 by american economist james tobin to impose a tax on currency speculation , would be levied on all financial products in all the markets in the world .
the reaction of other members of the g-20 group to this idea is unclear as yet .

steinbrueck 's international transaction tax according to saturday 's edition of the german berliner zeitung newspaper , steinbrueck also intends to use the g-20 meeting to propose a new international transaction tax on the world 's financial markets .
this , he hopes , will precipitate what he calls a fair distribution of the massive burdens of the financial crisis .
steinbrueck 's tax , inspired by a proposal made in 1970 by american economist james tobin to impose a tax on currency speculation , would be levied on all financial products in all the markets in the world .
the reaction of other members of the g-20 group to this idea is unclear as yet .

american media is reporting that washington contends the wto ruled against europe . according to us lawmakers , the over 1,000-page ruling says that the funds given to airbus by the european union were in breach of anti-competition laws .
" i applaud the wto 's decision that government subsidies of airbus are illegal , " said senator maria cantwell of washington state , where much of boeing 's production takes place .
" when finalized , this long-awaited ruling will help restore true competition in the commercial aviation market . "
however , european officials say the wto ruling is much more complex than that .
the document is not expected to be made public for several months . the american aviation giant , boeing , made an initial complaint in 2004 .
it said that the " launch aid " given to airbus by several european governments , including france , germany , spain , and britain , was anti-competitive and illegal .
the complaint referred to $ 205 billion -lrb- 143 billion euros -rrb- of aid received by airbus over two decades while it was building its a380 and other top-selling models .
the three-member wto panel was widely believed to rule in favor of washington .
ruling only " half the story " brussels , meanwhile , has stressed the findings must be looked at in a larger context .
it contends the wto must also take into account its complaint made against boeing for subsidies it received from the us government .
" it is important to recall that this report is only half the case against the us over aid to boeing , " said luiz guellner , spokesman for the eu trade commissioner catherine ashton .
it could take years for the wto to reach a final decision on the transatlantic subsidies battle between the two aviation giants , but many industry analysts expect boeing and airbus to negotiate a settlement in the long-running dispute before the matter ever reaches the wto top court .
" we look forward to a negotiated settlement in which both sides recognize the way this industry is supposed to work , " said airbus spokeswoman maggie bergsma .
if the wto panel strikes down future airbus aid , the company could find difficulties in financing its new airliners , such as the wide-body a350 due in the next decade .
such a decision would also affect how rivals in brazil , canada , china , russia , and japan fuel their expansion. glb / vj / reuters / dpa / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an army transporter carrying german troops was damaged and at least three soldiers inside the vehicle were slightly injured , according to the german military operations command in potsdam .
german officials in afghanistan said the target of the attack was the bundeswehr military base .
two ap reporters at the base later said the shock wave was felt inside the compound .
a taliban spokesman said the fundamentalist islamist militia was responsible for the attack and that the bomber came from the chardarah district of kunduz , where the taliban is active .
kunduz area becomes more dangerous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan forces still rely on nato and german support the area around kunduz has become increasingly dangerous for the approximately 4,000-strong german troop contingent stationed there .
in recent weeks , insurgents have repeatedly ambushed patrols and engaged german soldiers in hours-long firefights .
the german defense ministry has attributed the spate of recent attacks as an effort by the taliban to influence the outcome of the german federal election at the end of september .
meanwhile , in berlin , defense minister franz-josef jung sought to justify a nato air strike on two hijacked fuel trucks in kunduz on friday .
that attack , requested by german forces , left up to 90 people dead or injured , according to afghan president hamid karzai .
afghan officials and local residents said the dead included up to 40 civilians .
the german army has so far said that more than 50 taliban militants died , but that no civilians were involved .

speaking to the times of malta newspaper on saturday , fenech called the report " sensationalism , " adding , " this is all above board and according to eu laws .
we have never had any negative reaction by the german government on this front . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck is accused of turning a blind eye by establishing a subsidiary on the island , shareholders of major german are allowed to claim back six sevenths of their maltese income tax , reducing their taxable income in germany .
the result is a tax saving of 23.6 million euros -lrb- $ 33.7 million -rrb- for every 100 million euros of profit .
steinbrueck turns a blind eye der spiegel claims that the small mediterranean country has become one of german industry 's preferred locations ever since it joined the eu in 2004 .
the magazine goes on to accuse german finance minister peer steinbrueck of ignoring the problem even though the finance ministry has long been aware of it .
according to the magazine , the german embassy in malta is also culpable for the huge loss of revenue , since it actively encourages german companies to take advantage of the law and invest in malta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank is considering opening a subsidiary in malta .
one of the magazine 's sources , from an accounting firm based in malta , confirmed that there had been a marked increase in the number of german companies with representation on the island in the last few years .
in addition to basf , lufthansa and puma , who already have maltese branches , deutsche bank is also said to be considering opening a subsidiary on the island .
fenech acknowledged this recent surge in investment , but insisted that it was well-known , and that all transactions were above board .
" german investment in malta has been present for a long time and the double taxation agreement with germany is there to facilitate taxation between the two countries and promote investment , " he said .
closing the loopholes in may this year , steinbrueck presented a bill to the german parliament meant to crack down on german companies exploiting foreign tax havens , and caused a diplomatic row after accusing neighboring countries luxembourg , liechtenstein and switzerland of aiding tax-dodging german companies .
the finance minister estimates that germany loses 100 billion euros of revenue through tax havens every year. bk / dpa / spiegel editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on thursday , after both the usa and the eu claimed they had not received any official notification of such a proposal , foreign ministry spokesman hassan ghashghavi declared that iran would only speak to the iaea. bk / reuters / dpa editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

american media is reporting that washington contends the wto ruled against europe . according to us lawmakers , the over 1,000-page ruling says that the funds given to airbus by the european union were in breach of anti-competition laws .
" i applaud the wto 's decision that government subsidies of airbus are illegal , " said senator maria cantwell of washington state , where much of boeing 's production takes place .
" when finalized , this long-awaited ruling will help restore true competition in the commercial aviation market . "
however , european officials say the wto ruling is much more complex than that .
the document is not expected to be made public for several months . the american aviation giant , boeing , made an initial complaint in 2004 .
it said that the " launch aid " given to airbus by several european governments , including france , germany , spain , and britain , was anti-competitive and illegal .
the complaint referred to $ 205 billion -lrb- 143 billion euros -rrb- of aid received by airbus over two decades while it was building its a380 and other top-selling models .
the three-member wto panel was widely believed to rule in favor of washington .
ruling only " half the story " brussels , meanwhile , has stressed the findings must be looked at in a larger context .
it contends the wto must also take into account its complaint made against boeing for subsidies it received from the us government .
" it is important to recall that this report is only half the case against the us over aid to boeing , " said luiz guellner , spokesman for the eu trade commissioner catherine ashton .
it could take years for the wto to reach a final decision on the transatlantic subsidies battle between the two aviation giants , but many industry analysts expect boeing and airbus to negotiate a settlement in the long-running dispute before the matter ever reaches the wto top court .
" we look forward to a negotiated settlement in which both sides recognize the way this industry is supposed to work , " said airbus spokeswoman maggie bergsma .
if the wto panel strikes down future airbus aid , the company could find difficulties in financing its new airliners , such as the wide-body a350 due in the next decade .
such a decision would also affect how rivals in brazil , canada , china , russia , and japan fuel their expansion. glb / vj / reuters / dpa / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the cdu , along with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , would like to extend that deadline , a move that is opposed by the spd and environmentalist greens .
the issue has been largely ignored in pre-election campaigning for the sept .
27 general election .
but that may now change with saturday 's rally in berlin , led by farmers from wendland , a region in north-central germany , where plans call for permanent waste disposal sites .
the spd chancellor candidate , frank-walter steinmeier , on friday accused the cdu and fdp " of leading the country into an energy policy dead-end and endangering domestic security . "
but merkel has said it 's too early to turn off the switch on all nuclear power in germany .
" we can not phase out nuclear energy as quickly as some imagine , " merkel said .
" but in the long term , that 's to say in the second half of the century , we will experience a large amount of renewable energy sources .
we are convinced that we will be able to stop using nuclear energy at some point . "
a divisive issue and maybe a rallying cry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tractors heading to berlin for saturday 's rally political analysts have said that even though the dispute between the cdu and spd has had little effect on the campaign , the nuclear issue could mobilize voters in both camps .
" so far , it has played almost no role at all , which is a bit surprising , considering it 's one of the few issues where the cdu and spd are completely at odds , " said dietmar herz , a political scientist at erfurt university .
the spd and greens point to polls showing that a majority of germans - around 59 percent - oppose nuclear energy and want the plants shut down , while the cdu and fdp emphasize that until germany has built up a significant infrastructure of alternative energies , nuclear power plants should remain on line .
in 2001 , the spd-green government under former chancellor gerhard schroeder pushed through legislation to phase out the use of nuclear energy within two decades , despite protests from the industry and power utilities .
germany at odds with most other developed countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear waste is transported under heavy guard in special containers the spd and the greens had hoped that germany would lead the way into a " post-nuclear age , " but instead much of the developed world has embraced the use of nuclear power as part of a climate-friendly energy mix .
france , for example , gets 80 percent of its power from nuclear energy and even exports a significant amount of it to germany .
germany covers about 23 percent of its energy consumption with nuclear power , compared to 42 percent with coal-fired power stations , 14 percent with natural gas and 15 percent with renewable energy sources , such as wind , solar and thermal .
nils diedrich , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , said he expects discussions about nuclear issue to heat up if merkel is able to form a coalition with the free democrats after the september election .
" if the cdu and fdp do actually win power and push through an extension of nuclear power we 'll see a real battle , " he said .

the cdu , along with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , would like to extend that deadline , a move that is opposed by the spd and environmentalist greens .
the issue has been largely ignored in pre-election campaigning for the sept .
27 general election .
but that may now change with saturday 's rally in berlin , led by farmers from wendland , a region in north-central germany , where plans call for permanent waste disposal sites .
the spd chancellor candidate , frank-walter steinmeier , on friday accused the cdu and fdp " of leading the country into an energy policy dead-end and endangering domestic security . "
but merkel has said it 's too early to turn off the switch on all nuclear power in germany .
" we can not phase out nuclear energy as quickly as some imagine , " merkel said .
" but in the long term , that 's to say in the second half of the century , we will experience a large amount of renewable energy sources .
we are convinced that we will be able to stop using nuclear energy at some point . "
a divisive issue and maybe a rallying cry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tractors heading to berlin for saturday 's rally political analysts have said that even though the dispute between the cdu and spd has had little effect on the campaign , the nuclear issue could mobilize voters in both camps .
" so far , it has played almost no role at all , which is a bit surprising , considering it 's one of the few issues where the cdu and spd are completely at odds , " said dietmar herz , a political scientist at erfurt university .
the spd and greens point to polls showing that a majority of germans - around 59 percent - oppose nuclear energy and want the plants shut down , while the cdu and fdp emphasize that until germany has built up a significant infrastructure of alternative energies , nuclear power plants should remain on line .

the accusations are based on western intelligence reports suggesting that the tehran government secretly combined uranium processing , airborne high-explosive tests and work to remodel a missile cone in a way that would fit a nuclear warhead .
" the government of the united states has not handed over original documents to the agency since it does not in fact have any authenticated document and all it has are forged documents , " soltanieh wrote in a letter to iaea chief mohamed elbaradei .

despite the latest spat , steinmeier said he remained optimistic that iran 's alleged nuclear weapons program could still be stopped .
the european union also leant its weight to the growing western pressure on iran at a meeting of european foreign ministers in stockholm this week .
iran is currently refusing to bow to all demands , and has stated that it will only speak to the iaea .
iaea urges iran to clear up questions while the iaea has admitted that it does not have proof of an iranian weapons plan , it urged iran to clear up questions rather than dismiss intelligence reports as forgeries .
according iaea , tehran is not cooperating sufficiently with its enquiries , and has consistently denied the agency access to sites .

a us official who wished to remain anonymous also stated that soltanieh 's accusation of forgery was baseless .
the new exchange of accusations follows a week of mixed signals from the iranian government , whose chief nuclear negotiator saeed jalili issued a statement saying iran was ready to talk to world powers about an updated nuclear proposal for the country .

american media is reporting that washington contends the wto ruled against europe . according to us lawmakers , the over 1,000-page ruling says that the funds given to airbus by the european union were in breach of anti-competition laws .
" i applaud the wto 's decision that government subsidies of airbus are illegal , " said senator maria cantwell of washington state , where much of boeing 's production takes place .
" when finalized , this long-awaited ruling will help restore true competition in the commercial aviation market . "
however , european officials say the wto ruling is much more complex than that .
the document is not expected to be made public for several months . the american aviation giant , boeing , made an initial complaint in 2004 .
it said that the " launch aid " given to airbus by several european governments , including france , germany , spain , and britain , was anti-competitive and illegal .
the complaint referred to $ 205 billion -lrb- 143 billion euros -rrb- of aid received by airbus over two decades while it was building its a380 and other top-selling models .
the three-member wto panel was widely believed to rule in favor of washington .
ruling only " half the story " brussels , meanwhile , has stressed the findings must be looked at in a larger context .
it contends the wto must also take into account its complaint made against boeing for subsidies it received from the us government .
" it is important to recall that this report is only half the case against the us over aid to boeing , " said luiz guellner , spokesman for the eu trade commissioner catherine ashton .
it could take years for the wto to reach a final decision on the transatlantic subsidies battle between the two aviation giants , but many industry analysts expect boeing and airbus to negotiate a settlement in the long-running dispute before the matter ever reaches the wto top court .
" we look forward to a negotiated settlement in which both sides recognize the way this industry is supposed to work , " said airbus spokeswoman maggie bergsma .
if the wto panel strikes down future airbus aid , the company could find difficulties in financing its new airliners , such as the wide-body a350 due in the next decade .
such a decision would also affect how rivals in brazil , canada , china , russia , and japan fuel their expansion. glb / vj / reuters / dpa / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the accusations are based on western intelligence reports suggesting that the tehran government secretly combined uranium processing , airborne high-explosive tests and work to remodel a missile cone in a way that would fit a nuclear warhead .
" the government of the united states has not handed over original documents to the agency since it does not in fact have any authenticated document and all it has are forged documents , " soltanieh wrote in a letter to iaea chief mohamed elbaradei .

the accusations are based on western intelligence reports suggesting that the tehran government secretly combined uranium processing , airborne high-explosive tests and work to remodel a missile cone in a way that would fit a nuclear warhead .
" the government of the united states has not handed over original documents to the agency since it does not in fact have any authenticated document and all it has are forged documents , " soltanieh wrote in a letter to iaea chief mohamed elbaradei .
" the alleged studies are politically motivated and baseless allegations . "

american media is reporting that washington contends the wto ruled against europe . according to us lawmakers , the over 1,000-page ruling says that the funds given to airbus by the european union were in breach of anti-competition laws .
" i applaud the wto 's decision that government subsidies of airbus are illegal , " said senator maria cantwell of washington state , where much of boeing 's production takes place .
" when finalized , this long-awaited ruling will help restore true competition in the commercial aviation market . "
however , european officials say the wto ruling is much more complex than that .
the document is not expected to be made public for several months . the american aviation giant , boeing , made an initial complaint in 2004 .
it said that the " launch aid " given to airbus by several european governments , including france , germany , spain , and britain , was anti-competitive and illegal .
the complaint referred to $ 205 billion -lrb- 143 billion euros -rrb- of aid received by airbus over two decades while it was building its a380 and other top-selling models .
the three-member wto panel was widely believed to rule in favor of washington .
ruling only " half the story " brussels , meanwhile , has stressed the findings must be looked at in a larger context .
it contends the wto must also take into account its complaint made against boeing for subsidies it received from the us government .
" it is important to recall that this report is only half the case against the us over aid to boeing , " said luiz guellner , spokesman for the eu trade commissioner catherine ashton .
it could take years for the wto to reach a final decision on the transatlantic subsidies battle between the two aviation giants , but many industry analysts expect boeing and airbus to negotiate a settlement in the long-running dispute before the matter ever reaches the wto top court .
" we look forward to a negotiated settlement in which both sides recognize the way this industry is supposed to work , " said airbus spokeswoman maggie bergsma .
if the wto panel strikes down future airbus aid , the company could find difficulties in financing its new airliners , such as the wide-body a350 due in the next decade .
such a decision would also affect how rivals in brazil , canada , china , russia , and japan fuel their expansion. glb / vj / reuters / dpa / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an army transporter carrying german troops was damaged and at least three soldiers inside the vehicle were slightly injured , according to the german military operations command in potsdam .
german officials in afghanistan said the target of the attack was the bundeswehr military base .
two ap reporters at the base later said the shock wave was felt inside the compound .
a taliban spokesman said the fundamentalist islamist militia was responsible for the attack and that the bomber came from the chardarah district of kunduz , where the taliban is active .
kunduz area becomes more dangerous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan forces still rely on nato and german support the area around kunduz has become increasingly dangerous for the approximately 4,000-strong german troop contingent stationed there .
in recent weeks , insurgents have repeatedly ambushed patrols and engaged german soldiers in hours-long firefights .
the german defense ministry has attributed the spate of recent attacks as an effort by the taliban to influence the outcome of the german federal election at the end of september .
meanwhile , in berlin , defense minister franz-josef jung sought to justify a nato air strike on two hijacked fuel trucks in kunduz on friday .
that attack , requested by german forces , left up to 90 people dead or injured , according to afghan president hamid karzai .
afghan officials and local residents said the dead included up to 40 civilians .
the german army has so far said that more than 50 taliban militants died , but that no civilians were involved .
minister jung was quoted on the bild zeitung website as saying that " when just six kilometers away from us , the taliban take two fuel tankers , that represents a serious danger for us .

bringing down the number of civilian casualties is a chief concern . eu foreign ministers meeting in stockholm are set to discuss their joint strategy on afghanistan a day after a massive nato airstrike killed around 90 people , according to afghan officials .
the european governments are concerned that the incident could undermine their mission in afghanistan – where they have been trying to garner public support - and they have urged a speedy inquiry .
" it 's vital that nato and the afghanistan people come together .
we need a very strong nato commitment but we need a very strong afghan commitment also , " britian 's foreign minister david miliband told reporters in stockholm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nato airstrike sparked international outrage " and obviously incidents like this undermine that , " he added .
" that 's why it 's important that we are open and clear about what happened and make sure it does not happen again . "
on friday , two fuel tankers hijacked by the taliban were bombed in northern kunduz , killing insurgents and dozens of civilians .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country holds the eu presidency , called the loss of human life " regrettable " .
" we do n't know the details yet .
what we do know is that there are too many casualties , be that taliban or civilian casualties or be that something else , " he said .
afghan people are said to be growing impatient with the country 's fragile security situation and mounting civilian deaths , despite the military presence there .
eu governments , however , show no signs of abandoning the mission , instead expressing their continued support .
" what is very important is for the international community to continue to be united ... we will stay -lrb- as long as -rrb- necessary , " said italian foreing minister franco frattini .
meanwhile , three weeks after afghanistan 's disputed presidential elections , the un says it is planning a summit there for next year to discuss the country 's political and economic future .
according to un spokesman ari gaitanis , " the summit has been proposed as a means of bringing the next afghan government and its international partners together around a common agenda for afghanistan over the next few years .

an army transporter carrying german troops was damaged and at least three soldiers inside the vehicle were slightly injured , according to the german military operations command in potsdam .
german officials in afghanistan said the target of the attack was the bundeswehr military base .
two ap reporters at the base later said the shock wave was felt inside the compound .
a taliban spokesman said the fundamentalist islamist militia was responsible for the attack and that the bomber came from the chardarah district of kunduz , where the taliban is active .
kunduz area becomes more dangerous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan forces still rely on nato and german support the area around kunduz has become increasingly dangerous for the approximately 4,000-strong german troop contingent stationed there .

the german defense ministry has attributed the spate of recent attacks as an effort by the taliban to influence the outcome of the german federal election at the end of september .
meanwhile , in berlin , defense minister franz-josef jung sought to justify a nato air strike on two hijacked fuel trucks in kunduz on friday .
that attack , requested by german forces , left up to 90 people dead or injured , according to afghan president hamid karzai .
afghan officials and local residents said the dead included up to 40 civilians .
the german army has so far said that more than 50 taliban militants died , but that no civilians were involved .
minister jung was quoted on the bild zeitung website as saying that " when just six kilometers away from us , the taliban take two fuel tankers , that represents a serious danger for us .

an army transporter carrying german troops was damaged and at least three soldiers inside the vehicle were slightly injured , according to the german military operations command in potsdam .
german officials in afghanistan said the target of the attack was the bundeswehr military base .
two ap reporters at the base later said the shock wave was felt inside the compound .
a taliban spokesman said the fundamentalist islamist militia was responsible for the attack and that the bomber came from the chardarah district of kunduz , where the taliban is active .
kunduz area becomes more dangerous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan forces still rely on nato and german support the area around kunduz has become increasingly dangerous for the approximately 4,000-strong german troop contingent stationed there .
in recent weeks , insurgents have repeatedly ambushed patrols and engaged german soldiers in hours-long firefights .
the german defense ministry has attributed the spate of recent attacks as an effort by the taliban to influence the outcome of the german federal election at the end of september .
meanwhile , in berlin , defense minister franz-josef jung sought to justify a nato air strike on two hijacked fuel trucks in kunduz on friday .
that attack , requested by german forces , left up to 90 people dead or injured , according to afghan president hamid karzai .
afghan officials and local residents said the dead included up to 40 civilians .
the german army has so far said that more than 50 taliban militants died , but that no civilians were involved .
minister jung was quoted on the bild zeitung website as saying that " when just six kilometers away from us , the taliban take two fuel tankers , that represents a serious danger for us .

american media is reporting that washington contends the wto ruled against europe . according to us lawmakers , the over 1,000-page ruling says that the funds given to airbus by the european union were in breach of anti-competition laws .
" i applaud the wto 's decision that government subsidies of airbus are illegal , " said senator maria cantwell of washington state , where much of boeing 's production takes place .
" when finalized , this long-awaited ruling will help restore true competition in the commercial aviation market . "
however , european officials say the wto ruling is much more complex than that .
the document is not expected to be made public for several months . the american aviation giant , boeing , made an initial complaint in 2004 .
it said that the " launch aid " given to airbus by several european governments , including france , germany , spain , and britain , was anti-competitive and illegal .
the complaint referred to $ 205 billion -lrb- 143 billion euros -rrb- of aid received by airbus over two decades while it was building its a380 and other top-selling models .
the three-member wto panel was widely believed to rule in favor of washington .
ruling only " half the story " brussels , meanwhile , has stressed the findings must be looked at in a larger context .
it contends the wto must also take into account its complaint made against boeing for subsidies it received from the us government .
" it is important to recall that this report is only half the case against the us over aid to boeing , " said luiz guellner , spokesman for the eu trade commissioner catherine ashton .
it could take years for the wto to reach a final decision on the transatlantic subsidies battle between the two aviation giants , but many industry analysts expect boeing and airbus to negotiate a settlement in the long-running dispute before the matter ever reaches the wto top court .
" we look forward to a negotiated settlement in which both sides recognize the way this industry is supposed to work , " said airbus spokeswoman maggie bergsma .
if the wto panel strikes down future airbus aid , the company could find difficulties in financing its new airliners , such as the wide-body a350 due in the next decade .
such a decision would also affect how rivals in brazil , canada , china , russia , and japan fuel their expansion. glb / vj / reuters / dpa / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bringing down the number of civilian casualties is a chief concern . eu foreign ministers meeting in stockholm are set to discuss their joint strategy on afghanistan a day after a massive nato airstrike killed around 90 people , according to afghan officials .
the european governments are concerned that the incident could undermine their mission in afghanistan – where they have been trying to garner public support - and they have urged a speedy inquiry .
" it 's vital that nato and the afghanistan people come together .
we need a very strong nato commitment but we need a very strong afghan commitment also , " britian 's foreign minister david miliband told reporters in stockholm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nato airstrike sparked international outrage " and obviously incidents like this undermine that , " he added .
" that 's why it 's important that we are open and clear about what happened and make sure it does not happen again . "
on friday , two fuel tankers hijacked by the taliban were bombed in northern kunduz , killing insurgents and dozens of civilians .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country holds the eu presidency , called the loss of human life " regrettable " .
" we do n't know the details yet .
what we do know is that there are too many casualties , be that taliban or civilian casualties or be that something else , " he said .
afghan people are said to be growing impatient with the country 's fragile security situation and mounting civilian deaths , despite the military presence there .
eu governments , however , show no signs of abandoning the mission , instead expressing their continued support .
" what is very important is for the international community to continue to be united ... we will stay -lrb- as long as -rrb- necessary , " said italian foreing minister franco frattini .
meanwhile , three weeks after afghanistan 's disputed presidential elections , the un says it is planning a summit there for next year to discuss the country 's political and economic future .
according to un spokesman ari gaitanis , " the summit has been proposed as a means of bringing the next afghan government and its international partners together around a common agenda for afghanistan over the next few years .

france and germany , along with five other countries , are united in calling for a stringent crackdown on bankers ' bonuses , but so far british support for such a measure has been cautious .
britain and the usa are keen to protect their powerful banking communities in london and new york , and have so far opposed any drastic sweeping measures that may provoke the banks .
britain warns against german complacency german finance minister peer steinbrueck is also keen to discuss when and how countries will withdraw state stimulus packages .
but this proposal has elicited only a lukewarm response from other countries , with french finance minister christine lagarde saying that while she would welcome discussing an exit strategy , the timing for an end to the financial crisis was something that " god only knows " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : darling warns of complacency about the financial crisis .
steinbrueck 's british counterpart alistair darling warned against complacency and over-optimism in the week leading up to the meeting in london , after positive economic indicators in germany and france suggested that the world had weathered the worst of the global financial crisis .
in an interview with britain 's newspaper the independent , darling expressed fears that optimism may lead to some countries stopping their fiscal stimulus programs prematurely .
steinbrueck 's international transaction tax according to saturday 's edition of the german berliner zeitung newspaper , steinbrueck also intends to use the g-20 meeting to propose a new international transaction tax on the world 's financial markets .
this , he hopes , will precipitate what he calls a fair distribution of the massive burdens of the financial crisis .
steinbrueck 's tax , inspired by a proposal made in 1970 by american economist james tobin to impose a tax on currency speculation , would be levied on all financial products in all the markets in the world .
the reaction of other members of the g-20 group to this idea is unclear as yet .
the main purpose of the short weekend meeting is to agree an agenda for the major g-20 summit in pittsburgh at the end of september. bk / ap / afp / dpa editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the accusations are based on western intelligence reports suggesting that the tehran government secretly combined uranium processing , airborne high-explosive tests and work to remodel a missile cone in a way that would fit a nuclear warhead .
" the government of the united states has not handed over original documents to the agency since it does not in fact have any authenticated document and all it has are forged documents , " soltanieh wrote in a letter to iaea chief mohamed elbaradei .
" the alleged studies are politically motivated and baseless allegations . "
west shows united front in frankfurt at a meeting held near frankfurt this week , germany joined the five members of the un security council in calling on iran to negotiate with the un about its nuclear program .
germany , france , britain and the united states have also threatened iran with a fourth round of sanctions if it continues enriching uranium and refuses to resolve concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier echoed eu and un threats on new sanctions german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier aligned himself with its un allies in an interview in saturday 's hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" at the moment , i am sceptical .
if the situation stays as it is , we will have to enter a new round of sanctions .
we will have to increase the pressure . "
despite the latest spat , steinmeier said he remained optimistic that iran 's alleged nuclear weapons program could still be stopped .
the european union also leant its weight to the growing western pressure on iran at a meeting of european foreign ministers in stockholm this week .
iran is currently refusing to bow to all demands , and has stated that it will only speak to the iaea .
iaea urges iran to clear up questions while the iaea has admitted that it does not have proof of an iranian weapons plan , it urged iran to clear up questions rather than dismiss intelligence reports as forgeries .
according iaea , tehran is not cooperating sufficiently with its enquiries , and has consistently denied the agency access to sites .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soltanieh refuses to accept the legitimacy of western intelligence us state department spokesman ian kelly told reporters , " we have provided a path whereby iran can become a full and respected member of the international community .
it is up to iran to make a decision as to whether it chooses that path . "
a us official who wished to remain anonymous also stated that soltanieh 's accusation of forgery was baseless .
the new exchange of accusations follows a week of mixed signals from the iranian government , whose chief nuclear negotiator saeed jalili issued a statement saying iran was ready to talk to world powers about an updated nuclear proposal for the country .
on thursday , after both the usa and the eu claimed they had not received any official notification of such a proposal , foreign ministry spokesman hassan ghashghavi declared that iran would only speak to the iaea. bk / reuters / dpa editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
