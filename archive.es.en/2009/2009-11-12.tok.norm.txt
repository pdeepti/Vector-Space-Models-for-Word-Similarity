with important policy decisions on issues such as afghanistan waiting , barack obama is taking a week out of his tight schedule to visit east and southeast asia .
on friday , he 'll begin in tokyo and continue his tour in singapore , shanghai , beijing and seoul .
at the weekend , he 'll also attend two summits with leaders from all over the region . president obama , that 's what his advisers like to emphasize , has a special relationship with the asia-pacific region , having been born in hawaii and having spent his childhood and youth there as well as in indonesia .
maybe this will turn out to be useful in his bid to re-engage with a continent that has felt neglected by america to some extent .
it is a common perception in asia that the chinese footprint has become larger over the last decade , while american influence has been on the wane .
jeffrey bader of the us national security council explains : " during the period of asia 's emergence , the us has been substantially occupied with various fronts in the war on terror . "
engaging myanmar helps with asean now america is keen to show that it is back , and particularly in southeast asia .
on the sidelines of the asia-pacific economic cooperation or apec summit in singapore at the weekend , obama is set to hold the first ever summit meeting of a us president with leaders of the ten asean countries .
these include the junta of the internationally isolated myanmar .
prime minister general thein sein is expected in singapore , and as secretary of state hillary clinton has said , an opportunity for him to talk with her or even obama might well arise .
this would have been unthinkable under the previous bush administration .
robert sutter , an expert on asia at georgetown university in washington says : " now the obama administration has a more flexible approach , which allows a free interaction with all the leaders of the asean members , and that 's very helpful in the administration 's approach to dealing with the entire region ! "
controversial military presence obama will begin his political meetings in tokyo on friday .
in japan , he will have to address concerns within the newly elected hatoyama government about the us troops stationed on the island of okinawa .
obama 's top asia aide jeffrey bader says , " populations in our key allies in northeast asia support the alliances , but they want more equal partnerships with a lighter us military footprint .
that is why we are reconfiguring our presence in japan and south korea . "
even if major changes in troop deployment are expected neither in japan nor in south korea , the obama administration has been showing a new readiness to listen to the views of its allies - also with regard to north korea , an area where both japan and south korea felt out of the loop repeatedly during the last years .
jeffrey bader says the obama administration has taken a different approach here as well : " from day one , we have been scrupulous about building consensus with our allies on north korea policy , genuinely soliciting their views , sitting down with them before we made a decision , not just afterwards , and never making a move without thorough discussions . "
before returning home from south korea next week , obama will also visit china on possibly the most challenging leg of his asia trip .

the focus is likely to be on trade and security issues with the us keen to boost its influence in the region . barack obama kicked off his first trip to asia as us president on friday , holding talks with japanese prime minister yukio hatoyama .
both were keen to stress their cooperation on a wide range of issues including nuclear non-proliferation and efforts to tackle climate change .
japan is one of america 's oldest allies in east asia , and obama highlighted that the alliance with japan was a " foundation " for peace and prosperity in the region .
nevertheless the newly elected democratic party does n't appear to be as supportive of a strong us-japan alliance , and has called for a smaller us military " footprint " on japanese soil . obama is due to give a major speech in tokyo on saturday outlining his ideas for america 's new role in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands demonstrated against a us military base on the japanese island of okinawa the week-long tour , which also includes stops in singapore , beijing and seoul , is intended to lay the groundwork for future cooperation , according to administration officials and analysts , and it marks a notable shift in us involvement in the region , where chinese influence has grown considerably in recent years .
" if you do not hold your ground in the pacific , you can not be a world leader , " remarked singapore 's former prime minister lee kuan yew in washington last week .
obama 's predecessor , george w. bush , was often perceived as ignoring asia 's economic growth - much to the chagrin of officials there .
now , obama will seek to assure the region of continued us engagement , but analysts say relations have grown more complex in wake of asia 's economic transformation .
indeed , just days after world leaders celebrated the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , which was widely interpreted as the triumph of western ideas , obama 's asia visit will highlight just how much has changed in two decades .
" china , especially during the past two years , -lsb- has -rsb- emerged as a global economic powerhouse , " cheng li , an expert on us-china relations at the brookings institution in washington , told deutsche welle .
" and it really came as a big surprise , although many china analysts had predicted china 's rise . " " the period -lsb- in which -rsb- china is a student lectured by the west is coming to an end , " he added . china poses new challenges obama called china " a vital partner , as well as a competitor " ahead of his departure , and his stops in beijing and shanghai are perhaps the most crucial legs of his tour .
china is america 's second largest trading partner - and its largest creditor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says he will meet the dalai lama after his china trip there have been several indicators ahead of obama 's visit that point to a power shift in us-china relations .
" a year ago , hillary clinton , during the campaign , argued that the united states should boycott our olympics , but now she 's become a spokesperson for the shanghai expo - she visited the shanghai expo site - so that tells you how dramatic change has been , " said cheng li . furthermore , obama declined to meet with the dalai lama last month during his trip to washington , making him the first president since 1991 to do so . recently , the us administration also backed the replacement of the g-8 group of wealthy industrialized nations with the g-20 , which includes china , to converge on matters of the global economy .
but francois godement , an east asia expert at the european council on foreign relations , believes the hype about asia 's rise and america 's waning influence is overstated .
" i see us popularity increasing , not decreasing , and that 's the obama factor as you look at all of the opinion polls throughout asia - it 's a big change from a year ago , " godement told deutsche welle .
aside from economic matters , the us sees chinese cooperation as essential on two key issues : containing the nuclear ambitions of both north korea and iran , and negotiating a deal on carbon emissions caps at the upcoming climate summit in copenhagen .
mending strained relations in tough economic times in singapore , obama will participate in the leaders summit of the asia-pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- , where the aim will be to strengthen us ties with countries that form the asssociation of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- .
obama has agreed to engage with burma , opening the door for talks with asean leaders who had previously clashed with former president bush over the issue .
but the financial crisis will undoubtedly complicate obama 's agenda .
at a time when the us seeks to expand its influence in asia , obama would be hard-pressed to convince congress to support any new free-trade agreements .
many americans feel threatened by asia 's rise and the impact it will have on their jobs , especially during a period of record high unemployment .
analysts say they do n't expect any concrete achievements from the trip on any of the major issues - trade , non-nuclear proliferation , iran , afghanistan , north korea , and climate change - but asian leaders are said to be excited about renewed us interest in the region .

the focus is likely to be on trade and security issues with the us keen to boost its influence in the region . barack obama kicked off his first trip to asia as us president on friday , holding talks with japanese prime minister yukio hatoyama .
both were keen to stress their cooperation on a wide range of issues including nuclear non-proliferation and efforts to tackle climate change .
japan is one of america 's oldest allies in east asia , and obama highlighted that the alliance with japan was a " foundation " for peace and prosperity in the region .
nevertheless the newly elected democratic party does n't appear to be as supportive of a strong us-japan alliance , and has called for a smaller us military " footprint " on japanese soil . obama is due to give a major speech in tokyo on saturday outlining his ideas for america 's new role in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands demonstrated against a us military base on the japanese island of okinawa the week-long tour , which also includes stops in singapore , beijing and seoul , is intended to lay the groundwork for future cooperation , according to administration officials and analysts , and it marks a notable shift in us involvement in the region , where chinese influence has grown considerably in recent years .
" if you do not hold your ground in the pacific , you can not be a world leader , " remarked singapore 's former prime minister lee kuan yew in washington last week .
obama 's predecessor , george w. bush , was often perceived as ignoring asia 's economic growth - much to the chagrin of officials there .
now , obama will seek to assure the region of continued us engagement , but analysts say relations have grown more complex in wake of asia 's economic transformation .
indeed , just days after world leaders celebrated the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , which was widely interpreted as the triumph of western ideas , obama 's asia visit will highlight just how much has changed in two decades .
" china , especially during the past two years , -lsb- has -rsb- emerged as a global economic powerhouse , " cheng li , an expert on us-china relations at the brookings institution in washington , told deutsche welle .
" and it really came as a big surprise , although many china analysts had predicted china 's rise . " " the period -lsb- in which -rsb- china is a student lectured by the west is coming to an end , " he added . china poses new challenges obama called china " a vital partner , as well as a competitor " ahead of his departure , and his stops in beijing and shanghai are perhaps the most crucial legs of his tour .
china is america 's second largest trading partner - and its largest creditor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says he will meet the dalai lama after his china trip there have been several indicators ahead of obama 's visit that point to a power shift in us-china relations .
" a year ago , hillary clinton , during the campaign , argued that the united states should boycott our olympics , but now she 's become a spokesperson for the shanghai expo - she visited the shanghai expo site - so that tells you how dramatic change has been , " said cheng li . furthermore , obama declined to meet with the dalai lama last month during his trip to washington , making him the first president since 1991 to do so . recently , the us administration also backed the replacement of the g-8 group of wealthy industrialized nations with the g-20 , which includes china , to converge on matters of the global economy .
but francois godement , an east asia expert at the european council on foreign relations , believes the hype about asia 's rise and america 's waning influence is overstated .
" i see us popularity increasing , not decreasing , and that 's the obama factor as you look at all of the opinion polls throughout asia - it 's a big change from a year ago , " godement told deutsche welle .

the move has drawn condemnation from tehran . iran has condemned england 's oxford university for creating a scholarship in honor of neda agha-soltan , a 27-year-old philosophy student who was shot and killed over the summer during election protests in iran .
she became a symbol of the protests when her death was captured on video and viewed by millions on the internet .
in a letter sent to oxford from the iranian embassy in london , iran called the scholarship a " politically motivated move . "
the iranian government has repeatedly claimed that agha-soltan 's death was staged by enemies of the state .
oxford 's queen 's college created the neda agha soltan graduate scholarship in philosophy earlier this year , which is intended for philosophy students of iranian descent .
" the college is keen to support graduate students , " said professor paul madden , provost of queen 's college .
the scholarship will help iranian students to study at oxford , regardless of their financial background . he added : " donors make their own decisions , within reason , on how to name scholarships that they fund .
in this case , the donor who was instrumental in establishing the scholarship is a british citizen and is well known to the college . "

but the complex nature of the soccer community , and the problems that go with it , make finding answers much more difficult . attempts to understand what led german goalkeeper robert enke to take his own life may never get to the core of the torment he was suffering .
some would even argue that it ’ s better not to try - and let the hanover soccer star rest in peace . it has become clear that enke 's psyche was damaged by intense personal tragedy , with the death of his baby daughter from a congenital heart problem three years ago , and that he had been battling depression for years , but what was truly going on inside his head will never be revealed . however , a tragic loss like this can also prompt some potentially constructive questions about whether he - or others who share his plight - have had enough access to help and support within the sport 's structure . many sports psychologists will say , though , that enke 's death must be seen in the wider context of suicide .
while enke worked in an arena with its own particular stresses and strains , suicide is the leading cause of death among young men . some argue that instead of focusing on the pressures that soccer may have heaped onto him , it might be worth noting that enke actually had better access to support , community , and care – through his teammates , club and international federation – than many other sufferers of depression could ever hope to have . but peter kay , the ceo of sporting chance , a uk-based independent clinic for athletes with addictions and psychological problems , believes that while clubs have made progress in providing support in recent years , fear of exposure keeps many players from talking about their problems . too tough to open up bildunterschrift : enke feared revealing the depth of his depression could damage his career " there has been a real change in clubs over the last five years where the player has started to be seen more as a human being with human problems , " kay told deutsche welle .
" as a result , the clubs have brought in their own psychologists .
but what the players are willing to share is limited by the fear that the psychologists are going to report back to the manager ; they fear that their condition will be made known to the club .
one player who recently came to sporting chance , with the knowledge of his club , had his contract torn up by the manager who said he was a weak link and that he didn ’ t want that in the club .
this is the fear the players have . " while senseless and tragic to all , enke 's death may also confuse many .
some outside the world of soccer will question how anyone with the adoration of thousands , the financial security the game provides and the self-worth that comes from reaching the pinnacle of any sport , could ever become depressed . for the fans who fill the world ’ s stadia , those players on the pitch in front of them are living the dream .
however , those same factors can also contribute to a player 's fragile state of mind . " players live in a total fantasy world , cocooned by the clubs from reality , " kay said .
" while the clubs and soccer in general are not to blame , they are culpable .
from the age of eight and nine in some cases , young players are given everything which the club hopes will make them into a star .
there are few top players who can have a normal life – they 're celebrities now – and they have never had to live in the real world .
what is hard is when they can not equate their image in a magazine with how they truly feel inside .
they see this image of this star but inside they have self-doubts and low self-esteem .
this can be very damaging . " insecurity over first team chances , career bildunterschrift : enke , once tipped to be germany 's no.1 , had lost his secure grip on that place through illness sport psychologists are well aware of the particular pressures that athletes have to contend with .
enke 's career was dominated by the extreme highs and lows that come with every life spent in the sporting arena .
he had to deal with the constant threat of injury , the pressure to perform , and – as he publicly admitted – the threat of being replaced by a younger , better player .
facing these pressures in a career that could so easily end in a split-second collision , enke found out that the dream was always perilously close to turning into a nightmare . " top players live with the constant fear of being dropped or replaced , " said kay .
" they get their self-esteem from playing in the first team , from scoring goals or contributing to the team 's success .
you take that away from them and the problems multiply .
if a player of 32- or 33-years of age is struggling to keep his emotions and problems in check while also worrying about his career , the pressure can be overwhelming . " stigma in macho world of soccer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teammates are n't always mates enke feared that he could eventually be usurped as a goalkeeper but also that any revelation of his depression could lead to his adopted daughter leila being removed from his care .
while support structures may have been there for him , it is likely that he felt that he could n't admit that something was wrong with him for fear of what might happen . " there 's a terrific stigma in soccer , as in society , that if you have mental health issues or suffer from depression , then you ’ re seen as weak , " said kay .
" this is exacerbated in the macho world of soccer which , contrary to popular opinion , is a very lonely and insular place .
these players do n't all socialize together ; they do n't have dinner together every night , they 're not all pals , it 's not all tight-knit at the clubs .
it 's a highly competitive world where it 's every man for himself .
players wo n't share problems because they fear they will be judged and that their ' weakness ' will be used against them .

but the complex nature of the soccer community , and the problems that go with it , make finding answers much more difficult . attempts to understand what led german goalkeeper robert enke to take his own life may never get to the core of the torment he was suffering .
some would even argue that it ’ s better not to try - and let the hanover soccer star rest in peace . it has become clear that enke 's psyche was damaged by intense personal tragedy , with the death of his baby daughter from a congenital heart problem three years ago , and that he had been battling depression for years , but what was truly going on inside his head will never be revealed . however , a tragic loss like this can also prompt some potentially constructive questions about whether he - or others who share his plight - have had enough access to help and support within the sport 's structure . many sports psychologists will say , though , that enke 's death must be seen in the wider context of suicide .
while enke worked in an arena with its own particular stresses and strains , suicide is the leading cause of death among young men . some argue that instead of focusing on the pressures that soccer may have heaped onto him , it might be worth noting that enke actually had better access to support , community , and care – through his teammates , club and international federation – than many other sufferers of depression could ever hope to have . but peter kay , the ceo of sporting chance , a uk-based independent clinic for athletes with addictions and psychological problems , believes that while clubs have made progress in providing support in recent years , fear of exposure keeps many players from talking about their problems . too tough to open up bildunterschrift : enke feared revealing the depth of his depression could damage his career " there has been a real change in clubs over the last five years where the player has started to be seen more as a human being with human problems , " kay told deutsche welle .

families of the victims have demanded he pay for this negligence . local prosecutors had intended only to fine joerg k. for not locking up the gun and the ammunition used in the rampage as required by law .
but relatives of the 15 victims killed at a school and a car dealership in southwestern germany demanded a trial , saying the father had shown " gross negligence " in giving his " mentally ill " son " access to a weapon and 400 rounds of ammunition . "
now the justice ministry of the state of baden-wuerttemberg has said the state prosecutor will instruct the local prosecutor to put the father on trial .
prosecutors will argue that the father 's criminal negligence led to the homicides .
on march 11 of this year , tim k. took his father 's beretta pistol to his former school in winnenden where he killed nine students and three teachers .
he then shot and killed a gardener before commandeering a car and driving to the nearby town of wendlingen where he gunned down two other people .
when police caught up with him , he shot and killed himself .
following the killings , the families of the victims have led a movement to strengthen gun control laws in germany. hf / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 12.11.2009 opinion : europe should seize on medvedev 's calls for modernization großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his annual state of the nation address , russian president dimitry medvedev called for sweeping internal reforms .
deutsche welle 's ingo mannteufel thinks this is a golden opportunity for the eu . the russian president did not mince his words as he described the socio-economic situation in russia .
he ranted at what he called the country 's " chronic backwardness , " the " lack of economic competitiveness , " the rampant corruption and the high level of dependency on gas and oil .
and there 's no arguing with his assessment .
all the problems he listed play a major part in russia 's failure to fulfill its potential and to offer its people a modern way of life .
his appeals for change appear to be the right way forward , including the modernization and strengthening of democratic values and institutions and his pledge to fight terrorism in the north caucasus region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel however , any approval and support for his ideas should not overshadow two important questions : can medvedev achieve his ambitious aims given the extent of corruption and state-run bureaucracy , and can russia undergo an economic and technological modernization without far-reaching political reforms ?
his remarks in that respect did little to inspire confidence .
although he criticized authoritarian structures on a regional level and demanded improvements for russia 's opposition parties , there was little of substance on radical political and legal reform .
kremlin experts will have noted with interest medvedev 's calls to overhaul russia 's state-run companies , the behemoths created by his predecessor , vladimir putin .
however , it would be wrong to interpret that as a deep rift between the two men .
a closer look reveals that medvedev 's drive to modernize the country 's economy is part of the strategy pursued by putin .
medvedev can take credit for trying to give those ideas more substance and for giving them a democratic platform , thereby allowing optimists to hope whereas realists will say it 's time for action , not words .
still , medvedev 's message offers the west , and germany in particular , a promising opportunity .
for the first time russia is not using ideology or military might to define its status as a world power , instead it 's looking at whether it can offer its people modern living conditions .
this means that russia is being forced to adopt a more cooperative position towards the outside world .
as medvedev himself put it : modernization can only be achieved through integration with the global economy .
and that 's why it was no surprise that foreign policy was hardly mentioned .
medvedev said russia 's foreign policy would merely be an instrument to secure the sweeping internal reforms he has called for .
historically this would indicate a significant paradigm shift .
the european union should use this chance by defining its own aims and stating how it intends to help russia achieve modernization .

the works are meant to be taken at face value , without any political or religious overtones .
and stereotypes are to be left at the door . in the newest exhibition at the martin gropius bau in berlin , visitors are asked to take a fresh look at islamic culture . " it is now very common to speak of islamic culture in a way that reduces it , whether it is violence or a patriarchal culture or the veil , " said the exhibition 's head curator almut bruckstein coruh , who came from jerusalem to berlin to explore her own german-jewish background .
" this exhibition tries to undo these very strict and rude and basically violent boundaries created by this form of public discourse . " the exhibition is titled " taswir , " which , in arabic , persian and ottoman turkish means roughly " portrayal , likeness , drawing , or photograph . "
despite popular misconceptions , images are not absent from islamic tradition , bruckstein told deutsche welle .
the attitude toward images in islamic culture is ambivalent and has varied through history , she added . bildunterschrift : abdulnasser gharem 's " the path , " 2007 to understand the exhibition that has been painstakingly assembled by bruckstein , together with classical art historian hendrik budde , it is worth considering what it is not .
the structure of the show , which incorporates over 250 works , does not have a beginning or an end .
there is no chronology , it is not political , and most specifically , said bruckstein , it is not a study of religion . a poetic arrangement the exhibition 's 18 rooms have been set up based on an idea by aby warburg , a late 19th-century art historian - a first for a european gallery .
the concept , called the mnemosyne atlas , is a way of exhibiting art based on poetic association instead of chronology or theme . in addition to works by over 50 contemporary artists , classical islamic works are on loan from important national and international libraries and museums , including the hermitage in saint petersburg , the british museum and british library in london , the bibliotheque nationale de france , the calouste gulbenkian museum in lisbon and the museum of islamic art in berlin 's pergamon museum . " the mixing of classical and contemporary objects is absolutely new for me , " said budde .
" of course it was a struggle .
ms bruckstein was fighting for her contemporary works and i was begging , please do n't overwhelm my mostly - let 's face it - tiny classical objects .
but there are many rooms i am delighted by and the classical objects have , in fact , been heightened by their juxtaposition with the contemporary . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maliheh afnan 's " veiled minds , " 2006 not least of the classical artefacts assembled by classicist hendrik budde is a set of three painted korans , including an extremely rare 10th-century golden koran .
these examples were rare even in their day as korans are traditionally not decorated so as not to detract from the words . in some cases , however , visitors ca n't be sure whether they are looking at a classical or a modern piece , budde added - which may make them observe the objects more closely . unveiling art the exhibition asks the visitors to resist the temptation to compartmentalize islamic and european art . " i have never liked tags , " said palestinian-born artist maliheh afnan .
" i happen to be a woman , i happen to be an artist and i happen to be from the middle east .
there is all this talk nowadays about the veil and i thought about what we are hiding from within .
i think i prefer to deal with a person who veils their face and not themselves .
i think it is easier to deal with . " afnan has presented six works of calligraphy - a tradition she said is often connected to poetry as well as the koran .
even when using a very decorative script , religious texts or poetry always had to be readable .
afnan , however , has broken with this tradition .
she said her work is about the idea of writing itself , and is never actually readable . " i come from an ancient part of the world , so my work never looks fresh .
it looks weathered by time .
it is about the passage of time and about the ageing process , " said afnan . bildunterschrift : chant avedissian 's " the arab nation , " 2008 one of the exhibition 's strongest rooms , face and effaced face , is a play on the concept and idea of the veil .
the question here , said bruckstein , is what you see if you do n't have a regional , ethnic , or religious definition . at one end of the room is a 16th-century miniature of the prophet muhammad .
the picture shows a classically-veiled muhammad pointing at a full moon , which is traditionally a metaphor for beauty or perfection .
muhammad 's posture says : if you want to see me , look at the full moon . while the curators and artists are adamant that the show is neither about religion nor politics , this may not always be clear to the visitor .
the most recent piece in the room is a 2001 photo montage by palestinian artist taysir batniji , who was exiled from gaza and is now living in paris .
the photographs , taken black on black , depict the faces of 170 people killed by the israeli defence forces . bruckstein had to fight hard to get the art out of gaza .
she said that , even here , the focus is not on martyrdom but rather on engagement with the human face . life as a trace of absence in following with the exhibition 's method of poetic association , the show 's walls are scattered with sayings from thinkers and philosophers that define the theme or sentiment of each room .
one of them is from french philosopher jacques derrida , who said , " life must be thought of as a trace of absence . " budde has chosen a 16th-century miniature painting of the prophet muhammad 's sandals for this room .
it is part of a larger indian and persian tradition that sees footprints as the presence of someone 's absence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " khusraw watches shirin bathing , " 16th century miniature the centerpiece of the room is a four-by-four-meter well of sand .
a dial moves around the circle continuously , creating grooves with one side and rubbing them out with the other . " it is not a show about religion , " said bruckstein , " for example the question of the feet leaving a trace of absence is not a religious question ; it is a question of leaving a trace .
the three artists in the room are having a conversation . " budde said that this kind of exhibition is rare , since european museum-goers are more familiar with christian art . " i hope that visitors from islamic countries will be interested to see what we dared to put together , to do what ca n't be done in some arabic countries , " said budde . the exhibition runs until january 18 , 2010 . author : tanya wood editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the works are meant to be taken at face value , without any political or religious overtones .
and stereotypes are to be left at the door . in the newest exhibition at the martin gropius bau in berlin , visitors are asked to take a fresh look at islamic culture . " it is now very common to speak of islamic culture in a way that reduces it , whether it is violence or a patriarchal culture or the veil , " said the exhibition 's head curator almut bruckstein coruh , who came from jerusalem to berlin to explore her own german-jewish background .
" this exhibition tries to undo these very strict and rude and basically violent boundaries created by this form of public discourse . " the exhibition is titled " taswir , " which , in arabic , persian and ottoman turkish means roughly " portrayal , likeness , drawing , or photograph . "
despite popular misconceptions , images are not absent from islamic tradition , bruckstein told deutsche welle .
the attitude toward images in islamic culture is ambivalent and has varied through history , she added . bildunterschrift : abdulnasser gharem 's " the path , " 2007 to understand the exhibition that has been painstakingly assembled by bruckstein , together with classical art historian hendrik budde , it is worth considering what it is not .
the structure of the show , which incorporates over 250 works , does not have a beginning or an end .
there is no chronology , it is not political , and most specifically , said bruckstein , it is not a study of religion . a poetic arrangement the exhibition 's 18 rooms have been set up based on an idea by aby warburg , a late 19th-century art historian - a first for a european gallery .
the concept , called the mnemosyne atlas , is a way of exhibiting art based on poetic association instead of chronology or theme . in addition to works by over 50 contemporary artists , classical islamic works are on loan from important national and international libraries and museums , including the hermitage in saint petersburg , the british museum and british library in london , the bibliotheque nationale de france , the calouste gulbenkian museum in lisbon and the museum of islamic art in berlin 's pergamon museum . " the mixing of classical and contemporary objects is absolutely new for me , " said budde .
" of course it was a struggle .
ms bruckstein was fighting for her contemporary works and i was begging , please do n't overwhelm my mostly - let 's face it - tiny classical objects .
but there are many rooms i am delighted by and the classical objects have , in fact , been heightened by their juxtaposition with the contemporary . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maliheh afnan 's " veiled minds , " 2006 not least of the classical artefacts assembled by classicist hendrik budde is a set of three painted korans , including an extremely rare 10th-century golden koran .
these examples were rare even in their day as korans are traditionally not decorated so as not to detract from the words . in some cases , however , visitors ca n't be sure whether they are looking at a classical or a modern piece , budde added - which may make them observe the objects more closely . unveiling art the exhibition asks the visitors to resist the temptation to compartmentalize islamic and european art . " i have never liked tags , " said palestinian-born artist maliheh afnan .
" i happen to be a woman , i happen to be an artist and i happen to be from the middle east .
there is all this talk nowadays about the veil and i thought about what we are hiding from within .

the question here , said bruckstein , is what you see if you do n't have a regional , ethnic , or religious definition . at one end of the room is a 16th-century miniature of the prophet muhammad .
the picture shows a classically-veiled muhammad pointing at a full moon , which is traditionally a metaphor for beauty or perfection .
muhammad 's posture says : if you want to see me , look at the full moon . while the curators and artists are adamant that the show is neither about religion nor politics , this may not always be clear to the visitor .
the most recent piece in the room is a 2001 photo montage by palestinian artist taysir batniji , who was exiled from gaza and is now living in paris .

the works are meant to be taken at face value , without any political or religious overtones .
and stereotypes are to be left at the door . in the newest exhibition at the martin gropius bau in berlin , visitors are asked to take a fresh look at islamic culture . " it is now very common to speak of islamic culture in a way that reduces it , whether it is violence or a patriarchal culture or the veil , " said the exhibition 's head curator almut bruckstein coruh , who came from jerusalem to berlin to explore her own german-jewish background .
" this exhibition tries to undo these very strict and rude and basically violent boundaries created by this form of public discourse . " the exhibition is titled " taswir , " which , in arabic , persian and ottoman turkish means roughly " portrayal , likeness , drawing , or photograph . "
despite popular misconceptions , images are not absent from islamic tradition , bruckstein told deutsche welle .
the attitude toward images in islamic culture is ambivalent and has varied through history , she added . bildunterschrift : abdulnasser gharem 's " the path , " 2007 to understand the exhibition that has been painstakingly assembled by bruckstein , together with classical art historian hendrik budde , it is worth considering what it is not .
the structure of the show , which incorporates over 250 works , does not have a beginning or an end .
there is no chronology , it is not political , and most specifically , said bruckstein , it is not a study of religion . a poetic arrangement the exhibition 's 18 rooms have been set up based on an idea by aby warburg , a late 19th-century art historian - a first for a european gallery .
the concept , called the mnemosyne atlas , is a way of exhibiting art based on poetic association instead of chronology or theme . in addition to works by over 50 contemporary artists , classical islamic works are on loan from important national and international libraries and museums , including the hermitage in saint petersburg , the british museum and british library in london , the bibliotheque nationale de france , the calouste gulbenkian museum in lisbon and the museum of islamic art in berlin 's pergamon museum . " the mixing of classical and contemporary objects is absolutely new for me , " said budde .
" of course it was a struggle .
ms bruckstein was fighting for her contemporary works and i was begging , please do n't overwhelm my mostly - let 's face it - tiny classical objects .
but there are many rooms i am delighted by and the classical objects have , in fact , been heightened by their juxtaposition with the contemporary . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maliheh afnan 's " veiled minds , " 2006 not least of the classical artefacts assembled by classicist hendrik budde is a set of three painted korans , including an extremely rare 10th-century golden koran .
these examples were rare even in their day as korans are traditionally not decorated so as not to detract from the words . in some cases , however , visitors ca n't be sure whether they are looking at a classical or a modern piece , budde added - which may make them observe the objects more closely . unveiling art the exhibition asks the visitors to resist the temptation to compartmentalize islamic and european art . " i have never liked tags , " said palestinian-born artist maliheh afnan .
" i happen to be a woman , i happen to be an artist and i happen to be from the middle east .
there is all this talk nowadays about the veil and i thought about what we are hiding from within .
i think i prefer to deal with a person who veils their face and not themselves .
i think it is easier to deal with . " afnan has presented six works of calligraphy - a tradition she said is often connected to poetry as well as the koran .
even when using a very decorative script , religious texts or poetry always had to be readable .
afnan , however , has broken with this tradition .
she said her work is about the idea of writing itself , and is never actually readable . " i come from an ancient part of the world , so my work never looks fresh .
it looks weathered by time .
it is about the passage of time and about the ageing process , " said afnan . bildunterschrift : chant avedissian 's " the arab nation , " 2008 one of the exhibition 's strongest rooms , face and effaced face , is a play on the concept and idea of the veil .

while not criticizing his still-powerful predecessor , vladimir putin , medvedev recommended several breaks from putin 's legacy . while medvedvev pushed for reforms that would transform russia into a modern , democratic and economically diverse nation , he was careful to emphasize that the stability of the state remained the first priority .
" in the 21st century , our country again requires modernization in all areas , and this will be the first time in our history when modernization will be based on the values and institutions of democracy , " he told an audience of about 1,000 political leaders in the kremlin 's ornate st. george hall .
he warned , however , that " any attempts to rock the boat , destabilize the government and rend society under slogans of democracy will be stopped . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's dependence on exports of raw materials must end , medvedev said with vladimir putin , the country 's current prime minister , sitting in the front row , the speech was closely watched for signs medvedev was moving away from the governing philosophy of his predecessor .
while forbes lists putin third on its list of the world 's most powerful people , medvedev is only ranked 43rd .
medvedev also pushed for an end to the paternalism that characterized the soviet union .
" instead of an archaic society in which leaders make all the decisions and rules , a society of intelligent , free and responsible people will emerge , " he said .
his proposals included consolidating russia 's 11 time zones , moving away from a dependence on natural resources such as oil and gas , and reducing the state role in the economy .
he criticized the government-run corporations that saw a resurgence under putin , saying such companies " have no future . "
he added that " inefficient companies must be liquidated . "
competitiveness in the russian economy is " shamefully low , " he said. hf / afp / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with important policy decisions on issues such as afghanistan waiting , barack obama is taking a week out of his tight schedule to visit east and southeast asia .
on friday , he 'll begin in tokyo and continue his tour in singapore , shanghai , beijing and seoul .
at the weekend , he 'll also attend two summits with leaders from all over the region . president obama , that 's what his advisers like to emphasize , has a special relationship with the asia-pacific region , having been born in hawaii and having spent his childhood and youth there as well as in indonesia .
maybe this will turn out to be useful in his bid to re-engage with a continent that has felt neglected by america to some extent .
it is a common perception in asia that the chinese footprint has become larger over the last decade , while american influence has been on the wane .
jeffrey bader of the us national security council explains : " during the period of asia 's emergence , the us has been substantially occupied with various fronts in the war on terror . "
engaging myanmar helps with asean now america is keen to show that it is back , and particularly in southeast asia .
on the sidelines of the asia-pacific economic cooperation or apec summit in singapore at the weekend , obama is set to hold the first ever summit meeting of a us president with leaders of the ten asean countries .
these include the junta of the internationally isolated myanmar .
prime minister general thein sein is expected in singapore , and as secretary of state hillary clinton has said , an opportunity for him to talk with her or even obama might well arise .
this would have been unthinkable under the previous bush administration .
robert sutter , an expert on asia at georgetown university in washington says : " now the obama administration has a more flexible approach , which allows a free interaction with all the leaders of the asean members , and that 's very helpful in the administration 's approach to dealing with the entire region ! "
controversial military presence obama will begin his political meetings in tokyo on friday .
in japan , he will have to address concerns within the newly elected hatoyama government about the us troops stationed on the island of okinawa .
obama 's top asia aide jeffrey bader says , " populations in our key allies in northeast asia support the alliances , but they want more equal partnerships with a lighter us military footprint .
that is why we are reconfiguring our presence in japan and south korea . "
even if major changes in troop deployment are expected neither in japan nor in south korea , the obama administration has been showing a new readiness to listen to the views of its allies - also with regard to north korea , an area where both japan and south korea felt out of the loop repeatedly during the last years .
jeffrey bader says the obama administration has taken a different approach here as well : " from day one , we have been scrupulous about building consensus with our allies on north korea policy , genuinely soliciting their views , sitting down with them before we made a decision , not just afterwards , and never making a move without thorough discussions . "
before returning home from south korea next week , obama will also visit china on possibly the most challenging leg of his asia trip .

the focus is likely to be on trade and security issues with the us keen to boost its influence in the region . barack obama kicked off his first trip to asia as us president on friday , holding talks with japanese prime minister yukio hatoyama .
both were keen to stress their cooperation on a wide range of issues including nuclear non-proliferation and efforts to tackle climate change .
japan is one of america 's oldest allies in east asia , and obama highlighted that the alliance with japan was a " foundation " for peace and prosperity in the region .
nevertheless the newly elected democratic party does n't appear to be as supportive of a strong us-japan alliance , and has called for a smaller us military " footprint " on japanese soil . obama is due to give a major speech in tokyo on saturday outlining his ideas for america 's new role in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands demonstrated against a us military base on the japanese island of okinawa the week-long tour , which also includes stops in singapore , beijing and seoul , is intended to lay the groundwork for future cooperation , according to administration officials and analysts , and it marks a notable shift in us involvement in the region , where chinese influence has grown considerably in recent years .
" if you do not hold your ground in the pacific , you can not be a world leader , " remarked singapore 's former prime minister lee kuan yew in washington last week .
obama 's predecessor , george w. bush , was often perceived as ignoring asia 's economic growth - much to the chagrin of officials there .
now , obama will seek to assure the region of continued us engagement , but analysts say relations have grown more complex in wake of asia 's economic transformation .
indeed , just days after world leaders celebrated the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , which was widely interpreted as the triumph of western ideas , obama 's asia visit will highlight just how much has changed in two decades .
" china , especially during the past two years , -lsb- has -rsb- emerged as a global economic powerhouse , " cheng li , an expert on us-china relations at the brookings institution in washington , told deutsche welle .

analysts say they do n't expect any concrete achievements from the trip on any of the major issues - trade , non-nuclear proliferation , iran , afghanistan , north korea , and climate change - but asian leaders are said to be excited about renewed us interest in the region .

guttenberg was on his maiden visit to the country , where over 4,300 german troops are deployed . “ the karzai government has to fulfil certain conditions , " he asserted , adding that " we must see successes . " guttenberg , who assumed his new role as defense minister just over two weeks ago , had a busy schedule of meetings with president karzai , top nato commander gen. stanley mcchrystal , afghan defense minister abdul rahim wardak , the german ambassador to afghanistan , members of the eu police mission -lrb- eupol -rrb- , as well as the heads of german aid agencies and non-governmental organizations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tanks on maneuvers in mazar-i-sharif guttenberg also traveled to mazar-i-sharif , where some of the german troop contingent is stationed .
the minister reiterated recent comments in which he said that german soldiers were " at war " in the region .
his predecessor , franz josef jung , had always been careful to avoid that term . guttenberg said , however , that it was important to clearly explain to the troops and to the people at home what was going on in afghanistan . troops appreciate minister 's clear words his comments were welcomed by troops , with one of them saying that they " were exposed to danger every day and therefore it is appreciated when things are called by name . " guttenberg also made clear that he approved of the increased us elite troop activity in the region around kunduz where german troops were also deployed .
their presence had brought additional security and the coordination was good , he said . the defense minister is scheduled to fly to kunduz on friday to visit german reconstruction teams which are facing a growing taliban insurgency in their area . after his meeting with karzai , guttenberg said the topics discussed had included the widespread corruption in the country and the style of governance . guttenberg is the latest in a series of foreign ministers and world leaders who have publicly pressured karzai , coupling financial and military support to his willingness to battle corruption and tackle reforms . karzai is to be sworn in on november 19 for another five-year term , but under the increased scrutiny of the international community . large-scale fraud that marred the august 20 presidential election highlighted the scale of corruption in afghanistan 's government and has led to condemnation of karzai ’ s administration and demands that he tackle graft . change of strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 4,000 troops deployed in afghanistan guttenberg surprised many in germany soon after he assumed his new role as defense minister when he described germany 's engagement in afghanistan as a " combat operation . "
he told the mass-circulation bild newspaper that there was a " war " in afghanistan . guttenberg 's visit comes at a time of intensifying debate in germany over the bundeswehr mission in afghanistan , with berlin 's deployment of troops to the hindu kush region increasingly unpopular at home . it also follows news that a nato probe into a september airstrike that killed dozens of afghan civilians showed that the german commander who ordered it broke military rules of engagement the september 4 strike on fuel trucks in the northeastern kunduz province was the most deadly operation involving german troops since world war ii .
the attack was ordered by german colonel georg klein and carried out by a us fighter jet .
german federal prosecutors are set to look into the incident , after a nato report condemned the airstrike . the german army has backed klein 's decision , saying he acted out of concern for german troops , while guttenberg described the strike as " appropriate in military terms . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg heads the defense ministry at a time when the afghan mission is unpopular call for clear goals for nato ahead of his afghan trip , the german defense minister called for an international conference on afghanistan to set what he called " clear goals " for the nato-led alliance 's deployment there .
the comments come as us president barack obama weighs his country 's strategy for the afghan conflict , after tainted elections cast nato 's support of president hamid karzai into doubt .
" if we should have to realign our objectives after such a conference , then we would also have to think about our own capabilities there , " guttenberg said .
the german parliament is set to debate the renewal of the army 's afghanistan mandate before mid-december .
any increase of german troop levels that may be requested by the us when it has decided on its own strategy is bound to be highly controversial , given the public perception of the bundeswehr 's engagement there .
guttenberg also said : " we must not be shy about using the word exit strategy . " gb / rb / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 12.11.2009 top goalkeeper 's suicide exposes lonely , complex world of players with problems großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enke hid his depression despite help being at hand robert enke 's suicide has prompted many people to ask whether more could have been done to help .
but the complex nature of the soccer community , and the problems that go with it , make finding answers much more difficult . attempts to understand what led german goalkeeper robert enke to take his own life may never get to the core of the torment he was suffering .
some would even argue that it ’ s better not to try - and let the hanover soccer star rest in peace . it has become clear that enke 's psyche was damaged by intense personal tragedy , with the death of his baby daughter from a congenital heart problem three years ago , and that he had been battling depression for years , but what was truly going on inside his head will never be revealed . however , a tragic loss like this can also prompt some potentially constructive questions about whether he - or others who share his plight - have had enough access to help and support within the sport 's structure . many sports psychologists will say , though , that enke 's death must be seen in the wider context of suicide .
while enke worked in an arena with its own particular stresses and strains , suicide is the leading cause of death among young men . some argue that instead of focusing on the pressures that soccer may have heaped onto him , it might be worth noting that enke actually had better access to support , community , and care – through his teammates , club and international federation – than many other sufferers of depression could ever hope to have . but peter kay , the ceo of sporting chance , a uk-based independent clinic for athletes with addictions and psychological problems , believes that while clubs have made progress in providing support in recent years , fear of exposure keeps many players from talking about their problems . too tough to open up bildunterschrift : enke feared revealing the depth of his depression could damage his career " there has been a real change in clubs over the last five years where the player has started to be seen more as a human being with human problems , " kay told deutsche welle .
" as a result , the clubs have brought in their own psychologists .
but what the players are willing to share is limited by the fear that the psychologists are going to report back to the manager ; they fear that their condition will be made known to the club .
one player who recently came to sporting chance , with the knowledge of his club , had his contract torn up by the manager who said he was a weak link and that he didn ’ t want that in the club .
this is the fear the players have . " while senseless and tragic to all , enke 's death may also confuse many .
some outside the world of soccer will question how anyone with the adoration of thousands , the financial security the game provides and the self-worth that comes from reaching the pinnacle of any sport , could ever become depressed . for the fans who fill the world ’ s stadia , those players on the pitch in front of them are living the dream .
however , those same factors can also contribute to a player 's fragile state of mind . " players live in a total fantasy world , cocooned by the clubs from reality , " kay said .
" while the clubs and soccer in general are not to blame , they are culpable .
from the age of eight and nine in some cases , young players are given everything which the club hopes will make them into a star .
there are few top players who can have a normal life – they 're celebrities now – and they have never had to live in the real world .
what is hard is when they can not equate their image in a magazine with how they truly feel inside .
they see this image of this star but inside they have self-doubts and low self-esteem .
this can be very damaging . " insecurity over first team chances , career bildunterschrift : enke , once tipped to be germany 's no.1 , had lost his secure grip on that place through illness sport psychologists are well aware of the particular pressures that athletes have to contend with .
enke 's career was dominated by the extreme highs and lows that come with every life spent in the sporting arena .
he had to deal with the constant threat of injury , the pressure to perform , and – as he publicly admitted – the threat of being replaced by a younger , better player .
facing these pressures in a career that could so easily end in a split-second collision , enke found out that the dream was always perilously close to turning into a nightmare . " top players live with the constant fear of being dropped or replaced , " said kay .
" they get their self-esteem from playing in the first team , from scoring goals or contributing to the team 's success .
you take that away from them and the problems multiply .
if a player of 32- or 33-years of age is struggling to keep his emotions and problems in check while also worrying about his career , the pressure can be overwhelming . " stigma in macho world of soccer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teammates are n't always mates enke feared that he could eventually be usurped as a goalkeeper but also that any revelation of his depression could lead to his adopted daughter leila being removed from his care .
while support structures may have been there for him , it is likely that he felt that he could n't admit that something was wrong with him for fear of what might happen . " there 's a terrific stigma in soccer , as in society , that if you have mental health issues or suffer from depression , then you ’ re seen as weak , " said kay .
" this is exacerbated in the macho world of soccer which , contrary to popular opinion , is a very lonely and insular place .
these players do n't all socialize together ; they do n't have dinner together every night , they 're not all pals , it 's not all tight-knit at the clubs .
it 's a highly competitive world where it 's every man for himself .
players wo n't share problems because they fear they will be judged and that their ' weakness ' will be used against them .
so , as is the nature of depression , players will keep their feelings inside and will tell themselves they 'll get through it .
often they wo n't , not without help . " author : nick amies editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

analysts say they do n't expect any concrete achievements from the trip on any of the major issues - trade , non-nuclear proliferation , iran , afghanistan , north korea , and climate change - but asian leaders are said to be excited about renewed us interest in the region .

but the complex nature of the soccer community , and the problems that go with it , make finding answers much more difficult . attempts to understand what led german goalkeeper robert enke to take his own life may never get to the core of the torment he was suffering .
some would even argue that it ’ s better not to try - and let the hanover soccer star rest in peace . it has become clear that enke 's psyche was damaged by intense personal tragedy , with the death of his baby daughter from a congenital heart problem three years ago , and that he had been battling depression for years , but what was truly going on inside his head will never be revealed . however , a tragic loss like this can also prompt some potentially constructive questions about whether he - or others who share his plight - have had enough access to help and support within the sport 's structure . many sports psychologists will say , though , that enke 's death must be seen in the wider context of suicide .
while enke worked in an arena with its own particular stresses and strains , suicide is the leading cause of death among young men . some argue that instead of focusing on the pressures that soccer may have heaped onto him , it might be worth noting that enke actually had better access to support , community , and care – through his teammates , club and international federation – than many other sufferers of depression could ever hope to have . but peter kay , the ceo of sporting chance , a uk-based independent clinic for athletes with addictions and psychological problems , believes that while clubs have made progress in providing support in recent years , fear of exposure keeps many players from talking about their problems . too tough to open up bildunterschrift : enke feared revealing the depth of his depression could damage his career " there has been a real change in clubs over the last five years where the player has started to be seen more as a human being with human problems , " kay told deutsche welle .
" as a result , the clubs have brought in their own psychologists .
but what the players are willing to share is limited by the fear that the psychologists are going to report back to the manager ; they fear that their condition will be made known to the club .
one player who recently came to sporting chance , with the knowledge of his club , had his contract torn up by the manager who said he was a weak link and that he didn ’ t want that in the club .
this is the fear the players have . " while senseless and tragic to all , enke 's death may also confuse many .
some outside the world of soccer will question how anyone with the adoration of thousands , the financial security the game provides and the self-worth that comes from reaching the pinnacle of any sport , could ever become depressed . for the fans who fill the world ’ s stadia , those players on the pitch in front of them are living the dream .
however , those same factors can also contribute to a player 's fragile state of mind . " players live in a total fantasy world , cocooned by the clubs from reality , " kay said .
" while the clubs and soccer in general are not to blame , they are culpable .

he had to deal with the constant threat of injury , the pressure to perform , and – as he publicly admitted – the threat of being replaced by a younger , better player .

the decision will now pass to the european court of justice . in 2006 , the patent court partially rescinded a 1999 patent for the scientist 's method of creating nerve cells from embryonic stem cells . during the hearing on thursday , november 12 , the bgh 's presiding judge peter meier-beck pointed out that bruestle 's research methods did not break german law . however , the bgh will now leave it to the european court to provide the legal parameters on two key issues : the definition of a human embryo and whether every professional use of embryos that is consistent with the 1999 patent counts as “ industrial or commercial use ” of embryos . the german federal patent court ruled to partially reverse the 1999 patent after a challenge from the environmental activist group greenpeace , which has welcomed the move to provide clearer legal guidelines regarding embryos . the court said that anything culled from embryonic stem cells could not be patented , as it necessarily involved the destruction of human embryos . ethical minefield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver bruestle is one of germany 's leading stem cell researchers research on embryonic stem cells is allowed in germany , though the production of stem cell lines is banned .
scientists are only allowed access to lines imported before may 2007 . if the earlier court 's ruling is upheld , this would mean that german embryonic stem cell research could continue , but would not be protected by patents . " for german scientists , this means that their inventions could be picked up by foreign firms and , at the end of the day , also be used in germany , " bruestle , professor of reconstructive neurobiology at bonn university , told the german news magazine spiegel . he described as " bizarre " the fact that his research is approved and funded by the state , and that he even has to prove that he is making an effort to apply for patent protection .
" however , if i get my results patented , that is regarded as immoral . " the scientist wants to use his procedure to help find cures for diseases such as alzheimer 's and multiple sclerosis . concern about cloning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace says this will pave the way for commercial human cloning greenpeace , however , is concerned that the patenting of such research could lead to an " embryo industry . " the organization said that it is less concerned with the issue of stem cells , but with the commercialization of the human body .
greenpeace would like to legally clarify whether embryos are commercial goods . greenpeace patent expert christoph then told epd news agency that his organization was not concerned about the value of an invention , but its socio-economic effects . jg / gw / epd / dpa editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 12.11.2009 obama to outline new us role on east asia tour großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this will be obama 's first visit to asia as president obama is preparing to outline a new us role for asia as part of a week-long tour .
the focus is likely to be on trade and security issues with the us keen to boost its influence in the region . barack obama kicked off his first trip to asia as us president on friday , holding talks with japanese prime minister yukio hatoyama .
both were keen to stress their cooperation on a wide range of issues including nuclear non-proliferation and efforts to tackle climate change .
japan is one of america 's oldest allies in east asia , and obama highlighted that the alliance with japan was a " foundation " for peace and prosperity in the region .
nevertheless the newly elected democratic party does n't appear to be as supportive of a strong us-japan alliance , and has called for a smaller us military " footprint " on japanese soil . obama is due to give a major speech in tokyo on saturday outlining his ideas for america 's new role in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands demonstrated against a us military base on the japanese island of okinawa the week-long tour , which also includes stops in singapore , beijing and seoul , is intended to lay the groundwork for future cooperation , according to administration officials and analysts , and it marks a notable shift in us involvement in the region , where chinese influence has grown considerably in recent years .
" if you do not hold your ground in the pacific , you can not be a world leader , " remarked singapore 's former prime minister lee kuan yew in washington last week .
obama 's predecessor , george w. bush , was often perceived as ignoring asia 's economic growth - much to the chagrin of officials there .
now , obama will seek to assure the region of continued us engagement , but analysts say relations have grown more complex in wake of asia 's economic transformation .
indeed , just days after world leaders celebrated the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , which was widely interpreted as the triumph of western ideas , obama 's asia visit will highlight just how much has changed in two decades .
" china , especially during the past two years , -lsb- has -rsb- emerged as a global economic powerhouse , " cheng li , an expert on us-china relations at the brookings institution in washington , told deutsche welle .
" and it really came as a big surprise , although many china analysts had predicted china 's rise . " " the period -lsb- in which -rsb- china is a student lectured by the west is coming to an end , " he added . china poses new challenges obama called china " a vital partner , as well as a competitor " ahead of his departure , and his stops in beijing and shanghai are perhaps the most crucial legs of his tour .
china is america 's second largest trading partner - and its largest creditor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says he will meet the dalai lama after his china trip there have been several indicators ahead of obama 's visit that point to a power shift in us-china relations .
" a year ago , hillary clinton , during the campaign , argued that the united states should boycott our olympics , but now she 's become a spokesperson for the shanghai expo - she visited the shanghai expo site - so that tells you how dramatic change has been , " said cheng li . furthermore , obama declined to meet with the dalai lama last month during his trip to washington , making him the first president since 1991 to do so . recently , the us administration also backed the replacement of the g-8 group of wealthy industrialized nations with the g-20 , which includes china , to converge on matters of the global economy .
but francois godement , an east asia expert at the european council on foreign relations , believes the hype about asia 's rise and america 's waning influence is overstated .
" i see us popularity increasing , not decreasing , and that 's the obama factor as you look at all of the opinion polls throughout asia - it 's a big change from a year ago , " godement told deutsche welle .
aside from economic matters , the us sees chinese cooperation as essential on two key issues : containing the nuclear ambitions of both north korea and iran , and negotiating a deal on carbon emissions caps at the upcoming climate summit in copenhagen .
mending strained relations in tough economic times in singapore , obama will participate in the leaders summit of the asia-pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- , where the aim will be to strengthen us ties with countries that form the asssociation of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- .
obama has agreed to engage with burma , opening the door for talks with asean leaders who had previously clashed with former president bush over the issue .
but the financial crisis will undoubtedly complicate obama 's agenda .
at a time when the us seeks to expand its influence in asia , obama would be hard-pressed to convince congress to support any new free-trade agreements .
many americans feel threatened by asia 's rise and the impact it will have on their jobs , especially during a period of record high unemployment .

the for-profit venture between the otto group , a mail-order empire that does business in 20 countries with over 10 billion euros in annual sales last year , and the grameen bank , a microfinance lender , is intended to " give poor people in bangladesh the opportunity to free themselves from poverty , " said the statement .
" poor people are n't asking for charity because charity is n't a solution for poverty , " said yunus at a press event in otto 's home base of hamburg on wednesday .
" they want to work in order to earn their livelihood . "
the otto group is providing an interest-free loan of approximately two million euros to finance the factory 's construction and expects the loan to be repaid from the venture 's profits over a 10 to 15 year period .
for the profit of the workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nobel prize is not the only honor yunis has collected although the factory will operate on a for-profit basis , the first for-profit undertaking in grameen 's history , the profits will flow to a foundation whose mission will be to improve the living conditions of factory employees and their families and communities .
otto group chairman michael otto said the project should serve as a " model for textile production in bangladesh and similar factories in the rest of the world . "
yunus , an economist by training , began experimenting with small loans to help the very poorest members of society in the mid-1970s after his country had been devastated by natural disasters and a war of independence from pakistan .
he discovered very quickly that very small sums of money could have a transformative effect on the lives of the poor and that they lacked almost any access to affordable credit .
that insight led to the formation of a lending program which eventually became the grameen bank , which has lent over $ 8.4 billion -lrb- 5.6 billion euros -rrb- since its inception - with nearly 98 percent of the loans repaid , according to the bank .
about 97 percent of the borrowers are women , and part of the bank 's mission is to help empower women in bangladesh 's traditionally male-dominated society .
the bank 's success has led to imitators in over 40 countries worldwide , and in 2006 yunus was awarded the nobel peace prize for " efforts to create social and economic development from below .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 12.11.2009 obama to outline new us role on east asia tour großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this will be obama 's first visit to asia as president obama is preparing to outline a new us role for asia as part of a week-long tour .
the focus is likely to be on trade and security issues with the us keen to boost its influence in the region . barack obama kicked off his first trip to asia as us president on friday , holding talks with japanese prime minister yukio hatoyama .
both were keen to stress their cooperation on a wide range of issues including nuclear non-proliferation and efforts to tackle climate change .
japan is one of america 's oldest allies in east asia , and obama highlighted that the alliance with japan was a " foundation " for peace and prosperity in the region .
nevertheless the newly elected democratic party does n't appear to be as supportive of a strong us-japan alliance , and has called for a smaller us military " footprint " on japanese soil . obama is due to give a major speech in tokyo on saturday outlining his ideas for america 's new role in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands demonstrated against a us military base on the japanese island of okinawa the week-long tour , which also includes stops in singapore , beijing and seoul , is intended to lay the groundwork for future cooperation , according to administration officials and analysts , and it marks a notable shift in us involvement in the region , where chinese influence has grown considerably in recent years .
" if you do not hold your ground in the pacific , you can not be a world leader , " remarked singapore 's former prime minister lee kuan yew in washington last week .
obama 's predecessor , george w. bush , was often perceived as ignoring asia 's economic growth - much to the chagrin of officials there .
now , obama will seek to assure the region of continued us engagement , but analysts say relations have grown more complex in wake of asia 's economic transformation .
indeed , just days after world leaders celebrated the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , which was widely interpreted as the triumph of western ideas , obama 's asia visit will highlight just how much has changed in two decades .
" china , especially during the past two years , -lsb- has -rsb- emerged as a global economic powerhouse , " cheng li , an expert on us-china relations at the brookings institution in washington , told deutsche welle .
" and it really came as a big surprise , although many china analysts had predicted china 's rise . " " the period -lsb- in which -rsb- china is a student lectured by the west is coming to an end , " he added . china poses new challenges obama called china " a vital partner , as well as a competitor " ahead of his departure , and his stops in beijing and shanghai are perhaps the most crucial legs of his tour .
china is america 's second largest trading partner - and its largest creditor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says he will meet the dalai lama after his china trip there have been several indicators ahead of obama 's visit that point to a power shift in us-china relations .
" a year ago , hillary clinton , during the campaign , argued that the united states should boycott our olympics , but now she 's become a spokesperson for the shanghai expo - she visited the shanghai expo site - so that tells you how dramatic change has been , " said cheng li . furthermore , obama declined to meet with the dalai lama last month during his trip to washington , making him the first president since 1991 to do so . recently , the us administration also backed the replacement of the g-8 group of wealthy industrialized nations with the g-20 , which includes china , to converge on matters of the global economy .
but francois godement , an east asia expert at the european council on foreign relations , believes the hype about asia 's rise and america 's waning influence is overstated .
" i see us popularity increasing , not decreasing , and that 's the obama factor as you look at all of the opinion polls throughout asia - it 's a big change from a year ago , " godement told deutsche welle .
aside from economic matters , the us sees chinese cooperation as essential on two key issues : containing the nuclear ambitions of both north korea and iran , and negotiating a deal on carbon emissions caps at the upcoming climate summit in copenhagen .
mending strained relations in tough economic times in singapore , obama will participate in the leaders summit of the asia-pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- , where the aim will be to strengthen us ties with countries that form the asssociation of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- .
obama has agreed to engage with burma , opening the door for talks with asean leaders who had previously clashed with former president bush over the issue .
but the financial crisis will undoubtedly complicate obama 's agenda .
at a time when the us seeks to expand its influence in asia , obama would be hard-pressed to convince congress to support any new free-trade agreements .
many americans feel threatened by asia 's rise and the impact it will have on their jobs , especially during a period of record high unemployment .
analysts say they do n't expect any concrete achievements from the trip on any of the major issues - trade , non-nuclear proliferation , iran , afghanistan , north korea , and climate change - but asian leaders are said to be excited about renewed us interest in the region .

the works are meant to be taken at face value , without any political or religious overtones .
and stereotypes are to be left at the door . in the newest exhibition at the martin gropius bau in berlin , visitors are asked to take a fresh look at islamic culture . " it is now very common to speak of islamic culture in a way that reduces it , whether it is violence or a patriarchal culture or the veil , " said the exhibition 's head curator almut bruckstein coruh , who came from jerusalem to berlin to explore her own german-jewish background .
" this exhibition tries to undo these very strict and rude and basically violent boundaries created by this form of public discourse . " the exhibition is titled " taswir , " which , in arabic , persian and ottoman turkish means roughly " portrayal , likeness , drawing , or photograph . "
despite popular misconceptions , images are not absent from islamic tradition , bruckstein told deutsche welle .
the attitude toward images in islamic culture is ambivalent and has varied through history , she added . bildunterschrift : abdulnasser gharem 's " the path , " 2007 to understand the exhibition that has been painstakingly assembled by bruckstein , together with classical art historian hendrik budde , it is worth considering what it is not .
the structure of the show , which incorporates over 250 works , does not have a beginning or an end .
there is no chronology , it is not political , and most specifically , said bruckstein , it is not a study of religion . a poetic arrangement the exhibition 's 18 rooms have been set up based on an idea by aby warburg , a late 19th-century art historian - a first for a european gallery .
the concept , called the mnemosyne atlas , is a way of exhibiting art based on poetic association instead of chronology or theme . in addition to works by over 50 contemporary artists , classical islamic works are on loan from important national and international libraries and museums , including the hermitage in saint petersburg , the british museum and british library in london , the bibliotheque nationale de france , the calouste gulbenkian museum in lisbon and the museum of islamic art in berlin 's pergamon museum . " the mixing of classical and contemporary objects is absolutely new for me , " said budde .
" of course it was a struggle .
ms bruckstein was fighting for her contemporary works and i was begging , please do n't overwhelm my mostly - let 's face it - tiny classical objects .
but there are many rooms i am delighted by and the classical objects have , in fact , been heightened by their juxtaposition with the contemporary . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maliheh afnan 's " veiled minds , " 2006 not least of the classical artefacts assembled by classicist hendrik budde is a set of three painted korans , including an extremely rare 10th-century golden koran .
these examples were rare even in their day as korans are traditionally not decorated so as not to detract from the words . in some cases , however , visitors ca n't be sure whether they are looking at a classical or a modern piece , budde added - which may make them observe the objects more closely . unveiling art the exhibition asks the visitors to resist the temptation to compartmentalize islamic and european art . " i have never liked tags , " said palestinian-born artist maliheh afnan .
" i happen to be a woman , i happen to be an artist and i happen to be from the middle east .
there is all this talk nowadays about the veil and i thought about what we are hiding from within .
i think i prefer to deal with a person who veils their face and not themselves .
i think it is easier to deal with . " afnan has presented six works of calligraphy - a tradition she said is often connected to poetry as well as the koran .
even when using a very decorative script , religious texts or poetry always had to be readable .
afnan , however , has broken with this tradition .
she said her work is about the idea of writing itself , and is never actually readable . " i come from an ancient part of the world , so my work never looks fresh .
it looks weathered by time .
it is about the passage of time and about the ageing process , " said afnan . bildunterschrift : chant avedissian 's " the arab nation , " 2008 one of the exhibition 's strongest rooms , face and effaced face , is a play on the concept and idea of the veil .
the question here , said bruckstein , is what you see if you do n't have a regional , ethnic , or religious definition . at one end of the room is a 16th-century miniature of the prophet muhammad .
the picture shows a classically-veiled muhammad pointing at a full moon , which is traditionally a metaphor for beauty or perfection .
muhammad 's posture says : if you want to see me , look at the full moon . while the curators and artists are adamant that the show is neither about religion nor politics , this may not always be clear to the visitor .
the most recent piece in the room is a 2001 photo montage by palestinian artist taysir batniji , who was exiled from gaza and is now living in paris .
the photographs , taken black on black , depict the faces of 170 people killed by the israeli defence forces . bruckstein had to fight hard to get the art out of gaza .
she said that , even here , the focus is not on martyrdom but rather on engagement with the human face . life as a trace of absence in following with the exhibition 's method of poetic association , the show 's walls are scattered with sayings from thinkers and philosophers that define the theme or sentiment of each room .
one of them is from french philosopher jacques derrida , who said , " life must be thought of as a trace of absence . " budde has chosen a 16th-century miniature painting of the prophet muhammad 's sandals for this room .
it is part of a larger indian and persian tradition that sees footprints as the presence of someone 's absence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " khusraw watches shirin bathing , " 16th century miniature the centerpiece of the room is a four-by-four-meter well of sand .
a dial moves around the circle continuously , creating grooves with one side and rubbing them out with the other . " it is not a show about religion , " said bruckstein , " for example the question of the feet leaving a trace of absence is not a religious question ; it is a question of leaving a trace .
the three artists in the room are having a conversation . " budde said that this kind of exhibition is rare , since european museum-goers are more familiar with christian art . " i hope that visitors from islamic countries will be interested to see what we dared to put together , to do what ca n't be done in some arabic countries , " said budde . the exhibition runs until january 18 , 2010 . author : tanya wood editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the works are meant to be taken at face value , without any political or religious overtones .
and stereotypes are to be left at the door . in the newest exhibition at the martin gropius bau in berlin , visitors are asked to take a fresh look at islamic culture . " it is now very common to speak of islamic culture in a way that reduces it , whether it is violence or a patriarchal culture or the veil , " said the exhibition 's head curator almut bruckstein coruh , who came from jerusalem to berlin to explore her own german-jewish background .
" this exhibition tries to undo these very strict and rude and basically violent boundaries created by this form of public discourse . " the exhibition is titled " taswir , " which , in arabic , persian and ottoman turkish means roughly " portrayal , likeness , drawing , or photograph . "
despite popular misconceptions , images are not absent from islamic tradition , bruckstein told deutsche welle .
the attitude toward images in islamic culture is ambivalent and has varied through history , she added . bildunterschrift : abdulnasser gharem 's " the path , " 2007 to understand the exhibition that has been painstakingly assembled by bruckstein , together with classical art historian hendrik budde , it is worth considering what it is not .
the structure of the show , which incorporates over 250 works , does not have a beginning or an end .
there is no chronology , it is not political , and most specifically , said bruckstein , it is not a study of religion . a poetic arrangement the exhibition 's 18 rooms have been set up based on an idea by aby warburg , a late 19th-century art historian - a first for a european gallery .
the concept , called the mnemosyne atlas , is a way of exhibiting art based on poetic association instead of chronology or theme . in addition to works by over 50 contemporary artists , classical islamic works are on loan from important national and international libraries and museums , including the hermitage in saint petersburg , the british museum and british library in london , the bibliotheque nationale de france , the calouste gulbenkian museum in lisbon and the museum of islamic art in berlin 's pergamon museum . " the mixing of classical and contemporary objects is absolutely new for me , " said budde .
" of course it was a struggle .
ms bruckstein was fighting for her contemporary works and i was begging , please do n't overwhelm my mostly - let 's face it - tiny classical objects .
but there are many rooms i am delighted by and the classical objects have , in fact , been heightened by their juxtaposition with the contemporary . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maliheh afnan 's " veiled minds , " 2006 not least of the classical artefacts assembled by classicist hendrik budde is a set of three painted korans , including an extremely rare 10th-century golden koran .
these examples were rare even in their day as korans are traditionally not decorated so as not to detract from the words . in some cases , however , visitors ca n't be sure whether they are looking at a classical or a modern piece , budde added - which may make them observe the objects more closely . unveiling art the exhibition asks the visitors to resist the temptation to compartmentalize islamic and european art . " i have never liked tags , " said palestinian-born artist maliheh afnan .
" i happen to be a woman , i happen to be an artist and i happen to be from the middle east .
there is all this talk nowadays about the veil and i thought about what we are hiding from within .
i think i prefer to deal with a person who veils their face and not themselves .
i think it is easier to deal with . " afnan has presented six works of calligraphy - a tradition she said is often connected to poetry as well as the koran .
even when using a very decorative script , religious texts or poetry always had to be readable .
afnan , however , has broken with this tradition .
she said her work is about the idea of writing itself , and is never actually readable . " i come from an ancient part of the world , so my work never looks fresh .
it looks weathered by time .
it is about the passage of time and about the ageing process , " said afnan . bildunterschrift : chant avedissian 's " the arab nation , " 2008 one of the exhibition 's strongest rooms , face and effaced face , is a play on the concept and idea of the veil .
the question here , said bruckstein , is what you see if you do n't have a regional , ethnic , or religious definition . at one end of the room is a 16th-century miniature of the prophet muhammad .
the picture shows a classically-veiled muhammad pointing at a full moon , which is traditionally a metaphor for beauty or perfection .
muhammad 's posture says : if you want to see me , look at the full moon . while the curators and artists are adamant that the show is neither about religion nor politics , this may not always be clear to the visitor .
the most recent piece in the room is a 2001 photo montage by palestinian artist taysir batniji , who was exiled from gaza and is now living in paris .
the photographs , taken black on black , depict the faces of 170 people killed by the israeli defence forces . bruckstein had to fight hard to get the art out of gaza .
she said that , even here , the focus is not on martyrdom but rather on engagement with the human face . life as a trace of absence in following with the exhibition 's method of poetic association , the show 's walls are scattered with sayings from thinkers and philosophers that define the theme or sentiment of each room .
one of them is from french philosopher jacques derrida , who said , " life must be thought of as a trace of absence . " budde has chosen a 16th-century miniature painting of the prophet muhammad 's sandals for this room .
it is part of a larger indian and persian tradition that sees footprints as the presence of someone 's absence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " khusraw watches shirin bathing , " 16th century miniature the centerpiece of the room is a four-by-four-meter well of sand .
a dial moves around the circle continuously , creating grooves with one side and rubbing them out with the other . " it is not a show about religion , " said bruckstein , " for example the question of the feet leaving a trace of absence is not a religious question ; it is a question of leaving a trace .
the three artists in the room are having a conversation . " budde said that this kind of exhibition is rare , since european museum-goers are more familiar with christian art . " i hope that visitors from islamic countries will be interested to see what we dared to put together , to do what ca n't be done in some arabic countries , " said budde . the exhibition runs until january 18 , 2010 . author : tanya wood editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the works are meant to be taken at face value , without any political or religious overtones .
and stereotypes are to be left at the door . in the newest exhibition at the martin gropius bau in berlin , visitors are asked to take a fresh look at islamic culture . " it is now very common to speak of islamic culture in a way that reduces it , whether it is violence or a patriarchal culture or the veil , " said the exhibition 's head curator almut bruckstein coruh , who came from jerusalem to berlin to explore her own german-jewish background .
" this exhibition tries to undo these very strict and rude and basically violent boundaries created by this form of public discourse . " the exhibition is titled " taswir , " which , in arabic , persian and ottoman turkish means roughly " portrayal , likeness , drawing , or photograph . "
despite popular misconceptions , images are not absent from islamic tradition , bruckstein told deutsche welle .
the attitude toward images in islamic culture is ambivalent and has varied through history , she added . bildunterschrift : abdulnasser gharem 's " the path , " 2007 to understand the exhibition that has been painstakingly assembled by bruckstein , together with classical art historian hendrik budde , it is worth considering what it is not .
the structure of the show , which incorporates over 250 works , does not have a beginning or an end .
there is no chronology , it is not political , and most specifically , said bruckstein , it is not a study of religion . a poetic arrangement the exhibition 's 18 rooms have been set up based on an idea by aby warburg , a late 19th-century art historian - a first for a european gallery .
the concept , called the mnemosyne atlas , is a way of exhibiting art based on poetic association instead of chronology or theme . in addition to works by over 50 contemporary artists , classical islamic works are on loan from important national and international libraries and museums , including the hermitage in saint petersburg , the british museum and british library in london , the bibliotheque nationale de france , the calouste gulbenkian museum in lisbon and the museum of islamic art in berlin 's pergamon museum . " the mixing of classical and contemporary objects is absolutely new for me , " said budde .
" of course it was a struggle .
ms bruckstein was fighting for her contemporary works and i was begging , please do n't overwhelm my mostly - let 's face it - tiny classical objects .
but there are many rooms i am delighted by and the classical objects have , in fact , been heightened by their juxtaposition with the contemporary . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maliheh afnan 's " veiled minds , " 2006 not least of the classical artefacts assembled by classicist hendrik budde is a set of three painted korans , including an extremely rare 10th-century golden koran .
these examples were rare even in their day as korans are traditionally not decorated so as not to detract from the words . in some cases , however , visitors ca n't be sure whether they are looking at a classical or a modern piece , budde added - which may make them observe the objects more closely . unveiling art the exhibition asks the visitors to resist the temptation to compartmentalize islamic and european art . " i have never liked tags , " said palestinian-born artist maliheh afnan .
" i happen to be a woman , i happen to be an artist and i happen to be from the middle east .
there is all this talk nowadays about the veil and i thought about what we are hiding from within .
i think i prefer to deal with a person who veils their face and not themselves .
i think it is easier to deal with . " afnan has presented six works of calligraphy - a tradition she said is often connected to poetry as well as the koran .
even when using a very decorative script , religious texts or poetry always had to be readable .
afnan , however , has broken with this tradition .
she said her work is about the idea of writing itself , and is never actually readable . " i come from an ancient part of the world , so my work never looks fresh .
it looks weathered by time .
it is about the passage of time and about the ageing process , " said afnan . bildunterschrift : chant avedissian 's " the arab nation , " 2008 one of the exhibition 's strongest rooms , face and effaced face , is a play on the concept and idea of the veil .
the question here , said bruckstein , is what you see if you do n't have a regional , ethnic , or religious definition . at one end of the room is a 16th-century miniature of the prophet muhammad .
the picture shows a classically-veiled muhammad pointing at a full moon , which is traditionally a metaphor for beauty or perfection .
muhammad 's posture says : if you want to see me , look at the full moon . while the curators and artists are adamant that the show is neither about religion nor politics , this may not always be clear to the visitor .
the most recent piece in the room is a 2001 photo montage by palestinian artist taysir batniji , who was exiled from gaza and is now living in paris .
the photographs , taken black on black , depict the faces of 170 people killed by the israeli defence forces . bruckstein had to fight hard to get the art out of gaza .
she said that , even here , the focus is not on martyrdom but rather on engagement with the human face . life as a trace of absence in following with the exhibition 's method of poetic association , the show 's walls are scattered with sayings from thinkers and philosophers that define the theme or sentiment of each room .
one of them is from french philosopher jacques derrida , who said , " life must be thought of as a trace of absence . " budde has chosen a 16th-century miniature painting of the prophet muhammad 's sandals for this room .
it is part of a larger indian and persian tradition that sees footprints as the presence of someone 's absence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " khusraw watches shirin bathing , " 16th century miniature the centerpiece of the room is a four-by-four-meter well of sand .
a dial moves around the circle continuously , creating grooves with one side and rubbing them out with the other . " it is not a show about religion , " said bruckstein , " for example the question of the feet leaving a trace of absence is not a religious question ; it is a question of leaving a trace .
the three artists in the room are having a conversation . " budde said that this kind of exhibition is rare , since european museum-goers are more familiar with christian art . " i hope that visitors from islamic countries will be interested to see what we dared to put together , to do what ca n't be done in some arabic countries , " said budde . the exhibition runs until january 18 , 2010 . author : tanya wood editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while not criticizing his still-powerful predecessor , vladimir putin , medvedev recommended several breaks from putin 's legacy . while medvedvev pushed for reforms that would transform russia into a modern , democratic and economically diverse nation , he was careful to emphasize that the stability of the state remained the first priority .
" in the 21st century , our country again requires modernization in all areas , and this will be the first time in our history when modernization will be based on the values and institutions of democracy , " he told an audience of about 1,000 political leaders in the kremlin 's ornate st. george hall .

while forbes lists putin third on its list of the world 's most powerful people , medvedev is only ranked 43rd .
medvedev also pushed for an end to the paternalism that characterized the soviet union .
" instead of an archaic society in which leaders make all the decisions and rules , a society of intelligent , free and responsible people will emerge , " he said .
his proposals included consolidating russia 's 11 time zones , moving away from a dependence on natural resources such as oil and gas , and reducing the state role in the economy .
he criticized the government-run corporations that saw a resurgence under putin , saying such companies " have no future . "
he added that " inefficient companies must be liquidated . "

the for-profit venture between the otto group , a mail-order empire that does business in 20 countries with over 10 billion euros in annual sales last year , and the grameen bank , a microfinance lender , is intended to " give poor people in bangladesh the opportunity to free themselves from poverty , " said the statement .
" poor people are n't asking for charity because charity is n't a solution for poverty , " said yunus at a press event in otto 's home base of hamburg on wednesday .
" they want to work in order to earn their livelihood . "
the otto group is providing an interest-free loan of approximately two million euros to finance the factory 's construction and expects the loan to be repaid from the venture 's profits over a 10 to 15 year period .
for the profit of the workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nobel prize is not the only honor yunis has collected although the factory will operate on a for-profit basis , the first for-profit undertaking in grameen 's history , the profits will flow to a foundation whose mission will be to improve the living conditions of factory employees and their families and communities .
otto group chairman michael otto said the project should serve as a " model for textile production in bangladesh and similar factories in the rest of the world . "
yunus , an economist by training , began experimenting with small loans to help the very poorest members of society in the mid-1970s after his country had been devastated by natural disasters and a war of independence from pakistan .
he discovered very quickly that very small sums of money could have a transformative effect on the lives of the poor and that they lacked almost any access to affordable credit .
that insight led to the formation of a lending program which eventually became the grameen bank , which has lent over $ 8.4 billion -lrb- 5.6 billion euros -rrb- since its inception - with nearly 98 percent of the loans repaid , according to the bank .
about 97 percent of the borrowers are women , and part of the bank 's mission is to help empower women in bangladesh 's traditionally male-dominated society .
the bank 's success has led to imitators in over 40 countries worldwide , and in 2006 yunus was awarded the nobel peace prize for " efforts to create social and economic development from below .

families of the victims have demanded he pay for this negligence . local prosecutors had intended only to fine joerg k. for not locking up the gun and the ammunition used in the rampage as required by law .
but relatives of the 15 victims killed at a school and a car dealership in southwestern germany demanded a trial , saying the father had shown " gross negligence " in giving his " mentally ill " son " access to a weapon and 400 rounds of ammunition . "
now the justice ministry of the state of baden-wuerttemberg has said the state prosecutor will instruct the local prosecutor to put the father on trial .
prosecutors will argue that the father 's criminal negligence led to the homicides .
on march 11 of this year , tim k. took his father 's beretta pistol to his former school in winnenden where he killed nine students and three teachers .
he then shot and killed a gardener before commandeering a car and driving to the nearby town of wendlingen where he gunned down two other people .
when police caught up with him , he shot and killed himself .
following the killings , the families of the victims have led a movement to strengthen gun control laws in germany. hf / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 12.11.2009 opinion : europe should seize on medvedev 's calls for modernization großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his annual state of the nation address , russian president dimitry medvedev called for sweeping internal reforms .
deutsche welle 's ingo mannteufel thinks this is a golden opportunity for the eu . the russian president did not mince his words as he described the socio-economic situation in russia .
he ranted at what he called the country 's " chronic backwardness , " the " lack of economic competitiveness , " the rampant corruption and the high level of dependency on gas and oil .
and there 's no arguing with his assessment .
all the problems he listed play a major part in russia 's failure to fulfill its potential and to offer its people a modern way of life .
his appeals for change appear to be the right way forward , including the modernization and strengthening of democratic values and institutions and his pledge to fight terrorism in the north caucasus region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel however , any approval and support for his ideas should not overshadow two important questions : can medvedev achieve his ambitious aims given the extent of corruption and state-run bureaucracy , and can russia undergo an economic and technological modernization without far-reaching political reforms ?
his remarks in that respect did little to inspire confidence .
although he criticized authoritarian structures on a regional level and demanded improvements for russia 's opposition parties , there was little of substance on radical political and legal reform .
kremlin experts will have noted with interest medvedev 's calls to overhaul russia 's state-run companies , the behemoths created by his predecessor , vladimir putin .
however , it would be wrong to interpret that as a deep rift between the two men .
a closer look reveals that medvedev 's drive to modernize the country 's economy is part of the strategy pursued by putin .
medvedev can take credit for trying to give those ideas more substance and for giving them a democratic platform , thereby allowing optimists to hope whereas realists will say it 's time for action , not words .
still , medvedev 's message offers the west , and germany in particular , a promising opportunity .
for the first time russia is not using ideology or military might to define its status as a world power , instead it 's looking at whether it can offer its people modern living conditions .
this means that russia is being forced to adopt a more cooperative position towards the outside world .
as medvedev himself put it : modernization can only be achieved through integration with the global economy .
and that 's why it was no surprise that foreign policy was hardly mentioned .
medvedev said russia 's foreign policy would merely be an instrument to secure the sweeping internal reforms he has called for .
historically this would indicate a significant paradigm shift .
the european union should use this chance by defining its own aims and stating how it intends to help russia achieve modernization .

the decision will now pass to the european court of justice . in 2006 , the patent court partially rescinded a 1999 patent for the scientist 's method of creating nerve cells from embryonic stem cells . during the hearing on thursday , november 12 , the bgh 's presiding judge peter meier-beck pointed out that bruestle 's research methods did not break german law . however , the bgh will now leave it to the european court to provide the legal parameters on two key issues : the definition of a human embryo and whether every professional use of embryos that is consistent with the 1999 patent counts as “ industrial or commercial use ” of embryos . the german federal patent court ruled to partially reverse the 1999 patent after a challenge from the environmental activist group greenpeace , which has welcomed the move to provide clearer legal guidelines regarding embryos . the court said that anything culled from embryonic stem cells could not be patented , as it necessarily involved the destruction of human embryos . ethical minefield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver bruestle is one of germany 's leading stem cell researchers research on embryonic stem cells is allowed in germany , though the production of stem cell lines is banned .

" for german scientists , this means that their inventions could be picked up by foreign firms and , at the end of the day , also be used in germany , " bruestle , professor of reconstructive neurobiology at bonn university , told the german news magazine spiegel . he described as " bizarre " the fact that his research is approved and funded by the state , and that he even has to prove that he is making an effort to apply for patent protection .
" however , if i get my results patented , that is regarded as immoral .

but the complex nature of the soccer community , and the problems that go with it , make finding answers much more difficult . attempts to understand what led german goalkeeper robert enke to take his own life may never get to the core of the torment he was suffering .
some would even argue that it ’ s better not to try - and let the hanover soccer star rest in peace . it has become clear that enke 's psyche was damaged by intense personal tragedy , with the death of his baby daughter from a congenital heart problem three years ago , and that he had been battling depression for years , but what was truly going on inside his head will never be revealed . however , a tragic loss like this can also prompt some potentially constructive questions about whether he - or others who share his plight - have had enough access to help and support within the sport 's structure . many sports psychologists will say , though , that enke 's death must be seen in the wider context of suicide .
while enke worked in an arena with its own particular stresses and strains , suicide is the leading cause of death among young men . some argue that instead of focusing on the pressures that soccer may have heaped onto him , it might be worth noting that enke actually had better access to support , community , and care – through his teammates , club and international federation – than many other sufferers of depression could ever hope to have . but peter kay , the ceo of sporting chance , a uk-based independent clinic for athletes with addictions and psychological problems , believes that while clubs have made progress in providing support in recent years , fear of exposure keeps many players from talking about their problems . too tough to open up bildunterschrift : enke feared revealing the depth of his depression could damage his career " there has been a real change in clubs over the last five years where the player has started to be seen more as a human being with human problems , " kay told deutsche welle .
" as a result , the clubs have brought in their own psychologists .
but what the players are willing to share is limited by the fear that the psychologists are going to report back to the manager ; they fear that their condition will be made known to the club .
one player who recently came to sporting chance , with the knowledge of his club , had his contract torn up by the manager who said he was a weak link and that he didn ’ t want that in the club .
this is the fear the players have . " while senseless and tragic to all , enke 's death may also confuse many .
some outside the world of soccer will question how anyone with the adoration of thousands , the financial security the game provides and the self-worth that comes from reaching the pinnacle of any sport , could ever become depressed . for the fans who fill the world ’ s stadia , those players on the pitch in front of them are living the dream .
however , those same factors can also contribute to a player 's fragile state of mind . " players live in a total fantasy world , cocooned by the clubs from reality , " kay said .
" while the clubs and soccer in general are not to blame , they are culpable .
from the age of eight and nine in some cases , young players are given everything which the club hopes will make them into a star .
there are few top players who can have a normal life – they 're celebrities now – and they have never had to live in the real world .
what is hard is when they can not equate their image in a magazine with how they truly feel inside .
they see this image of this star but inside they have self-doubts and low self-esteem .
this can be very damaging . " insecurity over first team chances , career bildunterschrift : enke , once tipped to be germany 's no.1 , had lost his secure grip on that place through illness sport psychologists are well aware of the particular pressures that athletes have to contend with .
enke 's career was dominated by the extreme highs and lows that come with every life spent in the sporting arena .
he had to deal with the constant threat of injury , the pressure to perform , and – as he publicly admitted – the threat of being replaced by a younger , better player .
facing these pressures in a career that could so easily end in a split-second collision , enke found out that the dream was always perilously close to turning into a nightmare . " top players live with the constant fear of being dropped or replaced , " said kay .
" they get their self-esteem from playing in the first team , from scoring goals or contributing to the team 's success .
you take that away from them and the problems multiply .
if a player of 32- or 33-years of age is struggling to keep his emotions and problems in check while also worrying about his career , the pressure can be overwhelming . " stigma in macho world of soccer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teammates are n't always mates enke feared that he could eventually be usurped as a goalkeeper but also that any revelation of his depression could lead to his adopted daughter leila being removed from his care .
while support structures may have been there for him , it is likely that he felt that he could n't admit that something was wrong with him for fear of what might happen . " there 's a terrific stigma in soccer , as in society , that if you have mental health issues or suffer from depression , then you ’ re seen as weak , " said kay .
" this is exacerbated in the macho world of soccer which , contrary to popular opinion , is a very lonely and insular place .
these players do n't all socialize together ; they do n't have dinner together every night , they 're not all pals , it 's not all tight-knit at the clubs .
it 's a highly competitive world where it 's every man for himself .
players wo n't share problems because they fear they will be judged and that their ' weakness ' will be used against them .

but the complex nature of the soccer community , and the problems that go with it , make finding answers much more difficult . attempts to understand what led german goalkeeper robert enke to take his own life may never get to the core of the torment he was suffering .
some would even argue that it ’ s better not to try - and let the hanover soccer star rest in peace . it has become clear that enke 's psyche was damaged by intense personal tragedy , with the death of his baby daughter from a congenital heart problem three years ago , and that he had been battling depression for years , but what was truly going on inside his head will never be revealed . however , a tragic loss like this can also prompt some potentially constructive questions about whether he - or others who share his plight - have had enough access to help and support within the sport 's structure . many sports psychologists will say , though , that enke 's death must be seen in the wider context of suicide .
while enke worked in an arena with its own particular stresses and strains , suicide is the leading cause of death among young men . some argue that instead of focusing on the pressures that soccer may have heaped onto him , it might be worth noting that enke actually had better access to support , community , and care – through his teammates , club and international federation – than many other sufferers of depression could ever hope to have . but peter kay , the ceo of sporting chance , a uk-based independent clinic for athletes with addictions and psychological problems , believes that while clubs have made progress in providing support in recent years , fear of exposure keeps many players from talking about their problems . too tough to open up bildunterschrift : enke feared revealing the depth of his depression could damage his career " there has been a real change in clubs over the last five years where the player has started to be seen more as a human being with human problems , " kay told deutsche welle .
" as a result , the clubs have brought in their own psychologists .
but what the players are willing to share is limited by the fear that the psychologists are going to report back to the manager ; they fear that their condition will be made known to the club .
one player who recently came to sporting chance , with the knowledge of his club , had his contract torn up by the manager who said he was a weak link and that he didn ’ t want that in the club .
this is the fear the players have . " while senseless and tragic to all , enke 's death may also confuse many .
some outside the world of soccer will question how anyone with the adoration of thousands , the financial security the game provides and the self-worth that comes from reaching the pinnacle of any sport , could ever become depressed . for the fans who fill the world ’ s stadia , those players on the pitch in front of them are living the dream .
however , those same factors can also contribute to a player 's fragile state of mind . " players live in a total fantasy world , cocooned by the clubs from reality , " kay said .
" while the clubs and soccer in general are not to blame , they are culpable .
from the age of eight and nine in some cases , young players are given everything which the club hopes will make them into a star .
there are few top players who can have a normal life – they 're celebrities now – and they have never had to live in the real world .
what is hard is when they can not equate their image in a magazine with how they truly feel inside .
they see this image of this star but inside they have self-doubts and low self-esteem .
this can be very damaging . " insecurity over first team chances , career bildunterschrift : enke , once tipped to be germany 's no.1 , had lost his secure grip on that place through illness sport psychologists are well aware of the particular pressures that athletes have to contend with .
enke 's career was dominated by the extreme highs and lows that come with every life spent in the sporting arena .
he had to deal with the constant threat of injury , the pressure to perform , and – as he publicly admitted – the threat of being replaced by a younger , better player .
facing these pressures in a career that could so easily end in a split-second collision , enke found out that the dream was always perilously close to turning into a nightmare . " top players live with the constant fear of being dropped or replaced , " said kay .
" they get their self-esteem from playing in the first team , from scoring goals or contributing to the team 's success .
you take that away from them and the problems multiply .
if a player of 32- or 33-years of age is struggling to keep his emotions and problems in check while also worrying about his career , the pressure can be overwhelming . " stigma in macho world of soccer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teammates are n't always mates enke feared that he could eventually be usurped as a goalkeeper but also that any revelation of his depression could lead to his adopted daughter leila being removed from his care .
while support structures may have been there for him , it is likely that he felt that he could n't admit that something was wrong with him for fear of what might happen . " there 's a terrific stigma in soccer , as in society , that if you have mental health issues or suffer from depression , then you ’ re seen as weak , " said kay .
" this is exacerbated in the macho world of soccer which , contrary to popular opinion , is a very lonely and insular place .
these players do n't all socialize together ; they do n't have dinner together every night , they 're not all pals , it 's not all tight-knit at the clubs .
it 's a highly competitive world where it 's every man for himself .
players wo n't share problems because they fear they will be judged and that their ' weakness ' will be used against them .
so , as is the nature of depression , players will keep their feelings inside and will tell themselves they 'll get through it .

while not criticizing his still-powerful predecessor , vladimir putin , medvedev recommended several breaks from putin 's legacy . while medvedvev pushed for reforms that would transform russia into a modern , democratic and economically diverse nation , he was careful to emphasize that the stability of the state remained the first priority .
" in the 21st century , our country again requires modernization in all areas , and this will be the first time in our history when modernization will be based on the values and institutions of democracy , " he told an audience of about 1,000 political leaders in the kremlin 's ornate st. george hall .

while forbes lists putin third on its list of the world 's most powerful people , medvedev is only ranked 43rd .
medvedev also pushed for an end to the paternalism that characterized the soviet union .
" instead of an archaic society in which leaders make all the decisions and rules , a society of intelligent , free and responsible people will emerge , " he said .
his proposals included consolidating russia 's 11 time zones , moving away from a dependence on natural resources such as oil and gas , and reducing the state role in the economy .
he criticized the government-run corporations that saw a resurgence under putin , saying such companies " have no future . "
he added that " inefficient companies must be liquidated . "

families of the victims have demanded he pay for this negligence . local prosecutors had intended only to fine joerg k. for not locking up the gun and the ammunition used in the rampage as required by law .
but relatives of the 15 victims killed at a school and a car dealership in southwestern germany demanded a trial , saying the father had shown " gross negligence " in giving his " mentally ill " son " access to a weapon and 400 rounds of ammunition . "
now the justice ministry of the state of baden-wuerttemberg has said the state prosecutor will instruct the local prosecutor to put the father on trial .
prosecutors will argue that the father 's criminal negligence led to the homicides .
on march 11 of this year , tim k. took his father 's beretta pistol to his former school in winnenden where he killed nine students and three teachers .
he then shot and killed a gardener before commandeering a car and driving to the nearby town of wendlingen where he gunned down two other people .
when police caught up with him , he shot and killed himself .

while not criticizing his still-powerful predecessor , vladimir putin , medvedev recommended several breaks from putin 's legacy . while medvedvev pushed for reforms that would transform russia into a modern , democratic and economically diverse nation , he was careful to emphasize that the stability of the state remained the first priority .
" in the 21st century , our country again requires modernization in all areas , and this will be the first time in our history when modernization will be based on the values and institutions of democracy , " he told an audience of about 1,000 political leaders in the kremlin 's ornate st. george hall .
he warned , however , that " any attempts to rock the boat , destabilize the government and rend society under slogans of democracy will be stopped . "

while forbes lists putin third on its list of the world 's most powerful people , medvedev is only ranked 43rd .
medvedev also pushed for an end to the paternalism that characterized the soviet union .
" instead of an archaic society in which leaders make all the decisions and rules , a society of intelligent , free and responsible people will emerge , " he said .
his proposals included consolidating russia 's 11 time zones , moving away from a dependence on natural resources such as oil and gas , and reducing the state role in the economy .
he criticized the government-run corporations that saw a resurgence under putin , saying such companies " have no future . "
he added that " inefficient companies must be liquidated . "
competitiveness in the russian economy is " shamefully low , " he said. hf / afp / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while not criticizing his still-powerful predecessor , vladimir putin , medvedev recommended several breaks from putin 's legacy . while medvedvev pushed for reforms that would transform russia into a modern , democratic and economically diverse nation , he was careful to emphasize that the stability of the state remained the first priority .
" in the 21st century , our country again requires modernization in all areas , and this will be the first time in our history when modernization will be based on the values and institutions of democracy , " he told an audience of about 1,000 political leaders in the kremlin 's ornate st. george hall .

but a german agency has indexed rammstein 's new album , preventing young people from buying it . people younger than 18 can no longer buy rammstein 's new album " love is there for everyone , " according to a decision released this week by the federal department for media harmful to young persons .
the department cited the popular german band 's use of explicit , sado-masochistic imagery and texts as reasons for placing their album on the index .
the decision also prevents buyers from purchasing the album by mail and prohibits public advertisements for the cd .
members of rammstein , known both in germany and abroad for their heavy-metal music , expressed frustration with the department 's decision and charged it with having a " bourgeois understanding of art . "
a more conservative stance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images from rammstein 's new album have caused controversy some have also questioned whether indexing the album represents a public relations stunt that emphasizes the new german government ’ s more conservative politics .
ursula von der leyen , head of the federal ministry of familiy affairs and member of the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , directed the federal department for media harmful to young persons to come to a decision on the album .
the department issues its independent assessment of questionable media content presented to it by groups like schools , the police and youth organizations .
the department has not indexed an entire album from a famous german band since 1987 's " debil " by die aerzte .
however , the band 's themes do not seem to have prevented " love is there for everyone " from being a hit .
over 300,000 albums have been sold , and the cd continues to top german album charts. gw / dpa / afp editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

families of the victims have demanded he pay for this negligence . local prosecutors had intended only to fine joerg k. for not locking up the gun and the ammunition used in the rampage as required by law .
but relatives of the 15 victims killed at a school and a car dealership in southwestern germany demanded a trial , saying the father had shown " gross negligence " in giving his " mentally ill " son " access to a weapon and 400 rounds of ammunition . "
now the justice ministry of the state of baden-wuerttemberg has said the state prosecutor will instruct the local prosecutor to put the father on trial .
prosecutors will argue that the father 's criminal negligence led to the homicides .
on march 11 of this year , tim k. took his father 's beretta pistol to his former school in winnenden where he killed nine students and three teachers .
he then shot and killed a gardener before commandeering a car and driving to the nearby town of wendlingen where he gunned down two other people .
when police caught up with him , he shot and killed himself .
following the killings , the families of the victims have led a movement to strengthen gun control laws in germany. hf / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision will now pass to the european court of justice . in 2006 , the patent court partially rescinded a 1999 patent for the scientist 's method of creating nerve cells from embryonic stem cells . during the hearing on thursday , november 12 , the bgh 's presiding judge peter meier-beck pointed out that bruestle 's research methods did not break german law . however , the bgh will now leave it to the european court to provide the legal parameters on two key issues : the definition of a human embryo and whether every professional use of embryos that is consistent with the 1999 patent counts as “ industrial or commercial use ” of embryos . the german federal patent court ruled to partially reverse the 1999 patent after a challenge from the environmental activist group greenpeace , which has welcomed the move to provide clearer legal guidelines regarding embryos . the court said that anything culled from embryonic stem cells could not be patented , as it necessarily involved the destruction of human embryos . ethical minefield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver bruestle is one of germany 's leading stem cell researchers research on embryonic stem cells is allowed in germany , though the production of stem cell lines is banned .
scientists are only allowed access to lines imported before may 2007 . if the earlier court 's ruling is upheld , this would mean that german embryonic stem cell research could continue , but would not be protected by patents . " for german scientists , this means that their inventions could be picked up by foreign firms and , at the end of the day , also be used in germany , " bruestle , professor of reconstructive neurobiology at bonn university , told the german news magazine spiegel . he described as " bizarre " the fact that his research is approved and funded by the state , and that he even has to prove that he is making an effort to apply for patent protection .
" however , if i get my results patented , that is regarded as immoral . " the scientist wants to use his procedure to help find cures for diseases such as alzheimer 's and multiple sclerosis . concern about cloning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace says this will pave the way for commercial human cloning greenpeace , however , is concerned that the patenting of such research could lead to an " embryo industry .

some would even argue that it ’ s better not to try - and let the hanover soccer star rest in peace . it has become clear that enke 's psyche was damaged by intense personal tragedy , with the death of his baby daughter from a congenital heart problem three years ago , and that he had been battling depression for years , but what was truly going on inside his head will never be revealed . however , a tragic loss like this can also prompt some potentially constructive questions about whether he - or others who share his plight - have had enough access to help and support within the sport 's structure . many sports psychologists will say , though , that enke 's death must be seen in the wider context of suicide .
while enke worked in an arena with its own particular stresses and strains , suicide is the leading cause of death among young men . some argue that instead of focusing on the pressures that soccer may have heaped onto him , it might be worth noting that enke actually had better access to support , community , and care – through his teammates , club and international federation – than many other sufferers of depression could ever hope to have . but peter kay , the ceo of sporting chance , a uk-based independent clinic for athletes with addictions and psychological problems , believes that while clubs have made progress in providing support in recent years , fear of exposure keeps many players from talking about their problems . too tough to open up bildunterschrift : enke feared revealing the depth of his depression could damage his career " there has been a real change in clubs over the last five years where the player has started to be seen more as a human being with human problems , " kay told deutsche welle .

however , those same factors can also contribute to a player 's fragile state of mind . " players live in a total fantasy world , cocooned by the clubs from reality , " kay said .
" while the clubs and soccer in general are not to blame , they are culpable .
from the age of eight and nine in some cases , young players are given everything which the club hopes will make them into a star .
there are few top players who can have a normal life – they 're celebrities now – and they have never had to live in the real world .
what is hard is when they can not equate their image in a magazine with how they truly feel inside .

enke 's career was dominated by the extreme highs and lows that come with every life spent in the sporting arena .
he had to deal with the constant threat of injury , the pressure to perform , and – as he publicly admitted – the threat of being replaced by a younger , better player .
facing these pressures in a career that could so easily end in a split-second collision , enke found out that the dream was always perilously close to turning into a nightmare . " top players live with the constant fear of being dropped or replaced , " said kay .

while support structures may have been there for him , it is likely that he felt that he could n't admit that something was wrong with him for fear of what might happen . " there 's a terrific stigma in soccer , as in society , that if you have mental health issues or suffer from depression , then you ’ re seen as weak , " said kay .
" this is exacerbated in the macho world of soccer which , contrary to popular opinion , is a very lonely and insular place .
these players do n't all socialize together ; they do n't have dinner together every night , they 're not all pals , it 's not all tight-knit at the clubs .
it 's a highly competitive world where it 's every man for himself .
players wo n't share problems because they fear they will be judged and that their ' weakness ' will be used against them .
so , as is the nature of depression , players will keep their feelings inside and will tell themselves they 'll get through it .

deutsche welle 's ingo mannteufel thinks this is a golden opportunity for the eu . the russian president did not mince his words as he described the socio-economic situation in russia .
he ranted at what he called the country 's " chronic backwardness , " the " lack of economic competitiveness , " the rampant corruption and the high level of dependency on gas and oil .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel however , any approval and support for his ideas should not overshadow two important questions : can medvedev achieve his ambitious aims given the extent of corruption and state-run bureaucracy , and can russia undergo an economic and technological modernization without far-reaching political reforms ?
his remarks in that respect did little to inspire confidence .
although he criticized authoritarian structures on a regional level and demanded improvements for russia 's opposition parties , there was little of substance on radical political and legal reform .

however , it would be wrong to interpret that as a deep rift between the two men .

medvedev can take credit for trying to give those ideas more substance and for giving them a democratic platform , thereby allowing optimists to hope whereas realists will say it 's time for action , not words .
still , medvedev 's message offers the west , and germany in particular , a promising opportunity .
for the first time russia is not using ideology or military might to define its status as a world power , instead it 's looking at whether it can offer its people modern living conditions .
this means that russia is being forced to adopt a more cooperative position towards the outside world .
as medvedev himself put it : modernization can only be achieved through integration with the global economy .
and that 's why it was no surprise that foreign policy was hardly mentioned .
medvedev said russia 's foreign policy would merely be an instrument to secure the sweeping internal reforms he has called for .

the works are meant to be taken at face value , without any political or religious overtones .
and stereotypes are to be left at the door . in the newest exhibition at the martin gropius bau in berlin , visitors are asked to take a fresh look at islamic culture . " it is now very common to speak of islamic culture in a way that reduces it , whether it is violence or a patriarchal culture or the veil , " said the exhibition 's head curator almut bruckstein coruh , who came from jerusalem to berlin to explore her own german-jewish background .
" this exhibition tries to undo these very strict and rude and basically violent boundaries created by this form of public discourse . " the exhibition is titled " taswir , " which , in arabic , persian and ottoman turkish means roughly " portrayal , likeness , drawing , or photograph . "
despite popular misconceptions , images are not absent from islamic tradition , bruckstein told deutsche welle .
the attitude toward images in islamic culture is ambivalent and has varied through history , she added . bildunterschrift : abdulnasser gharem 's " the path , " 2007 to understand the exhibition that has been painstakingly assembled by bruckstein , together with classical art historian hendrik budde , it is worth considering what it is not .
the structure of the show , which incorporates over 250 works , does not have a beginning or an end .
there is no chronology , it is not political , and most specifically , said bruckstein , it is not a study of religion . a poetic arrangement the exhibition 's 18 rooms have been set up based on an idea by aby warburg , a late 19th-century art historian - a first for a european gallery .
the concept , called the mnemosyne atlas , is a way of exhibiting art based on poetic association instead of chronology or theme . in addition to works by over 50 contemporary artists , classical islamic works are on loan from important national and international libraries and museums , including the hermitage in saint petersburg , the british museum and british library in london , the bibliotheque nationale de france , the calouste gulbenkian museum in lisbon and the museum of islamic art in berlin 's pergamon museum . " the mixing of classical and contemporary objects is absolutely new for me , " said budde .
" of course it was a struggle .
ms bruckstein was fighting for her contemporary works and i was begging , please do n't overwhelm my mostly - let 's face it - tiny classical objects .
but there are many rooms i am delighted by and the classical objects have , in fact , been heightened by their juxtaposition with the contemporary . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maliheh afnan 's " veiled minds , " 2006 not least of the classical artefacts assembled by classicist hendrik budde is a set of three painted korans , including an extremely rare 10th-century golden koran .
these examples were rare even in their day as korans are traditionally not decorated so as not to detract from the words . in some cases , however , visitors ca n't be sure whether they are looking at a classical or a modern piece , budde added - which may make them observe the objects more closely . unveiling art the exhibition asks the visitors to resist the temptation to compartmentalize islamic and european art . " i have never liked tags , " said palestinian-born artist maliheh afnan .
" i happen to be a woman , i happen to be an artist and i happen to be from the middle east .
there is all this talk nowadays about the veil and i thought about what we are hiding from within .
i think i prefer to deal with a person who veils their face and not themselves .
i think it is easier to deal with . " afnan has presented six works of calligraphy - a tradition she said is often connected to poetry as well as the koran .
even when using a very decorative script , religious texts or poetry always had to be readable .
afnan , however , has broken with this tradition .
she said her work is about the idea of writing itself , and is never actually readable . " i come from an ancient part of the world , so my work never looks fresh .
it looks weathered by time .
it is about the passage of time and about the ageing process , " said afnan . bildunterschrift : chant avedissian 's " the arab nation , " 2008 one of the exhibition 's strongest rooms , face and effaced face , is a play on the concept and idea of the veil .
the question here , said bruckstein , is what you see if you do n't have a regional , ethnic , or religious definition . at one end of the room is a 16th-century miniature of the prophet muhammad .
the picture shows a classically-veiled muhammad pointing at a full moon , which is traditionally a metaphor for beauty or perfection .
muhammad 's posture says : if you want to see me , look at the full moon . while the curators and artists are adamant that the show is neither about religion nor politics , this may not always be clear to the visitor .
the most recent piece in the room is a 2001 photo montage by palestinian artist taysir batniji , who was exiled from gaza and is now living in paris .
the photographs , taken black on black , depict the faces of 170 people killed by the israeli defence forces . bruckstein had to fight hard to get the art out of gaza .
she said that , even here , the focus is not on martyrdom but rather on engagement with the human face . life as a trace of absence in following with the exhibition 's method of poetic association , the show 's walls are scattered with sayings from thinkers and philosophers that define the theme or sentiment of each room .
one of them is from french philosopher jacques derrida , who said , " life must be thought of as a trace of absence . " budde has chosen a 16th-century miniature painting of the prophet muhammad 's sandals for this room .
it is part of a larger indian and persian tradition that sees footprints as the presence of someone 's absence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " khusraw watches shirin bathing , " 16th century miniature the centerpiece of the room is a four-by-four-meter well of sand .
a dial moves around the circle continuously , creating grooves with one side and rubbing them out with the other . " it is not a show about religion , " said bruckstein , " for example the question of the feet leaving a trace of absence is not a religious question ; it is a question of leaving a trace .
the three artists in the room are having a conversation . " budde said that this kind of exhibition is rare , since european museum-goers are more familiar with christian art . " i hope that visitors from islamic countries will be interested to see what we dared to put together , to do what ca n't be done in some arabic countries , " said budde . the exhibition runs until january 18 , 2010 . author : tanya wood editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the works are meant to be taken at face value , without any political or religious overtones .
and stereotypes are to be left at the door . in the newest exhibition at the martin gropius bau in berlin , visitors are asked to take a fresh look at islamic culture . " it is now very common to speak of islamic culture in a way that reduces it , whether it is violence or a patriarchal culture or the veil , " said the exhibition 's head curator almut bruckstein coruh , who came from jerusalem to berlin to explore her own german-jewish background .
" this exhibition tries to undo these very strict and rude and basically violent boundaries created by this form of public discourse . " the exhibition is titled " taswir , " which , in arabic , persian and ottoman turkish means roughly " portrayal , likeness , drawing , or photograph . "
despite popular misconceptions , images are not absent from islamic tradition , bruckstein told deutsche welle .
the attitude toward images in islamic culture is ambivalent and has varied through history , she added . bildunterschrift : abdulnasser gharem 's " the path , " 2007 to understand the exhibition that has been painstakingly assembled by bruckstein , together with classical art historian hendrik budde , it is worth considering what it is not .
the structure of the show , which incorporates over 250 works , does not have a beginning or an end .
there is no chronology , it is not political , and most specifically , said bruckstein , it is not a study of religion . a poetic arrangement the exhibition 's 18 rooms have been set up based on an idea by aby warburg , a late 19th-century art historian - a first for a european gallery .
the concept , called the mnemosyne atlas , is a way of exhibiting art based on poetic association instead of chronology or theme . in addition to works by over 50 contemporary artists , classical islamic works are on loan from important national and international libraries and museums , including the hermitage in saint petersburg , the british museum and british library in london , the bibliotheque nationale de france , the calouste gulbenkian museum in lisbon and the museum of islamic art in berlin 's pergamon museum . " the mixing of classical and contemporary objects is absolutely new for me , " said budde .
" of course it was a struggle .
ms bruckstein was fighting for her contemporary works and i was begging , please do n't overwhelm my mostly - let 's face it - tiny classical objects .
but there are many rooms i am delighted by and the classical objects have , in fact , been heightened by their juxtaposition with the contemporary . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maliheh afnan 's " veiled minds , " 2006 not least of the classical artefacts assembled by classicist hendrik budde is a set of three painted korans , including an extremely rare 10th-century golden koran .
these examples were rare even in their day as korans are traditionally not decorated so as not to detract from the words . in some cases , however , visitors ca n't be sure whether they are looking at a classical or a modern piece , budde added - which may make them observe the objects more closely . unveiling art the exhibition asks the visitors to resist the temptation to compartmentalize islamic and european art . " i have never liked tags , " said palestinian-born artist maliheh afnan .
" i happen to be a woman , i happen to be an artist and i happen to be from the middle east .
there is all this talk nowadays about the veil and i thought about what we are hiding from within .
i think i prefer to deal with a person who veils their face and not themselves .
i think it is easier to deal with . " afnan has presented six works of calligraphy - a tradition she said is often connected to poetry as well as the koran .
even when using a very decorative script , religious texts or poetry always had to be readable .
afnan , however , has broken with this tradition .
she said her work is about the idea of writing itself , and is never actually readable . " i come from an ancient part of the world , so my work never looks fresh .
it looks weathered by time .
it is about the passage of time and about the ageing process , " said afnan . bildunterschrift : chant avedissian 's " the arab nation , " 2008 one of the exhibition 's strongest rooms , face and effaced face , is a play on the concept and idea of the veil .
the question here , said bruckstein , is what you see if you do n't have a regional , ethnic , or religious definition . at one end of the room is a 16th-century miniature of the prophet muhammad .
the picture shows a classically-veiled muhammad pointing at a full moon , which is traditionally a metaphor for beauty or perfection .

the works are meant to be taken at face value , without any political or religious overtones .
and stereotypes are to be left at the door . in the newest exhibition at the martin gropius bau in berlin , visitors are asked to take a fresh look at islamic culture . " it is now very common to speak of islamic culture in a way that reduces it , whether it is violence or a patriarchal culture or the veil , " said the exhibition 's head curator almut bruckstein coruh , who came from jerusalem to berlin to explore her own german-jewish background .
" this exhibition tries to undo these very strict and rude and basically violent boundaries created by this form of public discourse . " the exhibition is titled " taswir , " which , in arabic , persian and ottoman turkish means roughly " portrayal , likeness , drawing , or photograph . "
despite popular misconceptions , images are not absent from islamic tradition , bruckstein told deutsche welle .
the attitude toward images in islamic culture is ambivalent and has varied through history , she added . bildunterschrift : abdulnasser gharem 's " the path , " 2007 to understand the exhibition that has been painstakingly assembled by bruckstein , together with classical art historian hendrik budde , it is worth considering what it is not .
the structure of the show , which incorporates over 250 works , does not have a beginning or an end .
there is no chronology , it is not political , and most specifically , said bruckstein , it is not a study of religion . a poetic arrangement the exhibition 's 18 rooms have been set up based on an idea by aby warburg , a late 19th-century art historian - a first for a european gallery .
the concept , called the mnemosyne atlas , is a way of exhibiting art based on poetic association instead of chronology or theme . in addition to works by over 50 contemporary artists , classical islamic works are on loan from important national and international libraries and museums , including the hermitage in saint petersburg , the british museum and british library in london , the bibliotheque nationale de france , the calouste gulbenkian museum in lisbon and the museum of islamic art in berlin 's pergamon museum . " the mixing of classical and contemporary objects is absolutely new for me , " said budde .
" of course it was a struggle .
ms bruckstein was fighting for her contemporary works and i was begging , please do n't overwhelm my mostly - let 's face it - tiny classical objects .
but there are many rooms i am delighted by and the classical objects have , in fact , been heightened by their juxtaposition with the contemporary . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maliheh afnan 's " veiled minds , " 2006 not least of the classical artefacts assembled by classicist hendrik budde is a set of three painted korans , including an extremely rare 10th-century golden koran .
these examples were rare even in their day as korans are traditionally not decorated so as not to detract from the words . in some cases , however , visitors ca n't be sure whether they are looking at a classical or a modern piece , budde added - which may make them observe the objects more closely . unveiling art the exhibition asks the visitors to resist the temptation to compartmentalize islamic and european art . " i have never liked tags , " said palestinian-born artist maliheh afnan .
" i happen to be a woman , i happen to be an artist and i happen to be from the middle east .
there is all this talk nowadays about the veil and i thought about what we are hiding from within .
i think i prefer to deal with a person who veils their face and not themselves .
i think it is easier to deal with . " afnan has presented six works of calligraphy - a tradition she said is often connected to poetry as well as the koran .
even when using a very decorative script , religious texts or poetry always had to be readable .
afnan , however , has broken with this tradition .
she said her work is about the idea of writing itself , and is never actually readable . " i come from an ancient part of the world , so my work never looks fresh .
it looks weathered by time .
it is about the passage of time and about the ageing process , " said afnan . bildunterschrift : chant avedissian 's " the arab nation , " 2008 one of the exhibition 's strongest rooms , face and effaced face , is a play on the concept and idea of the veil .
the question here , said bruckstein , is what you see if you do n't have a regional , ethnic , or religious definition . at one end of the room is a 16th-century miniature of the prophet muhammad .
the picture shows a classically-veiled muhammad pointing at a full moon , which is traditionally a metaphor for beauty or perfection .
muhammad 's posture says : if you want to see me , look at the full moon . while the curators and artists are adamant that the show is neither about religion nor politics , this may not always be clear to the visitor .
the most recent piece in the room is a 2001 photo montage by palestinian artist taysir batniji , who was exiled from gaza and is now living in paris .
the photographs , taken black on black , depict the faces of 170 people killed by the israeli defence forces . bruckstein had to fight hard to get the art out of gaza .
she said that , even here , the focus is not on martyrdom but rather on engagement with the human face . life as a trace of absence in following with the exhibition 's method of poetic association , the show 's walls are scattered with sayings from thinkers and philosophers that define the theme or sentiment of each room .
one of them is from french philosopher jacques derrida , who said , " life must be thought of as a trace of absence . " budde has chosen a 16th-century miniature painting of the prophet muhammad 's sandals for this room .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 12.11.2009 opinion : europe should seize on medvedev 's calls for modernization großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his annual state of the nation address , russian president dimitry medvedev called for sweeping internal reforms .
deutsche welle 's ingo mannteufel thinks this is a golden opportunity for the eu . the russian president did not mince his words as he described the socio-economic situation in russia .
he ranted at what he called the country 's " chronic backwardness , " the " lack of economic competitiveness , " the rampant corruption and the high level of dependency on gas and oil .
and there 's no arguing with his assessment .
all the problems he listed play a major part in russia 's failure to fulfill its potential and to offer its people a modern way of life .
his appeals for change appear to be the right way forward , including the modernization and strengthening of democratic values and institutions and his pledge to fight terrorism in the north caucasus region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel however , any approval and support for his ideas should not overshadow two important questions : can medvedev achieve his ambitious aims given the extent of corruption and state-run bureaucracy , and can russia undergo an economic and technological modernization without far-reaching political reforms ?
his remarks in that respect did little to inspire confidence .
although he criticized authoritarian structures on a regional level and demanded improvements for russia 's opposition parties , there was little of substance on radical political and legal reform .
kremlin experts will have noted with interest medvedev 's calls to overhaul russia 's state-run companies , the behemoths created by his predecessor , vladimir putin .
however , it would be wrong to interpret that as a deep rift between the two men .
a closer look reveals that medvedev 's drive to modernize the country 's economy is part of the strategy pursued by putin .
medvedev can take credit for trying to give those ideas more substance and for giving them a democratic platform , thereby allowing optimists to hope whereas realists will say it 's time for action , not words .
still , medvedev 's message offers the west , and germany in particular , a promising opportunity .
for the first time russia is not using ideology or military might to define its status as a world power , instead it 's looking at whether it can offer its people modern living conditions .
this means that russia is being forced to adopt a more cooperative position towards the outside world .
as medvedev himself put it : modernization can only be achieved through integration with the global economy .
and that 's why it was no surprise that foreign policy was hardly mentioned .
medvedev said russia 's foreign policy would merely be an instrument to secure the sweeping internal reforms he has called for .
historically this would indicate a significant paradigm shift .
the european union should use this chance by defining its own aims and stating how it intends to help russia achieve modernization .

deutsche welle 's ingo mannteufel thinks this is a golden opportunity for the eu . the russian president did not mince his words as he described the socio-economic situation in russia .
he ranted at what he called the country 's " chronic backwardness , " the " lack of economic competitiveness , " the rampant corruption and the high level of dependency on gas and oil .
and there 's no arguing with his assessment .
all the problems he listed play a major part in russia 's failure to fulfill its potential and to offer its people a modern way of life .
his appeals for change appear to be the right way forward , including the modernization and strengthening of democratic values and institutions and his pledge to fight terrorism in the north caucasus region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel however , any approval and support for his ideas should not overshadow two important questions : can medvedev achieve his ambitious aims given the extent of corruption and state-run bureaucracy , and can russia undergo an economic and technological modernization without far-reaching political reforms ?
his remarks in that respect did little to inspire confidence .
although he criticized authoritarian structures on a regional level and demanded improvements for russia 's opposition parties , there was little of substance on radical political and legal reform .
kremlin experts will have noted with interest medvedev 's calls to overhaul russia 's state-run companies , the behemoths created by his predecessor , vladimir putin .
however , it would be wrong to interpret that as a deep rift between the two men .
a closer look reveals that medvedev 's drive to modernize the country 's economy is part of the strategy pursued by putin .
medvedev can take credit for trying to give those ideas more substance and for giving them a democratic platform , thereby allowing optimists to hope whereas realists will say it 's time for action , not words .
still , medvedev 's message offers the west , and germany in particular , a promising opportunity .
for the first time russia is not using ideology or military might to define its status as a world power , instead it 's looking at whether it can offer its people modern living conditions .
this means that russia is being forced to adopt a more cooperative position towards the outside world .
as medvedev himself put it : modernization can only be achieved through integration with the global economy .
and that 's why it was no surprise that foreign policy was hardly mentioned .
medvedev said russia 's foreign policy would merely be an instrument to secure the sweeping internal reforms he has called for .
historically this would indicate a significant paradigm shift .
the european union should use this chance by defining its own aims and stating how it intends to help russia achieve modernization .

the move has drawn condemnation from tehran . iran has condemned england 's oxford university for creating a scholarship in honor of neda agha-soltan , a 27-year-old philosophy student who was shot and killed over the summer during election protests in iran .

the focus is likely to be on trade and security issues with the us keen to boost its influence in the region . barack obama kicked off his first trip to asia as us president on friday , holding talks with japanese prime minister yukio hatoyama .
both were keen to stress their cooperation on a wide range of issues including nuclear non-proliferation and efforts to tackle climate change .
japan is one of america 's oldest allies in east asia , and obama highlighted that the alliance with japan was a " foundation " for peace and prosperity in the region .
nevertheless the newly elected democratic party does n't appear to be as supportive of a strong us-japan alliance , and has called for a smaller us military " footprint " on japanese soil . obama is due to give a major speech in tokyo on saturday outlining his ideas for america 's new role in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands demonstrated against a us military base on the japanese island of okinawa the week-long tour , which also includes stops in singapore , beijing and seoul , is intended to lay the groundwork for future cooperation , according to administration officials and analysts , and it marks a notable shift in us involvement in the region , where chinese influence has grown considerably in recent years .
" if you do not hold your ground in the pacific , you can not be a world leader , " remarked singapore 's former prime minister lee kuan yew in washington last week .
obama 's predecessor , george w. bush , was often perceived as ignoring asia 's economic growth - much to the chagrin of officials there .
now , obama will seek to assure the region of continued us engagement , but analysts say relations have grown more complex in wake of asia 's economic transformation .
indeed , just days after world leaders celebrated the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , which was widely interpreted as the triumph of western ideas , obama 's asia visit will highlight just how much has changed in two decades .
" china , especially during the past two years , -lsb- has -rsb- emerged as a global economic powerhouse , " cheng li , an expert on us-china relations at the brookings institution in washington , told deutsche welle .
" and it really came as a big surprise , although many china analysts had predicted china 's rise . " " the period -lsb- in which -rsb- china is a student lectured by the west is coming to an end , " he added . china poses new challenges obama called china " a vital partner , as well as a competitor " ahead of his departure , and his stops in beijing and shanghai are perhaps the most crucial legs of his tour .
china is america 's second largest trading partner - and its largest creditor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says he will meet the dalai lama after his china trip there have been several indicators ahead of obama 's visit that point to a power shift in us-china relations .
" a year ago , hillary clinton , during the campaign , argued that the united states should boycott our olympics , but now she 's become a spokesperson for the shanghai expo - she visited the shanghai expo site - so that tells you how dramatic change has been , " said cheng li . furthermore , obama declined to meet with the dalai lama last month during his trip to washington , making him the first president since 1991 to do so . recently , the us administration also backed the replacement of the g-8 group of wealthy industrialized nations with the g-20 , which includes china , to converge on matters of the global economy .
but francois godement , an east asia expert at the european council on foreign relations , believes the hype about asia 's rise and america 's waning influence is overstated .
" i see us popularity increasing , not decreasing , and that 's the obama factor as you look at all of the opinion polls throughout asia - it 's a big change from a year ago , " godement told deutsche welle .
aside from economic matters , the us sees chinese cooperation as essential on two key issues : containing the nuclear ambitions of both north korea and iran , and negotiating a deal on carbon emissions caps at the upcoming climate summit in copenhagen .
mending strained relations in tough economic times in singapore , obama will participate in the leaders summit of the asia-pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- , where the aim will be to strengthen us ties with countries that form the asssociation of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- .
obama has agreed to engage with burma , opening the door for talks with asean leaders who had previously clashed with former president bush over the issue .
but the financial crisis will undoubtedly complicate obama 's agenda .
at a time when the us seeks to expand its influence in asia , obama would be hard-pressed to convince congress to support any new free-trade agreements .
many americans feel threatened by asia 's rise and the impact it will have on their jobs , especially during a period of record high unemployment .
analysts say they do n't expect any concrete achievements from the trip on any of the major issues - trade , non-nuclear proliferation , iran , afghanistan , north korea , and climate change - but asian leaders are said to be excited about renewed us interest in the region .

guttenberg was on his maiden visit to the country , where over 4,300 german troops are deployed . “ the karzai government has to fulfil certain conditions , " he asserted , adding that " we must see successes . " guttenberg , who assumed his new role as defense minister just over two weeks ago , had a busy schedule of meetings with president karzai , top nato commander gen. stanley mcchrystal , afghan defense minister abdul rahim wardak , the german ambassador to afghanistan , members of the eu police mission -lrb- eupol -rrb- , as well as the heads of german aid agencies and non-governmental organizations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tanks on maneuvers in mazar-i-sharif guttenberg also traveled to mazar-i-sharif , where some of the german troop contingent is stationed .
the minister reiterated recent comments in which he said that german soldiers were " at war " in the region .
his predecessor , franz josef jung , had always been careful to avoid that term . guttenberg said , however , that it was important to clearly explain to the troops and to the people at home what was going on in afghanistan . troops appreciate minister 's clear words his comments were welcomed by troops , with one of them saying that they " were exposed to danger every day and therefore it is appreciated when things are called by name . " guttenberg also made clear that he approved of the increased us elite troop activity in the region around kunduz where german troops were also deployed .
their presence had brought additional security and the coordination was good , he said . the defense minister is scheduled to fly to kunduz on friday to visit german reconstruction teams which are facing a growing taliban insurgency in their area . after his meeting with karzai , guttenberg said the topics discussed had included the widespread corruption in the country and the style of governance . guttenberg is the latest in a series of foreign ministers and world leaders who have publicly pressured karzai , coupling financial and military support to his willingness to battle corruption and tackle reforms . karzai is to be sworn in on november 19 for another five-year term , but under the increased scrutiny of the international community . large-scale fraud that marred the august 20 presidential election highlighted the scale of corruption in afghanistan 's government and has led to condemnation of karzai ’ s administration and demands that he tackle graft . change of strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 4,000 troops deployed in afghanistan guttenberg surprised many in germany soon after he assumed his new role as defense minister when he described germany 's engagement in afghanistan as a " combat operation . "
he told the mass-circulation bild newspaper that there was a " war " in afghanistan . guttenberg 's visit comes at a time of intensifying debate in germany over the bundeswehr mission in afghanistan , with berlin 's deployment of troops to the hindu kush region increasingly unpopular at home . it also follows news that a nato probe into a september airstrike that killed dozens of afghan civilians showed that the german commander who ordered it broke military rules of engagement the september 4 strike on fuel trucks in the northeastern kunduz province was the most deadly operation involving german troops since world war ii .
the attack was ordered by german colonel georg klein and carried out by a us fighter jet .
german federal prosecutors are set to look into the incident , after a nato report condemned the airstrike . the german army has backed klein 's decision , saying he acted out of concern for german troops , while guttenberg described the strike as " appropriate in military terms .

the focus is likely to be on trade and security issues with the us keen to boost its influence in the region . barack obama kicked off his first trip to asia as us president on friday , holding talks with japanese prime minister yukio hatoyama .
both were keen to stress their cooperation on a wide range of issues including nuclear non-proliferation and efforts to tackle climate change .
japan is one of america 's oldest allies in east asia , and obama highlighted that the alliance with japan was a " foundation " for peace and prosperity in the region .
nevertheless the newly elected democratic party does n't appear to be as supportive of a strong us-japan alliance , and has called for a smaller us military " footprint " on japanese soil . obama is due to give a major speech in tokyo on saturday outlining his ideas for america 's new role in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands demonstrated against a us military base on the japanese island of okinawa the week-long tour , which also includes stops in singapore , beijing and seoul , is intended to lay the groundwork for future cooperation , according to administration officials and analysts , and it marks a notable shift in us involvement in the region , where chinese influence has grown considerably in recent years .
" if you do not hold your ground in the pacific , you can not be a world leader , " remarked singapore 's former prime minister lee kuan yew in washington last week .
obama 's predecessor , george w. bush , was often perceived as ignoring asia 's economic growth - much to the chagrin of officials there .
now , obama will seek to assure the region of continued us engagement , but analysts say relations have grown more complex in wake of asia 's economic transformation .
indeed , just days after world leaders celebrated the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , which was widely interpreted as the triumph of western ideas , obama 's asia visit will highlight just how much has changed in two decades .
" china , especially during the past two years , -lsb- has -rsb- emerged as a global economic powerhouse , " cheng li , an expert on us-china relations at the brookings institution in washington , told deutsche welle .
" and it really came as a big surprise , although many china analysts had predicted china 's rise . " " the period -lsb- in which -rsb- china is a student lectured by the west is coming to an end , " he added . china poses new challenges obama called china " a vital partner , as well as a competitor " ahead of his departure , and his stops in beijing and shanghai are perhaps the most crucial legs of his tour .
china is america 's second largest trading partner - and its largest creditor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says he will meet the dalai lama after his china trip there have been several indicators ahead of obama 's visit that point to a power shift in us-china relations .
" a year ago , hillary clinton , during the campaign , argued that the united states should boycott our olympics , but now she 's become a spokesperson for the shanghai expo - she visited the shanghai expo site - so that tells you how dramatic change has been , " said cheng li . furthermore , obama declined to meet with the dalai lama last month during his trip to washington , making him the first president since 1991 to do so . recently , the us administration also backed the replacement of the g-8 group of wealthy industrialized nations with the g-20 , which includes china , to converge on matters of the global economy .
but francois godement , an east asia expert at the european council on foreign relations , believes the hype about asia 's rise and america 's waning influence is overstated .
" i see us popularity increasing , not decreasing , and that 's the obama factor as you look at all of the opinion polls throughout asia - it 's a big change from a year ago , " godement told deutsche welle .
aside from economic matters , the us sees chinese cooperation as essential on two key issues : containing the nuclear ambitions of both north korea and iran , and negotiating a deal on carbon emissions caps at the upcoming climate summit in copenhagen .
mending strained relations in tough economic times in singapore , obama will participate in the leaders summit of the asia-pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- , where the aim will be to strengthen us ties with countries that form the asssociation of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- .
obama has agreed to engage with burma , opening the door for talks with asean leaders who had previously clashed with former president bush over the issue .
but the financial crisis will undoubtedly complicate obama 's agenda .
at a time when the us seeks to expand its influence in asia , obama would be hard-pressed to convince congress to support any new free-trade agreements .
many americans feel threatened by asia 's rise and the impact it will have on their jobs , especially during a period of record high unemployment .
analysts say they do n't expect any concrete achievements from the trip on any of the major issues - trade , non-nuclear proliferation , iran , afghanistan , north korea , and climate change - but asian leaders are said to be excited about renewed us interest in the region .

the focus is likely to be on trade and security issues with the us keen to boost its influence in the region . barack obama kicked off his first trip to asia as us president on friday , holding talks with japanese prime minister yukio hatoyama .
both were keen to stress their cooperation on a wide range of issues including nuclear non-proliferation and efforts to tackle climate change .
japan is one of america 's oldest allies in east asia , and obama highlighted that the alliance with japan was a " foundation " for peace and prosperity in the region .
nevertheless the newly elected democratic party does n't appear to be as supportive of a strong us-japan alliance , and has called for a smaller us military " footprint " on japanese soil . obama is due to give a major speech in tokyo on saturday outlining his ideas for america 's new role in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands demonstrated against a us military base on the japanese island of okinawa the week-long tour , which also includes stops in singapore , beijing and seoul , is intended to lay the groundwork for future cooperation , according to administration officials and analysts , and it marks a notable shift in us involvement in the region , where chinese influence has grown considerably in recent years .
" if you do not hold your ground in the pacific , you can not be a world leader , " remarked singapore 's former prime minister lee kuan yew in washington last week .
obama 's predecessor , george w. bush , was often perceived as ignoring asia 's economic growth - much to the chagrin of officials there .
now , obama will seek to assure the region of continued us engagement , but analysts say relations have grown more complex in wake of asia 's economic transformation .
indeed , just days after world leaders celebrated the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , which was widely interpreted as the triumph of western ideas , obama 's asia visit will highlight just how much has changed in two decades .
" china , especially during the past two years , -lsb- has -rsb- emerged as a global economic powerhouse , " cheng li , an expert on us-china relations at the brookings institution in washington , told deutsche welle .
" and it really came as a big surprise , although many china analysts had predicted china 's rise . " " the period -lsb- in which -rsb- china is a student lectured by the west is coming to an end , " he added . china poses new challenges obama called china " a vital partner , as well as a competitor " ahead of his departure , and his stops in beijing and shanghai are perhaps the most crucial legs of his tour .
china is america 's second largest trading partner - and its largest creditor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says he will meet the dalai lama after his china trip there have been several indicators ahead of obama 's visit that point to a power shift in us-china relations .

the decision will now pass to the european court of justice . in 2006 , the patent court partially rescinded a 1999 patent for the scientist 's method of creating nerve cells from embryonic stem cells . during the hearing on thursday , november 12 , the bgh 's presiding judge peter meier-beck pointed out that bruestle 's research methods did not break german law . however , the bgh will now leave it to the european court to provide the legal parameters on two key issues : the definition of a human embryo and whether every professional use of embryos that is consistent with the 1999 patent counts as “ industrial or commercial use ” of embryos . the german federal patent court ruled to partially reverse the 1999 patent after a challenge from the environmental activist group greenpeace , which has welcomed the move to provide clearer legal guidelines regarding embryos . the court said that anything culled from embryonic stem cells could not be patented , as it necessarily involved the destruction of human embryos . ethical minefield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver bruestle is one of germany 's leading stem cell researchers research on embryonic stem cells is allowed in germany , though the production of stem cell lines is banned .
scientists are only allowed access to lines imported before may 2007 . if the earlier court 's ruling is upheld , this would mean that german embryonic stem cell research could continue , but would not be protected by patents . " for german scientists , this means that their inventions could be picked up by foreign firms and , at the end of the day , also be used in germany , " bruestle , professor of reconstructive neurobiology at bonn university , told the german news magazine spiegel . he described as " bizarre " the fact that his research is approved and funded by the state , and that he even has to prove that he is making an effort to apply for patent protection .
" however , if i get my results patented , that is regarded as immoral . " the scientist wants to use his procedure to help find cures for diseases such as alzheimer 's and multiple sclerosis . concern about cloning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace says this will pave the way for commercial human cloning greenpeace , however , is concerned that the patenting of such research could lead to an " embryo industry . " the organization said that it is less concerned with the issue of stem cells , but with the commercialization of the human body .
greenpeace would like to legally clarify whether embryos are commercial goods . greenpeace patent expert christoph then told epd news agency that his organization was not concerned about the value of an invention , but its socio-economic effects . jg / gw / epd / dpa editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 12.11.2009 obama to outline new us role on east asia tour großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this will be obama 's first visit to asia as president obama is preparing to outline a new us role for asia as part of a week-long tour .
the focus is likely to be on trade and security issues with the us keen to boost its influence in the region . barack obama kicked off his first trip to asia as us president on friday , holding talks with japanese prime minister yukio hatoyama .
both were keen to stress their cooperation on a wide range of issues including nuclear non-proliferation and efforts to tackle climate change .
japan is one of america 's oldest allies in east asia , and obama highlighted that the alliance with japan was a " foundation " for peace and prosperity in the region .
nevertheless the newly elected democratic party does n't appear to be as supportive of a strong us-japan alliance , and has called for a smaller us military " footprint " on japanese soil . obama is due to give a major speech in tokyo on saturday outlining his ideas for america 's new role in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands demonstrated against a us military base on the japanese island of okinawa the week-long tour , which also includes stops in singapore , beijing and seoul , is intended to lay the groundwork for future cooperation , according to administration officials and analysts , and it marks a notable shift in us involvement in the region , where chinese influence has grown considerably in recent years .
" if you do not hold your ground in the pacific , you can not be a world leader , " remarked singapore 's former prime minister lee kuan yew in washington last week .
obama 's predecessor , george w. bush , was often perceived as ignoring asia 's economic growth - much to the chagrin of officials there .
now , obama will seek to assure the region of continued us engagement , but analysts say relations have grown more complex in wake of asia 's economic transformation .
indeed , just days after world leaders celebrated the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , which was widely interpreted as the triumph of western ideas , obama 's asia visit will highlight just how much has changed in two decades .
" china , especially during the past two years , -lsb- has -rsb- emerged as a global economic powerhouse , " cheng li , an expert on us-china relations at the brookings institution in washington , told deutsche welle .
" and it really came as a big surprise , although many china analysts had predicted china 's rise . " " the period -lsb- in which -rsb- china is a student lectured by the west is coming to an end , " he added . china poses new challenges obama called china " a vital partner , as well as a competitor " ahead of his departure , and his stops in beijing and shanghai are perhaps the most crucial legs of his tour .
china is america 's second largest trading partner - and its largest creditor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says he will meet the dalai lama after his china trip there have been several indicators ahead of obama 's visit that point to a power shift in us-china relations .
" a year ago , hillary clinton , during the campaign , argued that the united states should boycott our olympics , but now she 's become a spokesperson for the shanghai expo - she visited the shanghai expo site - so that tells you how dramatic change has been , " said cheng li . furthermore , obama declined to meet with the dalai lama last month during his trip to washington , making him the first president since 1991 to do so . recently , the us administration also backed the replacement of the g-8 group of wealthy industrialized nations with the g-20 , which includes china , to converge on matters of the global economy .
but francois godement , an east asia expert at the european council on foreign relations , believes the hype about asia 's rise and america 's waning influence is overstated .
" i see us popularity increasing , not decreasing , and that 's the obama factor as you look at all of the opinion polls throughout asia - it 's a big change from a year ago , " godement told deutsche welle .
aside from economic matters , the us sees chinese cooperation as essential on two key issues : containing the nuclear ambitions of both north korea and iran , and negotiating a deal on carbon emissions caps at the upcoming climate summit in copenhagen .
mending strained relations in tough economic times in singapore , obama will participate in the leaders summit of the asia-pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- , where the aim will be to strengthen us ties with countries that form the asssociation of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- .
obama has agreed to engage with burma , opening the door for talks with asean leaders who had previously clashed with former president bush over the issue .
but the financial crisis will undoubtedly complicate obama 's agenda .
at a time when the us seeks to expand its influence in asia , obama would be hard-pressed to convince congress to support any new free-trade agreements .
many americans feel threatened by asia 's rise and the impact it will have on their jobs , especially during a period of record high unemployment .
analysts say they do n't expect any concrete achievements from the trip on any of the major issues - trade , non-nuclear proliferation , iran , afghanistan , north korea , and climate change - but asian leaders are said to be excited about renewed us interest in the region .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 12.11.2009 obama to outline new us role on east asia tour großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this will be obama 's first visit to asia as president obama is preparing to outline a new us role for asia as part of a week-long tour .
the focus is likely to be on trade and security issues with the us keen to boost its influence in the region . barack obama kicked off his first trip to asia as us president on friday , holding talks with japanese prime minister yukio hatoyama .
both were keen to stress their cooperation on a wide range of issues including nuclear non-proliferation and efforts to tackle climate change .
japan is one of america 's oldest allies in east asia , and obama highlighted that the alliance with japan was a " foundation " for peace and prosperity in the region .
nevertheless the newly elected democratic party does n't appear to be as supportive of a strong us-japan alliance , and has called for a smaller us military " footprint " on japanese soil . obama is due to give a major speech in tokyo on saturday outlining his ideas for america 's new role in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands demonstrated against a us military base on the japanese island of okinawa the week-long tour , which also includes stops in singapore , beijing and seoul , is intended to lay the groundwork for future cooperation , according to administration officials and analysts , and it marks a notable shift in us involvement in the region , where chinese influence has grown considerably in recent years .
" if you do not hold your ground in the pacific , you can not be a world leader , " remarked singapore 's former prime minister lee kuan yew in washington last week .
obama 's predecessor , george w. bush , was often perceived as ignoring asia 's economic growth - much to the chagrin of officials there .
now , obama will seek to assure the region of continued us engagement , but analysts say relations have grown more complex in wake of asia 's economic transformation .
indeed , just days after world leaders celebrated the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , which was widely interpreted as the triumph of western ideas , obama 's asia visit will highlight just how much has changed in two decades .
" china , especially during the past two years , -lsb- has -rsb- emerged as a global economic powerhouse , " cheng li , an expert on us-china relations at the brookings institution in washington , told deutsche welle .
" and it really came as a big surprise , although many china analysts had predicted china 's rise . " " the period -lsb- in which -rsb- china is a student lectured by the west is coming to an end , " he added . china poses new challenges obama called china " a vital partner , as well as a competitor " ahead of his departure , and his stops in beijing and shanghai are perhaps the most crucial legs of his tour .
china is america 's second largest trading partner - and its largest creditor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says he will meet the dalai lama after his china trip there have been several indicators ahead of obama 's visit that point to a power shift in us-china relations .
" a year ago , hillary clinton , during the campaign , argued that the united states should boycott our olympics , but now she 's become a spokesperson for the shanghai expo - she visited the shanghai expo site - so that tells you how dramatic change has been , " said cheng li . furthermore , obama declined to meet with the dalai lama last month during his trip to washington , making him the first president since 1991 to do so . recently , the us administration also backed the replacement of the g-8 group of wealthy industrialized nations with the g-20 , which includes china , to converge on matters of the global economy .
but francois godement , an east asia expert at the european council on foreign relations , believes the hype about asia 's rise and america 's waning influence is overstated .
" i see us popularity increasing , not decreasing , and that 's the obama factor as you look at all of the opinion polls throughout asia - it 's a big change from a year ago , " godement told deutsche welle .
aside from economic matters , the us sees chinese cooperation as essential on two key issues : containing the nuclear ambitions of both north korea and iran , and negotiating a deal on carbon emissions caps at the upcoming climate summit in copenhagen .
mending strained relations in tough economic times in singapore , obama will participate in the leaders summit of the asia-pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- , where the aim will be to strengthen us ties with countries that form the asssociation of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- .
obama has agreed to engage with burma , opening the door for talks with asean leaders who had previously clashed with former president bush over the issue .
but the financial crisis will undoubtedly complicate obama 's agenda .
at a time when the us seeks to expand its influence in asia , obama would be hard-pressed to convince congress to support any new free-trade agreements .
many americans feel threatened by asia 's rise and the impact it will have on their jobs , especially during a period of record high unemployment .
analysts say they do n't expect any concrete achievements from the trip on any of the major issues - trade , non-nuclear proliferation , iran , afghanistan , north korea , and climate change - but asian leaders are said to be excited about renewed us interest in the region .

the focus is likely to be on trade and security issues with the us keen to boost its influence in the region . barack obama kicked off his first trip to asia as us president on friday , holding talks with japanese prime minister yukio hatoyama .
both were keen to stress their cooperation on a wide range of issues including nuclear non-proliferation and efforts to tackle climate change .
japan is one of america 's oldest allies in east asia , and obama highlighted that the alliance with japan was a " foundation " for peace and prosperity in the region .
nevertheless the newly elected democratic party does n't appear to be as supportive of a strong us-japan alliance , and has called for a smaller us military " footprint " on japanese soil . obama is due to give a major speech in tokyo on saturday outlining his ideas for america 's new role in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands demonstrated against a us military base on the japanese island of okinawa the week-long tour , which also includes stops in singapore , beijing and seoul , is intended to lay the groundwork for future cooperation , according to administration officials and analysts , and it marks a notable shift in us involvement in the region , where chinese influence has grown considerably in recent years .
" if you do not hold your ground in the pacific , you can not be a world leader , " remarked singapore 's former prime minister lee kuan yew in washington last week .
obama 's predecessor , george w. bush , was often perceived as ignoring asia 's economic growth - much to the chagrin of officials there .
now , obama will seek to assure the region of continued us engagement , but analysts say relations have grown more complex in wake of asia 's economic transformation .
indeed , just days after world leaders celebrated the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , which was widely interpreted as the triumph of western ideas , obama 's asia visit will highlight just how much has changed in two decades .
" china , especially during the past two years , -lsb- has -rsb- emerged as a global economic powerhouse , " cheng li , an expert on us-china relations at the brookings institution in washington , told deutsche welle .
" and it really came as a big surprise , although many china analysts had predicted china 's rise . " " the period -lsb- in which -rsb- china is a student lectured by the west is coming to an end , " he added . china poses new challenges obama called china " a vital partner , as well as a competitor " ahead of his departure , and his stops in beijing and shanghai are perhaps the most crucial legs of his tour .
china is america 's second largest trading partner - and its largest creditor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says he will meet the dalai lama after his china trip there have been several indicators ahead of obama 's visit that point to a power shift in us-china relations .
" a year ago , hillary clinton , during the campaign , argued that the united states should boycott our olympics , but now she 's become a spokesperson for the shanghai expo - she visited the shanghai expo site - so that tells you how dramatic change has been , " said cheng li . furthermore , obama declined to meet with the dalai lama last month during his trip to washington , making him the first president since 1991 to do so . recently , the us administration also backed the replacement of the g-8 group of wealthy industrialized nations with the g-20 , which includes china , to converge on matters of the global economy .
but francois godement , an east asia expert at the european council on foreign relations , believes the hype about asia 's rise and america 's waning influence is overstated .
" i see us popularity increasing , not decreasing , and that 's the obama factor as you look at all of the opinion polls throughout asia - it 's a big change from a year ago , " godement told deutsche welle .
aside from economic matters , the us sees chinese cooperation as essential on two key issues : containing the nuclear ambitions of both north korea and iran , and negotiating a deal on carbon emissions caps at the upcoming climate summit in copenhagen .
mending strained relations in tough economic times in singapore , obama will participate in the leaders summit of the asia-pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- , where the aim will be to strengthen us ties with countries that form the asssociation of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- .
obama has agreed to engage with burma , opening the door for talks with asean leaders who had previously clashed with former president bush over the issue .
but the financial crisis will undoubtedly complicate obama 's agenda .
at a time when the us seeks to expand its influence in asia , obama would be hard-pressed to convince congress to support any new free-trade agreements .
many americans feel threatened by asia 's rise and the impact it will have on their jobs , especially during a period of record high unemployment .
analysts say they do n't expect any concrete achievements from the trip on any of the major issues - trade , non-nuclear proliferation , iran , afghanistan , north korea , and climate change - but asian leaders are said to be excited about renewed us interest in the region .

guttenberg was on his maiden visit to the country , where over 4,300 german troops are deployed . “ the karzai government has to fulfil certain conditions , " he asserted , adding that " we must see successes . " guttenberg , who assumed his new role as defense minister just over two weeks ago , had a busy schedule of meetings with president karzai , top nato commander gen. stanley mcchrystal , afghan defense minister abdul rahim wardak , the german ambassador to afghanistan , members of the eu police mission -lrb- eupol -rrb- , as well as the heads of german aid agencies and non-governmental organizations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tanks on maneuvers in mazar-i-sharif guttenberg also traveled to mazar-i-sharif , where some of the german troop contingent is stationed .
the minister reiterated recent comments in which he said that german soldiers were " at war " in the region .
his predecessor , franz josef jung , had always been careful to avoid that term . guttenberg said , however , that it was important to clearly explain to the troops and to the people at home what was going on in afghanistan . troops appreciate minister 's clear words his comments were welcomed by troops , with one of them saying that they " were exposed to danger every day and therefore it is appreciated when things are called by name . " guttenberg also made clear that he approved of the increased us elite troop activity in the region around kunduz where german troops were also deployed .
their presence had brought additional security and the coordination was good , he said . the defense minister is scheduled to fly to kunduz on friday to visit german reconstruction teams which are facing a growing taliban insurgency in their area . after his meeting with karzai , guttenberg said the topics discussed had included the widespread corruption in the country and the style of governance . guttenberg is the latest in a series of foreign ministers and world leaders who have publicly pressured karzai , coupling financial and military support to his willingness to battle corruption and tackle reforms . karzai is to be sworn in on november 19 for another five-year term , but under the increased scrutiny of the international community . large-scale fraud that marred the august 20 presidential election highlighted the scale of corruption in afghanistan 's government and has led to condemnation of karzai ’ s administration and demands that he tackle graft . change of strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 4,000 troops deployed in afghanistan guttenberg surprised many in germany soon after he assumed his new role as defense minister when he described germany 's engagement in afghanistan as a " combat operation . "
he told the mass-circulation bild newspaper that there was a " war " in afghanistan . guttenberg 's visit comes at a time of intensifying debate in germany over the bundeswehr mission in afghanistan , with berlin 's deployment of troops to the hindu kush region increasingly unpopular at home . it also follows news that a nato probe into a september airstrike that killed dozens of afghan civilians showed that the german commander who ordered it broke military rules of engagement the september 4 strike on fuel trucks in the northeastern kunduz province was the most deadly operation involving german troops since world war ii .
the attack was ordered by german colonel georg klein and carried out by a us fighter jet .
german federal prosecutors are set to look into the incident , after a nato report condemned the airstrike . the german army has backed klein 's decision , saying he acted out of concern for german troops , while guttenberg described the strike as " appropriate in military terms . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg heads the defense ministry at a time when the afghan mission is unpopular call for clear goals for nato ahead of his afghan trip , the german defense minister called for an international conference on afghanistan to set what he called " clear goals " for the nato-led alliance 's deployment there .
the comments come as us president barack obama weighs his country 's strategy for the afghan conflict , after tainted elections cast nato 's support of president hamid karzai into doubt .
" if we should have to realign our objectives after such a conference , then we would also have to think about our own capabilities there , " guttenberg said .
the german parliament is set to debate the renewal of the army 's afghanistan mandate before mid-december .
any increase of german troop levels that may be requested by the us when it has decided on its own strategy is bound to be highly controversial , given the public perception of the bundeswehr 's engagement there .
guttenberg also said : " we must not be shy about using the word exit strategy . " gb / rb / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the works are meant to be taken at face value , without any political or religious overtones .
and stereotypes are to be left at the door . in the newest exhibition at the martin gropius bau in berlin , visitors are asked to take a fresh look at islamic culture . " it is now very common to speak of islamic culture in a way that reduces it , whether it is violence or a patriarchal culture or the veil , " said the exhibition 's head curator almut bruckstein coruh , who came from jerusalem to berlin to explore her own german-jewish background .
" this exhibition tries to undo these very strict and rude and basically violent boundaries created by this form of public discourse . " the exhibition is titled " taswir , " which , in arabic , persian and ottoman turkish means roughly " portrayal , likeness , drawing , or photograph . "
despite popular misconceptions , images are not absent from islamic tradition , bruckstein told deutsche welle .
the attitude toward images in islamic culture is ambivalent and has varied through history , she added . bildunterschrift : abdulnasser gharem 's " the path , " 2007 to understand the exhibition that has been painstakingly assembled by bruckstein , together with classical art historian hendrik budde , it is worth considering what it is not .
the structure of the show , which incorporates over 250 works , does not have a beginning or an end .
there is no chronology , it is not political , and most specifically , said bruckstein , it is not a study of religion . a poetic arrangement the exhibition 's 18 rooms have been set up based on an idea by aby warburg , a late 19th-century art historian - a first for a european gallery .
the concept , called the mnemosyne atlas , is a way of exhibiting art based on poetic association instead of chronology or theme . in addition to works by over 50 contemporary artists , classical islamic works are on loan from important national and international libraries and museums , including the hermitage in saint petersburg , the british museum and british library in london , the bibliotheque nationale de france , the calouste gulbenkian museum in lisbon and the museum of islamic art in berlin 's pergamon museum . " the mixing of classical and contemporary objects is absolutely new for me , " said budde .
" of course it was a struggle .
ms bruckstein was fighting for her contemporary works and i was begging , please do n't overwhelm my mostly - let 's face it - tiny classical objects .
but there are many rooms i am delighted by and the classical objects have , in fact , been heightened by their juxtaposition with the contemporary . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maliheh afnan 's " veiled minds , " 2006 not least of the classical artefacts assembled by classicist hendrik budde is a set of three painted korans , including an extremely rare 10th-century golden koran .
these examples were rare even in their day as korans are traditionally not decorated so as not to detract from the words . in some cases , however , visitors ca n't be sure whether they are looking at a classical or a modern piece , budde added - which may make them observe the objects more closely . unveiling art the exhibition asks the visitors to resist the temptation to compartmentalize islamic and european art . " i have never liked tags , " said palestinian-born artist maliheh afnan .
" i happen to be a woman , i happen to be an artist and i happen to be from the middle east .
there is all this talk nowadays about the veil and i thought about what we are hiding from within .
i think i prefer to deal with a person who veils their face and not themselves .
i think it is easier to deal with . " afnan has presented six works of calligraphy - a tradition she said is often connected to poetry as well as the koran .
even when using a very decorative script , religious texts or poetry always had to be readable .
afnan , however , has broken with this tradition .
she said her work is about the idea of writing itself , and is never actually readable . " i come from an ancient part of the world , so my work never looks fresh .
it looks weathered by time .
it is about the passage of time and about the ageing process , " said afnan . bildunterschrift : chant avedissian 's " the arab nation , " 2008 one of the exhibition 's strongest rooms , face and effaced face , is a play on the concept and idea of the veil .
the question here , said bruckstein , is what you see if you do n't have a regional , ethnic , or religious definition . at one end of the room is a 16th-century miniature of the prophet muhammad .
the picture shows a classically-veiled muhammad pointing at a full moon , which is traditionally a metaphor for beauty or perfection .
muhammad 's posture says : if you want to see me , look at the full moon . while the curators and artists are adamant that the show is neither about religion nor politics , this may not always be clear to the visitor .
the most recent piece in the room is a 2001 photo montage by palestinian artist taysir batniji , who was exiled from gaza and is now living in paris .
the photographs , taken black on black , depict the faces of 170 people killed by the israeli defence forces . bruckstein had to fight hard to get the art out of gaza .

the works are meant to be taken at face value , without any political or religious overtones .
and stereotypes are to be left at the door . in the newest exhibition at the martin gropius bau in berlin , visitors are asked to take a fresh look at islamic culture . " it is now very common to speak of islamic culture in a way that reduces it , whether it is violence or a patriarchal culture or the veil , " said the exhibition 's head curator almut bruckstein coruh , who came from jerusalem to berlin to explore her own german-jewish background .
" this exhibition tries to undo these very strict and rude and basically violent boundaries created by this form of public discourse . " the exhibition is titled " taswir , " which , in arabic , persian and ottoman turkish means roughly " portrayal , likeness , drawing , or photograph . "
despite popular misconceptions , images are not absent from islamic tradition , bruckstein told deutsche welle .
the attitude toward images in islamic culture is ambivalent and has varied through history , she added . bildunterschrift : abdulnasser gharem 's " the path , " 2007 to understand the exhibition that has been painstakingly assembled by bruckstein , together with classical art historian hendrik budde , it is worth considering what it is not .
the structure of the show , which incorporates over 250 works , does not have a beginning or an end .
there is no chronology , it is not political , and most specifically , said bruckstein , it is not a study of religion . a poetic arrangement the exhibition 's 18 rooms have been set up based on an idea by aby warburg , a late 19th-century art historian - a first for a european gallery .
the concept , called the mnemosyne atlas , is a way of exhibiting art based on poetic association instead of chronology or theme . in addition to works by over 50 contemporary artists , classical islamic works are on loan from important national and international libraries and museums , including the hermitage in saint petersburg , the british museum and british library in london , the bibliotheque nationale de france , the calouste gulbenkian museum in lisbon and the museum of islamic art in berlin 's pergamon museum . " the mixing of classical and contemporary objects is absolutely new for me , " said budde .
" of course it was a struggle .
ms bruckstein was fighting for her contemporary works and i was begging , please do n't overwhelm my mostly - let 's face it - tiny classical objects .
but there are many rooms i am delighted by and the classical objects have , in fact , been heightened by their juxtaposition with the contemporary . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maliheh afnan 's " veiled minds , " 2006 not least of the classical artefacts assembled by classicist hendrik budde is a set of three painted korans , including an extremely rare 10th-century golden koran .
these examples were rare even in their day as korans are traditionally not decorated so as not to detract from the words . in some cases , however , visitors ca n't be sure whether they are looking at a classical or a modern piece , budde added - which may make them observe the objects more closely . unveiling art the exhibition asks the visitors to resist the temptation to compartmentalize islamic and european art . " i have never liked tags , " said palestinian-born artist maliheh afnan .
" i happen to be a woman , i happen to be an artist and i happen to be from the middle east .
there is all this talk nowadays about the veil and i thought about what we are hiding from within .
i think i prefer to deal with a person who veils their face and not themselves .
i think it is easier to deal with . " afnan has presented six works of calligraphy - a tradition she said is often connected to poetry as well as the koran .
even when using a very decorative script , religious texts or poetry always had to be readable .
afnan , however , has broken with this tradition .
she said her work is about the idea of writing itself , and is never actually readable . " i come from an ancient part of the world , so my work never looks fresh .
it looks weathered by time .
it is about the passage of time and about the ageing process , " said afnan . bildunterschrift : chant avedissian 's " the arab nation , " 2008 one of the exhibition 's strongest rooms , face and effaced face , is a play on the concept and idea of the veil .
the question here , said bruckstein , is what you see if you do n't have a regional , ethnic , or religious definition . at one end of the room is a 16th-century miniature of the prophet muhammad .
the picture shows a classically-veiled muhammad pointing at a full moon , which is traditionally a metaphor for beauty or perfection .
muhammad 's posture says : if you want to see me , look at the full moon . while the curators and artists are adamant that the show is neither about religion nor politics , this may not always be clear to the visitor .
the most recent piece in the room is a 2001 photo montage by palestinian artist taysir batniji , who was exiled from gaza and is now living in paris .
the photographs , taken black on black , depict the faces of 170 people killed by the israeli defence forces . bruckstein had to fight hard to get the art out of gaza .
she said that , even here , the focus is not on martyrdom but rather on engagement with the human face . life as a trace of absence in following with the exhibition 's method of poetic association , the show 's walls are scattered with sayings from thinkers and philosophers that define the theme or sentiment of each room .

the works are meant to be taken at face value , without any political or religious overtones .
and stereotypes are to be left at the door . in the newest exhibition at the martin gropius bau in berlin , visitors are asked to take a fresh look at islamic culture . " it is now very common to speak of islamic culture in a way that reduces it , whether it is violence or a patriarchal culture or the veil , " said the exhibition 's head curator almut bruckstein coruh , who came from jerusalem to berlin to explore her own german-jewish background .
" this exhibition tries to undo these very strict and rude and basically violent boundaries created by this form of public discourse . " the exhibition is titled " taswir , " which , in arabic , persian and ottoman turkish means roughly " portrayal , likeness , drawing , or photograph . "
despite popular misconceptions , images are not absent from islamic tradition , bruckstein told deutsche welle .
the attitude toward images in islamic culture is ambivalent and has varied through history , she added . bildunterschrift : abdulnasser gharem 's " the path , " 2007 to understand the exhibition that has been painstakingly assembled by bruckstein , together with classical art historian hendrik budde , it is worth considering what it is not .
the structure of the show , which incorporates over 250 works , does not have a beginning or an end .
there is no chronology , it is not political , and most specifically , said bruckstein , it is not a study of religion . a poetic arrangement the exhibition 's 18 rooms have been set up based on an idea by aby warburg , a late 19th-century art historian - a first for a european gallery .
the concept , called the mnemosyne atlas , is a way of exhibiting art based on poetic association instead of chronology or theme . in addition to works by over 50 contemporary artists , classical islamic works are on loan from important national and international libraries and museums , including the hermitage in saint petersburg , the british museum and british library in london , the bibliotheque nationale de france , the calouste gulbenkian museum in lisbon and the museum of islamic art in berlin 's pergamon museum . " the mixing of classical and contemporary objects is absolutely new for me , " said budde .
" of course it was a struggle .
ms bruckstein was fighting for her contemporary works and i was begging , please do n't overwhelm my mostly - let 's face it - tiny classical objects .
but there are many rooms i am delighted by and the classical objects have , in fact , been heightened by their juxtaposition with the contemporary . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maliheh afnan 's " veiled minds , " 2006 not least of the classical artefacts assembled by classicist hendrik budde is a set of three painted korans , including an extremely rare 10th-century golden koran .
these examples were rare even in their day as korans are traditionally not decorated so as not to detract from the words . in some cases , however , visitors ca n't be sure whether they are looking at a classical or a modern piece , budde added - which may make them observe the objects more closely . unveiling art the exhibition asks the visitors to resist the temptation to compartmentalize islamic and european art . " i have never liked tags , " said palestinian-born artist maliheh afnan .
" i happen to be a woman , i happen to be an artist and i happen to be from the middle east .
there is all this talk nowadays about the veil and i thought about what we are hiding from within .
i think i prefer to deal with a person who veils their face and not themselves .
i think it is easier to deal with . " afnan has presented six works of calligraphy - a tradition she said is often connected to poetry as well as the koran .
even when using a very decorative script , religious texts or poetry always had to be readable .
afnan , however , has broken with this tradition .
she said her work is about the idea of writing itself , and is never actually readable . " i come from an ancient part of the world , so my work never looks fresh .
it looks weathered by time .
it is about the passage of time and about the ageing process , " said afnan . bildunterschrift : chant avedissian 's " the arab nation , " 2008 one of the exhibition 's strongest rooms , face and effaced face , is a play on the concept and idea of the veil .
the question here , said bruckstein , is what you see if you do n't have a regional , ethnic , or religious definition . at one end of the room is a 16th-century miniature of the prophet muhammad .
the picture shows a classically-veiled muhammad pointing at a full moon , which is traditionally a metaphor for beauty or perfection .
muhammad 's posture says : if you want to see me , look at the full moon . while the curators and artists are adamant that the show is neither about religion nor politics , this may not always be clear to the visitor .
the most recent piece in the room is a 2001 photo montage by palestinian artist taysir batniji , who was exiled from gaza and is now living in paris .
the photographs , taken black on black , depict the faces of 170 people killed by the israeli defence forces . bruckstein had to fight hard to get the art out of gaza .
she said that , even here , the focus is not on martyrdom but rather on engagement with the human face . life as a trace of absence in following with the exhibition 's method of poetic association , the show 's walls are scattered with sayings from thinkers and philosophers that define the theme or sentiment of each room .
one of them is from french philosopher jacques derrida , who said , " life must be thought of as a trace of absence . " budde has chosen a 16th-century miniature painting of the prophet muhammad 's sandals for this room .
it is part of a larger indian and persian tradition that sees footprints as the presence of someone 's absence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " khusraw watches shirin bathing , " 16th century miniature the centerpiece of the room is a four-by-four-meter well of sand .
a dial moves around the circle continuously , creating grooves with one side and rubbing them out with the other . " it is not a show about religion , " said bruckstein , " for example the question of the feet leaving a trace of absence is not a religious question ; it is a question of leaving a trace .
the three artists in the room are having a conversation . " budde said that this kind of exhibition is rare , since european museum-goers are more familiar with christian art . " i hope that visitors from islamic countries will be interested to see what we dared to put together , to do what ca n't be done in some arabic countries , " said budde . the exhibition runs until january 18 , 2010 . author : tanya wood editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the works are meant to be taken at face value , without any political or religious overtones .
and stereotypes are to be left at the door . in the newest exhibition at the martin gropius bau in berlin , visitors are asked to take a fresh look at islamic culture . " it is now very common to speak of islamic culture in a way that reduces it , whether it is violence or a patriarchal culture or the veil , " said the exhibition 's head curator almut bruckstein coruh , who came from jerusalem to berlin to explore her own german-jewish background .
" this exhibition tries to undo these very strict and rude and basically violent boundaries created by this form of public discourse . " the exhibition is titled " taswir , " which , in arabic , persian and ottoman turkish means roughly " portrayal , likeness , drawing , or photograph . "
despite popular misconceptions , images are not absent from islamic tradition , bruckstein told deutsche welle .
the attitude toward images in islamic culture is ambivalent and has varied through history , she added . bildunterschrift : abdulnasser gharem 's " the path , " 2007 to understand the exhibition that has been painstakingly assembled by bruckstein , together with classical art historian hendrik budde , it is worth considering what it is not .
the structure of the show , which incorporates over 250 works , does not have a beginning or an end .
there is no chronology , it is not political , and most specifically , said bruckstein , it is not a study of religion . a poetic arrangement the exhibition 's 18 rooms have been set up based on an idea by aby warburg , a late 19th-century art historian - a first for a european gallery .
the concept , called the mnemosyne atlas , is a way of exhibiting art based on poetic association instead of chronology or theme . in addition to works by over 50 contemporary artists , classical islamic works are on loan from important national and international libraries and museums , including the hermitage in saint petersburg , the british museum and british library in london , the bibliotheque nationale de france , the calouste gulbenkian museum in lisbon and the museum of islamic art in berlin 's pergamon museum . " the mixing of classical and contemporary objects is absolutely new for me , " said budde .
" of course it was a struggle .
ms bruckstein was fighting for her contemporary works and i was begging , please do n't overwhelm my mostly - let 's face it - tiny classical objects .
but there are many rooms i am delighted by and the classical objects have , in fact , been heightened by their juxtaposition with the contemporary . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maliheh afnan 's " veiled minds , " 2006 not least of the classical artefacts assembled by classicist hendrik budde is a set of three painted korans , including an extremely rare 10th-century golden koran .
these examples were rare even in their day as korans are traditionally not decorated so as not to detract from the words . in some cases , however , visitors ca n't be sure whether they are looking at a classical or a modern piece , budde added - which may make them observe the objects more closely . unveiling art the exhibition asks the visitors to resist the temptation to compartmentalize islamic and european art . " i have never liked tags , " said palestinian-born artist maliheh afnan .
" i happen to be a woman , i happen to be an artist and i happen to be from the middle east .
there is all this talk nowadays about the veil and i thought about what we are hiding from within .
i think i prefer to deal with a person who veils their face and not themselves .
i think it is easier to deal with . " afnan has presented six works of calligraphy - a tradition she said is often connected to poetry as well as the koran .
even when using a very decorative script , religious texts or poetry always had to be readable .
afnan , however , has broken with this tradition .
she said her work is about the idea of writing itself , and is never actually readable . " i come from an ancient part of the world , so my work never looks fresh .
it looks weathered by time .
it is about the passage of time and about the ageing process , " said afnan . bildunterschrift : chant avedissian 's " the arab nation , " 2008 one of the exhibition 's strongest rooms , face and effaced face , is a play on the concept and idea of the veil .
the question here , said bruckstein , is what you see if you do n't have a regional , ethnic , or religious definition . at one end of the room is a 16th-century miniature of the prophet muhammad .
the picture shows a classically-veiled muhammad pointing at a full moon , which is traditionally a metaphor for beauty or perfection .
muhammad 's posture says : if you want to see me , look at the full moon . while the curators and artists are adamant that the show is neither about religion nor politics , this may not always be clear to the visitor .
the most recent piece in the room is a 2001 photo montage by palestinian artist taysir batniji , who was exiled from gaza and is now living in paris .
the photographs , taken black on black , depict the faces of 170 people killed by the israeli defence forces . bruckstein had to fight hard to get the art out of gaza .
she said that , even here , the focus is not on martyrdom but rather on engagement with the human face . life as a trace of absence in following with the exhibition 's method of poetic association , the show 's walls are scattered with sayings from thinkers and philosophers that define the theme or sentiment of each room .
one of them is from french philosopher jacques derrida , who said , " life must be thought of as a trace of absence . " budde has chosen a 16th-century miniature painting of the prophet muhammad 's sandals for this room .
it is part of a larger indian and persian tradition that sees footprints as the presence of someone 's absence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " khusraw watches shirin bathing , " 16th century miniature the centerpiece of the room is a four-by-four-meter well of sand .
a dial moves around the circle continuously , creating grooves with one side and rubbing them out with the other . " it is not a show about religion , " said bruckstein , " for example the question of the feet leaving a trace of absence is not a religious question ; it is a question of leaving a trace .
the three artists in the room are having a conversation . " budde said that this kind of exhibition is rare , since european museum-goers are more familiar with christian art . " i hope that visitors from islamic countries will be interested to see what we dared to put together , to do what ca n't be done in some arabic countries , " said budde . the exhibition runs until january 18 , 2010 . author : tanya wood editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 12.11.2009 obama to outline new us role on east asia tour großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this will be obama 's first visit to asia as president obama is preparing to outline a new us role for asia as part of a week-long tour .
the focus is likely to be on trade and security issues with the us keen to boost its influence in the region . barack obama kicked off his first trip to asia as us president on friday , holding talks with japanese prime minister yukio hatoyama .
both were keen to stress their cooperation on a wide range of issues including nuclear non-proliferation and efforts to tackle climate change .
japan is one of america 's oldest allies in east asia , and obama highlighted that the alliance with japan was a " foundation " for peace and prosperity in the region .
nevertheless the newly elected democratic party does n't appear to be as supportive of a strong us-japan alliance , and has called for a smaller us military " footprint " on japanese soil . obama is due to give a major speech in tokyo on saturday outlining his ideas for america 's new role in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands demonstrated against a us military base on the japanese island of okinawa the week-long tour , which also includes stops in singapore , beijing and seoul , is intended to lay the groundwork for future cooperation , according to administration officials and analysts , and it marks a notable shift in us involvement in the region , where chinese influence has grown considerably in recent years .
" if you do not hold your ground in the pacific , you can not be a world leader , " remarked singapore 's former prime minister lee kuan yew in washington last week .
obama 's predecessor , george w. bush , was often perceived as ignoring asia 's economic growth - much to the chagrin of officials there .
now , obama will seek to assure the region of continued us engagement , but analysts say relations have grown more complex in wake of asia 's economic transformation .
indeed , just days after world leaders celebrated the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , which was widely interpreted as the triumph of western ideas , obama 's asia visit will highlight just how much has changed in two decades .
" china , especially during the past two years , -lsb- has -rsb- emerged as a global economic powerhouse , " cheng li , an expert on us-china relations at the brookings institution in washington , told deutsche welle .
" and it really came as a big surprise , although many china analysts had predicted china 's rise . " " the period -lsb- in which -rsb- china is a student lectured by the west is coming to an end , " he added . china poses new challenges obama called china " a vital partner , as well as a competitor " ahead of his departure , and his stops in beijing and shanghai are perhaps the most crucial legs of his tour .
china is america 's second largest trading partner - and its largest creditor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says he will meet the dalai lama after his china trip there have been several indicators ahead of obama 's visit that point to a power shift in us-china relations .
" a year ago , hillary clinton , during the campaign , argued that the united states should boycott our olympics , but now she 's become a spokesperson for the shanghai expo - she visited the shanghai expo site - so that tells you how dramatic change has been , " said cheng li . furthermore , obama declined to meet with the dalai lama last month during his trip to washington , making him the first president since 1991 to do so . recently , the us administration also backed the replacement of the g-8 group of wealthy industrialized nations with the g-20 , which includes china , to converge on matters of the global economy .

the focus is likely to be on trade and security issues with the us keen to boost its influence in the region . barack obama kicked off his first trip to asia as us president on friday , holding talks with japanese prime minister yukio hatoyama .
both were keen to stress their cooperation on a wide range of issues including nuclear non-proliferation and efforts to tackle climate change .
japan is one of america 's oldest allies in east asia , and obama highlighted that the alliance with japan was a " foundation " for peace and prosperity in the region .
nevertheless the newly elected democratic party does n't appear to be as supportive of a strong us-japan alliance , and has called for a smaller us military " footprint " on japanese soil . obama is due to give a major speech in tokyo on saturday outlining his ideas for america 's new role in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands demonstrated against a us military base on the japanese island of okinawa the week-long tour , which also includes stops in singapore , beijing and seoul , is intended to lay the groundwork for future cooperation , according to administration officials and analysts , and it marks a notable shift in us involvement in the region , where chinese influence has grown considerably in recent years .
" if you do not hold your ground in the pacific , you can not be a world leader , " remarked singapore 's former prime minister lee kuan yew in washington last week .
obama 's predecessor , george w. bush , was often perceived as ignoring asia 's economic growth - much to the chagrin of officials there .
now , obama will seek to assure the region of continued us engagement , but analysts say relations have grown more complex in wake of asia 's economic transformation .
indeed , just days after world leaders celebrated the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , which was widely interpreted as the triumph of western ideas , obama 's asia visit will highlight just how much has changed in two decades .
" china , especially during the past two years , -lsb- has -rsb- emerged as a global economic powerhouse , " cheng li , an expert on us-china relations at the brookings institution in washington , told deutsche welle .
" and it really came as a big surprise , although many china analysts had predicted china 's rise . " " the period -lsb- in which -rsb- china is a student lectured by the west is coming to an end , " he added . china poses new challenges obama called china " a vital partner , as well as a competitor " ahead of his departure , and his stops in beijing and shanghai are perhaps the most crucial legs of his tour .
china is america 's second largest trading partner - and its largest creditor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says he will meet the dalai lama after his china trip there have been several indicators ahead of obama 's visit that point to a power shift in us-china relations .
" a year ago , hillary clinton , during the campaign , argued that the united states should boycott our olympics , but now she 's become a spokesperson for the shanghai expo - she visited the shanghai expo site - so that tells you how dramatic change has been , " said cheng li . furthermore , obama declined to meet with the dalai lama last month during his trip to washington , making him the first president since 1991 to do so . recently , the us administration also backed the replacement of the g-8 group of wealthy industrialized nations with the g-20 , which includes china , to converge on matters of the global economy .
but francois godement , an east asia expert at the european council on foreign relations , believes the hype about asia 's rise and america 's waning influence is overstated .

guttenberg was on his maiden visit to the country , where over 4,300 german troops are deployed . “ the karzai government has to fulfil certain conditions , " he asserted , adding that " we must see successes . " guttenberg , who assumed his new role as defense minister just over two weeks ago , had a busy schedule of meetings with president karzai , top nato commander gen. stanley mcchrystal , afghan defense minister abdul rahim wardak , the german ambassador to afghanistan , members of the eu police mission -lrb- eupol -rrb- , as well as the heads of german aid agencies and non-governmental organizations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tanks on maneuvers in mazar-i-sharif guttenberg also traveled to mazar-i-sharif , where some of the german troop contingent is stationed .
the minister reiterated recent comments in which he said that german soldiers were " at war " in the region .
his predecessor , franz josef jung , had always been careful to avoid that term . guttenberg said , however , that it was important to clearly explain to the troops and to the people at home what was going on in afghanistan . troops appreciate minister 's clear words his comments were welcomed by troops , with one of them saying that they " were exposed to danger every day and therefore it is appreciated when things are called by name . " guttenberg also made clear that he approved of the increased us elite troop activity in the region around kunduz where german troops were also deployed .
their presence had brought additional security and the coordination was good , he said . the defense minister is scheduled to fly to kunduz on friday to visit german reconstruction teams which are facing a growing taliban insurgency in their area . after his meeting with karzai , guttenberg said the topics discussed had included the widespread corruption in the country and the style of governance . guttenberg is the latest in a series of foreign ministers and world leaders who have publicly pressured karzai , coupling financial and military support to his willingness to battle corruption and tackle reforms . karzai is to be sworn in on november 19 for another five-year term , but under the increased scrutiny of the international community . large-scale fraud that marred the august 20 presidential election highlighted the scale of corruption in afghanistan 's government and has led to condemnation of karzai ’ s administration and demands that he tackle graft . change of strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 4,000 troops deployed in afghanistan guttenberg surprised many in germany soon after he assumed his new role as defense minister when he described germany 's engagement in afghanistan as a " combat operation . "
he told the mass-circulation bild newspaper that there was a " war " in afghanistan . guttenberg 's visit comes at a time of intensifying debate in germany over the bundeswehr mission in afghanistan , with berlin 's deployment of troops to the hindu kush region increasingly unpopular at home . it also follows news that a nato probe into a september airstrike that killed dozens of afghan civilians showed that the german commander who ordered it broke military rules of engagement the september 4 strike on fuel trucks in the northeastern kunduz province was the most deadly operation involving german troops since world war ii .
the attack was ordered by german colonel georg klein and carried out by a us fighter jet .
german federal prosecutors are set to look into the incident , after a nato report condemned the airstrike . the german army has backed klein 's decision , saying he acted out of concern for german troops , while guttenberg described the strike as " appropriate in military terms . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg heads the defense ministry at a time when the afghan mission is unpopular call for clear goals for nato ahead of his afghan trip , the german defense minister called for an international conference on afghanistan to set what he called " clear goals " for the nato-led alliance 's deployment there .
the comments come as us president barack obama weighs his country 's strategy for the afghan conflict , after tainted elections cast nato 's support of president hamid karzai into doubt .
" if we should have to realign our objectives after such a conference , then we would also have to think about our own capabilities there , " guttenberg said .
the german parliament is set to debate the renewal of the army 's afghanistan mandate before mid-december .
any increase of german troop levels that may be requested by the us when it has decided on its own strategy is bound to be highly controversial , given the public perception of the bundeswehr 's engagement there .
guttenberg also said : " we must not be shy about using the word exit strategy . " gb / rb / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while not criticizing his still-powerful predecessor , vladimir putin , medvedev recommended several breaks from putin 's legacy . while medvedvev pushed for reforms that would transform russia into a modern , democratic and economically diverse nation , he was careful to emphasize that the stability of the state remained the first priority .

but the complex nature of the soccer community , and the problems that go with it , make finding answers much more difficult . attempts to understand what led german goalkeeper robert enke to take his own life may never get to the core of the torment he was suffering .
some would even argue that it ’ s better not to try - and let the hanover soccer star rest in peace . it has become clear that enke 's psyche was damaged by intense personal tragedy , with the death of his baby daughter from a congenital heart problem three years ago , and that he had been battling depression for years , but what was truly going on inside his head will never be revealed . however , a tragic loss like this can also prompt some potentially constructive questions about whether he - or others who share his plight - have had enough access to help and support within the sport 's structure . many sports psychologists will say , though , that enke 's death must be seen in the wider context of suicide .
while enke worked in an arena with its own particular stresses and strains , suicide is the leading cause of death among young men . some argue that instead of focusing on the pressures that soccer may have heaped onto him , it might be worth noting that enke actually had better access to support , community , and care – through his teammates , club and international federation – than many other sufferers of depression could ever hope to have . but peter kay , the ceo of sporting chance , a uk-based independent clinic for athletes with addictions and psychological problems , believes that while clubs have made progress in providing support in recent years , fear of exposure keeps many players from talking about their problems . too tough to open up bildunterschrift : enke feared revealing the depth of his depression could damage his career " there has been a real change in clubs over the last five years where the player has started to be seen more as a human being with human problems , " kay told deutsche welle .
" as a result , the clubs have brought in their own psychologists .
but what the players are willing to share is limited by the fear that the psychologists are going to report back to the manager ; they fear that their condition will be made known to the club .
one player who recently came to sporting chance , with the knowledge of his club , had his contract torn up by the manager who said he was a weak link and that he didn ’ t want that in the club .
this is the fear the players have . " while senseless and tragic to all , enke 's death may also confuse many .
some outside the world of soccer will question how anyone with the adoration of thousands , the financial security the game provides and the self-worth that comes from reaching the pinnacle of any sport , could ever become depressed . for the fans who fill the world ’ s stadia , those players on the pitch in front of them are living the dream .
however , those same factors can also contribute to a player 's fragile state of mind . " players live in a total fantasy world , cocooned by the clubs from reality , " kay said .
" while the clubs and soccer in general are not to blame , they are culpable .
from the age of eight and nine in some cases , young players are given everything which the club hopes will make them into a star .
there are few top players who can have a normal life – they 're celebrities now – and they have never had to live in the real world .
what is hard is when they can not equate their image in a magazine with how they truly feel inside .
they see this image of this star but inside they have self-doubts and low self-esteem .
this can be very damaging . " insecurity over first team chances , career bildunterschrift : enke , once tipped to be germany 's no.1 , had lost his secure grip on that place through illness sport psychologists are well aware of the particular pressures that athletes have to contend with .
enke 's career was dominated by the extreme highs and lows that come with every life spent in the sporting arena .
he had to deal with the constant threat of injury , the pressure to perform , and – as he publicly admitted – the threat of being replaced by a younger , better player .
facing these pressures in a career that could so easily end in a split-second collision , enke found out that the dream was always perilously close to turning into a nightmare . " top players live with the constant fear of being dropped or replaced , " said kay .
" they get their self-esteem from playing in the first team , from scoring goals or contributing to the team 's success .
you take that away from them and the problems multiply .
if a player of 32- or 33-years of age is struggling to keep his emotions and problems in check while also worrying about his career , the pressure can be overwhelming . " stigma in macho world of soccer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teammates are n't always mates enke feared that he could eventually be usurped as a goalkeeper but also that any revelation of his depression could lead to his adopted daughter leila being removed from his care .
while support structures may have been there for him , it is likely that he felt that he could n't admit that something was wrong with him for fear of what might happen . " there 's a terrific stigma in soccer , as in society , that if you have mental health issues or suffer from depression , then you ’ re seen as weak , " said kay .
" this is exacerbated in the macho world of soccer which , contrary to popular opinion , is a very lonely and insular place .
these players do n't all socialize together ; they do n't have dinner together every night , they 're not all pals , it 's not all tight-knit at the clubs .
it 's a highly competitive world where it 's every man for himself .
players wo n't share problems because they fear they will be judged and that their ' weakness ' will be used against them .
so , as is the nature of depression , players will keep their feelings inside and will tell themselves they 'll get through it .
often they wo n't , not without help . " author : nick amies editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision will now pass to the european court of justice . in 2006 , the patent court partially rescinded a 1999 patent for the scientist 's method of creating nerve cells from embryonic stem cells . during the hearing on thursday , november 12 , the bgh 's presiding judge peter meier-beck pointed out that bruestle 's research methods did not break german law . however , the bgh will now leave it to the european court to provide the legal parameters on two key issues : the definition of a human embryo and whether every professional use of embryos that is consistent with the 1999 patent counts as “ industrial or commercial use ” of embryos . the german federal patent court ruled to partially reverse the 1999 patent after a challenge from the environmental activist group greenpeace , which has welcomed the move to provide clearer legal guidelines regarding embryos . the court said that anything culled from embryonic stem cells could not be patented , as it necessarily involved the destruction of human embryos . ethical minefield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver bruestle is one of germany 's leading stem cell researchers research on embryonic stem cells is allowed in germany , though the production of stem cell lines is banned .
scientists are only allowed access to lines imported before may 2007 . if the earlier court 's ruling is upheld , this would mean that german embryonic stem cell research could continue , but would not be protected by patents . " for german scientists , this means that their inventions could be picked up by foreign firms and , at the end of the day , also be used in germany , " bruestle , professor of reconstructive neurobiology at bonn university , told the german news magazine spiegel . he described as " bizarre " the fact that his research is approved and funded by the state , and that he even has to prove that he is making an effort to apply for patent protection .
" however , if i get my results patented , that is regarded as immoral . " the scientist wants to use his procedure to help find cures for diseases such as alzheimer 's and multiple sclerosis . concern about cloning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace says this will pave the way for commercial human cloning greenpeace , however , is concerned that the patenting of such research could lead to an " embryo industry . " the organization said that it is less concerned with the issue of stem cells , but with the commercialization of the human body .
greenpeace would like to legally clarify whether embryos are commercial goods . greenpeace patent expert christoph then told epd news agency that his organization was not concerned about the value of an invention , but its socio-economic effects . jg / gw / epd / dpa editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 12.11.2009 medvedev calls for reforms but tiptoes around putin 's legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is medvedev 's second state-of-the-nation address after his election in march 2008 russian president dmitry medvedev has called for a sweeping modernization of the country .
while not criticizing his still-powerful predecessor , vladimir putin , medvedev recommended several breaks from putin 's legacy . while medvedvev pushed for reforms that would transform russia into a modern , democratic and economically diverse nation , he was careful to emphasize that the stability of the state remained the first priority .
" in the 21st century , our country again requires modernization in all areas , and this will be the first time in our history when modernization will be based on the values and institutions of democracy , " he told an audience of about 1,000 political leaders in the kremlin 's ornate st. george hall .
he warned , however , that " any attempts to rock the boat , destabilize the government and rend society under slogans of democracy will be stopped . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's dependence on exports of raw materials must end , medvedev said with vladimir putin , the country 's current prime minister , sitting in the front row , the speech was closely watched for signs medvedev was moving away from the governing philosophy of his predecessor .
while forbes lists putin third on its list of the world 's most powerful people , medvedev is only ranked 43rd .
medvedev also pushed for an end to the paternalism that characterized the soviet union .
" instead of an archaic society in which leaders make all the decisions and rules , a society of intelligent , free and responsible people will emerge , " he said .
his proposals included consolidating russia 's 11 time zones , moving away from a dependence on natural resources such as oil and gas , and reducing the state role in the economy .
he criticized the government-run corporations that saw a resurgence under putin , saying such companies " have no future . "
he added that " inefficient companies must be liquidated . "
competitiveness in the russian economy is " shamefully low , " he said. hf / afp / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move has drawn condemnation from tehran . iran has condemned england 's oxford university for creating a scholarship in honor of neda agha-soltan , a 27-year-old philosophy student who was shot and killed over the summer during election protests in iran .
she became a symbol of the protests when her death was captured on video and viewed by millions on the internet .
in a letter sent to oxford from the iranian embassy in london , iran called the scholarship a " politically motivated move . "
the iranian government has repeatedly claimed that agha-soltan 's death was staged by enemies of the state .
oxford 's queen 's college created the neda agha soltan graduate scholarship in philosophy earlier this year , which is intended for philosophy students of iranian descent .
" the college is keen to support graduate students , " said professor paul madden , provost of queen 's college .
the scholarship will help iranian students to study at oxford , regardless of their financial background . he added : " donors make their own decisions , within reason , on how to name scholarships that they fund .
in this case , the donor who was instrumental in establishing the scholarship is a british citizen and is well known to the college . "

while not criticizing his still-powerful predecessor , vladimir putin , medvedev recommended several breaks from putin 's legacy . while medvedvev pushed for reforms that would transform russia into a modern , democratic and economically diverse nation , he was careful to emphasize that the stability of the state remained the first priority .
" in the 21st century , our country again requires modernization in all areas , and this will be the first time in our history when modernization will be based on the values and institutions of democracy , " he told an audience of about 1,000 political leaders in the kremlin 's ornate st. george hall .
he warned , however , that " any attempts to rock the boat , destabilize the government and rend society under slogans of democracy will be stopped . "

while forbes lists putin third on its list of the world 's most powerful people , medvedev is only ranked 43rd .
medvedev also pushed for an end to the paternalism that characterized the soviet union .
" instead of an archaic society in which leaders make all the decisions and rules , a society of intelligent , free and responsible people will emerge , " he said .
his proposals included consolidating russia 's 11 time zones , moving away from a dependence on natural resources such as oil and gas , and reducing the state role in the economy .
he criticized the government-run corporations that saw a resurgence under putin , saying such companies " have no future . "
he added that " inefficient companies must be liquidated . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 12.11.2009 obama to outline new us role on east asia tour großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this will be obama 's first visit to asia as president obama is preparing to outline a new us role for asia as part of a week-long tour .
the focus is likely to be on trade and security issues with the us keen to boost its influence in the region . barack obama kicked off his first trip to asia as us president on friday , holding talks with japanese prime minister yukio hatoyama .
both were keen to stress their cooperation on a wide range of issues including nuclear non-proliferation and efforts to tackle climate change .
japan is one of america 's oldest allies in east asia , and obama highlighted that the alliance with japan was a " foundation " for peace and prosperity in the region .
nevertheless the newly elected democratic party does n't appear to be as supportive of a strong us-japan alliance , and has called for a smaller us military " footprint " on japanese soil . obama is due to give a major speech in tokyo on saturday outlining his ideas for america 's new role in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands demonstrated against a us military base on the japanese island of okinawa the week-long tour , which also includes stops in singapore , beijing and seoul , is intended to lay the groundwork for future cooperation , according to administration officials and analysts , and it marks a notable shift in us involvement in the region , where chinese influence has grown considerably in recent years .
" if you do not hold your ground in the pacific , you can not be a world leader , " remarked singapore 's former prime minister lee kuan yew in washington last week .
obama 's predecessor , george w. bush , was often perceived as ignoring asia 's economic growth - much to the chagrin of officials there .
now , obama will seek to assure the region of continued us engagement , but analysts say relations have grown more complex in wake of asia 's economic transformation .
indeed , just days after world leaders celebrated the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , which was widely interpreted as the triumph of western ideas , obama 's asia visit will highlight just how much has changed in two decades .
" china , especially during the past two years , -lsb- has -rsb- emerged as a global economic powerhouse , " cheng li , an expert on us-china relations at the brookings institution in washington , told deutsche welle .
" and it really came as a big surprise , although many china analysts had predicted china 's rise . " " the period -lsb- in which -rsb- china is a student lectured by the west is coming to an end , " he added . china poses new challenges obama called china " a vital partner , as well as a competitor " ahead of his departure , and his stops in beijing and shanghai are perhaps the most crucial legs of his tour .
china is america 's second largest trading partner - and its largest creditor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says he will meet the dalai lama after his china trip there have been several indicators ahead of obama 's visit that point to a power shift in us-china relations .
" a year ago , hillary clinton , during the campaign , argued that the united states should boycott our olympics , but now she 's become a spokesperson for the shanghai expo - she visited the shanghai expo site - so that tells you how dramatic change has been , " said cheng li . furthermore , obama declined to meet with the dalai lama last month during his trip to washington , making him the first president since 1991 to do so . recently , the us administration also backed the replacement of the g-8 group of wealthy industrialized nations with the g-20 , which includes china , to converge on matters of the global economy .
but francois godement , an east asia expert at the european council on foreign relations , believes the hype about asia 's rise and america 's waning influence is overstated .
" i see us popularity increasing , not decreasing , and that 's the obama factor as you look at all of the opinion polls throughout asia - it 's a big change from a year ago , " godement told deutsche welle .
aside from economic matters , the us sees chinese cooperation as essential on two key issues : containing the nuclear ambitions of both north korea and iran , and negotiating a deal on carbon emissions caps at the upcoming climate summit in copenhagen .
mending strained relations in tough economic times in singapore , obama will participate in the leaders summit of the asia-pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- , where the aim will be to strengthen us ties with countries that form the asssociation of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- .
obama has agreed to engage with burma , opening the door for talks with asean leaders who had previously clashed with former president bush over the issue .
but the financial crisis will undoubtedly complicate obama 's agenda .
at a time when the us seeks to expand its influence in asia , obama would be hard-pressed to convince congress to support any new free-trade agreements .
many americans feel threatened by asia 's rise and the impact it will have on their jobs , especially during a period of record high unemployment .
analysts say they do n't expect any concrete achievements from the trip on any of the major issues - trade , non-nuclear proliferation , iran , afghanistan , north korea , and climate change - but asian leaders are said to be excited about renewed us interest in the region .

but a german agency has indexed rammstein 's new album , preventing young people from buying it . people younger than 18 can no longer buy rammstein 's new album " love is there for everyone , " according to a decision released this week by the federal department for media harmful to young persons .
the department cited the popular german band 's use of explicit , sado-masochistic imagery and texts as reasons for placing their album on the index .
the decision also prevents buyers from purchasing the album by mail and prohibits public advertisements for the cd .
members of rammstein , known both in germany and abroad for their heavy-metal music , expressed frustration with the department 's decision and charged it with having a " bourgeois understanding of art . "
a more conservative stance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images from rammstein 's new album have caused controversy some have also questioned whether indexing the album represents a public relations stunt that emphasizes the new german government ’ s more conservative politics .
ursula von der leyen , head of the federal ministry of familiy affairs and member of the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , directed the federal department for media harmful to young persons to come to a decision on the album .
the department issues its independent assessment of questionable media content presented to it by groups like schools , the police and youth organizations .
the department has not indexed an entire album from a famous german band since 1987 's " debil " by die aerzte .
however , the band 's themes do not seem to have prevented " love is there for everyone " from being a hit .
over 300,000 albums have been sold , and the cd continues to top german album charts. gw / dpa / afp editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move has drawn condemnation from tehran . iran has condemned england 's oxford university for creating a scholarship in honor of neda agha-soltan , a 27-year-old philosophy student who was shot and killed over the summer during election protests in iran .
she became a symbol of the protests when her death was captured on video and viewed by millions on the internet .
in a letter sent to oxford from the iranian embassy in london , iran called the scholarship a " politically motivated move . "
the iranian government has repeatedly claimed that agha-soltan 's death was staged by enemies of the state .
oxford 's queen 's college created the neda agha soltan graduate scholarship in philosophy earlier this year , which is intended for philosophy students of iranian descent .
" the college is keen to support graduate students , " said professor paul madden , provost of queen 's college .
the scholarship will help iranian students to study at oxford , regardless of their financial background . he added : " donors make their own decisions , within reason , on how to name scholarships that they fund .
in this case , the donor who was instrumental in establishing the scholarship is a british citizen and is well known to the college . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 12.11.2009 opinion : europe should seize on medvedev 's calls for modernization großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his annual state of the nation address , russian president dimitry medvedev called for sweeping internal reforms .
deutsche welle 's ingo mannteufel thinks this is a golden opportunity for the eu . the russian president did not mince his words as he described the socio-economic situation in russia .
he ranted at what he called the country 's " chronic backwardness , " the " lack of economic competitiveness , " the rampant corruption and the high level of dependency on gas and oil .
and there 's no arguing with his assessment .
all the problems he listed play a major part in russia 's failure to fulfill its potential and to offer its people a modern way of life .
his appeals for change appear to be the right way forward , including the modernization and strengthening of democratic values and institutions and his pledge to fight terrorism in the north caucasus region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel however , any approval and support for his ideas should not overshadow two important questions : can medvedev achieve his ambitious aims given the extent of corruption and state-run bureaucracy , and can russia undergo an economic and technological modernization without far-reaching political reforms ?
his remarks in that respect did little to inspire confidence .
although he criticized authoritarian structures on a regional level and demanded improvements for russia 's opposition parties , there was little of substance on radical political and legal reform .
kremlin experts will have noted with interest medvedev 's calls to overhaul russia 's state-run companies , the behemoths created by his predecessor , vladimir putin .
however , it would be wrong to interpret that as a deep rift between the two men .
a closer look reveals that medvedev 's drive to modernize the country 's economy is part of the strategy pursued by putin .
medvedev can take credit for trying to give those ideas more substance and for giving them a democratic platform , thereby allowing optimists to hope whereas realists will say it 's time for action , not words .
still , medvedev 's message offers the west , and germany in particular , a promising opportunity .
for the first time russia is not using ideology or military might to define its status as a world power , instead it 's looking at whether it can offer its people modern living conditions .
this means that russia is being forced to adopt a more cooperative position towards the outside world .
as medvedev himself put it : modernization can only be achieved through integration with the global economy .
and that 's why it was no surprise that foreign policy was hardly mentioned .
medvedev said russia 's foreign policy would merely be an instrument to secure the sweeping internal reforms he has called for .
historically this would indicate a significant paradigm shift .
the european union should use this chance by defining its own aims and stating how it intends to help russia achieve modernization .

guttenberg was on his maiden visit to the country , where over 4,300 german troops are deployed . “ the karzai government has to fulfil certain conditions , " he asserted , adding that " we must see successes . " guttenberg , who assumed his new role as defense minister just over two weeks ago , had a busy schedule of meetings with president karzai , top nato commander gen. stanley mcchrystal , afghan defense minister abdul rahim wardak , the german ambassador to afghanistan , members of the eu police mission -lrb- eupol -rrb- , as well as the heads of german aid agencies and non-governmental organizations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tanks on maneuvers in mazar-i-sharif guttenberg also traveled to mazar-i-sharif , where some of the german troop contingent is stationed .
the minister reiterated recent comments in which he said that german soldiers were " at war " in the region .
his predecessor , franz josef jung , had always been careful to avoid that term . guttenberg said , however , that it was important to clearly explain to the troops and to the people at home what was going on in afghanistan . troops appreciate minister 's clear words his comments were welcomed by troops , with one of them saying that they " were exposed to danger every day and therefore it is appreciated when things are called by name . " guttenberg also made clear that he approved of the increased us elite troop activity in the region around kunduz where german troops were also deployed .
their presence had brought additional security and the coordination was good , he said . the defense minister is scheduled to fly to kunduz on friday to visit german reconstruction teams which are facing a growing taliban insurgency in their area . after his meeting with karzai , guttenberg said the topics discussed had included the widespread corruption in the country and the style of governance . guttenberg is the latest in a series of foreign ministers and world leaders who have publicly pressured karzai , coupling financial and military support to his willingness to battle corruption and tackle reforms . karzai is to be sworn in on november 19 for another five-year term , but under the increased scrutiny of the international community . large-scale fraud that marred the august 20 presidential election highlighted the scale of corruption in afghanistan 's government and has led to condemnation of karzai ’ s administration and demands that he tackle graft . change of strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 4,000 troops deployed in afghanistan guttenberg surprised many in germany soon after he assumed his new role as defense minister when he described germany 's engagement in afghanistan as a " combat operation . "
he told the mass-circulation bild newspaper that there was a " war " in afghanistan . guttenberg 's visit comes at a time of intensifying debate in germany over the bundeswehr mission in afghanistan , with berlin 's deployment of troops to the hindu kush region increasingly unpopular at home . it also follows news that a nato probe into a september airstrike that killed dozens of afghan civilians showed that the german commander who ordered it broke military rules of engagement the september 4 strike on fuel trucks in the northeastern kunduz province was the most deadly operation involving german troops since world war ii .
the attack was ordered by german colonel georg klein and carried out by a us fighter jet .
german federal prosecutors are set to look into the incident , after a nato report condemned the airstrike . the german army has backed klein 's decision , saying he acted out of concern for german troops , while guttenberg described the strike as " appropriate in military terms . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg heads the defense ministry at a time when the afghan mission is unpopular call for clear goals for nato ahead of his afghan trip , the german defense minister called for an international conference on afghanistan to set what he called " clear goals " for the nato-led alliance 's deployment there .
the comments come as us president barack obama weighs his country 's strategy for the afghan conflict , after tainted elections cast nato 's support of president hamid karzai into doubt .
" if we should have to realign our objectives after such a conference , then we would also have to think about our own capabilities there , " guttenberg said .
the german parliament is set to debate the renewal of the army 's afghanistan mandate before mid-december .
any increase of german troop levels that may be requested by the us when it has decided on its own strategy is bound to be highly controversial , given the public perception of the bundeswehr 's engagement there .

deutsche welle 's ingo mannteufel thinks this is a golden opportunity for the eu . the russian president did not mince his words as he described the socio-economic situation in russia .
he ranted at what he called the country 's " chronic backwardness , " the " lack of economic competitiveness , " the rampant corruption and the high level of dependency on gas and oil .
and there 's no arguing with his assessment .
all the problems he listed play a major part in russia 's failure to fulfill its potential and to offer its people a modern way of life .
his appeals for change appear to be the right way forward , including the modernization and strengthening of democratic values and institutions and his pledge to fight terrorism in the north caucasus region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel however , any approval and support for his ideas should not overshadow two important questions : can medvedev achieve his ambitious aims given the extent of corruption and state-run bureaucracy , and can russia undergo an economic and technological modernization without far-reaching political reforms ?
his remarks in that respect did little to inspire confidence .
although he criticized authoritarian structures on a regional level and demanded improvements for russia 's opposition parties , there was little of substance on radical political and legal reform .
kremlin experts will have noted with interest medvedev 's calls to overhaul russia 's state-run companies , the behemoths created by his predecessor , vladimir putin .
however , it would be wrong to interpret that as a deep rift between the two men .
a closer look reveals that medvedev 's drive to modernize the country 's economy is part of the strategy pursued by putin .
medvedev can take credit for trying to give those ideas more substance and for giving them a democratic platform , thereby allowing optimists to hope whereas realists will say it 's time for action , not words .
still , medvedev 's message offers the west , and germany in particular , a promising opportunity .
for the first time russia is not using ideology or military might to define its status as a world power , instead it 's looking at whether it can offer its people modern living conditions .
this means that russia is being forced to adopt a more cooperative position towards the outside world .
as medvedev himself put it : modernization can only be achieved through integration with the global economy .
and that 's why it was no surprise that foreign policy was hardly mentioned .
medvedev said russia 's foreign policy would merely be an instrument to secure the sweeping internal reforms he has called for .
historically this would indicate a significant paradigm shift .
the european union should use this chance by defining its own aims and stating how it intends to help russia achieve modernization .

the move has drawn condemnation from tehran . iran has condemned england 's oxford university for creating a scholarship in honor of neda agha-soltan , a 27-year-old philosophy student who was shot and killed over the summer during election protests in iran .
she became a symbol of the protests when her death was captured on video and viewed by millions on the internet .
in a letter sent to oxford from the iranian embassy in london , iran called the scholarship a " politically motivated move . "
the iranian government has repeatedly claimed that agha-soltan 's death was staged by enemies of the state .
oxford 's queen 's college created the neda agha soltan graduate scholarship in philosophy earlier this year , which is intended for philosophy students of iranian descent .
" the college is keen to support graduate students , " said professor paul madden , provost of queen 's college .
the scholarship will help iranian students to study at oxford , regardless of their financial background . he added : " donors make their own decisions , within reason , on how to name scholarships that they fund .
in this case , the donor who was instrumental in establishing the scholarship is a british citizen and is well known to the college . "
the name of the donor has not been released. mz / afp / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 12.11.2009 medvedev calls for reforms but tiptoes around putin 's legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is medvedev 's second state-of-the-nation address after his election in march 2008 russian president dmitry medvedev has called for a sweeping modernization of the country .
while not criticizing his still-powerful predecessor , vladimir putin , medvedev recommended several breaks from putin 's legacy . while medvedvev pushed for reforms that would transform russia into a modern , democratic and economically diverse nation , he was careful to emphasize that the stability of the state remained the first priority .
" in the 21st century , our country again requires modernization in all areas , and this will be the first time in our history when modernization will be based on the values and institutions of democracy , " he told an audience of about 1,000 political leaders in the kremlin 's ornate st. george hall .
he warned , however , that " any attempts to rock the boat , destabilize the government and rend society under slogans of democracy will be stopped . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's dependence on exports of raw materials must end , medvedev said with vladimir putin , the country 's current prime minister , sitting in the front row , the speech was closely watched for signs medvedev was moving away from the governing philosophy of his predecessor .
while forbes lists putin third on its list of the world 's most powerful people , medvedev is only ranked 43rd .
medvedev also pushed for an end to the paternalism that characterized the soviet union .
" instead of an archaic society in which leaders make all the decisions and rules , a society of intelligent , free and responsible people will emerge , " he said .
his proposals included consolidating russia 's 11 time zones , moving away from a dependence on natural resources such as oil and gas , and reducing the state role in the economy .
he criticized the government-run corporations that saw a resurgence under putin , saying such companies " have no future . "
he added that " inefficient companies must be liquidated . "
competitiveness in the russian economy is " shamefully low , " he said. hf / afp / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

families of the victims have demanded he pay for this negligence . local prosecutors had intended only to fine joerg k. for not locking up the gun and the ammunition used in the rampage as required by law .
but relatives of the 15 victims killed at a school and a car dealership in southwestern germany demanded a trial , saying the father had shown " gross negligence " in giving his " mentally ill " son " access to a weapon and 400 rounds of ammunition . "
now the justice ministry of the state of baden-wuerttemberg has said the state prosecutor will instruct the local prosecutor to put the father on trial .
prosecutors will argue that the father 's criminal negligence led to the homicides .
on march 11 of this year , tim k. took his father 's beretta pistol to his former school in winnenden where he killed nine students and three teachers .
he then shot and killed a gardener before commandeering a car and driving to the nearby town of wendlingen where he gunned down two other people .
when police caught up with him , he shot and killed himself .

the for-profit venture between the otto group , a mail-order empire that does business in 20 countries with over 10 billion euros in annual sales last year , and the grameen bank , a microfinance lender , is intended to " give poor people in bangladesh the opportunity to free themselves from poverty , " said the statement .
" poor people are n't asking for charity because charity is n't a solution for poverty , " said yunus at a press event in otto 's home base of hamburg on wednesday .
" they want to work in order to earn their livelihood . "
the otto group is providing an interest-free loan of approximately two million euros to finance the factory 's construction and expects the loan to be repaid from the venture 's profits over a 10 to 15 year period .
for the profit of the workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nobel prize is not the only honor yunis has collected although the factory will operate on a for-profit basis , the first for-profit undertaking in grameen 's history , the profits will flow to a foundation whose mission will be to improve the living conditions of factory employees and their families and communities .
otto group chairman michael otto said the project should serve as a " model for textile production in bangladesh and similar factories in the rest of the world . "
yunus , an economist by training , began experimenting with small loans to help the very poorest members of society in the mid-1970s after his country had been devastated by natural disasters and a war of independence from pakistan .
he discovered very quickly that very small sums of money could have a transformative effect on the lives of the poor and that they lacked almost any access to affordable credit .
that insight led to the formation of a lending program which eventually became the grameen bank , which has lent over $ 8.4 billion -lrb- 5.6 billion euros -rrb- since its inception - with nearly 98 percent of the loans repaid , according to the bank .
about 97 percent of the borrowers are women , and part of the bank 's mission is to help empower women in bangladesh 's traditionally male-dominated society .
the bank 's success has led to imitators in over 40 countries worldwide , and in 2006 yunus was awarded the nobel peace prize for " efforts to create social and economic development from below .

japan is one of america 's oldest allies in east asia , and obama highlighted that the alliance with japan was a " foundation " for peace and prosperity in the region .
nevertheless the newly elected democratic party does n't appear to be as supportive of a strong us-japan alliance , and has called for a smaller us military " footprint " on japanese soil . obama is due to give a major speech in tokyo on saturday outlining his ideas for america 's new role in the region .

the decision will now pass to the european court of justice . in 2006 , the patent court partially rescinded a 1999 patent for the scientist 's method of creating nerve cells from embryonic stem cells . during the hearing on thursday , november 12 , the bgh 's presiding judge peter meier-beck pointed out that bruestle 's research methods did not break german law . however , the bgh will now leave it to the european court to provide the legal parameters on two key issues : the definition of a human embryo and whether every professional use of embryos that is consistent with the 1999 patent counts as “ industrial or commercial use ” of embryos . the german federal patent court ruled to partially reverse the 1999 patent after a challenge from the environmental activist group greenpeace , which has welcomed the move to provide clearer legal guidelines regarding embryos . the court said that anything culled from embryonic stem cells could not be patented , as it necessarily involved the destruction of human embryos . ethical minefield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver bruestle is one of germany 's leading stem cell researchers research on embryonic stem cells is allowed in germany , though the production of stem cell lines is banned .
scientists are only allowed access to lines imported before may 2007 . if the earlier court 's ruling is upheld , this would mean that german embryonic stem cell research could continue , but would not be protected by patents . " for german scientists , this means that their inventions could be picked up by foreign firms and , at the end of the day , also be used in germany , " bruestle , professor of reconstructive neurobiology at bonn university , told the german news magazine spiegel . he described as " bizarre " the fact that his research is approved and funded by the state , and that he even has to prove that he is making an effort to apply for patent protection .
" however , if i get my results patented , that is regarded as immoral . " the scientist wants to use his procedure to help find cures for diseases such as alzheimer 's and multiple sclerosis . concern about cloning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace says this will pave the way for commercial human cloning greenpeace , however , is concerned that the patenting of such research could lead to an " embryo industry . " the organization said that it is less concerned with the issue of stem cells , but with the commercialization of the human body .
greenpeace would like to legally clarify whether embryos are commercial goods . greenpeace patent expert christoph then told epd news agency that his organization was not concerned about the value of an invention , but its socio-economic effects . jg / gw / epd / dpa editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle 's ingo mannteufel thinks this is a golden opportunity for the eu . the russian president did not mince his words as he described the socio-economic situation in russia .
he ranted at what he called the country 's " chronic backwardness , " the " lack of economic competitiveness , " the rampant corruption and the high level of dependency on gas and oil .
and there 's no arguing with his assessment .
all the problems he listed play a major part in russia 's failure to fulfill its potential and to offer its people a modern way of life .
his appeals for change appear to be the right way forward , including the modernization and strengthening of democratic values and institutions and his pledge to fight terrorism in the north caucasus region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel however , any approval and support for his ideas should not overshadow two important questions : can medvedev achieve his ambitious aims given the extent of corruption and state-run bureaucracy , and can russia undergo an economic and technological modernization without far-reaching political reforms ?
his remarks in that respect did little to inspire confidence .
although he criticized authoritarian structures on a regional level and demanded improvements for russia 's opposition parties , there was little of substance on radical political and legal reform .
kremlin experts will have noted with interest medvedev 's calls to overhaul russia 's state-run companies , the behemoths created by his predecessor , vladimir putin .
however , it would be wrong to interpret that as a deep rift between the two men .
a closer look reveals that medvedev 's drive to modernize the country 's economy is part of the strategy pursued by putin .
medvedev can take credit for trying to give those ideas more substance and for giving them a democratic platform , thereby allowing optimists to hope whereas realists will say it 's time for action , not words .
still , medvedev 's message offers the west , and germany in particular , a promising opportunity .
for the first time russia is not using ideology or military might to define its status as a world power , instead it 's looking at whether it can offer its people modern living conditions .
this means that russia is being forced to adopt a more cooperative position towards the outside world .
as medvedev himself put it : modernization can only be achieved through integration with the global economy .
and that 's why it was no surprise that foreign policy was hardly mentioned .
medvedev said russia 's foreign policy would merely be an instrument to secure the sweeping internal reforms he has called for .
historically this would indicate a significant paradigm shift .
the european union should use this chance by defining its own aims and stating how it intends to help russia achieve modernization .

guttenberg was on his maiden visit to the country , where over 4,300 german troops are deployed . “ the karzai government has to fulfil certain conditions , " he asserted , adding that " we must see successes . " guttenberg , who assumed his new role as defense minister just over two weeks ago , had a busy schedule of meetings with president karzai , top nato commander gen. stanley mcchrystal , afghan defense minister abdul rahim wardak , the german ambassador to afghanistan , members of the eu police mission -lrb- eupol -rrb- , as well as the heads of german aid agencies and non-governmental organizations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tanks on maneuvers in mazar-i-sharif guttenberg also traveled to mazar-i-sharif , where some of the german troop contingent is stationed .
the minister reiterated recent comments in which he said that german soldiers were " at war " in the region .
his predecessor , franz josef jung , had always been careful to avoid that term . guttenberg said , however , that it was important to clearly explain to the troops and to the people at home what was going on in afghanistan . troops appreciate minister 's clear words his comments were welcomed by troops , with one of them saying that they " were exposed to danger every day and therefore it is appreciated when things are called by name . " guttenberg also made clear that he approved of the increased us elite troop activity in the region around kunduz where german troops were also deployed .
their presence had brought additional security and the coordination was good , he said . the defense minister is scheduled to fly to kunduz on friday to visit german reconstruction teams which are facing a growing taliban insurgency in their area . after his meeting with karzai , guttenberg said the topics discussed had included the widespread corruption in the country and the style of governance . guttenberg is the latest in a series of foreign ministers and world leaders who have publicly pressured karzai , coupling financial and military support to his willingness to battle corruption and tackle reforms . karzai is to be sworn in on november 19 for another five-year term , but under the increased scrutiny of the international community . large-scale fraud that marred the august 20 presidential election highlighted the scale of corruption in afghanistan 's government and has led to condemnation of karzai ’ s administration and demands that he tackle graft . change of strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 4,000 troops deployed in afghanistan guttenberg surprised many in germany soon after he assumed his new role as defense minister when he described germany 's engagement in afghanistan as a " combat operation . "
he told the mass-circulation bild newspaper that there was a " war " in afghanistan . guttenberg 's visit comes at a time of intensifying debate in germany over the bundeswehr mission in afghanistan , with berlin 's deployment of troops to the hindu kush region increasingly unpopular at home . it also follows news that a nato probe into a september airstrike that killed dozens of afghan civilians showed that the german commander who ordered it broke military rules of engagement the september 4 strike on fuel trucks in the northeastern kunduz province was the most deadly operation involving german troops since world war ii .
the attack was ordered by german colonel georg klein and carried out by a us fighter jet .
german federal prosecutors are set to look into the incident , after a nato report condemned the airstrike . the german army has backed klein 's decision , saying he acted out of concern for german troops , while guttenberg described the strike as " appropriate in military terms . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg heads the defense ministry at a time when the afghan mission is unpopular call for clear goals for nato ahead of his afghan trip , the german defense minister called for an international conference on afghanistan to set what he called " clear goals " for the nato-led alliance 's deployment there .
the comments come as us president barack obama weighs his country 's strategy for the afghan conflict , after tainted elections cast nato 's support of president hamid karzai into doubt .
" if we should have to realign our objectives after such a conference , then we would also have to think about our own capabilities there , " guttenberg said .
the german parliament is set to debate the renewal of the army 's afghanistan mandate before mid-december .
any increase of german troop levels that may be requested by the us when it has decided on its own strategy is bound to be highly controversial , given the public perception of the bundeswehr 's engagement there .
guttenberg also said : " we must not be shy about using the word exit strategy . " gb / rb / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the for-profit venture between the otto group , a mail-order empire that does business in 20 countries with over 10 billion euros in annual sales last year , and the grameen bank , a microfinance lender , is intended to " give poor people in bangladesh the opportunity to free themselves from poverty , " said the statement .
" poor people are n't asking for charity because charity is n't a solution for poverty , " said yunus at a press event in otto 's home base of hamburg on wednesday .
" they want to work in order to earn their livelihood . "
the otto group is providing an interest-free loan of approximately two million euros to finance the factory 's construction and expects the loan to be repaid from the venture 's profits over a 10 to 15 year period .
for the profit of the workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nobel prize is not the only honor yunis has collected although the factory will operate on a for-profit basis , the first for-profit undertaking in grameen 's history , the profits will flow to a foundation whose mission will be to improve the living conditions of factory employees and their families and communities .
otto group chairman michael otto said the project should serve as a " model for textile production in bangladesh and similar factories in the rest of the world . "
yunus , an economist by training , began experimenting with small loans to help the very poorest members of society in the mid-1970s after his country had been devastated by natural disasters and a war of independence from pakistan .
he discovered very quickly that very small sums of money could have a transformative effect on the lives of the poor and that they lacked almost any access to affordable credit .
that insight led to the formation of a lending program which eventually became the grameen bank , which has lent over $ 8.4 billion -lrb- 5.6 billion euros -rrb- since its inception - with nearly 98 percent of the loans repaid , according to the bank .
about 97 percent of the borrowers are women , and part of the bank 's mission is to help empower women in bangladesh 's traditionally male-dominated society .
the bank 's success has led to imitators in over 40 countries worldwide , and in 2006 yunus was awarded the nobel peace prize for " efforts to create social and economic development from below .

" for german scientists , this means that their inventions could be picked up by foreign firms and , at the end of the day , also be used in germany , " bruestle , professor of reconstructive neurobiology at bonn university , told the german news magazine spiegel . he described as " bizarre " the fact that his research is approved and funded by the state , and that he even has to prove that he is making an effort to apply for patent protection .
" however , if i get my results patented , that is regarded as immoral .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 12.11.2009 medvedev calls for reforms but tiptoes around putin 's legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is medvedev 's second state-of-the-nation address after his election in march 2008 russian president dmitry medvedev has called for a sweeping modernization of the country .
while not criticizing his still-powerful predecessor , vladimir putin , medvedev recommended several breaks from putin 's legacy . while medvedvev pushed for reforms that would transform russia into a modern , democratic and economically diverse nation , he was careful to emphasize that the stability of the state remained the first priority .
" in the 21st century , our country again requires modernization in all areas , and this will be the first time in our history when modernization will be based on the values and institutions of democracy , " he told an audience of about 1,000 political leaders in the kremlin 's ornate st. george hall .
he warned , however , that " any attempts to rock the boat , destabilize the government and rend society under slogans of democracy will be stopped . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's dependence on exports of raw materials must end , medvedev said with vladimir putin , the country 's current prime minister , sitting in the front row , the speech was closely watched for signs medvedev was moving away from the governing philosophy of his predecessor .
while forbes lists putin third on its list of the world 's most powerful people , medvedev is only ranked 43rd .
medvedev also pushed for an end to the paternalism that characterized the soviet union .
" instead of an archaic society in which leaders make all the decisions and rules , a society of intelligent , free and responsible people will emerge , " he said .
his proposals included consolidating russia 's 11 time zones , moving away from a dependence on natural resources such as oil and gas , and reducing the state role in the economy .
he criticized the government-run corporations that saw a resurgence under putin , saying such companies " have no future . "
he added that " inefficient companies must be liquidated . "
competitiveness in the russian economy is " shamefully low , " he said. hf / afp / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move has drawn condemnation from tehran . iran has condemned england 's oxford university for creating a scholarship in honor of neda agha-soltan , a 27-year-old philosophy student who was shot and killed over the summer during election protests in iran .
she became a symbol of the protests when her death was captured on video and viewed by millions on the internet .
in a letter sent to oxford from the iranian embassy in london , iran called the scholarship a " politically motivated move . "
the iranian government has repeatedly claimed that agha-soltan 's death was staged by enemies of the state .
oxford 's queen 's college created the neda agha soltan graduate scholarship in philosophy earlier this year , which is intended for philosophy students of iranian descent .
" the college is keen to support graduate students , " said professor paul madden , provost of queen 's college .
the scholarship will help iranian students to study at oxford , regardless of their financial background . he added : " donors make their own decisions , within reason , on how to name scholarships that they fund .
in this case , the donor who was instrumental in establishing the scholarship is a british citizen and is well known to the college . "

while not criticizing his still-powerful predecessor , vladimir putin , medvedev recommended several breaks from putin 's legacy . while medvedvev pushed for reforms that would transform russia into a modern , democratic and economically diverse nation , he was careful to emphasize that the stability of the state remained the first priority .
" in the 21st century , our country again requires modernization in all areas , and this will be the first time in our history when modernization will be based on the values and institutions of democracy , " he told an audience of about 1,000 political leaders in the kremlin 's ornate st. george hall .
he warned , however , that " any attempts to rock the boat , destabilize the government and rend society under slogans of democracy will be stopped . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's dependence on exports of raw materials must end , medvedev said with vladimir putin , the country 's current prime minister , sitting in the front row , the speech was closely watched for signs medvedev was moving away from the governing philosophy of his predecessor .
while forbes lists putin third on its list of the world 's most powerful people , medvedev is only ranked 43rd .
medvedev also pushed for an end to the paternalism that characterized the soviet union .
" instead of an archaic society in which leaders make all the decisions and rules , a society of intelligent , free and responsible people will emerge , " he said .
his proposals included consolidating russia 's 11 time zones , moving away from a dependence on natural resources such as oil and gas , and reducing the state role in the economy .
he criticized the government-run corporations that saw a resurgence under putin , saying such companies " have no future . "
he added that " inefficient companies must be liquidated . "
competitiveness in the russian economy is " shamefully low , " he said. hf / afp / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision will now pass to the european court of justice . in 2006 , the patent court partially rescinded a 1999 patent for the scientist 's method of creating nerve cells from embryonic stem cells . during the hearing on thursday , november 12 , the bgh 's presiding judge peter meier-beck pointed out that bruestle 's research methods did not break german law . however , the bgh will now leave it to the european court to provide the legal parameters on two key issues : the definition of a human embryo and whether every professional use of embryos that is consistent with the 1999 patent counts as “ industrial or commercial use ” of embryos . the german federal patent court ruled to partially reverse the 1999 patent after a challenge from the environmental activist group greenpeace , which has welcomed the move to provide clearer legal guidelines regarding embryos . the court said that anything culled from embryonic stem cells could not be patented , as it necessarily involved the destruction of human embryos . ethical minefield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver bruestle is one of germany 's leading stem cell researchers research on embryonic stem cells is allowed in germany , though the production of stem cell lines is banned .
scientists are only allowed access to lines imported before may 2007 . if the earlier court 's ruling is upheld , this would mean that german embryonic stem cell research could continue , but would not be protected by patents . " for german scientists , this means that their inventions could be picked up by foreign firms and , at the end of the day , also be used in germany , " bruestle , professor of reconstructive neurobiology at bonn university , told the german news magazine spiegel . he described as " bizarre " the fact that his research is approved and funded by the state , and that he even has to prove that he is making an effort to apply for patent protection .
" however , if i get my results patented , that is regarded as immoral . " the scientist wants to use his procedure to help find cures for diseases such as alzheimer 's and multiple sclerosis . concern about cloning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace says this will pave the way for commercial human cloning greenpeace , however , is concerned that the patenting of such research could lead to an " embryo industry . " the organization said that it is less concerned with the issue of stem cells , but with the commercialization of the human body .
greenpeace would like to legally clarify whether embryos are commercial goods . greenpeace patent expert christoph then told epd news agency that his organization was not concerned about the value of an invention , but its socio-economic effects . jg / gw / epd / dpa editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move has drawn condemnation from tehran . iran has condemned england 's oxford university for creating a scholarship in honor of neda agha-soltan , a 27-year-old philosophy student who was shot and killed over the summer during election protests in iran .
she became a symbol of the protests when her death was captured on video and viewed by millions on the internet .
in a letter sent to oxford from the iranian embassy in london , iran called the scholarship a " politically motivated move . "
the iranian government has repeatedly claimed that agha-soltan 's death was staged by enemies of the state .
oxford 's queen 's college created the neda agha soltan graduate scholarship in philosophy earlier this year , which is intended for philosophy students of iranian descent .
" the college is keen to support graduate students , " said professor paul madden , provost of queen 's college .
the scholarship will help iranian students to study at oxford , regardless of their financial background . he added : " donors make their own decisions , within reason , on how to name scholarships that they fund .
in this case , the donor who was instrumental in establishing the scholarship is a british citizen and is well known to the college . "

" this exhibition tries to undo these very strict and rude and basically violent boundaries created by this form of public discourse . " the exhibition is titled " taswir , " which , in arabic , persian and ottoman turkish means roughly " portrayal , likeness , drawing , or photograph . "
despite popular misconceptions , images are not absent from islamic tradition , bruckstein told deutsche welle .
the attitude toward images in islamic culture is ambivalent and has varied through history , she added . bildunterschrift : abdulnasser gharem 's " the path , " 2007 to understand the exhibition that has been painstakingly assembled by bruckstein , together with classical art historian hendrik budde , it is worth considering what it is not .
the structure of the show , which incorporates over 250 works , does not have a beginning or an end .
there is no chronology , it is not political , and most specifically , said bruckstein , it is not a study of religion . a poetic arrangement the exhibition 's 18 rooms have been set up based on an idea by aby warburg , a late 19th-century art historian - a first for a european gallery .
the concept , called the mnemosyne atlas , is a way of exhibiting art based on poetic association instead of chronology or theme . in addition to works by over 50 contemporary artists , classical islamic works are on loan from important national and international libraries and museums , including the hermitage in saint petersburg , the british museum and british library in london , the bibliotheque nationale de france , the calouste gulbenkian museum in lisbon and the museum of islamic art in berlin 's pergamon museum . " the mixing of classical and contemporary objects is absolutely new for me , " said budde .
" of course it was a struggle .
ms bruckstein was fighting for her contemporary works and i was begging , please do n't overwhelm my mostly - let 's face it - tiny classical objects .
but there are many rooms i am delighted by and the classical objects have , in fact , been heightened by their juxtaposition with the contemporary . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maliheh afnan 's " veiled minds , " 2006 not least of the classical artefacts assembled by classicist hendrik budde is a set of three painted korans , including an extremely rare 10th-century golden koran .
these examples were rare even in their day as korans are traditionally not decorated so as not to detract from the words . in some cases , however , visitors ca n't be sure whether they are looking at a classical or a modern piece , budde added - which may make them observe the objects more closely . unveiling art the exhibition asks the visitors to resist the temptation to compartmentalize islamic and european art . " i have never liked tags , " said palestinian-born artist maliheh afnan .
" i happen to be a woman , i happen to be an artist and i happen to be from the middle east .
there is all this talk nowadays about the veil and i thought about what we are hiding from within .
i think i prefer to deal with a person who veils their face and not themselves .
i think it is easier to deal with . " afnan has presented six works of calligraphy - a tradition she said is often connected to poetry as well as the koran .
even when using a very decorative script , religious texts or poetry always had to be readable .
afnan , however , has broken with this tradition .
she said her work is about the idea of writing itself , and is never actually readable . " i come from an ancient part of the world , so my work never looks fresh .
it looks weathered by time .
it is about the passage of time and about the ageing process , " said afnan . bildunterschrift : chant avedissian 's " the arab nation , " 2008 one of the exhibition 's strongest rooms , face and effaced face , is a play on the concept and idea of the veil .
the question here , said bruckstein , is what you see if you do n't have a regional , ethnic , or religious definition . at one end of the room is a 16th-century miniature of the prophet muhammad .
the picture shows a classically-veiled muhammad pointing at a full moon , which is traditionally a metaphor for beauty or perfection .
muhammad 's posture says : if you want to see me , look at the full moon . while the curators and artists are adamant that the show is neither about religion nor politics , this may not always be clear to the visitor .
the most recent piece in the room is a 2001 photo montage by palestinian artist taysir batniji , who was exiled from gaza and is now living in paris .
the photographs , taken black on black , depict the faces of 170 people killed by the israeli defence forces . bruckstein had to fight hard to get the art out of gaza .
she said that , even here , the focus is not on martyrdom but rather on engagement with the human face . life as a trace of absence in following with the exhibition 's method of poetic association , the show 's walls are scattered with sayings from thinkers and philosophers that define the theme or sentiment of each room .
one of them is from french philosopher jacques derrida , who said , " life must be thought of as a trace of absence . " budde has chosen a 16th-century miniature painting of the prophet muhammad 's sandals for this room .
it is part of a larger indian and persian tradition that sees footprints as the presence of someone 's absence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " khusraw watches shirin bathing , " 16th century miniature the centerpiece of the room is a four-by-four-meter well of sand .
a dial moves around the circle continuously , creating grooves with one side and rubbing them out with the other . " it is not a show about religion , " said bruckstein , " for example the question of the feet leaving a trace of absence is not a religious question ; it is a question of leaving a trace .
the three artists in the room are having a conversation . " budde said that this kind of exhibition is rare , since european museum-goers are more familiar with christian art . " i hope that visitors from islamic countries will be interested to see what we dared to put together , to do what ca n't be done in some arabic countries , " said budde . the exhibition runs until january 18 , 2010 . author : tanya wood editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the concept , called the mnemosyne atlas , is a way of exhibiting art based on poetic association instead of chronology or theme . in addition to works by over 50 contemporary artists , classical islamic works are on loan from important national and international libraries and museums , including the hermitage in saint petersburg , the british museum and british library in london , the bibliotheque nationale de france , the calouste gulbenkian museum in lisbon and the museum of islamic art in berlin 's pergamon museum . " the mixing of classical and contemporary objects is absolutely new for me , " said budde .
" of course it was a struggle .
ms bruckstein was fighting for her contemporary works and i was begging , please do n't overwhelm my mostly - let 's face it - tiny classical objects .
but there are many rooms i am delighted by and the classical objects have , in fact , been heightened by their juxtaposition with the contemporary . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maliheh afnan 's " veiled minds , " 2006 not least of the classical artefacts assembled by classicist hendrik budde is a set of three painted korans , including an extremely rare 10th-century golden koran .
these examples were rare even in their day as korans are traditionally not decorated so as not to detract from the words . in some cases , however , visitors ca n't be sure whether they are looking at a classical or a modern piece , budde added - which may make them observe the objects more closely . unveiling art the exhibition asks the visitors to resist the temptation to compartmentalize islamic and european art . " i have never liked tags , " said palestinian-born artist maliheh afnan .
" i happen to be a woman , i happen to be an artist and i happen to be from the middle east .
there is all this talk nowadays about the veil and i thought about what we are hiding from within .
i think i prefer to deal with a person who veils their face and not themselves .
i think it is easier to deal with . " afnan has presented six works of calligraphy - a tradition she said is often connected to poetry as well as the koran .
even when using a very decorative script , religious texts or poetry always had to be readable .
afnan , however , has broken with this tradition .
she said her work is about the idea of writing itself , and is never actually readable . " i come from an ancient part of the world , so my work never looks fresh .
it looks weathered by time .
it is about the passage of time and about the ageing process , " said afnan . bildunterschrift : chant avedissian 's " the arab nation , " 2008 one of the exhibition 's strongest rooms , face and effaced face , is a play on the concept and idea of the veil .
the question here , said bruckstein , is what you see if you do n't have a regional , ethnic , or religious definition . at one end of the room is a 16th-century miniature of the prophet muhammad .
the picture shows a classically-veiled muhammad pointing at a full moon , which is traditionally a metaphor for beauty or perfection .
muhammad 's posture says : if you want to see me , look at the full moon . while the curators and artists are adamant that the show is neither about religion nor politics , this may not always be clear to the visitor .
the most recent piece in the room is a 2001 photo montage by palestinian artist taysir batniji , who was exiled from gaza and is now living in paris .
the photographs , taken black on black , depict the faces of 170 people killed by the israeli defence forces . bruckstein had to fight hard to get the art out of gaza .
she said that , even here , the focus is not on martyrdom but rather on engagement with the human face . life as a trace of absence in following with the exhibition 's method of poetic association , the show 's walls are scattered with sayings from thinkers and philosophers that define the theme or sentiment of each room .
one of them is from french philosopher jacques derrida , who said , " life must be thought of as a trace of absence . " budde has chosen a 16th-century miniature painting of the prophet muhammad 's sandals for this room .
it is part of a larger indian and persian tradition that sees footprints as the presence of someone 's absence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " khusraw watches shirin bathing , " 16th century miniature the centerpiece of the room is a four-by-four-meter well of sand .
a dial moves around the circle continuously , creating grooves with one side and rubbing them out with the other . " it is not a show about religion , " said bruckstein , " for example the question of the feet leaving a trace of absence is not a religious question ; it is a question of leaving a trace .
the three artists in the room are having a conversation . " budde said that this kind of exhibition is rare , since european museum-goers are more familiar with christian art . " i hope that visitors from islamic countries will be interested to see what we dared to put together , to do what ca n't be done in some arabic countries , " said budde . the exhibition runs until january 18 , 2010 . author : tanya wood editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the concept , called the mnemosyne atlas , is a way of exhibiting art based on poetic association instead of chronology or theme . in addition to works by over 50 contemporary artists , classical islamic works are on loan from important national and international libraries and museums , including the hermitage in saint petersburg , the british museum and british library in london , the bibliotheque nationale de france , the calouste gulbenkian museum in lisbon and the museum of islamic art in berlin 's pergamon museum . " the mixing of classical and contemporary objects is absolutely new for me , " said budde .
" of course it was a struggle .
ms bruckstein was fighting for her contemporary works and i was begging , please do n't overwhelm my mostly - let 's face it - tiny classical objects .
but there are many rooms i am delighted by and the classical objects have , in fact , been heightened by their juxtaposition with the contemporary . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maliheh afnan 's " veiled minds , " 2006 not least of the classical artefacts assembled by classicist hendrik budde is a set of three painted korans , including an extremely rare 10th-century golden koran .
these examples were rare even in their day as korans are traditionally not decorated so as not to detract from the words . in some cases , however , visitors ca n't be sure whether they are looking at a classical or a modern piece , budde added - which may make them observe the objects more closely . unveiling art the exhibition asks the visitors to resist the temptation to compartmentalize islamic and european art . " i have never liked tags , " said palestinian-born artist maliheh afnan .
" i happen to be a woman , i happen to be an artist and i happen to be from the middle east .
there is all this talk nowadays about the veil and i thought about what we are hiding from within .
i think i prefer to deal with a person who veils their face and not themselves .
i think it is easier to deal with . " afnan has presented six works of calligraphy - a tradition she said is often connected to poetry as well as the koran .
even when using a very decorative script , religious texts or poetry always had to be readable .
afnan , however , has broken with this tradition .
she said her work is about the idea of writing itself , and is never actually readable . " i come from an ancient part of the world , so my work never looks fresh .
it looks weathered by time .
it is about the passage of time and about the ageing process , " said afnan . bildunterschrift : chant avedissian 's " the arab nation , " 2008 one of the exhibition 's strongest rooms , face and effaced face , is a play on the concept and idea of the veil .
the question here , said bruckstein , is what you see if you do n't have a regional , ethnic , or religious definition . at one end of the room is a 16th-century miniature of the prophet muhammad .
the picture shows a classically-veiled muhammad pointing at a full moon , which is traditionally a metaphor for beauty or perfection .
muhammad 's posture says : if you want to see me , look at the full moon . while the curators and artists are adamant that the show is neither about religion nor politics , this may not always be clear to the visitor .
the most recent piece in the room is a 2001 photo montage by palestinian artist taysir batniji , who was exiled from gaza and is now living in paris .
the photographs , taken black on black , depict the faces of 170 people killed by the israeli defence forces . bruckstein had to fight hard to get the art out of gaza .
she said that , even here , the focus is not on martyrdom but rather on engagement with the human face . life as a trace of absence in following with the exhibition 's method of poetic association , the show 's walls are scattered with sayings from thinkers and philosophers that define the theme or sentiment of each room .
one of them is from french philosopher jacques derrida , who said , " life must be thought of as a trace of absence . " budde has chosen a 16th-century miniature painting of the prophet muhammad 's sandals for this room .
it is part of a larger indian and persian tradition that sees footprints as the presence of someone 's absence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " khusraw watches shirin bathing , " 16th century miniature the centerpiece of the room is a four-by-four-meter well of sand .
a dial moves around the circle continuously , creating grooves with one side and rubbing them out with the other . " it is not a show about religion , " said bruckstein , " for example the question of the feet leaving a trace of absence is not a religious question ; it is a question of leaving a trace .
the three artists in the room are having a conversation . " budde said that this kind of exhibition is rare , since european museum-goers are more familiar with christian art . " i hope that visitors from islamic countries will be interested to see what we dared to put together , to do what ca n't be done in some arabic countries , " said budde . the exhibition runs until january 18 , 2010 . author : tanya wood editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move has drawn condemnation from tehran . iran has condemned england 's oxford university for creating a scholarship in honor of neda agha-soltan , a 27-year-old philosophy student who was shot and killed over the summer during election protests in iran .
she became a symbol of the protests when her death was captured on video and viewed by millions on the internet .

guttenberg was on his maiden visit to the country , where over 4,300 german troops are deployed . “ the karzai government has to fulfil certain conditions , " he asserted , adding that " we must see successes . " guttenberg , who assumed his new role as defense minister just over two weeks ago , had a busy schedule of meetings with president karzai , top nato commander gen. stanley mcchrystal , afghan defense minister abdul rahim wardak , the german ambassador to afghanistan , members of the eu police mission -lrb- eupol -rrb- , as well as the heads of german aid agencies and non-governmental organizations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tanks on maneuvers in mazar-i-sharif guttenberg also traveled to mazar-i-sharif , where some of the german troop contingent is stationed .
the minister reiterated recent comments in which he said that german soldiers were " at war " in the region .
his predecessor , franz josef jung , had always been careful to avoid that term . guttenberg said , however , that it was important to clearly explain to the troops and to the people at home what was going on in afghanistan . troops appreciate minister 's clear words his comments were welcomed by troops , with one of them saying that they " were exposed to danger every day and therefore it is appreciated when things are called by name . " guttenberg also made clear that he approved of the increased us elite troop activity in the region around kunduz where german troops were also deployed .
their presence had brought additional security and the coordination was good , he said . the defense minister is scheduled to fly to kunduz on friday to visit german reconstruction teams which are facing a growing taliban insurgency in their area . after his meeting with karzai , guttenberg said the topics discussed had included the widespread corruption in the country and the style of governance . guttenberg is the latest in a series of foreign ministers and world leaders who have publicly pressured karzai , coupling financial and military support to his willingness to battle corruption and tackle reforms . karzai is to be sworn in on november 19 for another five-year term , but under the increased scrutiny of the international community . large-scale fraud that marred the august 20 presidential election highlighted the scale of corruption in afghanistan 's government and has led to condemnation of karzai ’ s administration and demands that he tackle graft . change of strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 4,000 troops deployed in afghanistan guttenberg surprised many in germany soon after he assumed his new role as defense minister when he described germany 's engagement in afghanistan as a " combat operation . "
he told the mass-circulation bild newspaper that there was a " war " in afghanistan . guttenberg 's visit comes at a time of intensifying debate in germany over the bundeswehr mission in afghanistan , with berlin 's deployment of troops to the hindu kush region increasingly unpopular at home . it also follows news that a nato probe into a september airstrike that killed dozens of afghan civilians showed that the german commander who ordered it broke military rules of engagement the september 4 strike on fuel trucks in the northeastern kunduz province was the most deadly operation involving german troops since world war ii .
the attack was ordered by german colonel georg klein and carried out by a us fighter jet .
german federal prosecutors are set to look into the incident , after a nato report condemned the airstrike . the german army has backed klein 's decision , saying he acted out of concern for german troops , while guttenberg described the strike as " appropriate in military terms .

deutsche welle 's ingo mannteufel thinks this is a golden opportunity for the eu . the russian president did not mince his words as he described the socio-economic situation in russia .
he ranted at what he called the country 's " chronic backwardness , " the " lack of economic competitiveness , " the rampant corruption and the high level of dependency on gas and oil .
and there 's no arguing with his assessment .
all the problems he listed play a major part in russia 's failure to fulfill its potential and to offer its people a modern way of life .
his appeals for change appear to be the right way forward , including the modernization and strengthening of democratic values and institutions and his pledge to fight terrorism in the north caucasus region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel however , any approval and support for his ideas should not overshadow two important questions : can medvedev achieve his ambitious aims given the extent of corruption and state-run bureaucracy , and can russia undergo an economic and technological modernization without far-reaching political reforms ?
his remarks in that respect did little to inspire confidence .
although he criticized authoritarian structures on a regional level and demanded improvements for russia 's opposition parties , there was little of substance on radical political and legal reform .
kremlin experts will have noted with interest medvedev 's calls to overhaul russia 's state-run companies , the behemoths created by his predecessor , vladimir putin .
however , it would be wrong to interpret that as a deep rift between the two men .
a closer look reveals that medvedev 's drive to modernize the country 's economy is part of the strategy pursued by putin .
medvedev can take credit for trying to give those ideas more substance and for giving them a democratic platform , thereby allowing optimists to hope whereas realists will say it 's time for action , not words .
still , medvedev 's message offers the west , and germany in particular , a promising opportunity .
for the first time russia is not using ideology or military might to define its status as a world power , instead it 's looking at whether it can offer its people modern living conditions .
this means that russia is being forced to adopt a more cooperative position towards the outside world .
as medvedev himself put it : modernization can only be achieved through integration with the global economy .
and that 's why it was no surprise that foreign policy was hardly mentioned .
medvedev said russia 's foreign policy would merely be an instrument to secure the sweeping internal reforms he has called for .
historically this would indicate a significant paradigm shift .
the european union should use this chance by defining its own aims and stating how it intends to help russia achieve modernization .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 12.11.2009 top goalkeeper 's suicide exposes lonely , complex world of players with problems großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enke hid his depression despite help being at hand robert enke 's suicide has prompted many people to ask whether more could have been done to help .
but the complex nature of the soccer community , and the problems that go with it , make finding answers much more difficult . attempts to understand what led german goalkeeper robert enke to take his own life may never get to the core of the torment he was suffering .
some would even argue that it ’ s better not to try - and let the hanover soccer star rest in peace . it has become clear that enke 's psyche was damaged by intense personal tragedy , with the death of his baby daughter from a congenital heart problem three years ago , and that he had been battling depression for years , but what was truly going on inside his head will never be revealed . however , a tragic loss like this can also prompt some potentially constructive questions about whether he - or others who share his plight - have had enough access to help and support within the sport 's structure . many sports psychologists will say , though , that enke 's death must be seen in the wider context of suicide .
while enke worked in an arena with its own particular stresses and strains , suicide is the leading cause of death among young men . some argue that instead of focusing on the pressures that soccer may have heaped onto him , it might be worth noting that enke actually had better access to support , community , and care – through his teammates , club and international federation – than many other sufferers of depression could ever hope to have . but peter kay , the ceo of sporting chance , a uk-based independent clinic for athletes with addictions and psychological problems , believes that while clubs have made progress in providing support in recent years , fear of exposure keeps many players from talking about their problems . too tough to open up bildunterschrift : enke feared revealing the depth of his depression could damage his career " there has been a real change in clubs over the last five years where the player has started to be seen more as a human being with human problems , " kay told deutsche welle .
" as a result , the clubs have brought in their own psychologists .
but what the players are willing to share is limited by the fear that the psychologists are going to report back to the manager ; they fear that their condition will be made known to the club .
one player who recently came to sporting chance , with the knowledge of his club , had his contract torn up by the manager who said he was a weak link and that he didn ’ t want that in the club .
this is the fear the players have . " while senseless and tragic to all , enke 's death may also confuse many .
some outside the world of soccer will question how anyone with the adoration of thousands , the financial security the game provides and the self-worth that comes from reaching the pinnacle of any sport , could ever become depressed . for the fans who fill the world ’ s stadia , those players on the pitch in front of them are living the dream .
however , those same factors can also contribute to a player 's fragile state of mind . " players live in a total fantasy world , cocooned by the clubs from reality , " kay said .
" while the clubs and soccer in general are not to blame , they are culpable .
from the age of eight and nine in some cases , young players are given everything which the club hopes will make them into a star .
there are few top players who can have a normal life – they 're celebrities now – and they have never had to live in the real world .
what is hard is when they can not equate their image in a magazine with how they truly feel inside .
they see this image of this star but inside they have self-doubts and low self-esteem .
this can be very damaging . " insecurity over first team chances , career bildunterschrift : enke , once tipped to be germany 's no.1 , had lost his secure grip on that place through illness sport psychologists are well aware of the particular pressures that athletes have to contend with .
enke 's career was dominated by the extreme highs and lows that come with every life spent in the sporting arena .
he had to deal with the constant threat of injury , the pressure to perform , and – as he publicly admitted – the threat of being replaced by a younger , better player .
facing these pressures in a career that could so easily end in a split-second collision , enke found out that the dream was always perilously close to turning into a nightmare . " top players live with the constant fear of being dropped or replaced , " said kay .
" they get their self-esteem from playing in the first team , from scoring goals or contributing to the team 's success .
you take that away from them and the problems multiply .
if a player of 32- or 33-years of age is struggling to keep his emotions and problems in check while also worrying about his career , the pressure can be overwhelming . " stigma in macho world of soccer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teammates are n't always mates enke feared that he could eventually be usurped as a goalkeeper but also that any revelation of his depression could lead to his adopted daughter leila being removed from his care .
while support structures may have been there for him , it is likely that he felt that he could n't admit that something was wrong with him for fear of what might happen . " there 's a terrific stigma in soccer , as in society , that if you have mental health issues or suffer from depression , then you ’ re seen as weak , " said kay .
" this is exacerbated in the macho world of soccer which , contrary to popular opinion , is a very lonely and insular place .
these players do n't all socialize together ; they do n't have dinner together every night , they 're not all pals , it 's not all tight-knit at the clubs .
it 's a highly competitive world where it 's every man for himself .
players wo n't share problems because they fear they will be judged and that their ' weakness ' will be used against them .
so , as is the nature of depression , players will keep their feelings inside and will tell themselves they 'll get through it .
often they wo n't , not without help . " author : nick amies editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 12.11.2009 opinion : europe should seize on medvedev 's calls for modernization großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his annual state of the nation address , russian president dimitry medvedev called for sweeping internal reforms .
deutsche welle 's ingo mannteufel thinks this is a golden opportunity for the eu . the russian president did not mince his words as he described the socio-economic situation in russia .
he ranted at what he called the country 's " chronic backwardness , " the " lack of economic competitiveness , " the rampant corruption and the high level of dependency on gas and oil .
and there 's no arguing with his assessment .
all the problems he listed play a major part in russia 's failure to fulfill its potential and to offer its people a modern way of life .
his appeals for change appear to be the right way forward , including the modernization and strengthening of democratic values and institutions and his pledge to fight terrorism in the north caucasus region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel however , any approval and support for his ideas should not overshadow two important questions : can medvedev achieve his ambitious aims given the extent of corruption and state-run bureaucracy , and can russia undergo an economic and technological modernization without far-reaching political reforms ?
his remarks in that respect did little to inspire confidence .
although he criticized authoritarian structures on a regional level and demanded improvements for russia 's opposition parties , there was little of substance on radical political and legal reform .
kremlin experts will have noted with interest medvedev 's calls to overhaul russia 's state-run companies , the behemoths created by his predecessor , vladimir putin .
however , it would be wrong to interpret that as a deep rift between the two men .
a closer look reveals that medvedev 's drive to modernize the country 's economy is part of the strategy pursued by putin .
medvedev can take credit for trying to give those ideas more substance and for giving them a democratic platform , thereby allowing optimists to hope whereas realists will say it 's time for action , not words .
still , medvedev 's message offers the west , and germany in particular , a promising opportunity .
for the first time russia is not using ideology or military might to define its status as a world power , instead it 's looking at whether it can offer its people modern living conditions .
this means that russia is being forced to adopt a more cooperative position towards the outside world .
as medvedev himself put it : modernization can only be achieved through integration with the global economy .
and that 's why it was no surprise that foreign policy was hardly mentioned .
medvedev said russia 's foreign policy would merely be an instrument to secure the sweeping internal reforms he has called for .
historically this would indicate a significant paradigm shift .
the european union should use this chance by defining its own aims and stating how it intends to help russia achieve modernization .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 12.11.2009 obama to outline new us role on east asia tour großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this will be obama 's first visit to asia as president obama is preparing to outline a new us role for asia as part of a week-long tour .
the focus is likely to be on trade and security issues with the us keen to boost its influence in the region . barack obama kicked off his first trip to asia as us president on friday , holding talks with japanese prime minister yukio hatoyama .
both were keen to stress their cooperation on a wide range of issues including nuclear non-proliferation and efforts to tackle climate change .
japan is one of america 's oldest allies in east asia , and obama highlighted that the alliance with japan was a " foundation " for peace and prosperity in the region .
nevertheless the newly elected democratic party does n't appear to be as supportive of a strong us-japan alliance , and has called for a smaller us military " footprint " on japanese soil . obama is due to give a major speech in tokyo on saturday outlining his ideas for america 's new role in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands demonstrated against a us military base on the japanese island of okinawa the week-long tour , which also includes stops in singapore , beijing and seoul , is intended to lay the groundwork for future cooperation , according to administration officials and analysts , and it marks a notable shift in us involvement in the region , where chinese influence has grown considerably in recent years .
" if you do not hold your ground in the pacific , you can not be a world leader , " remarked singapore 's former prime minister lee kuan yew in washington last week .
obama 's predecessor , george w. bush , was often perceived as ignoring asia 's economic growth - much to the chagrin of officials there .
now , obama will seek to assure the region of continued us engagement , but analysts say relations have grown more complex in wake of asia 's economic transformation .
indeed , just days after world leaders celebrated the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , which was widely interpreted as the triumph of western ideas , obama 's asia visit will highlight just how much has changed in two decades .
" china , especially during the past two years , -lsb- has -rsb- emerged as a global economic powerhouse , " cheng li , an expert on us-china relations at the brookings institution in washington , told deutsche welle .
" and it really came as a big surprise , although many china analysts had predicted china 's rise . " " the period -lsb- in which -rsb- china is a student lectured by the west is coming to an end , " he added . china poses new challenges obama called china " a vital partner , as well as a competitor " ahead of his departure , and his stops in beijing and shanghai are perhaps the most crucial legs of his tour .
china is america 's second largest trading partner - and its largest creditor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says he will meet the dalai lama after his china trip there have been several indicators ahead of obama 's visit that point to a power shift in us-china relations .
" a year ago , hillary clinton , during the campaign , argued that the united states should boycott our olympics , but now she 's become a spokesperson for the shanghai expo - she visited the shanghai expo site - so that tells you how dramatic change has been , " said cheng li . furthermore , obama declined to meet with the dalai lama last month during his trip to washington , making him the first president since 1991 to do so . recently , the us administration also backed the replacement of the g-8 group of wealthy industrialized nations with the g-20 , which includes china , to converge on matters of the global economy .
but francois godement , an east asia expert at the european council on foreign relations , believes the hype about asia 's rise and america 's waning influence is overstated .
" i see us popularity increasing , not decreasing , and that 's the obama factor as you look at all of the opinion polls throughout asia - it 's a big change from a year ago , " godement told deutsche welle .
aside from economic matters , the us sees chinese cooperation as essential on two key issues : containing the nuclear ambitions of both north korea and iran , and negotiating a deal on carbon emissions caps at the upcoming climate summit in copenhagen .
mending strained relations in tough economic times in singapore , obama will participate in the leaders summit of the asia-pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- , where the aim will be to strengthen us ties with countries that form the asssociation of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- .
obama has agreed to engage with burma , opening the door for talks with asean leaders who had previously clashed with former president bush over the issue .
but the financial crisis will undoubtedly complicate obama 's agenda .
at a time when the us seeks to expand its influence in asia , obama would be hard-pressed to convince congress to support any new free-trade agreements .
many americans feel threatened by asia 's rise and the impact it will have on their jobs , especially during a period of record high unemployment .
analysts say they do n't expect any concrete achievements from the trip on any of the major issues - trade , non-nuclear proliferation , iran , afghanistan , north korea , and climate change - but asian leaders are said to be excited about renewed us interest in the region .

the focus is likely to be on trade and security issues with the us keen to boost its influence in the region . barack obama kicked off his first trip to asia as us president on friday , holding talks with japanese prime minister yukio hatoyama .
both were keen to stress their cooperation on a wide range of issues including nuclear non-proliferation and efforts to tackle climate change .
japan is one of america 's oldest allies in east asia , and obama highlighted that the alliance with japan was a " foundation " for peace and prosperity in the region .
nevertheless the newly elected democratic party does n't appear to be as supportive of a strong us-japan alliance , and has called for a smaller us military " footprint " on japanese soil . obama is due to give a major speech in tokyo on saturday outlining his ideas for america 's new role in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands demonstrated against a us military base on the japanese island of okinawa the week-long tour , which also includes stops in singapore , beijing and seoul , is intended to lay the groundwork for future cooperation , according to administration officials and analysts , and it marks a notable shift in us involvement in the region , where chinese influence has grown considerably in recent years .
" if you do not hold your ground in the pacific , you can not be a world leader , " remarked singapore 's former prime minister lee kuan yew in washington last week .
obama 's predecessor , george w. bush , was often perceived as ignoring asia 's economic growth - much to the chagrin of officials there .
now , obama will seek to assure the region of continued us engagement , but analysts say relations have grown more complex in wake of asia 's economic transformation .
indeed , just days after world leaders celebrated the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , which was widely interpreted as the triumph of western ideas , obama 's asia visit will highlight just how much has changed in two decades .
" china , especially during the past two years , -lsb- has -rsb- emerged as a global economic powerhouse , " cheng li , an expert on us-china relations at the brookings institution in washington , told deutsche welle .
" and it really came as a big surprise , although many china analysts had predicted china 's rise . " " the period -lsb- in which -rsb- china is a student lectured by the west is coming to an end , " he added . china poses new challenges obama called china " a vital partner , as well as a competitor " ahead of his departure , and his stops in beijing and shanghai are perhaps the most crucial legs of his tour .
china is america 's second largest trading partner - and its largest creditor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says he will meet the dalai lama after his china trip there have been several indicators ahead of obama 's visit that point to a power shift in us-china relations .
" a year ago , hillary clinton , during the campaign , argued that the united states should boycott our olympics , but now she 's become a spokesperson for the shanghai expo - she visited the shanghai expo site - so that tells you how dramatic change has been , " said cheng li . furthermore , obama declined to meet with the dalai lama last month during his trip to washington , making him the first president since 1991 to do so . recently , the us administration also backed the replacement of the g-8 group of wealthy industrialized nations with the g-20 , which includes china , to converge on matters of the global economy .
but francois godement , an east asia expert at the european council on foreign relations , believes the hype about asia 's rise and america 's waning influence is overstated .
" i see us popularity increasing , not decreasing , and that 's the obama factor as you look at all of the opinion polls throughout asia - it 's a big change from a year ago , " godement told deutsche welle .
aside from economic matters , the us sees chinese cooperation as essential on two key issues : containing the nuclear ambitions of both north korea and iran , and negotiating a deal on carbon emissions caps at the upcoming climate summit in copenhagen .
mending strained relations in tough economic times in singapore , obama will participate in the leaders summit of the asia-pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- , where the aim will be to strengthen us ties with countries that form the asssociation of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- .
obama has agreed to engage with burma , opening the door for talks with asean leaders who had previously clashed with former president bush over the issue .
but the financial crisis will undoubtedly complicate obama 's agenda .
at a time when the us seeks to expand its influence in asia , obama would be hard-pressed to convince congress to support any new free-trade agreements .
many americans feel threatened by asia 's rise and the impact it will have on their jobs , especially during a period of record high unemployment .
analysts say they do n't expect any concrete achievements from the trip on any of the major issues - trade , non-nuclear proliferation , iran , afghanistan , north korea , and climate change - but asian leaders are said to be excited about renewed us interest in the region .

the focus is likely to be on trade and security issues with the us keen to boost its influence in the region . barack obama kicked off his first trip to asia as us president on friday , holding talks with japanese prime minister yukio hatoyama .
both were keen to stress their cooperation on a wide range of issues including nuclear non-proliferation and efforts to tackle climate change .
japan is one of america 's oldest allies in east asia , and obama highlighted that the alliance with japan was a " foundation " for peace and prosperity in the region .
nevertheless the newly elected democratic party does n't appear to be as supportive of a strong us-japan alliance , and has called for a smaller us military " footprint " on japanese soil . obama is due to give a major speech in tokyo on saturday outlining his ideas for america 's new role in the region .

" if you do not hold your ground in the pacific , you can not be a world leader , " remarked singapore 's former prime minister lee kuan yew in washington last week .
obama 's predecessor , george w. bush , was often perceived as ignoring asia 's economic growth - much to the chagrin of officials there .
now , obama will seek to assure the region of continued us engagement , but analysts say relations have grown more complex in wake of asia 's economic transformation .
indeed , just days after world leaders celebrated the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , which was widely interpreted as the triumph of western ideas , obama 's asia visit will highlight just how much has changed in two decades .

but francois godement , an east asia expert at the european council on foreign relations , believes the hype about asia 's rise and america 's waning influence is overstated .
" i see us popularity increasing , not decreasing , and that 's the obama factor as you look at all of the opinion polls throughout asia - it 's a big change from a year ago , " godement told deutsche welle .
aside from economic matters , the us sees chinese cooperation as essential on two key issues : containing the nuclear ambitions of both north korea and iran , and negotiating a deal on carbon emissions caps at the upcoming climate summit in copenhagen .
mending strained relations in tough economic times in singapore , obama will participate in the leaders summit of the asia-pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- , where the aim will be to strengthen us ties with countries that form the asssociation of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- .
obama has agreed to engage with burma , opening the door for talks with asean leaders who had previously clashed with former president bush over the issue .
but the financial crisis will undoubtedly complicate obama 's agenda .
at a time when the us seeks to expand its influence in asia , obama would be hard-pressed to convince congress to support any new free-trade agreements .
many americans feel threatened by asia 's rise and the impact it will have on their jobs , especially during a period of record high unemployment .
analysts say they do n't expect any concrete achievements from the trip on any of the major issues - trade , non-nuclear proliferation , iran , afghanistan , north korea , and climate change - but asian leaders are said to be excited about renewed us interest in the region .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 12.11.2009 opinion : europe should seize on medvedev 's calls for modernization großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his annual state of the nation address , russian president dimitry medvedev called for sweeping internal reforms .
deutsche welle 's ingo mannteufel thinks this is a golden opportunity for the eu . the russian president did not mince his words as he described the socio-economic situation in russia .
he ranted at what he called the country 's " chronic backwardness , " the " lack of economic competitiveness , " the rampant corruption and the high level of dependency on gas and oil .
and there 's no arguing with his assessment .
all the problems he listed play a major part in russia 's failure to fulfill its potential and to offer its people a modern way of life .
his appeals for change appear to be the right way forward , including the modernization and strengthening of democratic values and institutions and his pledge to fight terrorism in the north caucasus region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel however , any approval and support for his ideas should not overshadow two important questions : can medvedev achieve his ambitious aims given the extent of corruption and state-run bureaucracy , and can russia undergo an economic and technological modernization without far-reaching political reforms ?
his remarks in that respect did little to inspire confidence .
although he criticized authoritarian structures on a regional level and demanded improvements for russia 's opposition parties , there was little of substance on radical political and legal reform .
kremlin experts will have noted with interest medvedev 's calls to overhaul russia 's state-run companies , the behemoths created by his predecessor , vladimir putin .
however , it would be wrong to interpret that as a deep rift between the two men .
a closer look reveals that medvedev 's drive to modernize the country 's economy is part of the strategy pursued by putin .
medvedev can take credit for trying to give those ideas more substance and for giving them a democratic platform , thereby allowing optimists to hope whereas realists will say it 's time for action , not words .
still , medvedev 's message offers the west , and germany in particular , a promising opportunity .
for the first time russia is not using ideology or military might to define its status as a world power , instead it 's looking at whether it can offer its people modern living conditions .
this means that russia is being forced to adopt a more cooperative position towards the outside world .
as medvedev himself put it : modernization can only be achieved through integration with the global economy .
and that 's why it was no surprise that foreign policy was hardly mentioned .
medvedev said russia 's foreign policy would merely be an instrument to secure the sweeping internal reforms he has called for .
historically this would indicate a significant paradigm shift .
the european union should use this chance by defining its own aims and stating how it intends to help russia achieve modernization .

the focus is likely to be on trade and security issues with the us keen to boost its influence in the region . barack obama kicked off his first trip to asia as us president on friday , holding talks with japanese prime minister yukio hatoyama .
both were keen to stress their cooperation on a wide range of issues including nuclear non-proliferation and efforts to tackle climate change .
japan is one of america 's oldest allies in east asia , and obama highlighted that the alliance with japan was a " foundation " for peace and prosperity in the region .
nevertheless the newly elected democratic party does n't appear to be as supportive of a strong us-japan alliance , and has called for a smaller us military " footprint " on japanese soil . obama is due to give a major speech in tokyo on saturday outlining his ideas for america 's new role in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands demonstrated against a us military base on the japanese island of okinawa the week-long tour , which also includes stops in singapore , beijing and seoul , is intended to lay the groundwork for future cooperation , according to administration officials and analysts , and it marks a notable shift in us involvement in the region , where chinese influence has grown considerably in recent years .
" if you do not hold your ground in the pacific , you can not be a world leader , " remarked singapore 's former prime minister lee kuan yew in washington last week .
obama 's predecessor , george w. bush , was often perceived as ignoring asia 's economic growth - much to the chagrin of officials there .
now , obama will seek to assure the region of continued us engagement , but analysts say relations have grown more complex in wake of asia 's economic transformation .
indeed , just days after world leaders celebrated the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , which was widely interpreted as the triumph of western ideas , obama 's asia visit will highlight just how much has changed in two decades .
" china , especially during the past two years , -lsb- has -rsb- emerged as a global economic powerhouse , " cheng li , an expert on us-china relations at the brookings institution in washington , told deutsche welle .
" and it really came as a big surprise , although many china analysts had predicted china 's rise . " " the period -lsb- in which -rsb- china is a student lectured by the west is coming to an end , " he added . china poses new challenges obama called china " a vital partner , as well as a competitor " ahead of his departure , and his stops in beijing and shanghai are perhaps the most crucial legs of his tour .
china is america 's second largest trading partner - and its largest creditor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says he will meet the dalai lama after his china trip there have been several indicators ahead of obama 's visit that point to a power shift in us-china relations .
" a year ago , hillary clinton , during the campaign , argued that the united states should boycott our olympics , but now she 's become a spokesperson for the shanghai expo - she visited the shanghai expo site - so that tells you how dramatic change has been , " said cheng li . furthermore , obama declined to meet with the dalai lama last month during his trip to washington , making him the first president since 1991 to do so . recently , the us administration also backed the replacement of the g-8 group of wealthy industrialized nations with the g-20 , which includes china , to converge on matters of the global economy .
but francois godement , an east asia expert at the european council on foreign relations , believes the hype about asia 's rise and america 's waning influence is overstated .
" i see us popularity increasing , not decreasing , and that 's the obama factor as you look at all of the opinion polls throughout asia - it 's a big change from a year ago , " godement told deutsche welle .
aside from economic matters , the us sees chinese cooperation as essential on two key issues : containing the nuclear ambitions of both north korea and iran , and negotiating a deal on carbon emissions caps at the upcoming climate summit in copenhagen .
mending strained relations in tough economic times in singapore , obama will participate in the leaders summit of the asia-pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- , where the aim will be to strengthen us ties with countries that form the asssociation of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- .
obama has agreed to engage with burma , opening the door for talks with asean leaders who had previously clashed with former president bush over the issue .
but the financial crisis will undoubtedly complicate obama 's agenda .
at a time when the us seeks to expand its influence in asia , obama would be hard-pressed to convince congress to support any new free-trade agreements .
many americans feel threatened by asia 's rise and the impact it will have on their jobs , especially during a period of record high unemployment .
analysts say they do n't expect any concrete achievements from the trip on any of the major issues - trade , non-nuclear proliferation , iran , afghanistan , north korea , and climate change - but asian leaders are said to be excited about renewed us interest in the region .

the focus is likely to be on trade and security issues with the us keen to boost its influence in the region . barack obama kicked off his first trip to asia as us president on friday , holding talks with japanese prime minister yukio hatoyama .
both were keen to stress their cooperation on a wide range of issues including nuclear non-proliferation and efforts to tackle climate change .
japan is one of america 's oldest allies in east asia , and obama highlighted that the alliance with japan was a " foundation " for peace and prosperity in the region .
nevertheless the newly elected democratic party does n't appear to be as supportive of a strong us-japan alliance , and has called for a smaller us military " footprint " on japanese soil . obama is due to give a major speech in tokyo on saturday outlining his ideas for america 's new role in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands demonstrated against a us military base on the japanese island of okinawa the week-long tour , which also includes stops in singapore , beijing and seoul , is intended to lay the groundwork for future cooperation , according to administration officials and analysts , and it marks a notable shift in us involvement in the region , where chinese influence has grown considerably in recent years .
" if you do not hold your ground in the pacific , you can not be a world leader , " remarked singapore 's former prime minister lee kuan yew in washington last week .
obama 's predecessor , george w. bush , was often perceived as ignoring asia 's economic growth - much to the chagrin of officials there .
now , obama will seek to assure the region of continued us engagement , but analysts say relations have grown more complex in wake of asia 's economic transformation .
indeed , just days after world leaders celebrated the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , which was widely interpreted as the triumph of western ideas , obama 's asia visit will highlight just how much has changed in two decades .
" china , especially during the past two years , -lsb- has -rsb- emerged as a global economic powerhouse , " cheng li , an expert on us-china relations at the brookings institution in washington , told deutsche welle .
" and it really came as a big surprise , although many china analysts had predicted china 's rise . " " the period -lsb- in which -rsb- china is a student lectured by the west is coming to an end , " he added . china poses new challenges obama called china " a vital partner , as well as a competitor " ahead of his departure , and his stops in beijing and shanghai are perhaps the most crucial legs of his tour .
china is america 's second largest trading partner - and its largest creditor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says he will meet the dalai lama after his china trip there have been several indicators ahead of obama 's visit that point to a power shift in us-china relations .
" a year ago , hillary clinton , during the campaign , argued that the united states should boycott our olympics , but now she 's become a spokesperson for the shanghai expo - she visited the shanghai expo site - so that tells you how dramatic change has been , " said cheng li . furthermore , obama declined to meet with the dalai lama last month during his trip to washington , making him the first president since 1991 to do so . recently , the us administration also backed the replacement of the g-8 group of wealthy industrialized nations with the g-20 , which includes china , to converge on matters of the global economy .
but francois godement , an east asia expert at the european council on foreign relations , believes the hype about asia 's rise and america 's waning influence is overstated .
" i see us popularity increasing , not decreasing , and that 's the obama factor as you look at all of the opinion polls throughout asia - it 's a big change from a year ago , " godement told deutsche welle .
aside from economic matters , the us sees chinese cooperation as essential on two key issues : containing the nuclear ambitions of both north korea and iran , and negotiating a deal on carbon emissions caps at the upcoming climate summit in copenhagen .
mending strained relations in tough economic times in singapore , obama will participate in the leaders summit of the asia-pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- , where the aim will be to strengthen us ties with countries that form the asssociation of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- .
obama has agreed to engage with burma , opening the door for talks with asean leaders who had previously clashed with former president bush over the issue .
but the financial crisis will undoubtedly complicate obama 's agenda .
at a time when the us seeks to expand its influence in asia , obama would be hard-pressed to convince congress to support any new free-trade agreements .
many americans feel threatened by asia 's rise and the impact it will have on their jobs , especially during a period of record high unemployment .
analysts say they do n't expect any concrete achievements from the trip on any of the major issues - trade , non-nuclear proliferation , iran , afghanistan , north korea , and climate change - but asian leaders are said to be excited about renewed us interest in the region .

deutsche welle 's ingo mannteufel thinks this is a golden opportunity for the eu . the russian president did not mince his words as he described the socio-economic situation in russia .
he ranted at what he called the country 's " chronic backwardness , " the " lack of economic competitiveness , " the rampant corruption and the high level of dependency on gas and oil .
and there 's no arguing with his assessment .
all the problems he listed play a major part in russia 's failure to fulfill its potential and to offer its people a modern way of life .
his appeals for change appear to be the right way forward , including the modernization and strengthening of democratic values and institutions and his pledge to fight terrorism in the north caucasus region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel however , any approval and support for his ideas should not overshadow two important questions : can medvedev achieve his ambitious aims given the extent of corruption and state-run bureaucracy , and can russia undergo an economic and technological modernization without far-reaching political reforms ?
his remarks in that respect did little to inspire confidence .
although he criticized authoritarian structures on a regional level and demanded improvements for russia 's opposition parties , there was little of substance on radical political and legal reform .
kremlin experts will have noted with interest medvedev 's calls to overhaul russia 's state-run companies , the behemoths created by his predecessor , vladimir putin .
however , it would be wrong to interpret that as a deep rift between the two men .
a closer look reveals that medvedev 's drive to modernize the country 's economy is part of the strategy pursued by putin .
medvedev can take credit for trying to give those ideas more substance and for giving them a democratic platform , thereby allowing optimists to hope whereas realists will say it 's time for action , not words .
still , medvedev 's message offers the west , and germany in particular , a promising opportunity .
for the first time russia is not using ideology or military might to define its status as a world power , instead it 's looking at whether it can offer its people modern living conditions .
this means that russia is being forced to adopt a more cooperative position towards the outside world .
as medvedev himself put it : modernization can only be achieved through integration with the global economy .
and that 's why it was no surprise that foreign policy was hardly mentioned .
medvedev said russia 's foreign policy would merely be an instrument to secure the sweeping internal reforms he has called for .
historically this would indicate a significant paradigm shift .
the european union should use this chance by defining its own aims and stating how it intends to help russia achieve modernization .

the works are meant to be taken at face value , without any political or religious overtones .
and stereotypes are to be left at the door . in the newest exhibition at the martin gropius bau in berlin , visitors are asked to take a fresh look at islamic culture . " it is now very common to speak of islamic culture in a way that reduces it , whether it is violence or a patriarchal culture or the veil , " said the exhibition 's head curator almut bruckstein coruh , who came from jerusalem to berlin to explore her own german-jewish background .
" this exhibition tries to undo these very strict and rude and basically violent boundaries created by this form of public discourse . " the exhibition is titled " taswir , " which , in arabic , persian and ottoman turkish means roughly " portrayal , likeness , drawing , or photograph . "
despite popular misconceptions , images are not absent from islamic tradition , bruckstein told deutsche welle .
the attitude toward images in islamic culture is ambivalent and has varied through history , she added . bildunterschrift : abdulnasser gharem 's " the path , " 2007 to understand the exhibition that has been painstakingly assembled by bruckstein , together with classical art historian hendrik budde , it is worth considering what it is not .
the structure of the show , which incorporates over 250 works , does not have a beginning or an end .
there is no chronology , it is not political , and most specifically , said bruckstein , it is not a study of religion . a poetic arrangement the exhibition 's 18 rooms have been set up based on an idea by aby warburg , a late 19th-century art historian - a first for a european gallery .
the concept , called the mnemosyne atlas , is a way of exhibiting art based on poetic association instead of chronology or theme . in addition to works by over 50 contemporary artists , classical islamic works are on loan from important national and international libraries and museums , including the hermitage in saint petersburg , the british museum and british library in london , the bibliotheque nationale de france , the calouste gulbenkian museum in lisbon and the museum of islamic art in berlin 's pergamon museum . " the mixing of classical and contemporary objects is absolutely new for me , " said budde .
" of course it was a struggle .
ms bruckstein was fighting for her contemporary works and i was begging , please do n't overwhelm my mostly - let 's face it - tiny classical objects .
but there are many rooms i am delighted by and the classical objects have , in fact , been heightened by their juxtaposition with the contemporary . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maliheh afnan 's " veiled minds , " 2006 not least of the classical artefacts assembled by classicist hendrik budde is a set of three painted korans , including an extremely rare 10th-century golden koran .
these examples were rare even in their day as korans are traditionally not decorated so as not to detract from the words . in some cases , however , visitors ca n't be sure whether they are looking at a classical or a modern piece , budde added - which may make them observe the objects more closely . unveiling art the exhibition asks the visitors to resist the temptation to compartmentalize islamic and european art . " i have never liked tags , " said palestinian-born artist maliheh afnan .
" i happen to be a woman , i happen to be an artist and i happen to be from the middle east .
there is all this talk nowadays about the veil and i thought about what we are hiding from within .
i think i prefer to deal with a person who veils their face and not themselves .
i think it is easier to deal with . " afnan has presented six works of calligraphy - a tradition she said is often connected to poetry as well as the koran .
even when using a very decorative script , religious texts or poetry always had to be readable .
afnan , however , has broken with this tradition .
she said her work is about the idea of writing itself , and is never actually readable . " i come from an ancient part of the world , so my work never looks fresh .
it looks weathered by time .
it is about the passage of time and about the ageing process , " said afnan . bildunterschrift : chant avedissian 's " the arab nation , " 2008 one of the exhibition 's strongest rooms , face and effaced face , is a play on the concept and idea of the veil .
the question here , said bruckstein , is what you see if you do n't have a regional , ethnic , or religious definition . at one end of the room is a 16th-century miniature of the prophet muhammad .
the picture shows a classically-veiled muhammad pointing at a full moon , which is traditionally a metaphor for beauty or perfection .
muhammad 's posture says : if you want to see me , look at the full moon . while the curators and artists are adamant that the show is neither about religion nor politics , this may not always be clear to the visitor .
the most recent piece in the room is a 2001 photo montage by palestinian artist taysir batniji , who was exiled from gaza and is now living in paris .
the photographs , taken black on black , depict the faces of 170 people killed by the israeli defence forces . bruckstein had to fight hard to get the art out of gaza .
she said that , even here , the focus is not on martyrdom but rather on engagement with the human face . life as a trace of absence in following with the exhibition 's method of poetic association , the show 's walls are scattered with sayings from thinkers and philosophers that define the theme or sentiment of each room .
one of them is from french philosopher jacques derrida , who said , " life must be thought of as a trace of absence . " budde has chosen a 16th-century miniature painting of the prophet muhammad 's sandals for this room .
it is part of a larger indian and persian tradition that sees footprints as the presence of someone 's absence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " khusraw watches shirin bathing , " 16th century miniature the centerpiece of the room is a four-by-four-meter well of sand .
a dial moves around the circle continuously , creating grooves with one side and rubbing them out with the other . " it is not a show about religion , " said bruckstein , " for example the question of the feet leaving a trace of absence is not a religious question ; it is a question of leaving a trace .
the three artists in the room are having a conversation . " budde said that this kind of exhibition is rare , since european museum-goers are more familiar with christian art . " i hope that visitors from islamic countries will be interested to see what we dared to put together , to do what ca n't be done in some arabic countries , " said budde . the exhibition runs until january 18 , 2010 . author : tanya wood editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a german agency has indexed rammstein 's new album , preventing young people from buying it . people younger than 18 can no longer buy rammstein 's new album " love is there for everyone , " according to a decision released this week by the federal department for media harmful to young persons .
the department cited the popular german band 's use of explicit , sado-masochistic imagery and texts as reasons for placing their album on the index .
the decision also prevents buyers from purchasing the album by mail and prohibits public advertisements for the cd .
members of rammstein , known both in germany and abroad for their heavy-metal music , expressed frustration with the department 's decision and charged it with having a " bourgeois understanding of art . "
a more conservative stance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images from rammstein 's new album have caused controversy some have also questioned whether indexing the album represents a public relations stunt that emphasizes the new german government ’ s more conservative politics .
ursula von der leyen , head of the federal ministry of familiy affairs and member of the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , directed the federal department for media harmful to young persons to come to a decision on the album .
the department issues its independent assessment of questionable media content presented to it by groups like schools , the police and youth organizations .
the department has not indexed an entire album from a famous german band since 1987 's " debil " by die aerzte .
however , the band 's themes do not seem to have prevented " love is there for everyone " from being a hit .
over 300,000 albums have been sold , and the cd continues to top german album charts. gw / dpa / afp editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle 's ingo mannteufel thinks this is a golden opportunity for the eu . the russian president did not mince his words as he described the socio-economic situation in russia .
he ranted at what he called the country 's " chronic backwardness , " the " lack of economic competitiveness , " the rampant corruption and the high level of dependency on gas and oil .
and there 's no arguing with his assessment .
all the problems he listed play a major part in russia 's failure to fulfill its potential and to offer its people a modern way of life .
his appeals for change appear to be the right way forward , including the modernization and strengthening of democratic values and institutions and his pledge to fight terrorism in the north caucasus region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel however , any approval and support for his ideas should not overshadow two important questions : can medvedev achieve his ambitious aims given the extent of corruption and state-run bureaucracy , and can russia undergo an economic and technological modernization without far-reaching political reforms ?
his remarks in that respect did little to inspire confidence .
although he criticized authoritarian structures on a regional level and demanded improvements for russia 's opposition parties , there was little of substance on radical political and legal reform .
kremlin experts will have noted with interest medvedev 's calls to overhaul russia 's state-run companies , the behemoths created by his predecessor , vladimir putin .
however , it would be wrong to interpret that as a deep rift between the two men .
a closer look reveals that medvedev 's drive to modernize the country 's economy is part of the strategy pursued by putin .
medvedev can take credit for trying to give those ideas more substance and for giving them a democratic platform , thereby allowing optimists to hope whereas realists will say it 's time for action , not words .
still , medvedev 's message offers the west , and germany in particular , a promising opportunity .
for the first time russia is not using ideology or military might to define its status as a world power , instead it 's looking at whether it can offer its people modern living conditions .
this means that russia is being forced to adopt a more cooperative position towards the outside world .
as medvedev himself put it : modernization can only be achieved through integration with the global economy .
and that 's why it was no surprise that foreign policy was hardly mentioned .
medvedev said russia 's foreign policy would merely be an instrument to secure the sweeping internal reforms he has called for .
historically this would indicate a significant paradigm shift .
the european union should use this chance by defining its own aims and stating how it intends to help russia achieve modernization .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 12.11.2009 berlin exhibition takes new approach to islamic art großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hale tenger 's video installation of balconies in beirut contrast with ancient islamic art a new berlin exhibition parallels ancient and contemporary islamic art .
the works are meant to be taken at face value , without any political or religious overtones .
and stereotypes are to be left at the door . in the newest exhibition at the martin gropius bau in berlin , visitors are asked to take a fresh look at islamic culture . " it is now very common to speak of islamic culture in a way that reduces it , whether it is violence or a patriarchal culture or the veil , " said the exhibition 's head curator almut bruckstein coruh , who came from jerusalem to berlin to explore her own german-jewish background .
" this exhibition tries to undo these very strict and rude and basically violent boundaries created by this form of public discourse . " the exhibition is titled " taswir , " which , in arabic , persian and ottoman turkish means roughly " portrayal , likeness , drawing , or photograph . "
despite popular misconceptions , images are not absent from islamic tradition , bruckstein told deutsche welle .
the attitude toward images in islamic culture is ambivalent and has varied through history , she added . bildunterschrift : abdulnasser gharem 's " the path , " 2007 to understand the exhibition that has been painstakingly assembled by bruckstein , together with classical art historian hendrik budde , it is worth considering what it is not .
the structure of the show , which incorporates over 250 works , does not have a beginning or an end .
there is no chronology , it is not political , and most specifically , said bruckstein , it is not a study of religion . a poetic arrangement the exhibition 's 18 rooms have been set up based on an idea by aby warburg , a late 19th-century art historian - a first for a european gallery .
the concept , called the mnemosyne atlas , is a way of exhibiting art based on poetic association instead of chronology or theme . in addition to works by over 50 contemporary artists , classical islamic works are on loan from important national and international libraries and museums , including the hermitage in saint petersburg , the british museum and british library in london , the bibliotheque nationale de france , the calouste gulbenkian museum in lisbon and the museum of islamic art in berlin 's pergamon museum . " the mixing of classical and contemporary objects is absolutely new for me , " said budde .
" of course it was a struggle .
ms bruckstein was fighting for her contemporary works and i was begging , please do n't overwhelm my mostly - let 's face it - tiny classical objects .
but there are many rooms i am delighted by and the classical objects have , in fact , been heightened by their juxtaposition with the contemporary . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maliheh afnan 's " veiled minds , " 2006 not least of the classical artefacts assembled by classicist hendrik budde is a set of three painted korans , including an extremely rare 10th-century golden koran .
these examples were rare even in their day as korans are traditionally not decorated so as not to detract from the words . in some cases , however , visitors ca n't be sure whether they are looking at a classical or a modern piece , budde added - which may make them observe the objects more closely . unveiling art the exhibition asks the visitors to resist the temptation to compartmentalize islamic and european art . " i have never liked tags , " said palestinian-born artist maliheh afnan .
" i happen to be a woman , i happen to be an artist and i happen to be from the middle east .
there is all this talk nowadays about the veil and i thought about what we are hiding from within .
i think i prefer to deal with a person who veils their face and not themselves .
i think it is easier to deal with . " afnan has presented six works of calligraphy - a tradition she said is often connected to poetry as well as the koran .
even when using a very decorative script , religious texts or poetry always had to be readable .
afnan , however , has broken with this tradition .
she said her work is about the idea of writing itself , and is never actually readable . " i come from an ancient part of the world , so my work never looks fresh .
it looks weathered by time .
it is about the passage of time and about the ageing process , " said afnan . bildunterschrift : chant avedissian 's " the arab nation , " 2008 one of the exhibition 's strongest rooms , face and effaced face , is a play on the concept and idea of the veil .
the question here , said bruckstein , is what you see if you do n't have a regional , ethnic , or religious definition . at one end of the room is a 16th-century miniature of the prophet muhammad .
the picture shows a classically-veiled muhammad pointing at a full moon , which is traditionally a metaphor for beauty or perfection .
muhammad 's posture says : if you want to see me , look at the full moon . while the curators and artists are adamant that the show is neither about religion nor politics , this may not always be clear to the visitor .
the most recent piece in the room is a 2001 photo montage by palestinian artist taysir batniji , who was exiled from gaza and is now living in paris .
the photographs , taken black on black , depict the faces of 170 people killed by the israeli defence forces . bruckstein had to fight hard to get the art out of gaza .
she said that , even here , the focus is not on martyrdom but rather on engagement with the human face . life as a trace of absence in following with the exhibition 's method of poetic association , the show 's walls are scattered with sayings from thinkers and philosophers that define the theme or sentiment of each room .
one of them is from french philosopher jacques derrida , who said , " life must be thought of as a trace of absence . " budde has chosen a 16th-century miniature painting of the prophet muhammad 's sandals for this room .
it is part of a larger indian and persian tradition that sees footprints as the presence of someone 's absence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " khusraw watches shirin bathing , " 16th century miniature the centerpiece of the room is a four-by-four-meter well of sand .
a dial moves around the circle continuously , creating grooves with one side and rubbing them out with the other . " it is not a show about religion , " said bruckstein , " for example the question of the feet leaving a trace of absence is not a religious question ; it is a question of leaving a trace .
the three artists in the room are having a conversation . " budde said that this kind of exhibition is rare , since european museum-goers are more familiar with christian art . " i hope that visitors from islamic countries will be interested to see what we dared to put together , to do what ca n't be done in some arabic countries , " said budde . the exhibition runs until january 18 , 2010 . author : tanya wood editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the works are meant to be taken at face value , without any political or religious overtones .
and stereotypes are to be left at the door . in the newest exhibition at the martin gropius bau in berlin , visitors are asked to take a fresh look at islamic culture . " it is now very common to speak of islamic culture in a way that reduces it , whether it is violence or a patriarchal culture or the veil , " said the exhibition 's head curator almut bruckstein coruh , who came from jerusalem to berlin to explore her own german-jewish background .
" this exhibition tries to undo these very strict and rude and basically violent boundaries created by this form of public discourse . " the exhibition is titled " taswir , " which , in arabic , persian and ottoman turkish means roughly " portrayal , likeness , drawing , or photograph . "
despite popular misconceptions , images are not absent from islamic tradition , bruckstein told deutsche welle .
the attitude toward images in islamic culture is ambivalent and has varied through history , she added . bildunterschrift : abdulnasser gharem 's " the path , " 2007 to understand the exhibition that has been painstakingly assembled by bruckstein , together with classical art historian hendrik budde , it is worth considering what it is not .
the structure of the show , which incorporates over 250 works , does not have a beginning or an end .
there is no chronology , it is not political , and most specifically , said bruckstein , it is not a study of religion . a poetic arrangement the exhibition 's 18 rooms have been set up based on an idea by aby warburg , a late 19th-century art historian - a first for a european gallery .
the concept , called the mnemosyne atlas , is a way of exhibiting art based on poetic association instead of chronology or theme . in addition to works by over 50 contemporary artists , classical islamic works are on loan from important national and international libraries and museums , including the hermitage in saint petersburg , the british museum and british library in london , the bibliotheque nationale de france , the calouste gulbenkian museum in lisbon and the museum of islamic art in berlin 's pergamon museum . " the mixing of classical and contemporary objects is absolutely new for me , " said budde .
" of course it was a struggle .
ms bruckstein was fighting for her contemporary works and i was begging , please do n't overwhelm my mostly - let 's face it - tiny classical objects .
but there are many rooms i am delighted by and the classical objects have , in fact , been heightened by their juxtaposition with the contemporary . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maliheh afnan 's " veiled minds , " 2006 not least of the classical artefacts assembled by classicist hendrik budde is a set of three painted korans , including an extremely rare 10th-century golden koran .
these examples were rare even in their day as korans are traditionally not decorated so as not to detract from the words . in some cases , however , visitors ca n't be sure whether they are looking at a classical or a modern piece , budde added - which may make them observe the objects more closely . unveiling art the exhibition asks the visitors to resist the temptation to compartmentalize islamic and european art . " i have never liked tags , " said palestinian-born artist maliheh afnan .
" i happen to be a woman , i happen to be an artist and i happen to be from the middle east .
there is all this talk nowadays about the veil and i thought about what we are hiding from within .
i think i prefer to deal with a person who veils their face and not themselves .
i think it is easier to deal with . " afnan has presented six works of calligraphy - a tradition she said is often connected to poetry as well as the koran .
even when using a very decorative script , religious texts or poetry always had to be readable .
afnan , however , has broken with this tradition .
she said her work is about the idea of writing itself , and is never actually readable . " i come from an ancient part of the world , so my work never looks fresh .
it looks weathered by time .
it is about the passage of time and about the ageing process , " said afnan . bildunterschrift : chant avedissian 's " the arab nation , " 2008 one of the exhibition 's strongest rooms , face and effaced face , is a play on the concept and idea of the veil .
the question here , said bruckstein , is what you see if you do n't have a regional , ethnic , or religious definition . at one end of the room is a 16th-century miniature of the prophet muhammad .
the picture shows a classically-veiled muhammad pointing at a full moon , which is traditionally a metaphor for beauty or perfection .
muhammad 's posture says : if you want to see me , look at the full moon . while the curators and artists are adamant that the show is neither about religion nor politics , this may not always be clear to the visitor .
the most recent piece in the room is a 2001 photo montage by palestinian artist taysir batniji , who was exiled from gaza and is now living in paris .
the photographs , taken black on black , depict the faces of 170 people killed by the israeli defence forces . bruckstein had to fight hard to get the art out of gaza .
she said that , even here , the focus is not on martyrdom but rather on engagement with the human face . life as a trace of absence in following with the exhibition 's method of poetic association , the show 's walls are scattered with sayings from thinkers and philosophers that define the theme or sentiment of each room .
one of them is from french philosopher jacques derrida , who said , " life must be thought of as a trace of absence . " budde has chosen a 16th-century miniature painting of the prophet muhammad 's sandals for this room .
it is part of a larger indian and persian tradition that sees footprints as the presence of someone 's absence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " khusraw watches shirin bathing , " 16th century miniature the centerpiece of the room is a four-by-four-meter well of sand .
a dial moves around the circle continuously , creating grooves with one side and rubbing them out with the other . " it is not a show about religion , " said bruckstein , " for example the question of the feet leaving a trace of absence is not a religious question ; it is a question of leaving a trace .
the three artists in the room are having a conversation . " budde said that this kind of exhibition is rare , since european museum-goers are more familiar with christian art . " i hope that visitors from islamic countries will be interested to see what we dared to put together , to do what ca n't be done in some arabic countries , " said budde . the exhibition runs until january 18 , 2010 . author : tanya wood editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i have never liked tags , " said palestinian-born artist maliheh afnan .
" i happen to be a woman , i happen to be an artist and i happen to be from the middle east .
there is all this talk nowadays about the veil and i thought about what we are hiding from within .
i think i prefer to deal with a person who veils their face and not themselves .
i think it is easier to deal with . " afnan has presented six works of calligraphy - a tradition she said is often connected to poetry as well as the koran .
even when using a very decorative script , religious texts or poetry always had to be readable .
afnan , however , has broken with this tradition .
she said her work is about the idea of writing itself , and is never actually readable . " i come from an ancient part of the world , so my work never looks fresh .
it looks weathered by time .
it is about the passage of time and about the ageing process , " said afnan . bildunterschrift : chant avedissian 's " the arab nation , " 2008 one of the exhibition 's strongest rooms , face and effaced face , is a play on the concept and idea of the veil .
the question here , said bruckstein , is what you see if you do n't have a regional , ethnic , or religious definition . at one end of the room is a 16th-century miniature of the prophet muhammad .
the picture shows a classically-veiled muhammad pointing at a full moon , which is traditionally a metaphor for beauty or perfection .
muhammad 's posture says : if you want to see me , look at the full moon . while the curators and artists are adamant that the show is neither about religion nor politics , this may not always be clear to the visitor .
the most recent piece in the room is a 2001 photo montage by palestinian artist taysir batniji , who was exiled from gaza and is now living in paris .
the photographs , taken black on black , depict the faces of 170 people killed by the israeli defence forces . bruckstein had to fight hard to get the art out of gaza .
she said that , even here , the focus is not on martyrdom but rather on engagement with the human face . life as a trace of absence in following with the exhibition 's method of poetic association , the show 's walls are scattered with sayings from thinkers and philosophers that define the theme or sentiment of each room .
one of them is from french philosopher jacques derrida , who said , " life must be thought of as a trace of absence . " budde has chosen a 16th-century miniature painting of the prophet muhammad 's sandals for this room .
it is part of a larger indian and persian tradition that sees footprints as the presence of someone 's absence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " khusraw watches shirin bathing , " 16th century miniature the centerpiece of the room is a four-by-four-meter well of sand .
a dial moves around the circle continuously , creating grooves with one side and rubbing them out with the other . " it is not a show about religion , " said bruckstein , " for example the question of the feet leaving a trace of absence is not a religious question ; it is a question of leaving a trace .
the three artists in the room are having a conversation . " budde said that this kind of exhibition is rare , since european museum-goers are more familiar with christian art . " i hope that visitors from islamic countries will be interested to see what we dared to put together , to do what ca n't be done in some arabic countries , " said budde . the exhibition runs until january 18 , 2010 . author : tanya wood editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move has drawn condemnation from tehran . iran has condemned england 's oxford university for creating a scholarship in honor of neda agha-soltan , a 27-year-old philosophy student who was shot and killed over the summer during election protests in iran .
she became a symbol of the protests when her death was captured on video and viewed by millions on the internet .
in a letter sent to oxford from the iranian embassy in london , iran called the scholarship a " politically motivated move . "
the iranian government has repeatedly claimed that agha-soltan 's death was staged by enemies of the state .
oxford 's queen 's college created the neda agha soltan graduate scholarship in philosophy earlier this year , which is intended for philosophy students of iranian descent .
" the college is keen to support graduate students , " said professor paul madden , provost of queen 's college .
the scholarship will help iranian students to study at oxford , regardless of their financial background . he added : " donors make their own decisions , within reason , on how to name scholarships that they fund .
in this case , the donor who was instrumental in establishing the scholarship is a british citizen and is well known to the college . "
the name of the donor has not been released. mz / afp / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the for-profit venture between the otto group , a mail-order empire that does business in 20 countries with over 10 billion euros in annual sales last year , and the grameen bank , a microfinance lender , is intended to " give poor people in bangladesh the opportunity to free themselves from poverty , " said the statement .
" poor people are n't asking for charity because charity is n't a solution for poverty , " said yunus at a press event in otto 's home base of hamburg on wednesday .
" they want to work in order to earn their livelihood . "
the otto group is providing an interest-free loan of approximately two million euros to finance the factory 's construction and expects the loan to be repaid from the venture 's profits over a 10 to 15 year period .
for the profit of the workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nobel prize is not the only honor yunis has collected although the factory will operate on a for-profit basis , the first for-profit undertaking in grameen 's history , the profits will flow to a foundation whose mission will be to improve the living conditions of factory employees and their families and communities .
otto group chairman michael otto said the project should serve as a " model for textile production in bangladesh and similar factories in the rest of the world . "
yunus , an economist by training , began experimenting with small loans to help the very poorest members of society in the mid-1970s after his country had been devastated by natural disasters and a war of independence from pakistan .
he discovered very quickly that very small sums of money could have a transformative effect on the lives of the poor and that they lacked almost any access to affordable credit .
that insight led to the formation of a lending program which eventually became the grameen bank , which has lent over $ 8.4 billion -lrb- 5.6 billion euros -rrb- since its inception - with nearly 98 percent of the loans repaid , according to the bank .
about 97 percent of the borrowers are women , and part of the bank 's mission is to help empower women in bangladesh 's traditionally male-dominated society .
the bank 's success has led to imitators in over 40 countries worldwide , and in 2006 yunus was awarded the nobel peace prize for " efforts to create social and economic development from below .

but the complex nature of the soccer community , and the problems that go with it , make finding answers much more difficult . attempts to understand what led german goalkeeper robert enke to take his own life may never get to the core of the torment he was suffering .
some would even argue that it ’ s better not to try - and let the hanover soccer star rest in peace . it has become clear that enke 's psyche was damaged by intense personal tragedy , with the death of his baby daughter from a congenital heart problem three years ago , and that he had been battling depression for years , but what was truly going on inside his head will never be revealed . however , a tragic loss like this can also prompt some potentially constructive questions about whether he - or others who share his plight - have had enough access to help and support within the sport 's structure . many sports psychologists will say , though , that enke 's death must be seen in the wider context of suicide .
while enke worked in an arena with its own particular stresses and strains , suicide is the leading cause of death among young men . some argue that instead of focusing on the pressures that soccer may have heaped onto him , it might be worth noting that enke actually had better access to support , community , and care – through his teammates , club and international federation – than many other sufferers of depression could ever hope to have . but peter kay , the ceo of sporting chance , a uk-based independent clinic for athletes with addictions and psychological problems , believes that while clubs have made progress in providing support in recent years , fear of exposure keeps many players from talking about their problems . too tough to open up bildunterschrift : enke feared revealing the depth of his depression could damage his career " there has been a real change in clubs over the last five years where the player has started to be seen more as a human being with human problems , " kay told deutsche welle .
" as a result , the clubs have brought in their own psychologists .
but what the players are willing to share is limited by the fear that the psychologists are going to report back to the manager ; they fear that their condition will be made known to the club .
one player who recently came to sporting chance , with the knowledge of his club , had his contract torn up by the manager who said he was a weak link and that he didn ’ t want that in the club .
this is the fear the players have . " while senseless and tragic to all , enke 's death may also confuse many .
some outside the world of soccer will question how anyone with the adoration of thousands , the financial security the game provides and the self-worth that comes from reaching the pinnacle of any sport , could ever become depressed . for the fans who fill the world ’ s stadia , those players on the pitch in front of them are living the dream .
however , those same factors can also contribute to a player 's fragile state of mind . " players live in a total fantasy world , cocooned by the clubs from reality , " kay said .
" while the clubs and soccer in general are not to blame , they are culpable .
from the age of eight and nine in some cases , young players are given everything which the club hopes will make them into a star .
there are few top players who can have a normal life – they 're celebrities now – and they have never had to live in the real world .
what is hard is when they can not equate their image in a magazine with how they truly feel inside .
they see this image of this star but inside they have self-doubts and low self-esteem .
this can be very damaging . " insecurity over first team chances , career bildunterschrift : enke , once tipped to be germany 's no.1 , had lost his secure grip on that place through illness sport psychologists are well aware of the particular pressures that athletes have to contend with .
enke 's career was dominated by the extreme highs and lows that come with every life spent in the sporting arena .
he had to deal with the constant threat of injury , the pressure to perform , and – as he publicly admitted – the threat of being replaced by a younger , better player .
facing these pressures in a career that could so easily end in a split-second collision , enke found out that the dream was always perilously close to turning into a nightmare . " top players live with the constant fear of being dropped or replaced , " said kay .
" they get their self-esteem from playing in the first team , from scoring goals or contributing to the team 's success .
you take that away from them and the problems multiply .
if a player of 32- or 33-years of age is struggling to keep his emotions and problems in check while also worrying about his career , the pressure can be overwhelming . " stigma in macho world of soccer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teammates are n't always mates enke feared that he could eventually be usurped as a goalkeeper but also that any revelation of his depression could lead to his adopted daughter leila being removed from his care .
while support structures may have been there for him , it is likely that he felt that he could n't admit that something was wrong with him for fear of what might happen . " there 's a terrific stigma in soccer , as in society , that if you have mental health issues or suffer from depression , then you ’ re seen as weak , " said kay .
" this is exacerbated in the macho world of soccer which , contrary to popular opinion , is a very lonely and insular place .
these players do n't all socialize together ; they do n't have dinner together every night , they 're not all pals , it 's not all tight-knit at the clubs .
it 's a highly competitive world where it 's every man for himself .
players wo n't share problems because they fear they will be judged and that their ' weakness ' will be used against them .
so , as is the nature of depression , players will keep their feelings inside and will tell themselves they 'll get through it .
often they wo n't , not without help . " author : nick amies editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

families of the victims have demanded he pay for this negligence . local prosecutors had intended only to fine joerg k. for not locking up the gun and the ammunition used in the rampage as required by law .
but relatives of the 15 victims killed at a school and a car dealership in southwestern germany demanded a trial , saying the father had shown " gross negligence " in giving his " mentally ill " son " access to a weapon and 400 rounds of ammunition . "
now the justice ministry of the state of baden-wuerttemberg has said the state prosecutor will instruct the local prosecutor to put the father on trial .
prosecutors will argue that the father 's criminal negligence led to the homicides .
on march 11 of this year , tim k. took his father 's beretta pistol to his former school in winnenden where he killed nine students and three teachers .
he then shot and killed a gardener before commandeering a car and driving to the nearby town of wendlingen where he gunned down two other people .
when police caught up with him , he shot and killed himself .

while not criticizing his still-powerful predecessor , vladimir putin , medvedev recommended several breaks from putin 's legacy . while medvedvev pushed for reforms that would transform russia into a modern , democratic and economically diverse nation , he was careful to emphasize that the stability of the state remained the first priority .
" in the 21st century , our country again requires modernization in all areas , and this will be the first time in our history when modernization will be based on the values and institutions of democracy , " he told an audience of about 1,000 political leaders in the kremlin 's ornate st. george hall .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 12.11.2009 opinion : europe should seize on medvedev 's calls for modernization großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his annual state of the nation address , russian president dimitry medvedev called for sweeping internal reforms .
deutsche welle 's ingo mannteufel thinks this is a golden opportunity for the eu . the russian president did not mince his words as he described the socio-economic situation in russia .
he ranted at what he called the country 's " chronic backwardness , " the " lack of economic competitiveness , " the rampant corruption and the high level of dependency on gas and oil .
and there 's no arguing with his assessment .
all the problems he listed play a major part in russia 's failure to fulfill its potential and to offer its people a modern way of life .
his appeals for change appear to be the right way forward , including the modernization and strengthening of democratic values and institutions and his pledge to fight terrorism in the north caucasus region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel however , any approval and support for his ideas should not overshadow two important questions : can medvedev achieve his ambitious aims given the extent of corruption and state-run bureaucracy , and can russia undergo an economic and technological modernization without far-reaching political reforms ?
his remarks in that respect did little to inspire confidence .
although he criticized authoritarian structures on a regional level and demanded improvements for russia 's opposition parties , there was little of substance on radical political and legal reform .
kremlin experts will have noted with interest medvedev 's calls to overhaul russia 's state-run companies , the behemoths created by his predecessor , vladimir putin .
however , it would be wrong to interpret that as a deep rift between the two men .
a closer look reveals that medvedev 's drive to modernize the country 's economy is part of the strategy pursued by putin .
medvedev can take credit for trying to give those ideas more substance and for giving them a democratic platform , thereby allowing optimists to hope whereas realists will say it 's time for action , not words .
still , medvedev 's message offers the west , and germany in particular , a promising opportunity .
for the first time russia is not using ideology or military might to define its status as a world power , instead it 's looking at whether it can offer its people modern living conditions .
this means that russia is being forced to adopt a more cooperative position towards the outside world .
as medvedev himself put it : modernization can only be achieved through integration with the global economy .
and that 's why it was no surprise that foreign policy was hardly mentioned .
medvedev said russia 's foreign policy would merely be an instrument to secure the sweeping internal reforms he has called for .
historically this would indicate a significant paradigm shift .
the european union should use this chance by defining its own aims and stating how it intends to help russia achieve modernization .

with important policy decisions on issues such as afghanistan waiting , barack obama is taking a week out of his tight schedule to visit east and southeast asia .
on friday , he 'll begin in tokyo and continue his tour in singapore , shanghai , beijing and seoul .
at the weekend , he 'll also attend two summits with leaders from all over the region . president obama , that 's what his advisers like to emphasize , has a special relationship with the asia-pacific region , having been born in hawaii and having spent his childhood and youth there as well as in indonesia .
maybe this will turn out to be useful in his bid to re-engage with a continent that has felt neglected by america to some extent .
it is a common perception in asia that the chinese footprint has become larger over the last decade , while american influence has been on the wane .
jeffrey bader of the us national security council explains : " during the period of asia 's emergence , the us has been substantially occupied with various fronts in the war on terror . "
engaging myanmar helps with asean now america is keen to show that it is back , and particularly in southeast asia .
on the sidelines of the asia-pacific economic cooperation or apec summit in singapore at the weekend , obama is set to hold the first ever summit meeting of a us president with leaders of the ten asean countries .
these include the junta of the internationally isolated myanmar .
prime minister general thein sein is expected in singapore , and as secretary of state hillary clinton has said , an opportunity for him to talk with her or even obama might well arise .
this would have been unthinkable under the previous bush administration .
robert sutter , an expert on asia at georgetown university in washington says : " now the obama administration has a more flexible approach , which allows a free interaction with all the leaders of the asean members , and that 's very helpful in the administration 's approach to dealing with the entire region ! "
controversial military presence obama will begin his political meetings in tokyo on friday .
in japan , he will have to address concerns within the newly elected hatoyama government about the us troops stationed on the island of okinawa .
obama 's top asia aide jeffrey bader says , " populations in our key allies in northeast asia support the alliances , but they want more equal partnerships with a lighter us military footprint .
that is why we are reconfiguring our presence in japan and south korea . "
even if major changes in troop deployment are expected neither in japan nor in south korea , the obama administration has been showing a new readiness to listen to the views of its allies - also with regard to north korea , an area where both japan and south korea felt out of the loop repeatedly during the last years .
jeffrey bader says the obama administration has taken a different approach here as well : " from day one , we have been scrupulous about building consensus with our allies on north korea policy , genuinely soliciting their views , sitting down with them before we made a decision , not just afterwards , and never making a move without thorough discussions . "
before returning home from south korea next week , obama will also visit china on possibly the most challenging leg of his asia trip .

while not criticizing his still-powerful predecessor , vladimir putin , medvedev recommended several breaks from putin 's legacy . while medvedvev pushed for reforms that would transform russia into a modern , democratic and economically diverse nation , he was careful to emphasize that the stability of the state remained the first priority .
" in the 21st century , our country again requires modernization in all areas , and this will be the first time in our history when modernization will be based on the values and institutions of democracy , " he told an audience of about 1,000 political leaders in the kremlin 's ornate st. george hall .
he warned , however , that " any attempts to rock the boat , destabilize the government and rend society under slogans of democracy will be stopped . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's dependence on exports of raw materials must end , medvedev said with vladimir putin , the country 's current prime minister , sitting in the front row , the speech was closely watched for signs medvedev was moving away from the governing philosophy of his predecessor .
while forbes lists putin third on its list of the world 's most powerful people , medvedev is only ranked 43rd .
medvedev also pushed for an end to the paternalism that characterized the soviet union .
" instead of an archaic society in which leaders make all the decisions and rules , a society of intelligent , free and responsible people will emerge , " he said .
his proposals included consolidating russia 's 11 time zones , moving away from a dependence on natural resources such as oil and gas , and reducing the state role in the economy .
he criticized the government-run corporations that saw a resurgence under putin , saying such companies " have no future . "
he added that " inefficient companies must be liquidated . "
competitiveness in the russian economy is " shamefully low , " he said. hf / afp / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

2009 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what ´ s more important in politics : youth , or experience ? " more information : angela merkel 's new cabinet - more old than new there were a few a surprises when the cabinet of germany 's new coalition government was unveiled .
veteran politician wolfgang schäuble will be germany 's new finance minister , making him the most important man in merkel 's cabinet .
the former economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg will get the defense portfolio and , as expected , vice chancellor guido westerwelle will be representing germany on the international stage as foreign minister .
the fdp 's philipp rösler is set to become germany 's next health minister .
our question is : " what ´ s more important in politics : youth , or experience ? "
hannelore krause in germany has this to say : " both count .
you accumulate experiences throughout your life .
it 's traditional to start a political career at a mature age when you 've gained enough experience .
konrad adenauer did n't become chancellor until he was 73 years old .
today 's newcomers start their political careers as soon as they have finished school or university .
they start small and work their way up .
some get left behind .
young , dynamic and experienced - that would be the ideal , but it does n't always work .
older people have more experience .
we ought to take advantage of that .
they want to have a say in events too and that 's how it should be . "
rené junghans in brazil also favours mature politicians : " in politics , experience counts above everything .
all decisions have far-reaching consequences .
inexperienced politicians do more harm than good .
it 's like that everywhere in the world .
you 've got to give young people a chance to prove their abilities , but at the beginning , they should be restricted to less consequential work .
when a young person has proven their competence and specialist knowledge , they 'll automatically run for a leading position and get one .
but everyone 's fed up with people who try to get ahead politically by looking good and speaking loud . "
in finland , herbert fuchs says : „ at a symposium in japan , foreign journalists asked what was the country ’ s most valuable asset .
the immediate answer was the elderly and their experience which helped to steer the right path .
whether that is true of politics is a drifficult , tricky question : in today ’ s globalized world the young generation are more on the ball than the elderly when it comes to facing the future .
but the simple fact is that the older generation are keeping all the goodies and rewards to themselves . “ and mr fuchs continues : „ i think the young should be allowed to play a growing role in the important field of politics , to find the right mix between the old and the young in the interest of the nation . “ a view backed by ferenc deak , in romania : „ experience and youth are both key factors in politics . “ gerhard seeger , in the philippines , says one follows the other : „ .. the experienced ones started out young and weren ’ t in the know .
the young should heed advice from the elderly , and they in turn should be open to good suggestions put forward by the young . “ people and politics reserves the right to shorten texts send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

guttenberg was on his maiden visit to the country , where over 4,300 german troops are deployed . “ the karzai government has to fulfil certain conditions , " he asserted , adding that " we must see successes . " guttenberg , who assumed his new role as defense minister just over two weeks ago , had a busy schedule of meetings with president karzai , top nato commander gen. stanley mcchrystal , afghan defense minister abdul rahim wardak , the german ambassador to afghanistan , members of the eu police mission -lrb- eupol -rrb- , as well as the heads of german aid agencies and non-governmental organizations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tanks on maneuvers in mazar-i-sharif guttenberg also traveled to mazar-i-sharif , where some of the german troop contingent is stationed .
the minister reiterated recent comments in which he said that german soldiers were " at war " in the region .
his predecessor , franz josef jung , had always been careful to avoid that term . guttenberg said , however , that it was important to clearly explain to the troops and to the people at home what was going on in afghanistan . troops appreciate minister 's clear words his comments were welcomed by troops , with one of them saying that they " were exposed to danger every day and therefore it is appreciated when things are called by name . " guttenberg also made clear that he approved of the increased us elite troop activity in the region around kunduz where german troops were also deployed .
their presence had brought additional security and the coordination was good , he said . the defense minister is scheduled to fly to kunduz on friday to visit german reconstruction teams which are facing a growing taliban insurgency in their area . after his meeting with karzai , guttenberg said the topics discussed had included the widespread corruption in the country and the style of governance . guttenberg is the latest in a series of foreign ministers and world leaders who have publicly pressured karzai , coupling financial and military support to his willingness to battle corruption and tackle reforms . karzai is to be sworn in on november 19 for another five-year term , but under the increased scrutiny of the international community . large-scale fraud that marred the august 20 presidential election highlighted the scale of corruption in afghanistan 's government and has led to condemnation of karzai ’ s administration and demands that he tackle graft . change of strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 4,000 troops deployed in afghanistan guttenberg surprised many in germany soon after he assumed his new role as defense minister when he described germany 's engagement in afghanistan as a " combat operation . "
he told the mass-circulation bild newspaper that there was a " war " in afghanistan . guttenberg 's visit comes at a time of intensifying debate in germany over the bundeswehr mission in afghanistan , with berlin 's deployment of troops to the hindu kush region increasingly unpopular at home . it also follows news that a nato probe into a september airstrike that killed dozens of afghan civilians showed that the german commander who ordered it broke military rules of engagement the september 4 strike on fuel trucks in the northeastern kunduz province was the most deadly operation involving german troops since world war ii .
the attack was ordered by german colonel georg klein and carried out by a us fighter jet .
german federal prosecutors are set to look into the incident , after a nato report condemned the airstrike . the german army has backed klein 's decision , saying he acted out of concern for german troops , while guttenberg described the strike as " appropriate in military terms . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg heads the defense ministry at a time when the afghan mission is unpopular call for clear goals for nato ahead of his afghan trip , the german defense minister called for an international conference on afghanistan to set what he called " clear goals " for the nato-led alliance 's deployment there .
the comments come as us president barack obama weighs his country 's strategy for the afghan conflict , after tainted elections cast nato 's support of president hamid karzai into doubt .
" if we should have to realign our objectives after such a conference , then we would also have to think about our own capabilities there , " guttenberg said .
the german parliament is set to debate the renewal of the army 's afghanistan mandate before mid-december .
any increase of german troop levels that may be requested by the us when it has decided on its own strategy is bound to be highly controversial , given the public perception of the bundeswehr 's engagement there .
guttenberg also said : " we must not be shy about using the word exit strategy . " gb / rb / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 12.11.2009 obama to outline new us role on east asia tour großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this will be obama 's first visit to asia as president obama is preparing to outline a new us role for asia as part of a week-long tour .
the focus is likely to be on trade and security issues with the us keen to boost its influence in the region . barack obama kicked off his first trip to asia as us president on friday , holding talks with japanese prime minister yukio hatoyama .
both were keen to stress their cooperation on a wide range of issues including nuclear non-proliferation and efforts to tackle climate change .
japan is one of america 's oldest allies in east asia , and obama highlighted that the alliance with japan was a " foundation " for peace and prosperity in the region .
nevertheless the newly elected democratic party does n't appear to be as supportive of a strong us-japan alliance , and has called for a smaller us military " footprint " on japanese soil . obama is due to give a major speech in tokyo on saturday outlining his ideas for america 's new role in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands demonstrated against a us military base on the japanese island of okinawa the week-long tour , which also includes stops in singapore , beijing and seoul , is intended to lay the groundwork for future cooperation , according to administration officials and analysts , and it marks a notable shift in us involvement in the region , where chinese influence has grown considerably in recent years .
" if you do not hold your ground in the pacific , you can not be a world leader , " remarked singapore 's former prime minister lee kuan yew in washington last week .
obama 's predecessor , george w. bush , was often perceived as ignoring asia 's economic growth - much to the chagrin of officials there .
now , obama will seek to assure the region of continued us engagement , but analysts say relations have grown more complex in wake of asia 's economic transformation .
indeed , just days after world leaders celebrated the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , which was widely interpreted as the triumph of western ideas , obama 's asia visit will highlight just how much has changed in two decades .
" china , especially during the past two years , -lsb- has -rsb- emerged as a global economic powerhouse , " cheng li , an expert on us-china relations at the brookings institution in washington , told deutsche welle .
" and it really came as a big surprise , although many china analysts had predicted china 's rise . " " the period -lsb- in which -rsb- china is a student lectured by the west is coming to an end , " he added . china poses new challenges obama called china " a vital partner , as well as a competitor " ahead of his departure , and his stops in beijing and shanghai are perhaps the most crucial legs of his tour .
china is america 's second largest trading partner - and its largest creditor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says he will meet the dalai lama after his china trip there have been several indicators ahead of obama 's visit that point to a power shift in us-china relations .
" a year ago , hillary clinton , during the campaign , argued that the united states should boycott our olympics , but now she 's become a spokesperson for the shanghai expo - she visited the shanghai expo site - so that tells you how dramatic change has been , " said cheng li . furthermore , obama declined to meet with the dalai lama last month during his trip to washington , making him the first president since 1991 to do so . recently , the us administration also backed the replacement of the g-8 group of wealthy industrialized nations with the g-20 , which includes china , to converge on matters of the global economy .
but francois godement , an east asia expert at the european council on foreign relations , believes the hype about asia 's rise and america 's waning influence is overstated .
" i see us popularity increasing , not decreasing , and that 's the obama factor as you look at all of the opinion polls throughout asia - it 's a big change from a year ago , " godement told deutsche welle .
aside from economic matters , the us sees chinese cooperation as essential on two key issues : containing the nuclear ambitions of both north korea and iran , and negotiating a deal on carbon emissions caps at the upcoming climate summit in copenhagen .
mending strained relations in tough economic times in singapore , obama will participate in the leaders summit of the asia-pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- , where the aim will be to strengthen us ties with countries that form the asssociation of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- .
obama has agreed to engage with burma , opening the door for talks with asean leaders who had previously clashed with former president bush over the issue .
but the financial crisis will undoubtedly complicate obama 's agenda .
at a time when the us seeks to expand its influence in asia , obama would be hard-pressed to convince congress to support any new free-trade agreements .
many americans feel threatened by asia 's rise and the impact it will have on their jobs , especially during a period of record high unemployment .
analysts say they do n't expect any concrete achievements from the trip on any of the major issues - trade , non-nuclear proliferation , iran , afghanistan , north korea , and climate change - but asian leaders are said to be excited about renewed us interest in the region .

the works are meant to be taken at face value , without any political or religious overtones .
and stereotypes are to be left at the door . in the newest exhibition at the martin gropius bau in berlin , visitors are asked to take a fresh look at islamic culture . " it is now very common to speak of islamic culture in a way that reduces it , whether it is violence or a patriarchal culture or the veil , " said the exhibition 's head curator almut bruckstein coruh , who came from jerusalem to berlin to explore her own german-jewish background .
" this exhibition tries to undo these very strict and rude and basically violent boundaries created by this form of public discourse . " the exhibition is titled " taswir , " which , in arabic , persian and ottoman turkish means roughly " portrayal , likeness , drawing , or photograph . "
despite popular misconceptions , images are not absent from islamic tradition , bruckstein told deutsche welle .
the attitude toward images in islamic culture is ambivalent and has varied through history , she added . bildunterschrift : abdulnasser gharem 's " the path , " 2007 to understand the exhibition that has been painstakingly assembled by bruckstein , together with classical art historian hendrik budde , it is worth considering what it is not .
the structure of the show , which incorporates over 250 works , does not have a beginning or an end .
there is no chronology , it is not political , and most specifically , said bruckstein , it is not a study of religion . a poetic arrangement the exhibition 's 18 rooms have been set up based on an idea by aby warburg , a late 19th-century art historian - a first for a european gallery .
the concept , called the mnemosyne atlas , is a way of exhibiting art based on poetic association instead of chronology or theme . in addition to works by over 50 contemporary artists , classical islamic works are on loan from important national and international libraries and museums , including the hermitage in saint petersburg , the british museum and british library in london , the bibliotheque nationale de france , the calouste gulbenkian museum in lisbon and the museum of islamic art in berlin 's pergamon museum . " the mixing of classical and contemporary objects is absolutely new for me , " said budde .
" of course it was a struggle .
ms bruckstein was fighting for her contemporary works and i was begging , please do n't overwhelm my mostly - let 's face it - tiny classical objects .
but there are many rooms i am delighted by and the classical objects have , in fact , been heightened by their juxtaposition with the contemporary . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maliheh afnan 's " veiled minds , " 2006 not least of the classical artefacts assembled by classicist hendrik budde is a set of three painted korans , including an extremely rare 10th-century golden koran .
these examples were rare even in their day as korans are traditionally not decorated so as not to detract from the words . in some cases , however , visitors ca n't be sure whether they are looking at a classical or a modern piece , budde added - which may make them observe the objects more closely . unveiling art the exhibition asks the visitors to resist the temptation to compartmentalize islamic and european art . " i have never liked tags , " said palestinian-born artist maliheh afnan .
" i happen to be a woman , i happen to be an artist and i happen to be from the middle east .
there is all this talk nowadays about the veil and i thought about what we are hiding from within .
i think i prefer to deal with a person who veils their face and not themselves .
i think it is easier to deal with . " afnan has presented six works of calligraphy - a tradition she said is often connected to poetry as well as the koran .
even when using a very decorative script , religious texts or poetry always had to be readable .
afnan , however , has broken with this tradition .
she said her work is about the idea of writing itself , and is never actually readable . " i come from an ancient part of the world , so my work never looks fresh .
it looks weathered by time .
it is about the passage of time and about the ageing process , " said afnan . bildunterschrift : chant avedissian 's " the arab nation , " 2008 one of the exhibition 's strongest rooms , face and effaced face , is a play on the concept and idea of the veil .
the question here , said bruckstein , is what you see if you do n't have a regional , ethnic , or religious definition . at one end of the room is a 16th-century miniature of the prophet mohammed .
the picture shows a classically-veiled mohammed pointing at a full moon , which is traditionally a metaphor for beauty or perfection .
mohammed 's posture says : if you want to see me , look at the full moon . while the curators and artists are adamant that the show is neither about religion nor politics , this may not always be clear to the visitor .
the most recent piece in the room is a 2001 photo montage by palestinian artist taysir batniji , who was exiled from gaza and is now living in paris .
the photographs , taken black on black , depict the faces of 170 people killed by the israeli defence forces . bruckstein had to fight hard to get the art out of gaza .
she said that , even here , the focus is not on martyrdom but rather on engagement with the human face . life as a trace of absence in following with the exhibition 's method of poetic association , the show 's walls are scattered with sayings from thinkers and philosophers that define the theme or sentiment of each room .
one of them is from french philosopher jacques derrida , who said , " life must be thought of as a trace of absence . " budde has chosen a 16th-century miniature painting of the prophet mohammed 's sandals for this room .
it is part of a larger indian and persian tradition that sees footprints as the presence of someone 's absence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " khusraw watches shirin bathing , " 16th century miniature the centerpiece of the room is a four-by-four-meter well of sand .
a dial moves around the circle continuously , creating grooves with one side and rubbing them out with the other . " it is not a show about religion , " said bruckstein , " for example the question of the feet leaving a trace of absence is not a religious question ; it is a question of leaving a trace .
the three artists in the room are having a conversation . " budde said that this kind of exhibition is rare , since european museum-goers are more familiar with christian art . " i hope that visitors from islamic countries will be interested to see what we dared to put together , to do what ca n't be done in some arabic countries , " said budde . the exhibition runs until january 18 , 2010 . author : tanya wood editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 12.11.2009 opinion : europe should seize on medvedev 's calls for modernization großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his annual state of the nation address , russian president dimitry medvedev called for sweeping internal reforms .
deutsche welle 's ingo mannteufel thinks this is a golden opportunity for the eu . the russian president did not mince his words as he described the socio-economic situation in russia .
he ranted at what he called the country 's " chronic backwardness , " the " lack of economic competitiveness , " the rampant corruption and the high level of dependency on gas and oil .
and there 's no arguing with his assessment .
all the problems he listed play a major part in russia 's failure to fulfill its potential and to offer its people a modern way of life .
his appeals for change appear to be the right way forward , including the modernization and strengthening of democratic values and institutions and his pledge to fight terrorism in the north caucasus region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel however , any approval and support for his ideas should not overshadow two important questions : can medvedev achieve his ambitious aims given the extent of corruption and state-run bureaucracy , and can russia undergo an economic and technological modernization without far-reaching political reforms ?
his remarks in that respect did little to inspire confidence .
although he criticized authoritarian structures on a regional level and demanded improvements for russia 's opposition parties , there was little of substance on radical political and legal reform .
kremlin experts will have noted with interest medvedev 's calls to overhaul russia 's state-run companies , the behemoths created by his predecessor , vladimir putin .
however , it would be wrong to interpret that as a deep rift between the two men .
a closer look reveals that medvedev 's drive to modernize the country 's economy is part of the strategy pursued by putin .
medvedev can take credit for trying to give those ideas more substance and for giving them a democratic platform , thereby allowing optimists to hope whereas realists will say it 's time for action , not words .
still , medvedev 's message offers the west , and germany in particular , a promising opportunity .
for the first time russia is not using ideology or military might to define its status as a world power , instead it 's looking at whether it can offer its people modern living conditions .
this means that russia is being forced to adopt a more cooperative position towards the outside world .
as medvedev himself put it : modernization can only be achieved through integration with the global economy .
and that 's why it was no surprise that foreign policy was hardly mentioned .
medvedev said russia 's foreign policy would merely be an instrument to secure the sweeping internal reforms he has called for .
historically this would indicate a significant paradigm shift .
the european union should use this chance by defining its own aims and stating how it intends to help russia achieve modernization .

the lecture , to about 300 business and government figures was part of his new job as economic adviser to the cambodian government .
cambodia has rejected a thai extradition request for mr thaksin .
the thai government is outraged at cambodia 's welcome to mr thaksin , who it sees as a criminal - and a powerful political opponent .
" i see a lot of synergy between your country and mine .
what is good for you will also be good for my country .
of course not all my compatriots see it that way right now , " mr thaksin said in the speech .
hitting back " i do not believe those who do not share our vision right now are myopic .
their domestic political compulsions force them to false patriotism , " he said , without elaborating .
" let 's pray that they too will one day appreciate this partnership for the best , " he added .
reporters were evicted from the lecture , titled cambodia and the world after the financial crisis .
mr thaksin is expected to visit the angkor wat temple and to play golf with cambodian prime minister hun sen , but is believed to be staying only a few days and not setting up residence in cambodia .
" i 'll try my best to explain my experiences and share the knowledge that i gathered during my exile , " he said .
outrage mr hun sen has dismissed thai government demands that mr thaksin be surrendered to serve a two-year jail term for corruption , citing his friendship with mr thaksin .
thailand has frozen an memorandum of understanding regarding joint exploration of shared maritime areas , and says it is considering legal options following the extradition rebuff .
some analysts say the cambodian leader 's belief that the thai court that convicted mr thaksin was politically motivated has particularly angered the thai government .
mr thaksin served as thailand 's prime minister from 2001 to 2006 , when he was ousted by a military coup after being accused of corruption and showing disrespect to the country 's widely-revered monarch , king bhumibol adulyadej .
he has been living in self-imposed exile ever since - mostly in dubai - but has rarely been out of the headlines , giving a series of high-profile interviews and continuing to make contact with his supporters inside the country .
relations between thailand and cambodia are already strained .
thailand has withdrawn its ambassador from cambodia , and there have also been series of disputes centred around the 11th-century preah vihear temple complex near the two countries ' border .

outrage mr hun sen has dismissed thai government demands that mr thaksin be surrendered to serve a two-year jail term for corruption , citing his friendship with mr thaksin .
mr thaksin -lrb- r -rrb- and cambodian pm hun sen play golf together thailand has frozen an memorandum of understanding regarding joint exploration of shared maritime areas , and says it is considering legal options following the extradition rebuff .
some analysts say the cambodian leader 's belief that the thai court that convicted mr thaksin was politically motivated has particularly angered the thai government .
mr thaksin served as thailand 's prime minister from 2001 to 2006 , when he was ousted by a military coup after being accused of corruption and showing disrespect to the country 's widely-revered monarch , king bhumibol adulyadej .
he has been living in self-imposed exile ever since - mostly in dubai - but has rarely been out of the headlines , giving a series of high-profile interviews and continuing to make contact with his supporters inside the country .
relations between thailand and cambodia are already strained .
thailand has withdrawn its ambassador from cambodia , and there have also been series of disputes centred around the 11th-century preah vihear temple complex near the two countries ' border .

the study , by the joseph rowntree foundation , found that high levels of unemployment , disability and poor quality part-time jobs were to blame .
the charity defines poverty as the experience of a family with an income which is 60 % below the uk average .
it called on the assembly to allow those on benefits to earn extra money .
the foundation 's chief executive , julia unwin , said : " the assembly has already shown that it is possible to intervene to alleviate some of the worst aspects of poverty .
" just as it provided the one-off fuel payment of £ 150 to families on benefit in winter 2008/09 , it could make it easier for people to take ' mini-jobs ' , allowing those living on benefits to provide a little extra for their families . "
' educational attainment ' the authors of the study acknowledged that there are some areas which need to be tackled that are beyond the assembly 's control but said that efforts must be concentrated on issues over which the devolved administration has some influence .
they said local politicians must address the lack of quality , affordable childcare and support those already in work to increase their qualification levels .
they also said political representatives must increase educational attainment and give poorer young people access to positive social and leisure activities .
nearly a third of northern ireland 's working-age population is not in paid work .
at 31 % , the figure is higher than any region in great britain .
men working full-time also earn 15 % less than their counterparts in the rest of the uk .

the study , by the joseph rowntree foundation , found that high levels of unemployment , disability and poor quality part-time jobs were to blame .
the charity defines poverty as the experience of a family with an income which is 60 % below the uk average .
it called on the assembly to allow those on benefits to earn extra money .
the foundation 's chief executive , julia unwin , said : " the assembly has already shown that it is possible to intervene to alleviate some of the worst aspects of poverty .
" just as it provided the one-off fuel payment of £ 150 to families on benefit in winter 2008/09 , it could make it easier for people to take ' mini-jobs ' , allowing those living on benefits to provide a little extra for their families . "
' educational attainment ' the authors of the study acknowledged that there are some areas which need to be tackled that are beyond the assembly 's control but said that efforts must be concentrated on issues over which the devolved administration has some influence .
they said local politicians must address the lack of quality , affordable childcare and support those already in work to increase their qualification levels .
they also said political representatives must increase educational attainment and give poorer young people access to positive social and leisure activities .
nearly a third of northern ireland 's working-age population is not in paid work .
at 31 % , the figure is higher than any region in great britain .
men working full-time also earn 15 % less than their counterparts in the rest of the uk .

the ss nomadic was bought three years ago by the department of social development and brought back to belfast as a potential tourist attraction .
public accounts committee chairman paul maskey said significant unforeseen costs had been incurred since then .
a dsd spokesman said the £ 7m figure was wrong and most of the money would come from eu and heritage lottery grants .
the assembly spending watchdog 's report was criticised as misleading by the nomadic charitable trust , which has been raising money to fund the restoration project .
these are challenging times - preserving our heritage is important , but not at any cost paul maskey public accounts committee the trust was appointed by the dsd to oversee the conservation project of the nomadic , which transported passengers to the ill-fated liner .
trust chairman denis rooney said it has " operated with great financial efficiency and has been very successful in getting funding from a variety of sources , including a substantial grant from the eu , with other awards pending " .
mr maskey said the dsd acknowledged when it saved the nomadic from a wrecker 's yard in france that it was getting involved in areas in which it had very little experience .
" this inexperience was demonstrated by unforeseen costs that the department incurred up to december 2008 , including £ 650,000 on transportation , essential restoration for the vessel and providing financial assistance to the ss nomadic charitable trust .
" the department has told the committee it would not fund the costs of restoration - that was a matter for the trust who have so far secured £ 3.6m towards the cost of restoration .
" however , over 90 % of this has come from public funds . "
titanic centenary he said the committee recognised the trust is a voluntary organisation staffed mainly by part-time workers and enthusiasts .
" however , these are challenging times - preserving our heritage is important , but not at any cost , " he said .
the report said the current cost of restoring the nomadic was estimated to be between £ 5m and £ 7m .
the restoration project had been planned to be completed by 2012 , the centenary of the sinking of the titanic .
a series of commemorative events will take place in belfast , where both boats were built at the harland and wolff shipyard .
the nomadic currently sits in dry dock , awaiting repair and restoration .
the committee recommended that the department and trust work together to ensure that contractors are appointed to enable work to commence at the earliest opportunity .

trust chairman denis rooney said it has " operated with great financial efficiency and has been very successful in getting funding from a variety of sources , including a substantial grant from the eu , with other awards pending " .
mr maskey said the dsd acknowledged when it saved the nomadic from a wrecker 's yard in france that it was getting involved in areas in which it had very little experience .
" this inexperience was demonstrated by unforeseen costs that the department incurred up to december 2008 , including £ 650,000 on transportation , essential restoration for the vessel and providing financial assistance to the ss nomadic charitable trust .
" the department has told the committee it would not fund the costs of restoration - that was a matter for the trust who have so far secured £ 3.6m towards the cost of restoration .
" however , over 90 % of this has come from public funds . "
titanic centenary he said the committee recognised the trust is a voluntary organisation staffed mainly by part-time workers and enthusiasts .
" however , these are challenging times - preserving our heritage is important , but not at any cost , " he said .
the report said the current cost of restoring the nomadic was estimated to be between £ 5m and £ 7m .
the restoration project had been planned to be completed by 2012 , the centenary of the sinking of the titanic .
a series of commemorative events will take place in belfast , where both boats were built at the harland and wolff shipyard .
the nomadic currently sits in dry dock , awaiting repair and restoration .
the committee recommended that the department and trust work together to ensure that contractors are appointed to enable work to commence at the earliest opportunity .

the site is to be refurbished and made into a business centre with 15 units aimed at local small businesses .
the project was devised by two businessmen , with european backing .
robert kearns and michael henderson have invested their own money in parc busnes treorchi , which has received £ 2m from the convergence european regional development fund through the welsh assembly government .
it also received £ 118,550 backing from the heads of the valleys programme for site preparation works .

" as long as it 's jobs - i ca n't even say well-paid jobs because we were only on minimum wage at the factory .

the youngsters need to find jobs when they leave school . "
mrs young , who lives just down the street from the site , added : " it 's exciting to hear that something is coming there - jobs are always welcome . "

" this exciting new development is a perfect example of how the public and private sector in wales can work hand in hand to re-vitalise sites abandoned by multinationals in favour of cheap labour overseas , " he said .
" we are confident that smaller units with shorter tenancy options and competitive rates will attract a range of local businesses to the site . "
work will start on the redevelopment in december .
mr henderson added : " the new business park will be specifically designed with small local businesses in mind .

rhondda mp chris bryant and am leighton andrews were part of a worldwide campaign to keep the factory open , which was backed by a number of welsh stars including actor and burberry model ioan gruffudd , rhys ifans and opera singer bryn terfel .
mr bryant said : " burberry were wrong to close the treorchy factory , but i 'm very pleased that the site is now being redeveloped and new jobs will come to the rhondda in its place . "

mr henderson added : " the new business park will be specifically designed with small local businesses in mind .
increased prosperity " being rhondda born and bred , i am particularly pleased to see this new project get off the ground and create much needed jobs in rhondda cynon taf . "
economy minister ieuan wyn jones said rhondda had been dealt an enormous blow when burberry closed .
" now , the site will provide new , sustainable employment opportunities , created through partnership working across the public and private sector to support local businesses and entrepreneurs which , in turn , will bring increased prosperity to the whole community .
rhondda mp chris bryant and am leighton andrews were part of a worldwide campaign to keep the factory open , which was backed by a number of welsh stars including actor and burberry model ioan gruffudd , rhys ifans and opera singer bryn terfel .
mr bryant said : " burberry were wrong to close the treorchy factory , but i 'm very pleased that the site is now being redeveloped and new jobs will come to the rhondda in its place . "
mr andrews added : " treorchy and treherbert were included by the labour assembly government in the heads of the valleys programme when the factory was designated for closure .
" it is good to see this additional investment coming through . "

each region will have an area group which will be required to develop plans to move towards becoming a low-carbon region .
andrew davies , minister for finance and public service delivery , said : " through a collaborative approach we can identify the infrastructure and services needed to enable the citizens of wales to make low carbon choices . "

david hughes , who writes as ambrose conway , has written two books about the reso estate in rhyl , denbighshire .
now based in nottingham , the former teacher is hoping to attract funding to train young people to produce a film based on the books .
a promotional trailer is to be screened at rhyl adventure playground on thursday .
mr hughes based his reso books on his experiences there as a youngster in the 1960s and 1970s .
part of the cover of the reso , first book about where he grew up as part of a drive to regenerate the seaside town , £ 30,000 of funding has been awarded to produce a promotional trailer .
it is now hoped the trailer will generate enough interest and money to pay for a feature film .
mr hughes and others involved in the project hope to use the money to train local young people to make the film .
he said he hoped that rhyl could be " re-branded " because the area " has everything going for it , " despite any problems .
he would also like to see the town establish a media centre which would help improve the potential of those young people known as " neets " - not in education , employment or training .

the first black leader of the us is also the first american president who has lived in asia as a child - the first president with an " asia-pacific orientation " , as us officials put it .
president obama will try to capitalise on this during his week-long trip to the region .
he wants to build on and improve crucial relationships with allies and rivals across the pacific .
he will be tackling a broad range of issues - some of them thorny , like global trade , china 's currency and us debt , and how to deal with countries like north korea and burma , not to mention climate change .
he will also be the first us president to attend a summit of the association of south east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- in singapore .
mutual ties this is , according to ben rhodes , a senior official at the national security council , a clear signal of the " president 's strong commitment to work in a comprehensive way with our asian partners " .
" he understands that the future of our prosperity and our security is very much tied to this part of the world , " mr rhodes told reporters in a briefing .
while the future of the us may be tied to asia , it is also in many ways dependent on it - particularly when it comes to trade or key foreign policy goals .
that is why a lot is riding on this trip .
the region buys around 25 % of american exports - 1.6 million jobs in the us are linked to those exports .
at a time of economic crisis , this is particularly critical .
the deputy national security adviser for international economic affairs , michael froman , said the us wanted to make sure countries in asia were " pursuing balanced growth going forward , opening their economies , allowing us to expand our exports to the region and create more export-related jobs here at home " .
the region is expected to grow by 7 % next year .
the trip , which also includes stops in japan , south korea and china , aims to send a clear message that washington remains a powerful player in the region .
it is also meant to reassure us allies who fear chinese hegemonic power .
power games a senior us official said recently that " the chinese are everywhere , their workers are everywhere , from india to burma to iran " .
he added that the us was watching china take over economically in some parts of the world .
" i think it 's a common perception in the region that us influence has been on the decline while chinese influence has been increasing , " said jeffrey bader , who is in charge of asian policy at the national security council . "
china must reassure the rest of the world that its development and growing global role will not come at the expense of security and well-being of others " jim steinberg , deputy secretary of state " one of the messages that the president will be sending on this visit is that we are an asia-pacific nation and we are there for the long haul . "
mr bader was surprisingly candid when discussing the importance of the relationship with beijing .
after listing the issues that would be on the agenda , he admitted that on none of them could the us " succeed without china 's cooperation " .
chinese leaders are likely to relish such a statement and the power it seems to give them .
mr bader added that the administration did not see the relationship as " a zero-sum one , but one where we 're obviously going to have differences , where we 're going to be competitors in certain aspects .
but we want to maximise areas where we can work together because the global challenges will simply not be met if we do n't . "
' strategic reassurance ' it is a pragmatic approach to diplomacy , which the obama administration has adopted with many of its foes and rivals - but it still needs to deliver results .
critics of the administration say the president is being too accommodating , whether with china or russia .
" dubbed ' strategic reassurance ' , the policy aims to convince the chinese that the united states has no intention of containing their rising power .
details remain to be seen , but as with the russia ' reset ' , it is bound to make america 's allies nervous , " writes robert kagan from the carnegie endowment for international peace in the washington post .
contrary to how the administration views the relationship , mr kagan argues that " for the chinese - true realists - the competition with the united states in east asia is very much a zero-sum game " .
academics have been debating the meaning of " strategic reassurance " .
critics say it sounds too much like appeasement , while supporters argue it requires beijing to do some of the reassuring .
at least that is what deputy secretary of state jim steinberg argued when he coined the catchphrase : " china must reassure the rest of the world that its development and growing global role will not come at the expense of security and well-being of others . "
asia experts will be watching whether the administration fleshes out its policy on china some more during this trip .
some of that may come in tokyo .
there , the president will deliver a key speech during which he is expected to reaffirm the strength of washington 's alliance with japan .
but beyond the official meetings , there will be some people-to-people diplomacy with a " town hall " -style meeting in shanghai and sightseeing in beijing .
in japan , the president will meet emperor akihito and empress michiko .
and mr obama 's personal background will also play a role - in singapore he will hold a bilateral meeting with the indonesian president .
indonesia is the country where he spent four years of his childhood .

the region buys around 25 % of american exports - 1.6 million jobs in the us are linked to those exports .
at a time of economic crisis , this is particularly critical .
the deputy national security adviser for international economic affairs , michael froman , said the us wanted to make sure countries in asia were " pursuing balanced growth going forward , opening their economies , allowing us to expand our exports to the region and create more export-related jobs here at home " .
the region is expected to grow by 7 % next year .
the trip , which also includes stops in japan , south korea and china , aims to send a clear message that washington remains a powerful player in the region .
it is also meant to reassure us allies who fear chinese hegemonic power .
power games a senior us official said recently that " the chinese are everywhere , their workers are everywhere , from india to burma to iran " .
he added that the us was watching china take over economically in some parts of the world .
" i think it 's a common perception in the region that us influence has been on the decline while chinese influence has been increasing , " said jeffrey bader , who is in charge of asian policy at the national security council .
china must reassure the rest of the world that its development and growing global role will not come at the expense of security and well-being of others jim steinberg , deputy secretary of state " one of the messages that the president will be sending on this visit is that we are an asia-pacific nation and we are there for the long haul . "
mr bader was surprisingly candid when discussing the importance of the relationship with beijing .
after listing the issues that would be on the agenda , he admitted that on none of them could the us " succeed without china 's cooperation " .
chinese leaders are likely to relish such a statement and the power it seems to give them .
mr bader added that the administration did not see the relationship as " a zero-sum one , but one where we 're obviously going to have differences , where we 're going to be competitors in certain aspects .
but we want to maximise areas where we can work together because the global challenges will simply not be met if we do n't . "
' strategic reassurance ' it is a pragmatic approach to diplomacy , which the obama administration has adopted with many of its foes and rivals - but it still needs to deliver results .
critics of the administration say the president is being too accommodating , whether with china or russia .
" dubbed ' strategic reassurance ' , the policy aims to convince the chinese that the united states has no intention of containing their rising power .
details remain to be seen , but as with the russia ' reset ' , it is bound to make america 's allies nervous , " writes robert kagan from the carnegie endowment for international peace in the washington post .
contrary to how the administration views the relationship , mr kagan argues that " for the chinese - true realists - the competition with the united states in east asia is very much a zero-sum game " .
academics have been debating the meaning of " strategic reassurance " .
critics say it sounds too much like appeasement , while supporters argue it requires beijing to do some of the reassuring .
at least that is what deputy secretary of state jim steinberg argued when he coined the catchphrase : " china must reassure the rest of the world that its development and growing global role will not come at the expense of security and well-being of others . "
asia experts will be watching whether the administration fleshes out its policy on china some more during this trip .
some of that may come in tokyo .
there , the president will deliver a key speech during which he is expected to reaffirm the strength of washington 's alliance with japan .
but beyond the official meetings , there will be some people-to-people diplomacy with a " town hall " -style meeting in shanghai and sightseeing in beijing .
in japan , the president will meet emperor akihito and empress michiko .
and mr obama 's personal background will also play a role - in singapore he will hold a bilateral meeting with the indonesian president .
indonesia is the country where he spent four years of his childhood .

the first black leader of the us is also the first american president who has lived in asia as a child - the first president with an " asia-pacific orientation " , as us officials put it .
president obama will try to capitalise on this during his week-long trip to the region .
he wants to build on and improve crucial relationships with allies and rivals across the pacific .
he will be tackling a broad range of issues - some of them thorny , like global trade , china 's currency and us debt , and how to deal with countries like north korea and burma , not to mention climate change .
he will also be the first us president to attend a summit of the association of south east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- in singapore .
mutual ties toymakers in japan have gone into overdrive ahead of the visit this is , according to ben rhodes , a senior official at the national security council , a clear signal of the " president 's strong commitment to work in a comprehensive way with our asian partners " .
" he understands that the future of our prosperity and our security is very much tied to this part of the world , " mr rhodes told reporters in a briefing .

the christmas lights were started in 1963 by mousehole-based artist , joan gilchrest with a string of coloured bulbs put up along both quays .
the spectacle has grown considerably since then and now attracts thousands of people from all over the world .
the mousehole lights is run solely by unpaid volunteers and money is collected to keep the tradition alive .
click here to see a gallery of images taken of the mousehole illuminations to mark the event there will be an outdoor carolaire service with traditional music provided by the pendeen silver band and the carolaire choir .
the dove of peace features in the newlyn lights from sunday 13 december to sunday 3 january 2010 the lights are switched on from 5pm until approximately 11pm , with the exception on saturday 19th december when the lights will be switched off from 8pm - 9pm in remembrance of the crews of the solomon browne lifeboat and union star in 1981 .
another unique event that takes place over christmas in mousehole is the celebration of a dish unique to the village - star gazey pie .
the lights beneath the ship inn pub symbolise the dish which is prepared and eaten on 23rd december- tom bawcock 's eve .
legend has it that residents were starved of fish because of a stormy winter .
weeks had passed and no fishermen had been able to set sail .
two nights before christmas one of these local fishermen , tom bawcock , braved the storm and through some miracle caught 7 types of different fish and brought them back to the village ...
a dish unique to the village - star gazey pie tom became a local hero and every year is honoured because of his courage on the 23rd december when the star gazey pie is cooked at the ship inn and brought out at midnight .
nearby , newlyn also boasts an impressive display of festive illuminations , which you can view on your way if you are arriving from penzance .
newlyn lights are just as spectacular , with the illuminations distributed around the fishing harbour , along the pier and along the surrounding roads .
there is a park and ride facility from penzance harbour carpark .

under the council 's local development plan , up to 2,000 extra homes could be built there .
but opponents to the scheme want the development on a smaller scale claiming the scheme is " unsustainable " .
the proposals could also see a new primary school , care home and new access from the a55 put in place .
the public meeting was held at bodelwyddan community centre on wednesday night after a consultation started last month .
council officer iwan prys jones said : " if we fail to provide an adequate supply of homes one of the consequences is that the housing stock will continue to become more expensive and will continue to become less affordable from the point of view of people who live within the county .
" as ever there 's a balance to be drawn i think between the nature of new development and making sure that we 're providing acceptable and suitable homes for people who live in denbighshire . "
however , the bodelwyddan development action group is against the plans and has held a series of public meetings in recent months .
its founder , alice jones , has said the proposals include building 1,715 new houses , and that the current population of about 1,000 could rise to 6,000 over 12 years .
the group has called for development on a smaller scale , " in smaller stages , so that people can integrate into communities " .
it says public services in the area are already struggling , and the main a55 road would not meet the demands of extra traffic .
according to the 2001 census , bodelwyddan had 895 homes .

' there 's a balance to be drawn ' say council officials " as ever there 's a balance to be drawn i think between the nature of new development and making sure that we 're providing acceptable and suitable homes for people who live in denbighshire . "
however , the bodelwyddan development action group is against the plans and has held a series of public meetings in recent months .
its founder , alice jones , has said the proposals include building 1,715 new houses , and that the current population of about 1,000 could rise to 6,000 over 12 years .
the group has called for development on a smaller scale , " in smaller stages , so that people can integrate into communities " .
it says public services in the area are already struggling , and the main a55 road would not meet the demands of extra traffic .
according to the 2001 census , bodelwyddan had 895 homes .

but opponents to the scheme want the development on a smaller scale claiming the scheme is " unsustainable " .
the proposals could also see a new primary school , care home and new access from the a55 put in place .

forty-two people died in october 's attack , which has been blamed on the sunni resistance group , jundullah .
islamabad has dismissed claims that the leader of jundullah was in pakistan .
attackers escaped " two men on foot intercepted mr jaffery as he was leaving for office , " head of the local police station abdul rehman told the bbc .
" an automatic pistol was used and the attackers were able to escape afterwards . "
he said mr jaffery died as he was being taken to the nearest hospital .

he resigned from his government position a few years ago to join the iranian mission as the head of public affairs .
