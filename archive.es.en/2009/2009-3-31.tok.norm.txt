after considering the files , the prosecutor 's office said it would open a preliminary investigation into the firms , the first step towards a possible indictment on charges of dodging taxes and concealing the profits behind liechtenstein 's banking secrecy laws .
all three firms denied being the target of a money-laundering probe .
" the michelin group does not own a copa foundation , nor does it hold any accounts at the lgt bank in liechtenstein , " a spokesman for the firm told afp , denying claims in a report by french daily le parisien .
a spokeswoman for energy giant totalfinaelf said in a statement that it " formally denies " owning a foundation called " elf trading " in liechtenstein , while adidas told le parisien it had no knowledge of any such investigation .
" we have no activities in liechtenstein , with the exception of two service stations , " the total spokeswoman said in the statement .
french uncovered fraud files after german investigation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein has been trying to clamp down on tax evaders the files allegedly linking the three businesses to foundations which are suspected of being fronts for money laundering were uncovered after french authorities launched an investigation after a major german tax evasion scandal uncovered allegedly undeclared accounts held by foreign nationals within liechtenstein 's secretive banking sector .
french budget minister eric woerth confirmed on lci television that his ministry had transferred three files to prosecutors , but would neither confirm nor deny the names of the groups involved .
france 's finance ministry has been investigating 64 family-owned firms in connection with the scandal , of which 16 have since come clean and paid their overdue taxes and penalties , woerth said .
authorities estimated last year that french firms evaded up to one billion euros in taxes via liechtenstein , of which le parisien said elf , michelin and adidas accounted for " a large part " .
french president nicolas sarkozy recently said france would crack down on money laundering in european tax havens , including liechtenstein , luxembourg and andorra .
transparency international france estimates that corporate tax evasion via tax havens costs the french state some 10 billion euros per year .
leaders of the group of 20 meeting in london this week are set to draw up an international blacklist of tax havens , as worldwide pressure grows to clamp down on uncooperative nations and territories .
bowing to international pressure , liechtenstein agreed earlier this month to ease its strict banking secrecy rules and cooperate with foreign governments to combat tax fraud . nda / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

police said the group 's assets and propaganda material were seized in the raids .

sabine s. has left the scene at the age of 16 .
she recalls the group 's indoctrination of the children .

germany and france make the case for regulation financial crisis hindering african development goals merkel , medvedev unite on market reform before g20 summit economy -pipe- 31.03.2009 assertions of g20 unity mask underlying transatlantic tensions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g20 members have different views on market regulation and stimulus packages european countries are pushing for the g20 summit to focus on revamping the global financial architecture , but clashes with the us over stimulus packages continue to overshadow their drive ahead of the meeting this week . transatlantic tensions over the focus of the summit have marked the run-up to the april 2 meeting in london , which is supposed to be a demonstration of top-level unity between the world 's leading economic powers .
european leaders have repeatedly rebuffed us pressure to plough more money into their ailing economies as part of an international effort to revive withering global demand .
the dispute turned ugly last week when czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , described the united states ' ambitious but costly economic stimulus plans as " a way to hell . "
he also said " the united states is not on the right path " with its costly stimulus plans , and insisted " we need to read the history books " to avoid the same mistakes .
the remarks sent top aides scrambling to backtrack , with one insisting topolanek never made the " hell " remark .
since then , officials have been trying to paper over transatlantic differences .
tough talking ahead but world wants unity , says brown british prime minister gordon brown said on monday that tough talking would be needed but he felt that the world 's financial powers were united in finding solutions to the crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says he will do all he can to make the summit a success " we no doubt have some long days of negotiation ahead .
these are difficult and complex problems .
it will not be easy to reach the conclusions that i believe are necessary for the world economy , " said brown , but he added that his recent series of preparatory meetings with world leaders had made him feel certain that " the world wants to come together . "
brown said he would continue to do " all i can to build consensus and to enable an agreement to take us out of this recession and put the whole world back onto a path of growth . "
" this is a decisive moment for the world economy .
we have a choice to make .
we can either let the recession take its course and retreat into isolationism and protectionism ... or resolve as a world community to fight back against the global recession that is hurting people in every country and every continent , " said brown .
obama rejects " either or " approach in an interview with the financial times published on monday , us president barack obama said it was important that the summit should deliver a " message of unity . "
he rejected the idea of an " either or approach " between financial stimulus and regulation , saying that both were needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says both stimulus and regulation are needed " we need stimulus and regulation .
we need to deal with the problems right in front of us and we also need to make sure we 're taking steps to prevent these types of breakdowns from happening again , " obama said .
with respect to the stimulus there would be an accord in london that g20 countries " will do what is necessary to promote growth and trade , " he predicted .
however , he understood the " legitimate concerns " in some countries which had already initiated significant stimulus programs and wanted first to see how they worked .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso said on friday that there was " no dichotomy between stimulating the economy and improving global financial regulation . "
" we need both if we are to get the economy moving again and to restore confidence in a lasting way , " he added europe , us both committed to stimulus measures washington is spending trillions of dollars to support its banking system and drag the world 's biggest economy out of its deepest recession in decades .
meanwhile , the 27-nation european union has committed to economic stimulus measures in 2009 and 2010 worth 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 540 billion -rrb- , equivalent to 3.3 percent of the bloc 's gross domestic product .
the figure includes both national and eu level stimulus measures as well as automatic increases in social spending , such as unemployment benefits , which kick in when the economy weakens .
in berlin , a german spokesman said there were " no points of contention here between us and the us government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin insists there is no rift between obama and merkel " for both of us , and our position has been made clear for some time , regulation of financial markets is the focus of the meeting , " the spokesman said after chancellor angela merkel and us president barack obama held a video conference on thursday .
the rift between europe and the united states over the focus of the summit has been narrowed by washington 's latest announcement for sweeping financial regulatory reforms , including a single watchdog for all key financial institutions and payment systems .
like the united states , the eu wants to clamp down on hedge funds , private equity funds and the use of complicated credit derivatives as well as offshore tax havens .
europe is also in favor of doubling the international monetary fund 's resources for bailing out troubled countries to $ 500 billion , while washington wants to go even further by tripling its funds .
it also wants colleges of supervisors for all major cross-border financial institutions to be set up before the end of 2009 in order to keep a closer eye on big international groups .
talk of tensions is overblown but rifts exist , say experts experts in transatlantic relations say that despite the desire of all the major developed and developing powers at the g20 to show a united front , differences of emphasis do exist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some european nations are against pouring more money into the economy " the obama administration has been pushing europeans to spend much more , but the europeans are baulking at that , " kati suominen , a fellow with the german marshall fund of the united states , told afp .
" particularly the bigger countries , france , germany and the current holder of the european union presidency , czech republic , have been very adamantly opposed to new spending .
so there is a little bit of a rift there . "
dan price , a former assistant to president george w. bush for international economic affairs , argued that reports of discord between nations like france and germany and the united states were " somewhat overblown . "
he pointed out that washington had acted broadly to enact crisis rescue measures since the g20 finance ministers meeting in the uk just three weeks ago .
at those talks , us treasury secretary timothy geithner said washington would provide a capital assistance program for finance firms , and outline a plan to clear toxic assets from the books of crippled banks .
" i think the united states goes into the meeting having done what it said it would do , " said price , now senior partner for global issues at sidley austin llp .
" the united states will be interested to hear what the other nations will do in this regard . " nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the two leaders said they hoped the summit would be a success . merkel called for an overhaul of the financial markets on tuesday , march 31 , after meeting with medvedev in the german capital . " the world is standing at a crossroads , " the chancellor told reporters at a joint press conference following the meeting .
" financial markets need to change in such a way that such crises are not repeated . " medvedev supported his german counterpart , adding that the g20 meeting would be the first of many meetings towards developing a new global financial system . " the g20 format does not have to provide the definitive solution , " he said .
" it should be the start of a new financial market design . " the two leaders also warned of protectionist policies implemented by some governments in response to the financial crisis . merkel said the g20 meeting must include a clear statement against protectionism . russia 's ambitious financial reform plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev heads to london with ambitious plans ahead of thursday 's summit in london , russia has come up with an ambitious plan to overhaul the entire global financial order .
medvedev even said the international community should have a say when the world 's richest countries make decisions with global implications , as in the us mortgage crisis . but analysts doubt russia 's plans will get many backers among group of 20 countries , be they established players or rising powerhouses such as brazil , india and china . economists say that while some of russia 's ideas - such as a world currency - are currently unfeasible , others it may offer will fail more due to moscow 's lack of diplomatic heft . though russia is a member of the group of eight industrial powers , it is still not among the 153 members of the world trade organization and is side-lined at meetings of group of seven finance ministers . while russia is among the top world energy producers and an undoubted political heavyweight , its economy is dwarfed by the united states and european union . amid reports that the g20 meeting may be devoted to crisis management rather than long-term reform , britain 's financial times has reported that the british foreign office has already relegated russia to the rank of second-division player . russia appears reluctant to accept this and has been talking up its reform plans for weeks . germany offers to mediate in gas dispute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : january 's gas dispute put a strain on eu-russia relations merkel also offered germany 's services on tuesday in resolving the dispute over gas between russia , and ukraine , which has made a deal to modernize its pipeline network with the european union last month . the chancellor said she would raise the issue with the european commission despite russia 's objection to the agreement . russia was angry at being left out of talks over the deal , calling the agreement an " unfriendly act .

ukraine , however , has said its pipeline overhaul was not aimed at russia .

german chancellor angela merkel has said she will form a team of experts to negotiate a new corporate structure for german carmaker opel in talks with its troubled us parent group , general motors . " we have 60 days in which to talk about how a future concept should look , " merkel said on tuesday , march 31 , referring to the two month restructuring deadline us president barack obama set general motors one day earlier . merkel made her comments during a speech to some 3,000 opel workers at the company 's main plant in ruesselsheim , near frankfurt . she said the german government and authorities from states with major opel factories would join forces with bankers and opel managers to " defend german interests " in talks with gm and us officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel addressed a crowd of 3,000 workers at the opel factory in ruesselsheim .
" we must lay the foundation for the creation of a european opel , " merkel said , adding that she would work to ensure the carmaker was made economically viable by 2012 . she added that opel would be an efficient and modern organization where " employees can say they 're building german 's future and leading the world . " opel managers have said they need some 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.38 billion -rrb- to restructure their operations and become independent of general motors .

germany and france make the case for regulation financial crisis hindering african development goals assertions of g20 unity mask underlying transatlantic tensions international relations -pipe- 31.03.2009 merkel , medvedev unite on market reform before g20 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev and merkel focused on finance during talks in berlin german chancellor angela merkel and russian president dmitry medvedev will head to the g20 summit with similar goals and expectations .
the two leaders said they hoped the summit would be a success . merkel called for an overhaul of the financial markets on tuesday , march 31 , after meeting with medvedev in the german capital . " the world is standing at a crossroads , " the chancellor told reporters at a joint press conference following the meeting .
" financial markets need to change in such a way that such crises are not repeated . " medvedev supported his german counterpart , adding that the g20 meeting would be the first of many meetings towards developing a new global financial system . " the g20 format does not have to provide the definitive solution , " he said .
" it should be the start of a new financial market design . " the two leaders also warned of protectionist policies implemented by some governments in response to the financial crisis . merkel said the g20 meeting must include a clear statement against protectionism . russia 's ambitious financial reform plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev heads to london with ambitious plans ahead of thursday 's summit in london , russia has come up with an ambitious plan to overhaul the entire global financial order .
medvedev even said the international community should have a say when the world 's richest countries make decisions with global implications , as in the us mortgage crisis . but analysts doubt russia 's plans will get many backers among group of 20 countries , be they established players or rising powerhouses such as brazil , india and china . economists say that while some of russia 's ideas - such as a world currency - are currently unfeasible , others it may offer will fail more due to moscow 's lack of diplomatic heft . though russia is a member of the group of eight industrial powers , it is still not among the 153 members of the world trade organization and is side-lined at meetings of group of seven finance ministers . while russia is among the top world energy producers and an undoubted political heavyweight , its economy is dwarfed by the united states and european union . amid reports that the g20 meeting may be devoted to crisis management rather than long-term reform , britain 's financial times has reported that the british foreign office has already relegated russia to the rank of second-division player . russia appears reluctant to accept this and has been talking up its reform plans for weeks . germany offers to mediate in gas dispute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : january 's gas dispute put a strain on eu-russia relations merkel also offered germany 's services on tuesday in resolving the dispute over gas between russia , and ukraine , which has made a deal to modernize its pipeline network with the european union last month . the chancellor said she would raise the issue with the european commission despite russia 's objection to the agreement . russia was angry at being left out of talks over the deal , calling the agreement an " unfriendly act . "
ukraine , however , has said its pipeline overhaul was not aimed at russia .
ukraine is a major transit country for russian energy headed to europe . merkel called on both parties not to let the situation escalate out of control . a gas dispute between russia and ukraine in january left some eu nations without gas for more than a week . cla / nda / sms / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

expectations are high as the us president takes part in three major conferences across the continent . though it may not match the 200,000 people who turned up to hear " obama the candidate " speak in berlin , the us president is likely to receive a warm welcome from europe 's leaders and the general public on a visit that begins this tuesday . but there 's an even greater sense of expectation this time around .
europe wants to know if " obama the president " will live up to the hype . the first stop on his whirlwind tour is london , where he 'll be the star attraction at the thursday meeting of the group of 20 nations .
there is no question that the world economy will be at the top of the agenda , but what is not clear is whether obama and european leaders can agree on how to act . last week , czech prime minister mirek topolanek described obama 's economic stimulus package as the " road to hell .

german chancellor angela merkel has said she will form a team of experts to negotiate a new corporate structure for german carmaker opel in talks with its troubled us parent group , general motors . " we have 60 days in which to talk about how a future concept should look , " merkel said on tuesday , march 31 , referring to the two month restructuring deadline us president barack obama set general motors one day earlier . merkel made her comments during a speech to some 3,000 opel workers at the company 's main plant in ruesselsheim , near frankfurt . she said the german government and authorities from states with major opel factories would join forces with bankers and opel managers to " defend german interests " in talks with gm and us officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel addressed a crowd of 3,000 workers at the opel factory in ruesselsheim .
" we must lay the foundation for the creation of a european opel , " merkel said , adding that she would work to ensure the carmaker was made economically viable by 2012 . she added that opel would be an efficient and modern organization where " employees can say they 're building german 's future and leading the world . " opel managers have said they need some 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.38 billion -rrb- to restructure their operations and become independent of general motors .
but the german government has so far refused to provide the funds because it is concerned public money may be transferred across the atlantic to help plug holes in gm 's accounts political maneuvering with national elections due in september , merkel 's grand coalition government remains split over how far the state should go in saving the 110-year-old german carmaker , which has been a gm subsidiary since 1929 .
merkel 's christian democratic union would prefer a private investor to rescue opel , while her junior coalition partners from the social democratic party want the state to make direct investments aimed at saving the company 's 26,000-strong workforce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel could become a major election issue in september .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat who will challenge merkel for the chancellorship , laid out a 10-point plan on monday and has said the german government must take action immediately . steinmeier proposed that the federal and state governments join forces with a consortium of opel dealers and managers to purchase a holding of 50 percent plus one share , leaving gm with the minority stake .
he said the move would give opel at least three months to reorganize and find a private investor . but german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg rejected the idea of buying directly into opel , arguing that berlin should limit itself to providing credit guarantees to attract investors . union makes concessions germany 's giant metalworkers union ig metall , meanwhile , has renewed calls for merkel to throw her full support behind efforts aimed at saving opel from bankruptcy . ig metal boss detlef wetzel questioned why merkel would provide billions of euros in a financial bail-out to banks but deny requests for aid from the " real economy . " meanwhile , the union 's regional director in frankfurt , armin schild , has indicated that opel workers are prepared to make significant concessions to keep the company afloat and prevent job cuts . he said possible changes could range from cutting working hours without compensatory wage increases to the negotiation of new collective agreements between employees and management . sje / sh / sms / dpa / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany and france make the case for regulation financial crisis hindering african development goals assertions of g20 unity mask underlying transatlantic tensions international relations -pipe- 31.03.2009 merkel , medvedev unite on market reform before g20 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev and merkel focused on finance during talks in berlin german chancellor angela merkel and russian president dmitry medvedev will head to the g20 summit with similar goals and expectations .
the two leaders said they hoped the summit would be a success . merkel called for an overhaul of the financial markets on tuesday , march 31 , after meeting with medvedev in the german capital . " the world is standing at a crossroads , " the chancellor told reporters at a joint press conference following the meeting .
" financial markets need to change in such a way that such crises are not repeated . " medvedev supported his german counterpart , adding that the g20 meeting would be the first of many meetings towards developing a new global financial system . " the g20 format does not have to provide the definitive solution , " he said .
" it should be the start of a new financial market design . " the two leaders also warned of protectionist policies implemented by some governments in response to the financial crisis . merkel said the g20 meeting must include a clear statement against protectionism . russia 's ambitious financial reform plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev heads to london with ambitious plans ahead of thursday 's summit in london , russia has come up with an ambitious plan to overhaul the entire global financial order .
medvedev even said the international community should have a say when the world 's richest countries make decisions with global implications , as in the us mortgage crisis . but analysts doubt russia 's plans will get many backers among group of 20 countries , be they established players or rising powerhouses such as brazil , india and china . economists say that while some of russia 's ideas - such as a world currency - are currently unfeasible , others it may offer will fail more due to moscow 's lack of diplomatic heft . though russia is a member of the group of eight industrial powers , it is still not among the 153 members of the world trade organization and is side-lined at meetings of group of seven finance ministers . while russia is among the top world energy producers and an undoubted political heavyweight , its economy is dwarfed by the united states and european union . amid reports that the g20 meeting may be devoted to crisis management rather than long-term reform , britain 's financial times has reported that the british foreign office has already relegated russia to the rank of second-division player . russia appears reluctant to accept this and has been talking up its reform plans for weeks . germany offers to mediate in gas dispute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : january 's gas dispute put a strain on eu-russia relations merkel also offered germany 's services on tuesday in resolving the dispute over gas between russia , and ukraine , which has made a deal to modernize its pipeline network with the european union last month . the chancellor said she would raise the issue with the european commission despite russia 's objection to the agreement . russia was angry at being left out of talks over the deal , calling the agreement an " unfriendly act . "
ukraine , however , has said its pipeline overhaul was not aimed at russia .
ukraine is a major transit country for russian energy headed to europe . merkel called on both parties not to let the situation escalate out of control . a gas dispute between russia and ukraine in january left some eu nations without gas for more than a week . cla / nda / sms / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 31.03.2009 obama gears up for european extravaganza großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is looking to obama to lead the way on several issues barack obama 's visit to europe marks his first major overseas trip since being sworn into office .
expectations are high as the us president takes part in three major conferences across the continent . though it may not match the 200,000 people who turned up to hear " obama the candidate " speak in berlin , the us president is likely to receive a warm welcome from europe 's leaders and the general public on a visit that begins this tuesday . but there 's an even greater sense of expectation this time around .
europe wants to know if " obama the president " will live up to the hype . the first stop on his whirlwind tour is london , where he 'll be the star attraction at the thursday meeting of the group of 20 nations .
there is no question that the world economy will be at the top of the agenda , but what is not clear is whether obama and european leaders can agree on how to act . last week , czech prime minister mirek topolanek described obama 's economic stimulus package as the " road to hell . " while other european leaders distanced themselves from topolanek 's comment , there are serious differences of opinion between the us and european governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek said the us was repeating the mistakes of the 1930s craig kennedy , president of the german marshall fund in washington , said europe is concerned that the us approach includes too much stimulus and not enough regulation . " the size of the american stimulus and the size of our resulting deficits are causing tremendous concern , " he said . restoring america 's standing obama is officially visiting europe to take part in international conferences , but the trip is a symbolic one too . the visit is a " fundamental part of the president 's agenda of restoring america 's standing in the world and particularly europe , " presidential advisor dennis mcdonough said . ties between europe and the us became strained during the previous administration of george w. bush , especially over the invasion of iraq . during his tour , obama will meet with the leaders of britain , france , germany , turkey and the czech republic .
he 's also set to hold talks with russian president dmitry medvedev while in london . relations between the us and russia came under particular strain last year during the russian-georgian war .
washington is also concerned that moscow 's aid to tehran 's nuclear energy program could help the islamic republic develop nuclear weapons .
iran maintains its nuclear program serves only civilian purposes . russia , on the other hand , objects to us plans to build a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic , and disapproves of nato 's push to extend membership to the ex-soviet republics of ukraine and georgia . on with the tour after the g20 summit in london , obama heads to strasbourg , france , for a summit marking the 60th anniversary of the north atlantic treaty organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in afghanistan is at its highest level since us-led forces toppled the taliban in 2001 he 's set to use the occasion to urge nato countries to support his new strategy for afghanistan , which he outlined last week . obama announced the deployment of an extra 4,000 troops , on top of the 17,000 reinforcements already planned .
his new strategy also includes an increase of civilian personnel , and a greater focus on fighting al qaeda and the taliban , particularly along the afghan-pakistan border . european governments have welcomed obama 's new afghanistan strategy , but nato members know that obama will now expect increased contributions from them too . chancellor angela merkel has announced that germany will boost its training of police and security forces in afghanistan , but has previously ruled out an increase of combat troops . the forgotten issue somewhere down on the to-do list is climate change .
the issue is up for discussion at a meeting of the 27 european union heads of state in prague , the third stop on obama 's tour . the kyoto protocol is due to be replaced at talks in copenhagen at the end of the year , and climate change meetings are taking place across the globe in the lead-up to december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern said the us does not have a magic wand to fix the climate the obama administration made its international climate debut last weekend at un talks in bonn .
todd stern , obama 's special climate envoy , pledged to " make up for lost time " and called for more action by all nations . stern did say , however , that the us wanted to work towards a treaty that was economically " doable . "
but comments like this have some observers concerned about the united states ' commitment to fighting climate change . craig kennedy says that , despite the new administration 's rhetoric , there are doubts in europe that obama will be serious about climate change . " people look at the deficit ; people look at the pressures on the american economy , and people are starting to ask whether or not this is really going to be the highest priority , " he said . cla / sh / sms / rtr / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european leaders have repeatedly rebuffed us pressure to plough more money into their ailing economies as part of an international effort to revive withering global demand .
the dispute turned ugly last week when czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , described the united states ' ambitious but costly economic stimulus plans as " a way to hell . "
he also said " the united states is not on the right path " with its costly stimulus plans , and insisted " we need to read the history books " to avoid the same mistakes .
the remarks sent top aides scrambling to backtrack , with one insisting topolanek never made the " hell " remark .
since then , officials have been trying to paper over transatlantic differences .
tough talking ahead but world wants unity , says brown british prime minister gordon brown said on monday that tough talking would be needed but he felt that the world 's financial powers were united in finding solutions to the crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says he will do all he can to make the summit a success " we no doubt have some long days of negotiation ahead .
these are difficult and complex problems .
it will not be easy to reach the conclusions that i believe are necessary for the world economy , " said brown , but he added that his recent series of preparatory meetings with world leaders had made him feel certain that " the world wants to come together . "
brown said he would continue to do " all i can to build consensus and to enable an agreement to take us out of this recession and put the whole world back onto a path of growth . "
" this is a decisive moment for the world economy .
we have a choice to make .
we can either let the recession take its course and retreat into isolationism and protectionism ... or resolve as a world community to fight back against the global recession that is hurting people in every country and every continent , " said brown .
obama rejects " either or " approach in an interview with the financial times published on monday , us president barack obama said it was important that the summit should deliver a " message of unity . "
he rejected the idea of an " either or approach " between financial stimulus and regulation , saying that both were needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says both stimulus and regulation are needed " we need stimulus and regulation .
we need to deal with the problems right in front of us and we also need to make sure we 're taking steps to prevent these types of breakdowns from happening again , " obama said .
with respect to the stimulus there would be an accord in london that g20 countries " will do what is necessary to promote growth and trade , " he predicted .
however , he understood the " legitimate concerns " in some countries which had already initiated significant stimulus programs and wanted first to see how they worked .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso said on friday that there was " no dichotomy between stimulating the economy and improving global financial regulation . "
" we need both if we are to get the economy moving again and to restore confidence in a lasting way , " he added europe , us both committed to stimulus measures washington is spending trillions of dollars to support its banking system and drag the world 's biggest economy out of its deepest recession in decades .
meanwhile , the 27-nation european union has committed to economic stimulus measures in 2009 and 2010 worth 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 540 billion -rrb- , equivalent to 3.3 percent of the bloc 's gross domestic product .
the figure includes both national and eu level stimulus measures as well as automatic increases in social spending , such as unemployment benefits , which kick in when the economy weakens .
in berlin , a german spokesman said there were " no points of contention here between us and the us government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin insists there is no rift between obama and merkel " for both of us , and our position has been made clear for some time , regulation of financial markets is the focus of the meeting , " the spokesman said after chancellor angela merkel and us president barack obama held a video conference on thursday .
the rift between europe and the united states over the focus of the summit has been narrowed by washington 's latest announcement for sweeping financial regulatory reforms , including a single watchdog for all key financial institutions and payment systems .
like the united states , the eu wants to clamp down on hedge funds , private equity funds and the use of complicated credit derivatives as well as offshore tax havens .
europe is also in favor of doubling the international monetary fund 's resources for bailing out troubled countries to $ 500 billion , while washington wants to go even further by tripling its funds .
it also wants colleges of supervisors for all major cross-border financial institutions to be set up before the end of 2009 in order to keep a closer eye on big international groups .
talk of tensions is overblown but rifts exist , say experts experts in transatlantic relations say that despite the desire of all the major developed and developing powers at the g20 to show a united front , differences of emphasis do exist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some european nations are against pouring more money into the economy " the obama administration has been pushing europeans to spend much more , but the europeans are baulking at that , " kati suominen , a fellow with the german marshall fund of the united states , told afp .
" particularly the bigger countries , france , germany and the current holder of the european union presidency , czech republic , have been very adamantly opposed to new spending .
so there is a little bit of a rift there . "
dan price , a former assistant to president george w. bush for international economic affairs , argued that reports of discord between nations like france and germany and the united states were " somewhat overblown . "
he pointed out that washington had acted broadly to enact crisis rescue measures since the g20 finance ministers meeting in the uk just three weeks ago .
at those talks , us treasury secretary timothy geithner said washington would provide a capital assistance program for finance firms , and outline a plan to clear toxic assets from the books of crippled banks .
" i think the united states goes into the meeting having done what it said it would do , " said price , now senior partner for global issues at sidley austin llp .

after considering the files , the prosecutor 's office said it would open a preliminary investigation into the firms , the first step towards a possible indictment on charges of dodging taxes and concealing the profits behind liechtenstein 's banking secrecy laws .
all three firms denied being the target of a money-laundering probe .
" the michelin group does not own a copa foundation , nor does it hold any accounts at the lgt bank in liechtenstein , " a spokesman for the firm told afp , denying claims in a report by french daily le parisien .
a spokeswoman for energy giant totalfinaelf said in a statement that it " formally denies " owning a foundation called " elf trading " in liechtenstein , while adidas told le parisien it had no knowledge of any such investigation .
" we have no activities in liechtenstein , with the exception of two service stations , " the total spokeswoman said in the statement .
french uncovered fraud files after german investigation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein has been trying to clamp down on tax evaders the files allegedly linking the three businesses to foundations which are suspected of being fronts for money laundering were uncovered after french authorities launched an investigation after a major german tax evasion scandal uncovered allegedly undeclared accounts held by foreign nationals within liechtenstein 's secretive banking sector .
french budget minister eric woerth confirmed on lci television that his ministry had transferred three files to prosecutors , but would neither confirm nor deny the names of the groups involved .
france 's finance ministry has been investigating 64 family-owned firms in connection with the scandal , of which 16 have since come clean and paid their overdue taxes and penalties , woerth said .
authorities estimated last year that french firms evaded up to one billion euros in taxes via liechtenstein , of which le parisien said elf , michelin and adidas accounted for " a large part " .
french president nicolas sarkozy recently said france would crack down on money laundering in european tax havens , including liechtenstein , luxembourg and andorra .
transparency international france estimates that corporate tax evasion via tax havens costs the french state some 10 billion euros per year .
leaders of the group of 20 meeting in london this week are set to draw up an international blacklist of tax havens , as worldwide pressure grows to clamp down on uncooperative nations and territories .
bowing to international pressure , liechtenstein agreed earlier this month to ease its strict banking secrecy rules and cooperate with foreign governments to combat tax fraud . nda / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says both stimulus and regulation are needed " we need stimulus and regulation .
we need to deal with the problems right in front of us and we also need to make sure we 're taking steps to prevent these types of breakdowns from happening again , " obama said .
with respect to the stimulus there would be an accord in london that g20 countries " will do what is necessary to promote growth and trade , " he predicted .
however , he understood the " legitimate concerns " in some countries which had already initiated significant stimulus programs and wanted first to see how they worked .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso said on friday that there was " no dichotomy between stimulating the economy and improving global financial regulation . "
" we need both if we are to get the economy moving again and to restore confidence in a lasting way , " he added europe , us both committed to stimulus measures washington is spending trillions of dollars to support its banking system and drag the world 's biggest economy out of its deepest recession in decades .
meanwhile , the 27-nation european union has committed to economic stimulus measures in 2009 and 2010 worth 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 540 billion -rrb- , equivalent to 3.3 percent of the bloc 's gross domestic product .
the figure includes both national and eu level stimulus measures as well as automatic increases in social spending , such as unemployment benefits , which kick in when the economy weakens .
in berlin , a german spokesman said there were " no points of contention here between us and the us government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin insists there is no rift between obama and merkel " for both of us , and our position has been made clear for some time , regulation of financial markets is the focus of the meeting , " the spokesman said after chancellor angela merkel and us president barack obama held a video conference on thursday .
the rift between europe and the united states over the focus of the summit has been narrowed by washington 's latest announcement for sweeping financial regulatory reforms , including a single watchdog for all key financial institutions and payment systems .
like the united states , the eu wants to clamp down on hedge funds , private equity funds and the use of complicated credit derivatives as well as offshore tax havens .
europe is also in favor of doubling the international monetary fund 's resources for bailing out troubled countries to $ 500 billion , while washington wants to go even further by tripling its funds .
it also wants colleges of supervisors for all major cross-border financial institutions to be set up before the end of 2009 in order to keep a closer eye on big international groups .
talk of tensions is overblown but rifts exist , say experts experts in transatlantic relations say that despite the desire of all the major developed and developing powers at the g20 to show a united front , differences of emphasis do exist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some european nations are against pouring more money into the economy " the obama administration has been pushing europeans to spend much more , but the europeans are baulking at that , " kati suominen , a fellow with the german marshall fund of the united states , told afp .
" particularly the bigger countries , france , germany and the current holder of the european union presidency , czech republic , have been very adamantly opposed to new spending .
so there is a little bit of a rift there . "
dan price , a former assistant to president george w. bush for international economic affairs , argued that reports of discord between nations like france and germany and the united states were " somewhat overblown . "
he pointed out that washington had acted broadly to enact crisis rescue measures since the g20 finance ministers meeting in the uk just three weeks ago .
at those talks , us treasury secretary timothy geithner said washington would provide a capital assistance program for finance firms , and outline a plan to clear toxic assets from the books of crippled banks .
" i think the united states goes into the meeting having done what it said it would do , " said price , now senior partner for global issues at sidley austin llp .
" the united states will be interested to hear what the other nations will do in this regard . " nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

expectations are high as the us president takes part in three major conferences across the continent . though it may not match the 200,000 people who turned up to hear " obama the candidate " speak in berlin , the us president is likely to receive a warm welcome from europe 's leaders and the general public on a visit that begins this tuesday . but there 's an even greater sense of expectation this time around .
europe wants to know if " obama the president " will live up to the hype . the first stop on his whirlwind tour is london , where he 'll be the star attraction at the thursday meeting of the group of 20 nations .
there is no question that the world economy will be at the top of the agenda , but what is not clear is whether obama and european leaders can agree on how to act . last week , czech prime minister mirek topolanek described obama 's economic stimulus package as the " road to hell . " while other european leaders distanced themselves from topolanek 's comment , there are serious differences of opinion between the us and european governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek said the us was repeating the mistakes of the 1930s craig kennedy , president of the german marshall fund in washington , said europe is concerned that the us approach includes too much stimulus and not enough regulation . " the size of the american stimulus and the size of our resulting deficits are causing tremendous concern , " he said . restoring america 's standing obama is officially visiting europe to take part in international conferences , but the trip is a symbolic one too . the visit is a " fundamental part of the president 's agenda of restoring america 's standing in the world and particularly europe , " presidential advisor dennis mcdonough said . ties between europe and the us became strained during the previous administration of george w. bush , especially over the invasion of iraq . during his tour , obama will meet with the leaders of britain , france , germany , turkey and the czech republic .
he 's also set to hold talks with russian president dmitry medvedev while in london . relations between the us and russia came under particular strain last year during the russian-georgian war .
washington is also concerned that moscow 's aid to tehran 's nuclear energy program could help the islamic republic develop nuclear weapons .
iran maintains its nuclear program serves only civilian purposes . russia , on the other hand , objects to us plans to build a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic , and disapproves of nato 's push to extend membership to the ex-soviet republics of ukraine and georgia . on with the tour after the g20 summit in london , obama heads to strasbourg , france , for a summit marking the 60th anniversary of the north atlantic treaty organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in afghanistan is at its highest level since us-led forces toppled the taliban in 2001 he 's set to use the occasion to urge nato countries to support his new strategy for afghanistan , which he outlined last week . obama announced the deployment of an extra 4,000 troops , on top of the 17,000 reinforcements already planned .
his new strategy also includes an increase of civilian personnel , and a greater focus on fighting al qaeda and the taliban , particularly along the afghan-pakistan border . european governments have welcomed obama 's new afghanistan strategy , but nato members know that obama will now expect increased contributions from them too . chancellor angela merkel has announced that germany will boost its training of police and security forces in afghanistan , but has previously ruled out an increase of combat troops . the forgotten issue somewhere down on the to-do list is climate change .
the issue is up for discussion at a meeting of the 27 european union heads of state in prague , the third stop on obama 's tour . the kyoto protocol is due to be replaced at talks in copenhagen at the end of the year , and climate change meetings are taking place across the globe in the lead-up to december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern said the us does not have a magic wand to fix the climate the obama administration made its international climate debut last weekend at un talks in bonn .
todd stern , obama 's special climate envoy , pledged to " make up for lost time " and called for more action by all nations . stern did say , however , that the us wanted to work towards a treaty that was economically " doable . "
but comments like this have some observers concerned about the united states ' commitment to fighting climate change . craig kennedy says that , despite the new administration 's rhetoric , there are doubts in europe that obama will be serious about climate change .

medvedev even said the international community should have a say when the world 's richest countries make decisions with global implications , as in the us mortgage crisis . but analysts doubt russia 's plans will get many backers among group of 20 countries , be they established players or rising powerhouses such as brazil , india and china . economists say that while some of russia 's ideas - such as a world currency - are currently unfeasible , others it may offer will fail more due to moscow 's lack of diplomatic heft . though russia is a member of the group of eight industrial powers , it is still not among the 153 members of the world trade organization and is side-lined at meetings of group of seven finance ministers . while russia is among the top world energy producers and an undoubted political heavyweight , its economy is dwarfed by the united states and european union . amid reports that the g20 meeting may be devoted to crisis management rather than long-term reform , britain 's financial times has reported that the british foreign office has already relegated russia to the rank of second-division player . russia appears reluctant to accept this and has been talking up its reform plans for weeks . germany offers to mediate in gas dispute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : january 's gas dispute put a strain on eu-russia relations merkel also offered germany 's services on tuesday in resolving the dispute over gas between russia , and ukraine , which has made a deal to modernize its pipeline network with the european union last month . the chancellor said she would raise the issue with the european commission despite russia 's objection to the agreement . russia was angry at being left out of talks over the deal , calling the agreement an " unfriendly act .

germany and france make the case for regulation financial crisis hindering african development goals merkel , medvedev unite on market reform before g20 summit economy -pipe- 31.03.2009 assertions of g20 unity mask underlying transatlantic tensions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g20 members have different views on market regulation and stimulus packages european countries are pushing for the g20 summit to focus on revamping the global financial architecture , but clashes with the us over stimulus packages continue to overshadow their drive ahead of the meeting this week . transatlantic tensions over the focus of the summit have marked the run-up to the april 2 meeting in london , which is supposed to be a demonstration of top-level unity between the world 's leading economic powers .
european leaders have repeatedly rebuffed us pressure to plough more money into their ailing economies as part of an international effort to revive withering global demand .
the dispute turned ugly last week when czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , described the united states ' ambitious but costly economic stimulus plans as " a way to hell . "
he also said " the united states is not on the right path " with its costly stimulus plans , and insisted " we need to read the history books " to avoid the same mistakes .
the remarks sent top aides scrambling to backtrack , with one insisting topolanek never made the " hell " remark .
since then , officials have been trying to paper over transatlantic differences .
tough talking ahead but world wants unity , says brown british prime minister gordon brown said on monday that tough talking would be needed but he felt that the world 's financial powers were united in finding solutions to the crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says he will do all he can to make the summit a success " we no doubt have some long days of negotiation ahead .
these are difficult and complex problems .
it will not be easy to reach the conclusions that i believe are necessary for the world economy , " said brown , but he added that his recent series of preparatory meetings with world leaders had made him feel certain that " the world wants to come together . "
brown said he would continue to do " all i can to build consensus and to enable an agreement to take us out of this recession and put the whole world back onto a path of growth . "
" this is a decisive moment for the world economy .
we have a choice to make .
we can either let the recession take its course and retreat into isolationism and protectionism ... or resolve as a world community to fight back against the global recession that is hurting people in every country and every continent , " said brown .
obama rejects " either or " approach in an interview with the financial times published on monday , us president barack obama said it was important that the summit should deliver a " message of unity . "
he rejected the idea of an " either or approach " between financial stimulus and regulation , saying that both were needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says both stimulus and regulation are needed " we need stimulus and regulation .
we need to deal with the problems right in front of us and we also need to make sure we 're taking steps to prevent these types of breakdowns from happening again , " obama said .
with respect to the stimulus there would be an accord in london that g20 countries " will do what is necessary to promote growth and trade , " he predicted .
however , he understood the " legitimate concerns " in some countries which had already initiated significant stimulus programs and wanted first to see how they worked .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso said on friday that there was " no dichotomy between stimulating the economy and improving global financial regulation . "
" we need both if we are to get the economy moving again and to restore confidence in a lasting way , " he added europe , us both committed to stimulus measures washington is spending trillions of dollars to support its banking system and drag the world 's biggest economy out of its deepest recession in decades .
meanwhile , the 27-nation european union has committed to economic stimulus measures in 2009 and 2010 worth 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 540 billion -rrb- , equivalent to 3.3 percent of the bloc 's gross domestic product .
the figure includes both national and eu level stimulus measures as well as automatic increases in social spending , such as unemployment benefits , which kick in when the economy weakens .
in berlin , a german spokesman said there were " no points of contention here between us and the us government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin insists there is no rift between obama and merkel " for both of us , and our position has been made clear for some time , regulation of financial markets is the focus of the meeting , " the spokesman said after chancellor angela merkel and us president barack obama held a video conference on thursday .
the rift between europe and the united states over the focus of the summit has been narrowed by washington 's latest announcement for sweeping financial regulatory reforms , including a single watchdog for all key financial institutions and payment systems .
like the united states , the eu wants to clamp down on hedge funds , private equity funds and the use of complicated credit derivatives as well as offshore tax havens .
europe is also in favor of doubling the international monetary fund 's resources for bailing out troubled countries to $ 500 billion , while washington wants to go even further by tripling its funds .
it also wants colleges of supervisors for all major cross-border financial institutions to be set up before the end of 2009 in order to keep a closer eye on big international groups .
talk of tensions is overblown but rifts exist , say experts experts in transatlantic relations say that despite the desire of all the major developed and developing powers at the g20 to show a united front , differences of emphasis do exist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some european nations are against pouring more money into the economy " the obama administration has been pushing europeans to spend much more , but the europeans are baulking at that , " kati suominen , a fellow with the german marshall fund of the united states , told afp .
" particularly the bigger countries , france , germany and the current holder of the european union presidency , czech republic , have been very adamantly opposed to new spending .
so there is a little bit of a rift there . "
dan price , a former assistant to president george w. bush for international economic affairs , argued that reports of discord between nations like france and germany and the united states were " somewhat overblown . "
he pointed out that washington had acted broadly to enact crisis rescue measures since the g20 finance ministers meeting in the uk just three weeks ago .
at those talks , us treasury secretary timothy geithner said washington would provide a capital assistance program for finance firms , and outline a plan to clear toxic assets from the books of crippled banks .
" i think the united states goes into the meeting having done what it said it would do , " said price , now senior partner for global issues at sidley austin llp .
" the united states will be interested to hear what the other nations will do in this regard . " nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 31.03.2009 obama gears up for european extravaganza großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is looking to obama to lead the way on several issues barack obama 's visit to europe marks his first major overseas trip since being sworn into office .
expectations are high as the us president takes part in three major conferences across the continent . though it may not match the 200,000 people who turned up to hear " obama the candidate " speak in berlin , the us president is likely to receive a warm welcome from europe 's leaders and the general public on a visit that begins this tuesday . but there 's an even greater sense of expectation this time around .
europe wants to know if " obama the president " will live up to the hype . the first stop on his whirlwind tour is london , where he 'll be the star attraction at the thursday meeting of the group of 20 nations .
there is no question that the world economy will be at the top of the agenda , but what is not clear is whether obama and european leaders can agree on how to act . last week , czech prime minister mirek topolanek described obama 's economic stimulus package as the " road to hell . " while other european leaders distanced themselves from topolanek 's comment , there are serious differences of opinion between the us and european governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek said the us was repeating the mistakes of the 1930s craig kennedy , president of the german marshall fund in washington , said europe is concerned that the us approach includes too much stimulus and not enough regulation . " the size of the american stimulus and the size of our resulting deficits are causing tremendous concern , " he said . restoring america 's standing obama is officially visiting europe to take part in international conferences , but the trip is a symbolic one too . the visit is a " fundamental part of the president 's agenda of restoring america 's standing in the world and particularly europe , " presidential advisor dennis mcdonough said . ties between europe and the us became strained during the previous administration of george w. bush , especially over the invasion of iraq . during his tour , obama will meet with the leaders of britain , france , germany , turkey and the czech republic .
he 's also set to hold talks with russian president dmitry medvedev while in london . relations between the us and russia came under particular strain last year during the russian-georgian war .
washington is also concerned that moscow 's aid to tehran 's nuclear energy program could help the islamic republic develop nuclear weapons .
iran maintains its nuclear program serves only civilian purposes . russia , on the other hand , objects to us plans to build a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic , and disapproves of nato 's push to extend membership to the ex-soviet republics of ukraine and georgia . on with the tour after the g20 summit in london , obama heads to strasbourg , france , for a summit marking the 60th anniversary of the north atlantic treaty organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in afghanistan is at its highest level since us-led forces toppled the taliban in 2001 he 's set to use the occasion to urge nato countries to support his new strategy for afghanistan , which he outlined last week . obama announced the deployment of an extra 4,000 troops , on top of the 17,000 reinforcements already planned .
his new strategy also includes an increase of civilian personnel , and a greater focus on fighting al qaeda and the taliban , particularly along the afghan-pakistan border . european governments have welcomed obama 's new afghanistan strategy , but nato members know that obama will now expect increased contributions from them too . chancellor angela merkel has announced that germany will boost its training of police and security forces in afghanistan , but has previously ruled out an increase of combat troops . the forgotten issue somewhere down on the to-do list is climate change .
the issue is up for discussion at a meeting of the 27 european union heads of state in prague , the third stop on obama 's tour . the kyoto protocol is due to be replaced at talks in copenhagen at the end of the year , and climate change meetings are taking place across the globe in the lead-up to december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern said the us does not have a magic wand to fix the climate the obama administration made its international climate debut last weekend at un talks in bonn .
todd stern , obama 's special climate envoy , pledged to " make up for lost time " and called for more action by all nations . stern did say , however , that the us wanted to work towards a treaty that was economically " doable . "
but comments like this have some observers concerned about the united states ' commitment to fighting climate change . craig kennedy says that , despite the new administration 's rhetoric , there are doubts in europe that obama will be serious about climate change . " people look at the deficit ; people look at the pressures on the american economy , and people are starting to ask whether or not this is really going to be the highest priority , " he said . cla / sh / sms / rtr / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after considering the files , the prosecutor 's office said it would open a preliminary investigation into the firms , the first step towards a possible indictment on charges of dodging taxes and concealing the profits behind liechtenstein 's banking secrecy laws .
all three firms denied being the target of a money-laundering probe .
" the michelin group does not own a copa foundation , nor does it hold any accounts at the lgt bank in liechtenstein , " a spokesman for the firm told afp , denying claims in a report by french daily le parisien .
a spokeswoman for energy giant totalfinaelf said in a statement that it " formally denies " owning a foundation called " elf trading " in liechtenstein , while adidas told le parisien it had no knowledge of any such investigation .
" we have no activities in liechtenstein , with the exception of two service stations , " the total spokeswoman said in the statement .
french uncovered fraud files after german investigation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein has been trying to clamp down on tax evaders the files allegedly linking the three businesses to foundations which are suspected of being fronts for money laundering were uncovered after french authorities launched an investigation after a major german tax evasion scandal uncovered allegedly undeclared accounts held by foreign nationals within liechtenstein 's secretive banking sector .
french budget minister eric woerth confirmed on lci television that his ministry had transferred three files to prosecutors , but would neither confirm nor deny the names of the groups involved .
france 's finance ministry has been investigating 64 family-owned firms in connection with the scandal , of which 16 have since come clean and paid their overdue taxes and penalties , woerth said .
authorities estimated last year that french firms evaded up to one billion euros in taxes via liechtenstein , of which le parisien said elf , michelin and adidas accounted for " a large part " .
french president nicolas sarkozy recently said france would crack down on money laundering in european tax havens , including liechtenstein , luxembourg and andorra .
transparency international france estimates that corporate tax evasion via tax havens costs the french state some 10 billion euros per year .
leaders of the group of 20 meeting in london this week are set to draw up an international blacklist of tax havens , as worldwide pressure grows to clamp down on uncooperative nations and territories .

the two leaders said they hoped the summit would be a success . merkel called for an overhaul of the financial markets on tuesday , march 31 , after meeting with medvedev in the german capital . " the world is standing at a crossroads , " the chancellor told reporters at a joint press conference following the meeting .
" financial markets need to change in such a way that such crises are not repeated . " medvedev supported his german counterpart , adding that the g20 meeting would be the first of many meetings towards developing a new global financial system . " the g20 format does not have to provide the definitive solution , " he said .
" it should be the start of a new financial market design . " the two leaders also warned of protectionist policies implemented by some governments in response to the financial crisis . merkel said the g20 meeting must include a clear statement against protectionism . russia 's ambitious financial reform plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev heads to london with ambitious plans ahead of thursday 's summit in london , russia has come up with an ambitious plan to overhaul the entire global financial order .
medvedev even said the international community should have a say when the world 's richest countries make decisions with global implications , as in the us mortgage crisis . but analysts doubt russia 's plans will get many backers among group of 20 countries , be they established players or rising powerhouses such as brazil , india and china . economists say that while some of russia 's ideas - such as a world currency - are currently unfeasible , others it may offer will fail more due to moscow 's lack of diplomatic heft . though russia is a member of the group of eight industrial powers , it is still not among the 153 members of the world trade organization and is side-lined at meetings of group of seven finance ministers . while russia is among the top world energy producers and an undoubted political heavyweight , its economy is dwarfed by the united states and european union . amid reports that the g20 meeting may be devoted to crisis management rather than long-term reform , britain 's financial times has reported that the british foreign office has already relegated russia to the rank of second-division player . russia appears reluctant to accept this and has been talking up its reform plans for weeks . germany offers to mediate in gas dispute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : january 's gas dispute put a strain on eu-russia relations merkel also offered germany 's services on tuesday in resolving the dispute over gas between russia , and ukraine , which has made a deal to modernize its pipeline network with the european union last month . the chancellor said she would raise the issue with the european commission despite russia 's objection to the agreement . russia was angry at being left out of talks over the deal , calling the agreement an " unfriendly act . "
ukraine , however , has said its pipeline overhaul was not aimed at russia .
ukraine is a major transit country for russian energy headed to europe . merkel called on both parties not to let the situation escalate out of control . a gas dispute between russia and ukraine in january left some eu nations without gas for more than a week . cla / nda / sms / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat who will challenge merkel for the chancellorship , laid out a 10-point plan on monday and has said the german government must take action immediately . steinmeier proposed that the federal and state governments join forces with a consortium of opel dealers and managers to purchase a holding of 50 percent plus one share , leaving gm with the minority stake .
he said the move would give opel at least three months to reorganize and find a private investor . but german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg rejected the idea of buying directly into opel , arguing that berlin should limit itself to providing credit guarantees to attract investors . union makes concessions germany 's giant metalworkers union ig metall , meanwhile , has renewed calls for merkel to throw her full support behind efforts aimed at saving opel from bankruptcy . ig metal boss detlef wetzel questioned why merkel would provide billions of euros in a financial bail-out to banks but deny requests for aid from the " real economy . " meanwhile , the union 's regional director in frankfurt , armin schild , has indicated that opel workers are prepared to make significant concessions to keep the company afloat and prevent job cuts . he said possible changes could range from cutting working hours without compensatory wage increases to the negotiation of new collective agreements between employees and management . sje / sh / sms / dpa / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after considering the files , the prosecutor 's office said it would open a preliminary investigation into the firms , the first step towards a possible indictment on charges of dodging taxes and concealing the profits behind liechtenstein 's banking secrecy laws .
all three firms denied being the target of a money-laundering probe .
" the michelin group does not own a copa foundation , nor does it hold any accounts at the lgt bank in liechtenstein , " a spokesman for the firm told afp , denying claims in a report by french daily le parisien .
a spokeswoman for energy giant totalfinaelf said in a statement that it " formally denies " owning a foundation called " elf trading " in liechtenstein , while adidas told le parisien it had no knowledge of any such investigation .
" we have no activities in liechtenstein , with the exception of two service stations , " the total spokeswoman said in the statement .
french uncovered fraud files after german investigation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein has been trying to clamp down on tax evaders the files allegedly linking the three businesses to foundations which are suspected of being fronts for money laundering were uncovered after french authorities launched an investigation after a major german tax evasion scandal uncovered allegedly undeclared accounts held by foreign nationals within liechtenstein 's secretive banking sector .
french budget minister eric woerth confirmed on lci television that his ministry had transferred three files to prosecutors , but would neither confirm nor deny the names of the groups involved .
france 's finance ministry has been investigating 64 family-owned firms in connection with the scandal , of which 16 have since come clean and paid their overdue taxes and penalties , woerth said .
authorities estimated last year that french firms evaded up to one billion euros in taxes via liechtenstein , of which le parisien said elf , michelin and adidas accounted for " a large part " .
french president nicolas sarkozy recently said france would crack down on money laundering in european tax havens , including liechtenstein , luxembourg and andorra .
transparency international france estimates that corporate tax evasion via tax havens costs the french state some 10 billion euros per year .
leaders of the group of 20 meeting in london this week are set to draw up an international blacklist of tax havens , as worldwide pressure grows to clamp down on uncooperative nations and territories .

after considering the files , the prosecutor 's office said it would open a preliminary investigation into the firms , the first step towards a possible indictment on charges of dodging taxes and concealing the profits behind liechtenstein 's banking secrecy laws .
all three firms denied being the target of a money-laundering probe .
" the michelin group does not own a copa foundation , nor does it hold any accounts at the lgt bank in liechtenstein , " a spokesman for the firm told afp , denying claims in a report by french daily le parisien .
a spokeswoman for energy giant totalfinaelf said in a statement that it " formally denies " owning a foundation called " elf trading " in liechtenstein , while adidas told le parisien it had no knowledge of any such investigation .
" we have no activities in liechtenstein , with the exception of two service stations , " the total spokeswoman said in the statement .
french uncovered fraud files after german investigation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein has been trying to clamp down on tax evaders the files allegedly linking the three businesses to foundations which are suspected of being fronts for money laundering were uncovered after french authorities launched an investigation after a major german tax evasion scandal uncovered allegedly undeclared accounts held by foreign nationals within liechtenstein 's secretive banking sector .
french budget minister eric woerth confirmed on lci television that his ministry had transferred three files to prosecutors , but would neither confirm nor deny the names of the groups involved .
france 's finance ministry has been investigating 64 family-owned firms in connection with the scandal , of which 16 have since come clean and paid their overdue taxes and penalties , woerth said .
authorities estimated last year that french firms evaded up to one billion euros in taxes via liechtenstein , of which le parisien said elf , michelin and adidas accounted for " a large part " .
french president nicolas sarkozy recently said france would crack down on money laundering in european tax havens , including liechtenstein , luxembourg and andorra .
transparency international france estimates that corporate tax evasion via tax havens costs the french state some 10 billion euros per year .
leaders of the group of 20 meeting in london this week are set to draw up an international blacklist of tax havens , as worldwide pressure grows to clamp down on uncooperative nations and territories .
bowing to international pressure , liechtenstein agreed earlier this month to ease its strict banking secrecy rules and cooperate with foreign governments to combat tax fraud . nda / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

police said the group 's assets and propaganda material were seized in the raids .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : g20 summit in london can europe help developing countries out of the crisis ?
germany and france make the case for regulation financial crisis hindering african development goals merkel , medvedev unite on market reform before g20 summit economy -pipe- 31.03.2009 assertions of g20 unity mask underlying transatlantic tensions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g20 members have different views on market regulation and stimulus packages european countries are pushing for the g20 summit to focus on revamping the global financial architecture , but clashes with the us over stimulus packages continue to overshadow their drive ahead of the meeting this week . transatlantic tensions over the focus of the summit have marked the run-up to the april 2 meeting in london , which is supposed to be a demonstration of top-level unity between the world 's leading economic powers .
european leaders have repeatedly rebuffed us pressure to plough more money into their ailing economies as part of an international effort to revive withering global demand .
the dispute turned ugly last week when czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , described the united states ' ambitious but costly economic stimulus plans as " a way to hell . "
he also said " the united states is not on the right path " with its costly stimulus plans , and insisted " we need to read the history books " to avoid the same mistakes .
the remarks sent top aides scrambling to backtrack , with one insisting topolanek never made the " hell " remark .
since then , officials have been trying to paper over transatlantic differences .
tough talking ahead but world wants unity , says brown british prime minister gordon brown said on monday that tough talking would be needed but he felt that the world 's financial powers were united in finding solutions to the crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says he will do all he can to make the summit a success " we no doubt have some long days of negotiation ahead .
these are difficult and complex problems .
it will not be easy to reach the conclusions that i believe are necessary for the world economy , " said brown , but he added that his recent series of preparatory meetings with world leaders had made him feel certain that " the world wants to come together . "
brown said he would continue to do " all i can to build consensus and to enable an agreement to take us out of this recession and put the whole world back onto a path of growth . "
" this is a decisive moment for the world economy .
we have a choice to make .
we can either let the recession take its course and retreat into isolationism and protectionism ... or resolve as a world community to fight back against the global recession that is hurting people in every country and every continent , " said brown .
obama rejects " either or " approach in an interview with the financial times published on monday , us president barack obama said it was important that the summit should deliver a " message of unity . "
he rejected the idea of an " either or approach " between financial stimulus and regulation , saying that both were needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says both stimulus and regulation are needed " we need stimulus and regulation .
we need to deal with the problems right in front of us and we also need to make sure we 're taking steps to prevent these types of breakdowns from happening again , " obama said .
with respect to the stimulus there would be an accord in london that g20 countries " will do what is necessary to promote growth and trade , " he predicted .
however , he understood the " legitimate concerns " in some countries which had already initiated significant stimulus programs and wanted first to see how they worked .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso said on friday that there was " no dichotomy between stimulating the economy and improving global financial regulation . "
" we need both if we are to get the economy moving again and to restore confidence in a lasting way , " he added europe , us both committed to stimulus measures washington is spending trillions of dollars to support its banking system and drag the world 's biggest economy out of its deepest recession in decades .
meanwhile , the 27-nation european union has committed to economic stimulus measures in 2009 and 2010 worth 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 540 billion -rrb- , equivalent to 3.3 percent of the bloc 's gross domestic product .
the figure includes both national and eu level stimulus measures as well as automatic increases in social spending , such as unemployment benefits , which kick in when the economy weakens .
in berlin , a german spokesman said there were " no points of contention here between us and the us government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin insists there is no rift between obama and merkel " for both of us , and our position has been made clear for some time , regulation of financial markets is the focus of the meeting , " the spokesman said after chancellor angela merkel and us president barack obama held a video conference on thursday .
the rift between europe and the united states over the focus of the summit has been narrowed by washington 's latest announcement for sweeping financial regulatory reforms , including a single watchdog for all key financial institutions and payment systems .
like the united states , the eu wants to clamp down on hedge funds , private equity funds and the use of complicated credit derivatives as well as offshore tax havens .
europe is also in favor of doubling the international monetary fund 's resources for bailing out troubled countries to $ 500 billion , while washington wants to go even further by tripling its funds .
it also wants colleges of supervisors for all major cross-border financial institutions to be set up before the end of 2009 in order to keep a closer eye on big international groups .
talk of tensions is overblown but rifts exist , say experts experts in transatlantic relations say that despite the desire of all the major developed and developing powers at the g20 to show a united front , differences of emphasis do exist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some european nations are against pouring more money into the economy " the obama administration has been pushing europeans to spend much more , but the europeans are baulking at that , " kati suominen , a fellow with the german marshall fund of the united states , told afp .
" particularly the bigger countries , france , germany and the current holder of the european union presidency , czech republic , have been very adamantly opposed to new spending .
so there is a little bit of a rift there . "
dan price , a former assistant to president george w. bush for international economic affairs , argued that reports of discord between nations like france and germany and the united states were " somewhat overblown . "
he pointed out that washington had acted broadly to enact crisis rescue measures since the g20 finance ministers meeting in the uk just three weeks ago .
at those talks , us treasury secretary timothy geithner said washington would provide a capital assistance program for finance firms , and outline a plan to clear toxic assets from the books of crippled banks .
" i think the united states goes into the meeting having done what it said it would do , " said price , now senior partner for global issues at sidley austin llp .

germany and france make the case for regulation financial crisis hindering african development goals merkel , medvedev unite on market reform before g20 summit economy -pipe- 31.03.2009 assertions of g20 unity mask underlying transatlantic tensions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g20 members have different views on market regulation and stimulus packages european countries are pushing for the g20 summit to focus on revamping the global financial architecture , but clashes with the us over stimulus packages continue to overshadow their drive ahead of the meeting this week . transatlantic tensions over the focus of the summit have marked the run-up to the april 2 meeting in london , which is supposed to be a demonstration of top-level unity between the world 's leading economic powers .
european leaders have repeatedly rebuffed us pressure to plough more money into their ailing economies as part of an international effort to revive withering global demand .
the dispute turned ugly last week when czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , described the united states ' ambitious but costly economic stimulus plans as " a way to hell . "
he also said " the united states is not on the right path " with its costly stimulus plans , and insisted " we need to read the history books " to avoid the same mistakes .
the remarks sent top aides scrambling to backtrack , with one insisting topolanek never made the " hell " remark .
since then , officials have been trying to paper over transatlantic differences .
tough talking ahead but world wants unity , says brown british prime minister gordon brown said on monday that tough talking would be needed but he felt that the world 's financial powers were united in finding solutions to the crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says he will do all he can to make the summit a success " we no doubt have some long days of negotiation ahead .
these are difficult and complex problems .
it will not be easy to reach the conclusions that i believe are necessary for the world economy , " said brown , but he added that his recent series of preparatory meetings with world leaders had made him feel certain that " the world wants to come together . "
brown said he would continue to do " all i can to build consensus and to enable an agreement to take us out of this recession and put the whole world back onto a path of growth . "
" this is a decisive moment for the world economy .
we have a choice to make .
we can either let the recession take its course and retreat into isolationism and protectionism ... or resolve as a world community to fight back against the global recession that is hurting people in every country and every continent , " said brown .
obama rejects " either or " approach in an interview with the financial times published on monday , us president barack obama said it was important that the summit should deliver a " message of unity . "
he rejected the idea of an " either or approach " between financial stimulus and regulation , saying that both were needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says both stimulus and regulation are needed " we need stimulus and regulation .
we need to deal with the problems right in front of us and we also need to make sure we 're taking steps to prevent these types of breakdowns from happening again , " obama said .
with respect to the stimulus there would be an accord in london that g20 countries " will do what is necessary to promote growth and trade , " he predicted .
however , he understood the " legitimate concerns " in some countries which had already initiated significant stimulus programs and wanted first to see how they worked .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso said on friday that there was " no dichotomy between stimulating the economy and improving global financial regulation . "
" we need both if we are to get the economy moving again and to restore confidence in a lasting way , " he added europe , us both committed to stimulus measures washington is spending trillions of dollars to support its banking system and drag the world 's biggest economy out of its deepest recession in decades .
meanwhile , the 27-nation european union has committed to economic stimulus measures in 2009 and 2010 worth 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 540 billion -rrb- , equivalent to 3.3 percent of the bloc 's gross domestic product .

germany and france make the case for regulation financial crisis hindering african development goals merkel , medvedev unite on market reform before g20 summit economy -pipe- 31.03.2009 assertions of g20 unity mask underlying transatlantic tensions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g20 members have different views on market regulation and stimulus packages european countries are pushing for the g20 summit to focus on revamping the global financial architecture , but clashes with the us over stimulus packages continue to overshadow their drive ahead of the meeting this week . transatlantic tensions over the focus of the summit have marked the run-up to the april 2 meeting in london , which is supposed to be a demonstration of top-level unity between the world 's leading economic powers .
european leaders have repeatedly rebuffed us pressure to plough more money into their ailing economies as part of an international effort to revive withering global demand .
the dispute turned ugly last week when czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , described the united states ' ambitious but costly economic stimulus plans as " a way to hell . "
he also said " the united states is not on the right path " with its costly stimulus plans , and insisted " we need to read the history books " to avoid the same mistakes .
the remarks sent top aides scrambling to backtrack , with one insisting topolanek never made the " hell " remark .
since then , officials have been trying to paper over transatlantic differences .
tough talking ahead but world wants unity , says brown british prime minister gordon brown said on monday that tough talking would be needed but he felt that the world 's financial powers were united in finding solutions to the crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says he will do all he can to make the summit a success " we no doubt have some long days of negotiation ahead .
these are difficult and complex problems .
it will not be easy to reach the conclusions that i believe are necessary for the world economy , " said brown , but he added that his recent series of preparatory meetings with world leaders had made him feel certain that " the world wants to come together . "
brown said he would continue to do " all i can to build consensus and to enable an agreement to take us out of this recession and put the whole world back onto a path of growth . "
" this is a decisive moment for the world economy .
we have a choice to make .
we can either let the recession take its course and retreat into isolationism and protectionism ... or resolve as a world community to fight back against the global recession that is hurting people in every country and every continent , " said brown .
obama rejects " either or " approach in an interview with the financial times published on monday , us president barack obama said it was important that the summit should deliver a " message of unity . "
he rejected the idea of an " either or approach " between financial stimulus and regulation , saying that both were needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says both stimulus and regulation are needed " we need stimulus and regulation .
we need to deal with the problems right in front of us and we also need to make sure we 're taking steps to prevent these types of breakdowns from happening again , " obama said .
with respect to the stimulus there would be an accord in london that g20 countries " will do what is necessary to promote growth and trade , " he predicted .
however , he understood the " legitimate concerns " in some countries which had already initiated significant stimulus programs and wanted first to see how they worked .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso said on friday that there was " no dichotomy between stimulating the economy and improving global financial regulation . "
" we need both if we are to get the economy moving again and to restore confidence in a lasting way , " he added europe , us both committed to stimulus measures washington is spending trillions of dollars to support its banking system and drag the world 's biggest economy out of its deepest recession in decades .
meanwhile , the 27-nation european union has committed to economic stimulus measures in 2009 and 2010 worth 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 540 billion -rrb- , equivalent to 3.3 percent of the bloc 's gross domestic product .
the figure includes both national and eu level stimulus measures as well as automatic increases in social spending , such as unemployment benefits , which kick in when the economy weakens .
in berlin , a german spokesman said there were " no points of contention here between us and the us government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin insists there is no rift between obama and merkel " for both of us , and our position has been made clear for some time , regulation of financial markets is the focus of the meeting , " the spokesman said after chancellor angela merkel and us president barack obama held a video conference on thursday .
the rift between europe and the united states over the focus of the summit has been narrowed by washington 's latest announcement for sweeping financial regulatory reforms , including a single watchdog for all key financial institutions and payment systems .
like the united states , the eu wants to clamp down on hedge funds , private equity funds and the use of complicated credit derivatives as well as offshore tax havens .
europe is also in favor of doubling the international monetary fund 's resources for bailing out troubled countries to $ 500 billion , while washington wants to go even further by tripling its funds .
it also wants colleges of supervisors for all major cross-border financial institutions to be set up before the end of 2009 in order to keep a closer eye on big international groups .
talk of tensions is overblown but rifts exist , say experts experts in transatlantic relations say that despite the desire of all the major developed and developing powers at the g20 to show a united front , differences of emphasis do exist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some european nations are against pouring more money into the economy " the obama administration has been pushing europeans to spend much more , but the europeans are baulking at that , " kati suominen , a fellow with the german marshall fund of the united states , told afp .
" particularly the bigger countries , france , germany and the current holder of the european union presidency , czech republic , have been very adamantly opposed to new spending .
so there is a little bit of a rift there . "
dan price , a former assistant to president george w. bush for international economic affairs , argued that reports of discord between nations like france and germany and the united states were " somewhat overblown . "
he pointed out that washington had acted broadly to enact crisis rescue measures since the g20 finance ministers meeting in the uk just three weeks ago .
at those talks , us treasury secretary timothy geithner said washington would provide a capital assistance program for finance firms , and outline a plan to clear toxic assets from the books of crippled banks .
" i think the united states goes into the meeting having done what it said it would do , " said price , now senior partner for global issues at sidley austin llp .

" we have 60 days in which to talk about how a future concept should look , " merkel said on tuesday , march 31 , referring to the two month restructuring deadline us president barack obama set general motors one day earlier . merkel made her comments during a speech to some 3,000 opel workers at the company 's main plant in ruesselsheim , near frankfurt . she said the german government and authorities from states with major opel factories would join forces with bankers and opel managers to " defend german interests " in talks with gm and us officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel addressed a crowd of 3,000 workers at the opel factory in ruesselsheim .
" we must lay the foundation for the creation of a european opel , " merkel said , adding that she would work to ensure the carmaker was made economically viable by 2012 . she added that opel would be an efficient and modern organization where " employees can say they 're building german 's future and leading the world . " opel managers have said they need some 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.38 billion -rrb- to restructure their operations and become independent of general motors .
but the german government has so far refused to provide the funds because it is concerned public money may be transferred across the atlantic to help plug holes in gm 's accounts political maneuvering with national elections due in september , merkel 's grand coalition government remains split over how far the state should go in saving the 110-year-old german carmaker , which has been a gm subsidiary since 1929 .
merkel 's christian democratic union would prefer a private investor to rescue opel , while her junior coalition partners from the social democratic party want the state to make direct investments aimed at saving the company 's 26,000-strong workforce .

german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat who will challenge merkel for the chancellorship , laid out a 10-point plan on monday and has said the german government must take action immediately . steinmeier proposed that the federal and state governments join forces with a consortium of opel dealers and managers to purchase a holding of 50 percent plus one share , leaving gm with the minority stake .
he said the move would give opel at least three months to reorganize and find a private investor . but german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg rejected the idea of buying directly into opel , arguing that berlin should limit itself to providing credit guarantees to attract investors . union makes concessions germany 's giant metalworkers union ig metall , meanwhile , has renewed calls for merkel to throw her full support behind efforts aimed at saving opel from bankruptcy . ig metal boss detlef wetzel questioned why merkel would provide billions of euros in a financial bail-out to banks but deny requests for aid from the " real economy . " meanwhile , the union 's regional director in frankfurt , armin schild , has indicated that opel workers are prepared to make significant concessions to keep the company afloat and prevent job cuts . he said possible changes could range from cutting working hours without compensatory wage increases to the negotiation of new collective agreements between employees and management . sje / sh / sms / dpa / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 31.03.2009 obama gears up for european extravaganza großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is looking to obama to lead the way on several issues barack obama 's visit to europe marks his first major overseas trip since being sworn into office .
expectations are high as the us president takes part in three major conferences across the continent . though it may not match the 200,000 people who turned up to hear " obama the candidate " speak in berlin , the us president is likely to receive a warm welcome from europe 's leaders and the general public on a visit that begins this tuesday . but there 's an even greater sense of expectation this time around .
europe wants to know if " obama the president " will live up to the hype . the first stop on his whirlwind tour is london , where he 'll be the star attraction at the thursday meeting of the group of 20 nations .
there is no question that the world economy will be at the top of the agenda , but what is not clear is whether obama and european leaders can agree on how to act . last week , czech prime minister mirek topolanek described obama 's economic stimulus package as the " road to hell . " while other european leaders distanced themselves from topolanek 's comment , there are serious differences of opinion between the us and european governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek said the us was repeating the mistakes of the 1930s craig kennedy , president of the german marshall fund in washington , said europe is concerned that the us approach includes too much stimulus and not enough regulation . " the size of the american stimulus and the size of our resulting deficits are causing tremendous concern , " he said . restoring america 's standing obama is officially visiting europe to take part in international conferences , but the trip is a symbolic one too . the visit is a " fundamental part of the president 's agenda of restoring america 's standing in the world and particularly europe , " presidential advisor dennis mcdonough said . ties between europe and the us became strained during the previous administration of george w. bush , especially over the invasion of iraq . during his tour , obama will meet with the leaders of britain , france , germany , turkey and the czech republic .
he 's also set to hold talks with russian president dmitry medvedev while in london . relations between the us and russia came under particular strain last year during the russian-georgian war .
washington is also concerned that moscow 's aid to tehran 's nuclear energy program could help the islamic republic develop nuclear weapons .
iran maintains its nuclear program serves only civilian purposes . russia , on the other hand , objects to us plans to build a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic , and disapproves of nato 's push to extend membership to the ex-soviet republics of ukraine and georgia . on with the tour after the g20 summit in london , obama heads to strasbourg , france , for a summit marking the 60th anniversary of the north atlantic treaty organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in afghanistan is at its highest level since us-led forces toppled the taliban in 2001 he 's set to use the occasion to urge nato countries to support his new strategy for afghanistan , which he outlined last week . obama announced the deployment of an extra 4,000 troops , on top of the 17,000 reinforcements already planned .
his new strategy also includes an increase of civilian personnel , and a greater focus on fighting al qaeda and the taliban , particularly along the afghan-pakistan border . european governments have welcomed obama 's new afghanistan strategy , but nato members know that obama will now expect increased contributions from them too . chancellor angela merkel has announced that germany will boost its training of police and security forces in afghanistan , but has previously ruled out an increase of combat troops . the forgotten issue somewhere down on the to-do list is climate change .
the issue is up for discussion at a meeting of the 27 european union heads of state in prague , the third stop on obama 's tour . the kyoto protocol is due to be replaced at talks in copenhagen at the end of the year , and climate change meetings are taking place across the globe in the lead-up to december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern said the us does not have a magic wand to fix the climate the obama administration made its international climate debut last weekend at un talks in bonn .
todd stern , obama 's special climate envoy , pledged to " make up for lost time " and called for more action by all nations . stern did say , however , that the us wanted to work towards a treaty that was economically " doable . "
but comments like this have some observers concerned about the united states ' commitment to fighting climate change . craig kennedy says that , despite the new administration 's rhetoric , there are doubts in europe that obama will be serious about climate change . " people look at the deficit ; people look at the pressures on the american economy , and people are starting to ask whether or not this is really going to be the highest priority , " he said . cla / sh / sms / rtr / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu praises obama on afghanistan , pledges civilian surge the eu will embrace us president barack obama 's " european-style " strategy for afghanistan and will contribute to a " civilian surge " by providing more money and more police trainers , the bloc 's foreign ministers said .

some 200 police officers swooped on the headquarters of cologne 's local transport company , kvb , and on offices of building firms involved in the underground project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as well as the cost to human life , the collapse of the archive wiped out a priceless collection chief state prosecutor guenther feld said frankfurt , berlin , munich , essen , duesseldorf , karlsruhe and wiesbaden were among the cities where tuesday 's raids had taken place . the cologne state prosecutor 's office is investigating on suspicion of negligent homicide and endangering a building .
feld said the raids had been necessary even though those involved had been cooperative up to now .
" we still do not suspect any individual in particular , " said the city 's top chief prosecutor . building of subway restarts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is what the scene of destruction looked like from above meanwhile , the construction of the subway line continues .
a temporary halt in building work was rescinded on tuesday , march 31 , after independent experts had inspected the building sites .
the city transport 's supervisory board has decided to retain the technical director walter reinarz -lrb- cdu -rrb- in his post while the investigations are ongoing .
reinarz has come under fire for failing to pass on important information about groundwater problems in the metro construction site near the historic archive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city 's mayor believes he has been unfairly attacked over the affair cologne mayor fritz schramma -lrb- cdu -rrb- continues to back reinarz .
on sunday , however , schramma himself announced that he would not be standing again for re-election in summer , in part because of anonymous attacks from the ranks of his own party for his handling of the crisis . the city mayor said that he had been placed under general suspicion and described the attempt to find the culprits for the disaster as a " politically motivated search for scapegoats .

expectations are high as the us president takes part in three major conferences across the continent . though it may not match the 200,000 people who turned up to hear " obama the candidate " speak in berlin , the us president is likely to receive a warm welcome from europe 's leaders and the general public on a visit that begins this tuesday . but there 's an even greater sense of expectation this time around .
europe wants to know if " obama the president " will live up to the hype . the first stop on his whirlwind tour is london , where he 'll be the star attraction at the thursday meeting of the group of 20 nations .
there is no question that the world economy will be at the top of the agenda , but what is not clear is whether obama and european leaders can agree on how to act . last week , czech prime minister mirek topolanek described obama 's economic stimulus package as the " road to hell . " while other european leaders distanced themselves from topolanek 's comment , there are serious differences of opinion between the us and european governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek said the us was repeating the mistakes of the 1930s craig kennedy , president of the german marshall fund in washington , said europe is concerned that the us approach includes too much stimulus and not enough regulation . " the size of the american stimulus and the size of our resulting deficits are causing tremendous concern , " he said . restoring america 's standing obama is officially visiting europe to take part in international conferences , but the trip is a symbolic one too . the visit is a " fundamental part of the president 's agenda of restoring america 's standing in the world and particularly europe , " presidential advisor dennis mcdonough said . ties between europe and the us became strained during the previous administration of george w. bush , especially over the invasion of iraq . during his tour , obama will meet with the leaders of britain , france , germany , turkey and the czech republic .
he 's also set to hold talks with russian president dmitry medvedev while in london . relations between the us and russia came under particular strain last year during the russian-georgian war .
washington is also concerned that moscow 's aid to tehran 's nuclear energy program could help the islamic republic develop nuclear weapons .
iran maintains its nuclear program serves only civilian purposes . russia , on the other hand , objects to us plans to build a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic , and disapproves of nato 's push to extend membership to the ex-soviet republics of ukraine and georgia . on with the tour after the g20 summit in london , obama heads to strasbourg , france , for a summit marking the 60th anniversary of the north atlantic treaty organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in afghanistan is at its highest level since us-led forces toppled the taliban in 2001 he 's set to use the occasion to urge nato countries to support his new strategy for afghanistan , which he outlined last week . obama announced the deployment of an extra 4,000 troops , on top of the 17,000 reinforcements already planned .
his new strategy also includes an increase of civilian personnel , and a greater focus on fighting al qaeda and the taliban , particularly along the afghan-pakistan border . european governments have welcomed obama 's new afghanistan strategy , but nato members know that obama will now expect increased contributions from them too . chancellor angela merkel has announced that germany will boost its training of police and security forces in afghanistan , but has previously ruled out an increase of combat troops . the forgotten issue somewhere down on the to-do list is climate change .
the issue is up for discussion at a meeting of the 27 european union heads of state in prague , the third stop on obama 's tour . the kyoto protocol is due to be replaced at talks in copenhagen at the end of the year , and climate change meetings are taking place across the globe in the lead-up to december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern said the us does not have a magic wand to fix the climate the obama administration made its international climate debut last weekend at un talks in bonn .
todd stern , obama 's special climate envoy , pledged to " make up for lost time " and called for more action by all nations . stern did say , however , that the us wanted to work towards a treaty that was economically " doable . "
but comments like this have some observers concerned about the united states ' commitment to fighting climate change . craig kennedy says that , despite the new administration 's rhetoric , there are doubts in europe that obama will be serious about climate change .

there is no question that the world economy will be at the top of the agenda , but what is not clear is whether obama and european leaders can agree on how to act . last week , czech prime minister mirek topolanek described obama 's economic stimulus package as the " road to hell . " while other european leaders distanced themselves from topolanek 's comment , there are serious differences of opinion between the us and european governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek said the us was repeating the mistakes of the 1930s craig kennedy , president of the german marshall fund in washington , said europe is concerned that the us approach includes too much stimulus and not enough regulation .

he 's also set to hold talks with russian president dmitry medvedev while in london . relations between the us and russia came under particular strain last year during the russian-georgian war .
washington is also concerned that moscow 's aid to tehran 's nuclear energy program could help the islamic republic develop nuclear weapons .
iran maintains its nuclear program serves only civilian purposes . russia , on the other hand , objects to us plans to build a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic , and disapproves of nato 's push to extend membership to the ex-soviet republics of ukraine and georgia . on with the tour after the g20 summit in london , obama heads to strasbourg , france , for a summit marking the 60th anniversary of the north atlantic treaty organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in afghanistan is at its highest level since us-led forces toppled the taliban in 2001 he 's set to use the occasion to urge nato countries to support his new strategy for afghanistan , which he outlined last week . obama announced the deployment of an extra 4,000 troops , on top of the 17,000 reinforcements already planned .

germany and france make the case for regulation financial crisis hindering african development goals assertions of g20 unity mask underlying transatlantic tensions international relations -pipe- 31.03.2009 merkel , medvedev unite on market reform before g20 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev and merkel focused on finance during talks in berlin german chancellor angela merkel and russian president dmitry medvedev will head to the g20 summit with similar goals and expectations .
the two leaders said they hoped the summit would be a success . merkel called for an overhaul of the financial markets on tuesday , march 31 , after meeting with medvedev in the german capital . " the world is standing at a crossroads , " the chancellor told reporters at a joint press conference following the meeting .
" financial markets need to change in such a way that such crises are not repeated . " medvedev supported his german counterpart , adding that the g20 meeting would be the first of many meetings towards developing a new global financial system . " the g20 format does not have to provide the definitive solution , " he said .
" it should be the start of a new financial market design . " the two leaders also warned of protectionist policies implemented by some governments in response to the financial crisis . merkel said the g20 meeting must include a clear statement against protectionism . russia 's ambitious financial reform plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev heads to london with ambitious plans ahead of thursday 's summit in london , russia has come up with an ambitious plan to overhaul the entire global financial order .
medvedev even said the international community should have a say when the world 's richest countries make decisions with global implications , as in the us mortgage crisis . but analysts doubt russia 's plans will get many backers among group of 20 countries , be they established players or rising powerhouses such as brazil , india and china . economists say that while some of russia 's ideas - such as a world currency - are currently unfeasible , others it may offer will fail more due to moscow 's lack of diplomatic heft . though russia is a member of the group of eight industrial powers , it is still not among the 153 members of the world trade organization and is side-lined at meetings of group of seven finance ministers . while russia is among the top world energy producers and an undoubted political heavyweight , its economy is dwarfed by the united states and european union . amid reports that the g20 meeting may be devoted to crisis management rather than long-term reform , britain 's financial times has reported that the british foreign office has already relegated russia to the rank of second-division player . russia appears reluctant to accept this and has been talking up its reform plans for weeks . germany offers to mediate in gas dispute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : january 's gas dispute put a strain on eu-russia relations merkel also offered germany 's services on tuesday in resolving the dispute over gas between russia , and ukraine , which has made a deal to modernize its pipeline network with the european union last month . the chancellor said she would raise the issue with the european commission despite russia 's objection to the agreement . russia was angry at being left out of talks over the deal , calling the agreement an " unfriendly act . "
ukraine , however , has said its pipeline overhaul was not aimed at russia .

germany and france make the case for regulation financial crisis hindering african development goals merkel , medvedev unite on market reform before g20 summit economy -pipe- 31.03.2009 assertions of g20 unity mask underlying transatlantic tensions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g20 members have different views on market regulation and stimulus packages european countries are pushing for the g20 summit to focus on revamping the global financial architecture , but clashes with the us over stimulus packages continue to overshadow their drive ahead of the meeting this week . transatlantic tensions over the focus of the summit have marked the run-up to the april 2 meeting in london , which is supposed to be a demonstration of top-level unity between the world 's leading economic powers .
european leaders have repeatedly rebuffed us pressure to plough more money into their ailing economies as part of an international effort to revive withering global demand .
the dispute turned ugly last week when czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , described the united states ' ambitious but costly economic stimulus plans as " a way to hell . "
he also said " the united states is not on the right path " with its costly stimulus plans , and insisted " we need to read the history books " to avoid the same mistakes .
the remarks sent top aides scrambling to backtrack , with one insisting topolanek never made the " hell " remark .
since then , officials have been trying to paper over transatlantic differences .
tough talking ahead but world wants unity , says brown british prime minister gordon brown said on monday that tough talking would be needed but he felt that the world 's financial powers were united in finding solutions to the crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says he will do all he can to make the summit a success " we no doubt have some long days of negotiation ahead .
these are difficult and complex problems .
it will not be easy to reach the conclusions that i believe are necessary for the world economy , " said brown , but he added that his recent series of preparatory meetings with world leaders had made him feel certain that " the world wants to come together . "
brown said he would continue to do " all i can to build consensus and to enable an agreement to take us out of this recession and put the whole world back onto a path of growth . "
" this is a decisive moment for the world economy .
we have a choice to make .
we can either let the recession take its course and retreat into isolationism and protectionism ... or resolve as a world community to fight back against the global recession that is hurting people in every country and every continent , " said brown .
obama rejects " either or " approach in an interview with the financial times published on monday , us president barack obama said it was important that the summit should deliver a " message of unity . "
he rejected the idea of an " either or approach " between financial stimulus and regulation , saying that both were needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says both stimulus and regulation are needed " we need stimulus and regulation .
we need to deal with the problems right in front of us and we also need to make sure we 're taking steps to prevent these types of breakdowns from happening again , " obama said .
with respect to the stimulus there would be an accord in london that g20 countries " will do what is necessary to promote growth and trade , " he predicted .
however , he understood the " legitimate concerns " in some countries which had already initiated significant stimulus programs and wanted first to see how they worked .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso said on friday that there was " no dichotomy between stimulating the economy and improving global financial regulation . "
" we need both if we are to get the economy moving again and to restore confidence in a lasting way , " he added europe , us both committed to stimulus measures washington is spending trillions of dollars to support its banking system and drag the world 's biggest economy out of its deepest recession in decades .
meanwhile , the 27-nation european union has committed to economic stimulus measures in 2009 and 2010 worth 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 540 billion -rrb- , equivalent to 3.3 percent of the bloc 's gross domestic product .
the figure includes both national and eu level stimulus measures as well as automatic increases in social spending , such as unemployment benefits , which kick in when the economy weakens .
in berlin , a german spokesman said there were " no points of contention here between us and the us government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin insists there is no rift between obama and merkel " for both of us , and our position has been made clear for some time , regulation of financial markets is the focus of the meeting , " the spokesman said after chancellor angela merkel and us president barack obama held a video conference on thursday .
the rift between europe and the united states over the focus of the summit has been narrowed by washington 's latest announcement for sweeping financial regulatory reforms , including a single watchdog for all key financial institutions and payment systems .
like the united states , the eu wants to clamp down on hedge funds , private equity funds and the use of complicated credit derivatives as well as offshore tax havens .
europe is also in favor of doubling the international monetary fund 's resources for bailing out troubled countries to $ 500 billion , while washington wants to go even further by tripling its funds .
it also wants colleges of supervisors for all major cross-border financial institutions to be set up before the end of 2009 in order to keep a closer eye on big international groups .
talk of tensions is overblown but rifts exist , say experts experts in transatlantic relations say that despite the desire of all the major developed and developing powers at the g20 to show a united front , differences of emphasis do exist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some european nations are against pouring more money into the economy " the obama administration has been pushing europeans to spend much more , but the europeans are baulking at that , " kati suominen , a fellow with the german marshall fund of the united states , told afp .
" particularly the bigger countries , france , germany and the current holder of the european union presidency , czech republic , have been very adamantly opposed to new spending .
so there is a little bit of a rift there . "
dan price , a former assistant to president george w. bush for international economic affairs , argued that reports of discord between nations like france and germany and the united states were " somewhat overblown . "
he pointed out that washington had acted broadly to enact crisis rescue measures since the g20 finance ministers meeting in the uk just three weeks ago .
at those talks , us treasury secretary timothy geithner said washington would provide a capital assistance program for finance firms , and outline a plan to clear toxic assets from the books of crippled banks .
" i think the united states goes into the meeting having done what it said it would do , " said price , now senior partner for global issues at sidley austin llp .
" the united states will be interested to hear what the other nations will do in this regard . " nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany and france make the case for regulation financial crisis hindering african development goals merkel , medvedev unite on market reform before g20 summit economy -pipe- 31.03.2009 assertions of g20 unity mask underlying transatlantic tensions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g20 members have different views on market regulation and stimulus packages european countries are pushing for the g20 summit to focus on revamping the global financial architecture , but clashes with the us over stimulus packages continue to overshadow their drive ahead of the meeting this week . transatlantic tensions over the focus of the summit have marked the run-up to the april 2 meeting in london , which is supposed to be a demonstration of top-level unity between the world 's leading economic powers .
european leaders have repeatedly rebuffed us pressure to plough more money into their ailing economies as part of an international effort to revive withering global demand .
the dispute turned ugly last week when czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , described the united states ' ambitious but costly economic stimulus plans as " a way to hell . "
he also said " the united states is not on the right path " with its costly stimulus plans , and insisted " we need to read the history books " to avoid the same mistakes .
the remarks sent top aides scrambling to backtrack , with one insisting topolanek never made the " hell " remark .
since then , officials have been trying to paper over transatlantic differences .
tough talking ahead but world wants unity , says brown british prime minister gordon brown said on monday that tough talking would be needed but he felt that the world 's financial powers were united in finding solutions to the crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says he will do all he can to make the summit a success " we no doubt have some long days of negotiation ahead .
these are difficult and complex problems .
it will not be easy to reach the conclusions that i believe are necessary for the world economy , " said brown , but he added that his recent series of preparatory meetings with world leaders had made him feel certain that " the world wants to come together . "
brown said he would continue to do " all i can to build consensus and to enable an agreement to take us out of this recession and put the whole world back onto a path of growth . "
" this is a decisive moment for the world economy .
we have a choice to make .
we can either let the recession take its course and retreat into isolationism and protectionism ... or resolve as a world community to fight back against the global recession that is hurting people in every country and every continent , " said brown .
obama rejects " either or " approach in an interview with the financial times published on monday , us president barack obama said it was important that the summit should deliver a " message of unity . "
he rejected the idea of an " either or approach " between financial stimulus and regulation , saying that both were needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says both stimulus and regulation are needed " we need stimulus and regulation .
we need to deal with the problems right in front of us and we also need to make sure we 're taking steps to prevent these types of breakdowns from happening again , " obama said .
with respect to the stimulus there would be an accord in london that g20 countries " will do what is necessary to promote growth and trade , " he predicted .
however , he understood the " legitimate concerns " in some countries which had already initiated significant stimulus programs and wanted first to see how they worked .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso said on friday that there was " no dichotomy between stimulating the economy and improving global financial regulation . "
" we need both if we are to get the economy moving again and to restore confidence in a lasting way , " he added europe , us both committed to stimulus measures washington is spending trillions of dollars to support its banking system and drag the world 's biggest economy out of its deepest recession in decades .
meanwhile , the 27-nation european union has committed to economic stimulus measures in 2009 and 2010 worth 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 540 billion -rrb- , equivalent to 3.3 percent of the bloc 's gross domestic product .
the figure includes both national and eu level stimulus measures as well as automatic increases in social spending , such as unemployment benefits , which kick in when the economy weakens .
in berlin , a german spokesman said there were " no points of contention here between us and the us government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin insists there is no rift between obama and merkel " for both of us , and our position has been made clear for some time , regulation of financial markets is the focus of the meeting , " the spokesman said after chancellor angela merkel and us president barack obama held a video conference on thursday .
the rift between europe and the united states over the focus of the summit has been narrowed by washington 's latest announcement for sweeping financial regulatory reforms , including a single watchdog for all key financial institutions and payment systems .
like the united states , the eu wants to clamp down on hedge funds , private equity funds and the use of complicated credit derivatives as well as offshore tax havens .
europe is also in favor of doubling the international monetary fund 's resources for bailing out troubled countries to $ 500 billion , while washington wants to go even further by tripling its funds .
it also wants colleges of supervisors for all major cross-border financial institutions to be set up before the end of 2009 in order to keep a closer eye on big international groups .
talk of tensions is overblown but rifts exist , say experts experts in transatlantic relations say that despite the desire of all the major developed and developing powers at the g20 to show a united front , differences of emphasis do exist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some european nations are against pouring more money into the economy " the obama administration has been pushing europeans to spend much more , but the europeans are baulking at that , " kati suominen , a fellow with the german marshall fund of the united states , told afp .
" particularly the bigger countries , france , germany and the current holder of the european union presidency , czech republic , have been very adamantly opposed to new spending .
so there is a little bit of a rift there . "
dan price , a former assistant to president george w. bush for international economic affairs , argued that reports of discord between nations like france and germany and the united states were " somewhat overblown . "
he pointed out that washington had acted broadly to enact crisis rescue measures since the g20 finance ministers meeting in the uk just three weeks ago .
at those talks , us treasury secretary timothy geithner said washington would provide a capital assistance program for finance firms , and outline a plan to clear toxic assets from the books of crippled banks .
" i think the united states goes into the meeting having done what it said it would do , " said price , now senior partner for global issues at sidley austin llp .
" the united states will be interested to hear what the other nations will do in this regard . " nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

feld said the raids had been necessary even though those involved had been cooperative up to now .

the city transport 's supervisory board has decided to retain the technical director walter reinarz -lrb- cdu -rrb- in his post while the investigations are ongoing .
reinarz has come under fire for failing to pass on important information about groundwater problems in the metro construction site near the historic archive .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as well as the cost to human life , the collapse of the archive wiped out a priceless collection chief state prosecutor guenther feld said frankfurt , berlin , munich , essen , duesseldorf , karlsruhe and wiesbaden were among the cities where tuesday 's raids had taken place . the cologne state prosecutor 's office is investigating on suspicion of negligent homicide and endangering a building .
feld said the raids had been necessary even though those involved had been cooperative up to now .
" we still do not suspect any individual in particular , " said the city 's top chief prosecutor . building of subway restarts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is what the scene of destruction looked like from above meanwhile , the construction of the subway line continues .
a temporary halt in building work was rescinded on tuesday , march 31 , after independent experts had inspected the building sites .
the city transport 's supervisory board has decided to retain the technical director walter reinarz -lrb- cdu -rrb- in his post while the investigations are ongoing .
reinarz has come under fire for failing to pass on important information about groundwater problems in the metro construction site near the historic archive .

on sunday , however , schramma himself announced that he would not be standing again for re-election in summer , in part because of anonymous attacks from the ranks of his own party for his handling of the crisis . the city mayor said that he had been placed under general suspicion and described the attempt to find the culprits for the disaster as a " politically motivated search for scapegoats .

after considering the files , the prosecutor 's office said it would open a preliminary investigation into the firms , the first step towards a possible indictment on charges of dodging taxes and concealing the profits behind liechtenstein 's banking secrecy laws .
all three firms denied being the target of a money-laundering probe .
" the michelin group does not own a copa foundation , nor does it hold any accounts at the lgt bank in liechtenstein , " a spokesman for the firm told afp , denying claims in a report by french daily le parisien .
a spokeswoman for energy giant totalfinaelf said in a statement that it " formally denies " owning a foundation called " elf trading " in liechtenstein , while adidas told le parisien it had no knowledge of any such investigation .
" we have no activities in liechtenstein , with the exception of two service stations , " the total spokeswoman said in the statement .
french uncovered fraud files after german investigation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein has been trying to clamp down on tax evaders the files allegedly linking the three businesses to foundations which are suspected of being fronts for money laundering were uncovered after french authorities launched an investigation after a major german tax evasion scandal uncovered allegedly undeclared accounts held by foreign nationals within liechtenstein 's secretive banking sector .
french budget minister eric woerth confirmed on lci television that his ministry had transferred three files to prosecutors , but would neither confirm nor deny the names of the groups involved .
france 's finance ministry has been investigating 64 family-owned firms in connection with the scandal , of which 16 have since come clean and paid their overdue taxes and penalties , woerth said .
authorities estimated last year that french firms evaded up to one billion euros in taxes via liechtenstein , of which le parisien said elf , michelin and adidas accounted for " a large part " .
french president nicolas sarkozy recently said france would crack down on money laundering in european tax havens , including liechtenstein , luxembourg and andorra .
transparency international france estimates that corporate tax evasion via tax havens costs the french state some 10 billion euros per year .

some 200 police officers swooped on the headquarters of cologne 's local transport company , kvb , and on offices of building firms involved in the underground project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as well as the cost to human life , the collapse of the archive wiped out a priceless collection chief state prosecutor guenther feld said frankfurt , berlin , munich , essen , duesseldorf , karlsruhe and wiesbaden were among the cities where tuesday 's raids had taken place . the cologne state prosecutor 's office is investigating on suspicion of negligent homicide and endangering a building .
feld said the raids had been necessary even though those involved had been cooperative up to now .
" we still do not suspect any individual in particular , " said the city 's top chief prosecutor . building of subway restarts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is what the scene of destruction looked like from above meanwhile , the construction of the subway line continues .
a temporary halt in building work was rescinded on tuesday , march 31 , after independent experts had inspected the building sites .
the city transport 's supervisory board has decided to retain the technical director walter reinarz -lrb- cdu -rrb- in his post while the investigations are ongoing .
reinarz has come under fire for failing to pass on important information about groundwater problems in the metro construction site near the historic archive .

on sunday , however , schramma himself announced that he would not be standing again for re-election in summer , in part because of anonymous attacks from the ranks of his own party for his handling of the crisis . the city mayor said that he had been placed under general suspicion and described the attempt to find the culprits for the disaster as a " politically motivated search for scapegoats .

germany and france make the case for regulation financial crisis hindering african development goals merkel , medvedev unite on market reform before g20 summit economy -pipe- 31.03.2009 assertions of g20 unity mask underlying transatlantic tensions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g20 members have different views on market regulation and stimulus packages european countries are pushing for the g20 summit to focus on revamping the global financial architecture , but clashes with the us over stimulus packages continue to overshadow their drive ahead of the meeting this week . transatlantic tensions over the focus of the summit have marked the run-up to the april 2 meeting in london , which is supposed to be a demonstration of top-level unity between the world 's leading economic powers .
european leaders have repeatedly rebuffed us pressure to plough more money into their ailing economies as part of an international effort to revive withering global demand .
the dispute turned ugly last week when czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , described the united states ' ambitious but costly economic stimulus plans as " a way to hell . "
he also said " the united states is not on the right path " with its costly stimulus plans , and insisted " we need to read the history books " to avoid the same mistakes .
the remarks sent top aides scrambling to backtrack , with one insisting topolanek never made the " hell " remark .
since then , officials have been trying to paper over transatlantic differences .
tough talking ahead but world wants unity , says brown british prime minister gordon brown said on monday that tough talking would be needed but he felt that the world 's financial powers were united in finding solutions to the crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says he will do all he can to make the summit a success " we no doubt have some long days of negotiation ahead .
these are difficult and complex problems .
it will not be easy to reach the conclusions that i believe are necessary for the world economy , " said brown , but he added that his recent series of preparatory meetings with world leaders had made him feel certain that " the world wants to come together . "
brown said he would continue to do " all i can to build consensus and to enable an agreement to take us out of this recession and put the whole world back onto a path of growth . "
" this is a decisive moment for the world economy .
we have a choice to make .
we can either let the recession take its course and retreat into isolationism and protectionism ... or resolve as a world community to fight back against the global recession that is hurting people in every country and every continent , " said brown .
obama rejects " either or " approach in an interview with the financial times published on monday , us president barack obama said it was important that the summit should deliver a " message of unity . "
he rejected the idea of an " either or approach " between financial stimulus and regulation , saying that both were needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says both stimulus and regulation are needed " we need stimulus and regulation .
we need to deal with the problems right in front of us and we also need to make sure we 're taking steps to prevent these types of breakdowns from happening again , " obama said .
with respect to the stimulus there would be an accord in london that g20 countries " will do what is necessary to promote growth and trade , " he predicted .
however , he understood the " legitimate concerns " in some countries which had already initiated significant stimulus programs and wanted first to see how they worked .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso said on friday that there was " no dichotomy between stimulating the economy and improving global financial regulation . "
" we need both if we are to get the economy moving again and to restore confidence in a lasting way , " he added europe , us both committed to stimulus measures washington is spending trillions of dollars to support its banking system and drag the world 's biggest economy out of its deepest recession in decades .
meanwhile , the 27-nation european union has committed to economic stimulus measures in 2009 and 2010 worth 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 540 billion -rrb- , equivalent to 3.3 percent of the bloc 's gross domestic product .
the figure includes both national and eu level stimulus measures as well as automatic increases in social spending , such as unemployment benefits , which kick in when the economy weakens .
in berlin , a german spokesman said there were " no points of contention here between us and the us government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin insists there is no rift between obama and merkel " for both of us , and our position has been made clear for some time , regulation of financial markets is the focus of the meeting , " the spokesman said after chancellor angela merkel and us president barack obama held a video conference on thursday .
the rift between europe and the united states over the focus of the summit has been narrowed by washington 's latest announcement for sweeping financial regulatory reforms , including a single watchdog for all key financial institutions and payment systems .
like the united states , the eu wants to clamp down on hedge funds , private equity funds and the use of complicated credit derivatives as well as offshore tax havens .
europe is also in favor of doubling the international monetary fund 's resources for bailing out troubled countries to $ 500 billion , while washington wants to go even further by tripling its funds .
it also wants colleges of supervisors for all major cross-border financial institutions to be set up before the end of 2009 in order to keep a closer eye on big international groups .
talk of tensions is overblown but rifts exist , say experts experts in transatlantic relations say that despite the desire of all the major developed and developing powers at the g20 to show a united front , differences of emphasis do exist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some european nations are against pouring more money into the economy " the obama administration has been pushing europeans to spend much more , but the europeans are baulking at that , " kati suominen , a fellow with the german marshall fund of the united states , told afp .
" particularly the bigger countries , france , germany and the current holder of the european union presidency , czech republic , have been very adamantly opposed to new spending .
so there is a little bit of a rift there . "
dan price , a former assistant to president george w. bush for international economic affairs , argued that reports of discord between nations like france and germany and the united states were " somewhat overblown . "
he pointed out that washington had acted broadly to enact crisis rescue measures since the g20 finance ministers meeting in the uk just three weeks ago .
at those talks , us treasury secretary timothy geithner said washington would provide a capital assistance program for finance firms , and outline a plan to clear toxic assets from the books of crippled banks .
" i think the united states goes into the meeting having done what it said it would do , " said price , now senior partner for global issues at sidley austin llp .
" the united states will be interested to hear what the other nations will do in this regard . " nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we need both if we are to get the economy moving again and to restore confidence in a lasting way , " he added europe , us both committed to stimulus measures washington is spending trillions of dollars to support its banking system and drag the world 's biggest economy out of its deepest recession in decades .
meanwhile , the 27-nation european union has committed to economic stimulus measures in 2009 and 2010 worth 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 540 billion -rrb- , equivalent to 3.3 percent of the bloc 's gross domestic product .
the figure includes both national and eu level stimulus measures as well as automatic increases in social spending , such as unemployment benefits , which kick in when the economy weakens .
in berlin , a german spokesman said there were " no points of contention here between us and the us government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin insists there is no rift between obama and merkel " for both of us , and our position has been made clear for some time , regulation of financial markets is the focus of the meeting , " the spokesman said after chancellor angela merkel and us president barack obama held a video conference on thursday .
the rift between europe and the united states over the focus of the summit has been narrowed by washington 's latest announcement for sweeping financial regulatory reforms , including a single watchdog for all key financial institutions and payment systems .
like the united states , the eu wants to clamp down on hedge funds , private equity funds and the use of complicated credit derivatives as well as offshore tax havens .
europe is also in favor of doubling the international monetary fund 's resources for bailing out troubled countries to $ 500 billion , while washington wants to go even further by tripling its funds .
it also wants colleges of supervisors for all major cross-border financial institutions to be set up before the end of 2009 in order to keep a closer eye on big international groups .
talk of tensions is overblown but rifts exist , say experts experts in transatlantic relations say that despite the desire of all the major developed and developing powers at the g20 to show a united front , differences of emphasis do exist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some european nations are against pouring more money into the economy " the obama administration has been pushing europeans to spend much more , but the europeans are baulking at that , " kati suominen , a fellow with the german marshall fund of the united states , told afp .
" particularly the bigger countries , france , germany and the current holder of the european union presidency , czech republic , have been very adamantly opposed to new spending .
so there is a little bit of a rift there . "
dan price , a former assistant to president george w. bush for international economic affairs , argued that reports of discord between nations like france and germany and the united states were " somewhat overblown . "
he pointed out that washington had acted broadly to enact crisis rescue measures since the g20 finance ministers meeting in the uk just three weeks ago .
at those talks , us treasury secretary timothy geithner said washington would provide a capital assistance program for finance firms , and outline a plan to clear toxic assets from the books of crippled banks .
" i think the united states goes into the meeting having done what it said it would do , " said price , now senior partner for global issues at sidley austin llp .
" the united states will be interested to hear what the other nations will do in this regard . " nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany and france make the case for regulation financial crisis hindering african development goals merkel , medvedev unite on market reform before g20 summit economy -pipe- 31.03.2009 assertions of g20 unity mask underlying transatlantic tensions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g20 members have different views on market regulation and stimulus packages european countries are pushing for the g20 summit to focus on revamping the global financial architecture , but clashes with the us over stimulus packages continue to overshadow their drive ahead of the meeting this week . transatlantic tensions over the focus of the summit have marked the run-up to the april 2 meeting in london , which is supposed to be a demonstration of top-level unity between the world 's leading economic powers .
european leaders have repeatedly rebuffed us pressure to plough more money into their ailing economies as part of an international effort to revive withering global demand .
the dispute turned ugly last week when czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , described the united states ' ambitious but costly economic stimulus plans as " a way to hell . "
he also said " the united states is not on the right path " with its costly stimulus plans , and insisted " we need to read the history books " to avoid the same mistakes .
the remarks sent top aides scrambling to backtrack , with one insisting topolanek never made the " hell " remark .
since then , officials have been trying to paper over transatlantic differences .
tough talking ahead but world wants unity , says brown british prime minister gordon brown said on monday that tough talking would be needed but he felt that the world 's financial powers were united in finding solutions to the crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says he will do all he can to make the summit a success " we no doubt have some long days of negotiation ahead .
these are difficult and complex problems .
it will not be easy to reach the conclusions that i believe are necessary for the world economy , " said brown , but he added that his recent series of preparatory meetings with world leaders had made him feel certain that " the world wants to come together . "
brown said he would continue to do " all i can to build consensus and to enable an agreement to take us out of this recession and put the whole world back onto a path of growth . "
" this is a decisive moment for the world economy .
we have a choice to make .
we can either let the recession take its course and retreat into isolationism and protectionism ... or resolve as a world community to fight back against the global recession that is hurting people in every country and every continent , " said brown .
obama rejects " either or " approach in an interview with the financial times published on monday , us president barack obama said it was important that the summit should deliver a " message of unity . "
he rejected the idea of an " either or approach " between financial stimulus and regulation , saying that both were needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says both stimulus and regulation are needed " we need stimulus and regulation .
we need to deal with the problems right in front of us and we also need to make sure we 're taking steps to prevent these types of breakdowns from happening again , " obama said .
with respect to the stimulus there would be an accord in london that g20 countries " will do what is necessary to promote growth and trade , " he predicted .
however , he understood the " legitimate concerns " in some countries which had already initiated significant stimulus programs and wanted first to see how they worked .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso said on friday that there was " no dichotomy between stimulating the economy and improving global financial regulation . "
" we need both if we are to get the economy moving again and to restore confidence in a lasting way , " he added europe , us both committed to stimulus measures washington is spending trillions of dollars to support its banking system and drag the world 's biggest economy out of its deepest recession in decades .
meanwhile , the 27-nation european union has committed to economic stimulus measures in 2009 and 2010 worth 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 540 billion -rrb- , equivalent to 3.3 percent of the bloc 's gross domestic product .
the figure includes both national and eu level stimulus measures as well as automatic increases in social spending , such as unemployment benefits , which kick in when the economy weakens .
in berlin , a german spokesman said there were " no points of contention here between us and the us government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin insists there is no rift between obama and merkel " for both of us , and our position has been made clear for some time , regulation of financial markets is the focus of the meeting , " the spokesman said after chancellor angela merkel and us president barack obama held a video conference on thursday .
the rift between europe and the united states over the focus of the summit has been narrowed by washington 's latest announcement for sweeping financial regulatory reforms , including a single watchdog for all key financial institutions and payment systems .
like the united states , the eu wants to clamp down on hedge funds , private equity funds and the use of complicated credit derivatives as well as offshore tax havens .
europe is also in favor of doubling the international monetary fund 's resources for bailing out troubled countries to $ 500 billion , while washington wants to go even further by tripling its funds .
it also wants colleges of supervisors for all major cross-border financial institutions to be set up before the end of 2009 in order to keep a closer eye on big international groups .
talk of tensions is overblown but rifts exist , say experts experts in transatlantic relations say that despite the desire of all the major developed and developing powers at the g20 to show a united front , differences of emphasis do exist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some european nations are against pouring more money into the economy " the obama administration has been pushing europeans to spend much more , but the europeans are baulking at that , " kati suominen , a fellow with the german marshall fund of the united states , told afp .
" particularly the bigger countries , france , germany and the current holder of the european union presidency , czech republic , have been very adamantly opposed to new spending .
so there is a little bit of a rift there . "
dan price , a former assistant to president george w. bush for international economic affairs , argued that reports of discord between nations like france and germany and the united states were " somewhat overblown . "
he pointed out that washington had acted broadly to enact crisis rescue measures since the g20 finance ministers meeting in the uk just three weeks ago .
at those talks , us treasury secretary timothy geithner said washington would provide a capital assistance program for finance firms , and outline a plan to clear toxic assets from the books of crippled banks .
" i think the united states goes into the meeting having done what it said it would do , " said price , now senior partner for global issues at sidley austin llp .

tough talking ahead but world wants unity , says brown british prime minister gordon brown said on monday that tough talking would be needed but he felt that the world 's financial powers were united in finding solutions to the crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says he will do all he can to make the summit a success " we no doubt have some long days of negotiation ahead .
these are difficult and complex problems .
it will not be easy to reach the conclusions that i believe are necessary for the world economy , " said brown , but he added that his recent series of preparatory meetings with world leaders had made him feel certain that " the world wants to come together . "
brown said he would continue to do " all i can to build consensus and to enable an agreement to take us out of this recession and put the whole world back onto a path of growth . "
" this is a decisive moment for the world economy .
we have a choice to make .
we can either let the recession take its course and retreat into isolationism and protectionism ... or resolve as a world community to fight back against the global recession that is hurting people in every country and every continent , " said brown .
obama rejects " either or " approach in an interview with the financial times published on monday , us president barack obama said it was important that the summit should deliver a " message of unity . "
he rejected the idea of an " either or approach " between financial stimulus and regulation , saying that both were needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says both stimulus and regulation are needed " we need stimulus and regulation .
we need to deal with the problems right in front of us and we also need to make sure we 're taking steps to prevent these types of breakdowns from happening again , " obama said .
with respect to the stimulus there would be an accord in london that g20 countries " will do what is necessary to promote growth and trade , " he predicted .
however , he understood the " legitimate concerns " in some countries which had already initiated significant stimulus programs and wanted first to see how they worked .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso said on friday that there was " no dichotomy between stimulating the economy and improving global financial regulation . "
" we need both if we are to get the economy moving again and to restore confidence in a lasting way , " he added europe , us both committed to stimulus measures washington is spending trillions of dollars to support its banking system and drag the world 's biggest economy out of its deepest recession in decades .
meanwhile , the 27-nation european union has committed to economic stimulus measures in 2009 and 2010 worth 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 540 billion -rrb- , equivalent to 3.3 percent of the bloc 's gross domestic product .
the figure includes both national and eu level stimulus measures as well as automatic increases in social spending , such as unemployment benefits , which kick in when the economy weakens .
in berlin , a german spokesman said there were " no points of contention here between us and the us government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin insists there is no rift between obama and merkel " for both of us , and our position has been made clear for some time , regulation of financial markets is the focus of the meeting , " the spokesman said after chancellor angela merkel and us president barack obama held a video conference on thursday .
the rift between europe and the united states over the focus of the summit has been narrowed by washington 's latest announcement for sweeping financial regulatory reforms , including a single watchdog for all key financial institutions and payment systems .
like the united states , the eu wants to clamp down on hedge funds , private equity funds and the use of complicated credit derivatives as well as offshore tax havens .
europe is also in favor of doubling the international monetary fund 's resources for bailing out troubled countries to $ 500 billion , while washington wants to go even further by tripling its funds .
it also wants colleges of supervisors for all major cross-border financial institutions to be set up before the end of 2009 in order to keep a closer eye on big international groups .
talk of tensions is overblown but rifts exist , say experts experts in transatlantic relations say that despite the desire of all the major developed and developing powers at the g20 to show a united front , differences of emphasis do exist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some european nations are against pouring more money into the economy " the obama administration has been pushing europeans to spend much more , but the europeans are baulking at that , " kati suominen , a fellow with the german marshall fund of the united states , told afp .
" particularly the bigger countries , france , germany and the current holder of the european union presidency , czech republic , have been very adamantly opposed to new spending .
so there is a little bit of a rift there . "
dan price , a former assistant to president george w. bush for international economic affairs , argued that reports of discord between nations like france and germany and the united states were " somewhat overblown . "
he pointed out that washington had acted broadly to enact crisis rescue measures since the g20 finance ministers meeting in the uk just three weeks ago .
at those talks , us treasury secretary timothy geithner said washington would provide a capital assistance program for finance firms , and outline a plan to clear toxic assets from the books of crippled banks .
" i think the united states goes into the meeting having done what it said it would do , " said price , now senior partner for global issues at sidley austin llp .

with respect to the stimulus there would be an accord in london that g20 countries " will do what is necessary to promote growth and trade , " he predicted .
however , he understood the " legitimate concerns " in some countries which had already initiated significant stimulus programs and wanted first to see how they worked .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso said on friday that there was " no dichotomy between stimulating the economy and improving global financial regulation . "
" we need both if we are to get the economy moving again and to restore confidence in a lasting way , " he added europe , us both committed to stimulus measures washington is spending trillions of dollars to support its banking system and drag the world 's biggest economy out of its deepest recession in decades .
meanwhile , the 27-nation european union has committed to economic stimulus measures in 2009 and 2010 worth 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 540 billion -rrb- , equivalent to 3.3 percent of the bloc 's gross domestic product .
the figure includes both national and eu level stimulus measures as well as automatic increases in social spending , such as unemployment benefits , which kick in when the economy weakens .
in berlin , a german spokesman said there were " no points of contention here between us and the us government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin insists there is no rift between obama and merkel " for both of us , and our position has been made clear for some time , regulation of financial markets is the focus of the meeting , " the spokesman said after chancellor angela merkel and us president barack obama held a video conference on thursday .
the rift between europe and the united states over the focus of the summit has been narrowed by washington 's latest announcement for sweeping financial regulatory reforms , including a single watchdog for all key financial institutions and payment systems .
like the united states , the eu wants to clamp down on hedge funds , private equity funds and the use of complicated credit derivatives as well as offshore tax havens .
europe is also in favor of doubling the international monetary fund 's resources for bailing out troubled countries to $ 500 billion , while washington wants to go even further by tripling its funds .
it also wants colleges of supervisors for all major cross-border financial institutions to be set up before the end of 2009 in order to keep a closer eye on big international groups .
talk of tensions is overblown but rifts exist , say experts experts in transatlantic relations say that despite the desire of all the major developed and developing powers at the g20 to show a united front , differences of emphasis do exist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some european nations are against pouring more money into the economy " the obama administration has been pushing europeans to spend much more , but the europeans are baulking at that , " kati suominen , a fellow with the german marshall fund of the united states , told afp .
" particularly the bigger countries , france , germany and the current holder of the european union presidency , czech republic , have been very adamantly opposed to new spending .
so there is a little bit of a rift there . "
dan price , a former assistant to president george w. bush for international economic affairs , argued that reports of discord between nations like france and germany and the united states were " somewhat overblown . "
he pointed out that washington had acted broadly to enact crisis rescue measures since the g20 finance ministers meeting in the uk just three weeks ago .
at those talks , us treasury secretary timothy geithner said washington would provide a capital assistance program for finance firms , and outline a plan to clear toxic assets from the books of crippled banks .
" i think the united states goes into the meeting having done what it said it would do , " said price , now senior partner for global issues at sidley austin llp .
" the united states will be interested to hear what the other nations will do in this regard . " nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have 60 days in which to talk about how a future concept should look , " merkel said on tuesday , march 31 , referring to the two month restructuring deadline us president barack obama set general motors one day earlier . merkel made her comments during a speech to some 3,000 opel workers at the company 's main plant in ruesselsheim , near frankfurt . she said the german government and authorities from states with major opel factories would join forces with bankers and opel managers to " defend german interests " in talks with gm and us officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel addressed a crowd of 3,000 workers at the opel factory in ruesselsheim .
" we must lay the foundation for the creation of a european opel , " merkel said , adding that she would work to ensure the carmaker was made economically viable by 2012 . she added that opel would be an efficient and modern organization where " employees can say they 're building german 's future and leading the world . " opel managers have said they need some 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.38 billion -rrb- to restructure their operations and become independent of general motors .
but the german government has so far refused to provide the funds because it is concerned public money may be transferred across the atlantic to help plug holes in gm 's accounts political maneuvering with national elections due in september , merkel 's grand coalition government remains split over how far the state should go in saving the 110-year-old german carmaker , which has been a gm subsidiary since 1929 .
merkel 's christian democratic union would prefer a private investor to rescue opel , while her junior coalition partners from the social democratic party want the state to make direct investments aimed at saving the company 's 26,000-strong workforce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel could become a major election issue in september .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat who will challenge merkel for the chancellorship , laid out a 10-point plan on monday and has said the german government must take action immediately . steinmeier proposed that the federal and state governments join forces with a consortium of opel dealers and managers to purchase a holding of 50 percent plus one share , leaving gm with the minority stake .
he said the move would give opel at least three months to reorganize and find a private investor . but german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg rejected the idea of buying directly into opel , arguing that berlin should limit itself to providing credit guarantees to attract investors . union makes concessions germany 's giant metalworkers union ig metall , meanwhile , has renewed calls for merkel to throw her full support behind efforts aimed at saving opel from bankruptcy . ig metal boss detlef wetzel questioned why merkel would provide billions of euros in a financial bail-out to banks but deny requests for aid from the " real economy . " meanwhile , the union 's regional director in frankfurt , armin schild , has indicated that opel workers are prepared to make significant concessions to keep the company afloat and prevent job cuts . he said possible changes could range from cutting working hours without compensatory wage increases to the negotiation of new collective agreements between employees and management . sje / sh / sms / dpa / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 31.03.2009 obama gears up for european extravaganza großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is looking to obama to lead the way on several issues barack obama 's visit to europe marks his first major overseas trip since being sworn into office .
expectations are high as the us president takes part in three major conferences across the continent . though it may not match the 200,000 people who turned up to hear " obama the candidate " speak in berlin , the us president is likely to receive a warm welcome from europe 's leaders and the general public on a visit that begins this tuesday . but there 's an even greater sense of expectation this time around .
europe wants to know if " obama the president " will live up to the hype . the first stop on his whirlwind tour is london , where he 'll be the star attraction at the thursday meeting of the group of 20 nations .
there is no question that the world economy will be at the top of the agenda , but what is not clear is whether obama and european leaders can agree on how to act . last week , czech prime minister mirek topolanek described obama 's economic stimulus package as the " road to hell . " while other european leaders distanced themselves from topolanek 's comment , there are serious differences of opinion between the us and european governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek said the us was repeating the mistakes of the 1930s craig kennedy , president of the german marshall fund in washington , said europe is concerned that the us approach includes too much stimulus and not enough regulation . " the size of the american stimulus and the size of our resulting deficits are causing tremendous concern , " he said . restoring america 's standing obama is officially visiting europe to take part in international conferences , but the trip is a symbolic one too . the visit is a " fundamental part of the president 's agenda of restoring america 's standing in the world and particularly europe , " presidential advisor dennis mcdonough said . ties between europe and the us became strained during the previous administration of george w. bush , especially over the invasion of iraq . during his tour , obama will meet with the leaders of britain , france , germany , turkey and the czech republic .

expectations are high as the us president takes part in three major conferences across the continent . though it may not match the 200,000 people who turned up to hear " obama the candidate " speak in berlin , the us president is likely to receive a warm welcome from europe 's leaders and the general public on a visit that begins this tuesday . but there 's an even greater sense of expectation this time around .
europe wants to know if " obama the president " will live up to the hype . the first stop on his whirlwind tour is london , where he 'll be the star attraction at the thursday meeting of the group of 20 nations .
there is no question that the world economy will be at the top of the agenda , but what is not clear is whether obama and european leaders can agree on how to act . last week , czech prime minister mirek topolanek described obama 's economic stimulus package as the " road to hell . " while other european leaders distanced themselves from topolanek 's comment , there are serious differences of opinion between the us and european governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek said the us was repeating the mistakes of the 1930s craig kennedy , president of the german marshall fund in washington , said europe is concerned that the us approach includes too much stimulus and not enough regulation . " the size of the american stimulus and the size of our resulting deficits are causing tremendous concern , " he said . restoring america 's standing obama is officially visiting europe to take part in international conferences , but the trip is a symbolic one too . the visit is a " fundamental part of the president 's agenda of restoring america 's standing in the world and particularly europe , " presidential advisor dennis mcdonough said . ties between europe and the us became strained during the previous administration of george w. bush , especially over the invasion of iraq . during his tour , obama will meet with the leaders of britain , france , germany , turkey and the czech republic .
he 's also set to hold talks with russian president dmitry medvedev while in london . relations between the us and russia came under particular strain last year during the russian-georgian war .
washington is also concerned that moscow 's aid to tehran 's nuclear energy program could help the islamic republic develop nuclear weapons .

some 200 police officers swooped on the headquarters of cologne 's local transport company , kvb , and on offices of building firms involved in the underground project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as well as the cost to human life , the collapse of the archive wiped out a priceless collection chief state prosecutor guenther feld said frankfurt , berlin , munich , essen , duesseldorf , karlsruhe and wiesbaden were among the cities where tuesday 's raids had taken place . the cologne state prosecutor 's office is investigating on suspicion of negligent homicide and endangering a building .
feld said the raids had been necessary even though those involved had been cooperative up to now .
" we still do not suspect any individual in particular , " said the city 's top chief prosecutor . building of subway restarts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is what the scene of destruction looked like from above meanwhile , the construction of the subway line continues .
a temporary halt in building work was rescinded on tuesday , march 31 , after independent experts had inspected the building sites .
the city transport 's supervisory board has decided to retain the technical director walter reinarz -lrb- cdu -rrb- in his post while the investigations are ongoing .
reinarz has come under fire for failing to pass on important information about groundwater problems in the metro construction site near the historic archive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city 's mayor believes he has been unfairly attacked over the affair cologne mayor fritz schramma -lrb- cdu -rrb- continues to back reinarz .
on sunday , however , schramma himself announced that he would not be standing again for re-election in summer , in part because of anonymous attacks from the ranks of his own party for his handling of the crisis . the city mayor said that he had been placed under general suspicion and described the attempt to find the culprits for the disaster as a " politically motivated search for scapegoats .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 31.03.2009 obama gears up for european extravaganza großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is looking to obama to lead the way on several issues barack obama 's visit to europe marks his first major overseas trip since being sworn into office .
expectations are high as the us president takes part in three major conferences across the continent . though it may not match the 200,000 people who turned up to hear " obama the candidate " speak in berlin , the us president is likely to receive a warm welcome from europe 's leaders and the general public on a visit that begins this tuesday . but there 's an even greater sense of expectation this time around .
europe wants to know if " obama the president " will live up to the hype . the first stop on his whirlwind tour is london , where he 'll be the star attraction at the thursday meeting of the group of 20 nations .
there is no question that the world economy will be at the top of the agenda , but what is not clear is whether obama and european leaders can agree on how to act . last week , czech prime minister mirek topolanek described obama 's economic stimulus package as the " road to hell . " while other european leaders distanced themselves from topolanek 's comment , there are serious differences of opinion between the us and european governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek said the us was repeating the mistakes of the 1930s craig kennedy , president of the german marshall fund in washington , said europe is concerned that the us approach includes too much stimulus and not enough regulation . " the size of the american stimulus and the size of our resulting deficits are causing tremendous concern , " he said . restoring america 's standing obama is officially visiting europe to take part in international conferences , but the trip is a symbolic one too . the visit is a " fundamental part of the president 's agenda of restoring america 's standing in the world and particularly europe , " presidential advisor dennis mcdonough said . ties between europe and the us became strained during the previous administration of george w. bush , especially over the invasion of iraq . during his tour , obama will meet with the leaders of britain , france , germany , turkey and the czech republic .
he 's also set to hold talks with russian president dmitry medvedev while in london . relations between the us and russia came under particular strain last year during the russian-georgian war .
washington is also concerned that moscow 's aid to tehran 's nuclear energy program could help the islamic republic develop nuclear weapons .
iran maintains its nuclear program serves only civilian purposes . russia , on the other hand , objects to us plans to build a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic , and disapproves of nato 's push to extend membership to the ex-soviet republics of ukraine and georgia . on with the tour after the g20 summit in london , obama heads to strasbourg , france , for a summit marking the 60th anniversary of the north atlantic treaty organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in afghanistan is at its highest level since us-led forces toppled the taliban in 2001 he 's set to use the occasion to urge nato countries to support his new strategy for afghanistan , which he outlined last week . obama announced the deployment of an extra 4,000 troops , on top of the 17,000 reinforcements already planned .
his new strategy also includes an increase of civilian personnel , and a greater focus on fighting al qaeda and the taliban , particularly along the afghan-pakistan border . european governments have welcomed obama 's new afghanistan strategy , but nato members know that obama will now expect increased contributions from them too . chancellor angela merkel has announced that germany will boost its training of police and security forces in afghanistan , but has previously ruled out an increase of combat troops . the forgotten issue somewhere down on the to-do list is climate change .
the issue is up for discussion at a meeting of the 27 european union heads of state in prague , the third stop on obama 's tour . the kyoto protocol is due to be replaced at talks in copenhagen at the end of the year , and climate change meetings are taking place across the globe in the lead-up to december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern said the us does not have a magic wand to fix the climate the obama administration made its international climate debut last weekend at un talks in bonn .
todd stern , obama 's special climate envoy , pledged to " make up for lost time " and called for more action by all nations . stern did say , however , that the us wanted to work towards a treaty that was economically " doable . "
but comments like this have some observers concerned about the united states ' commitment to fighting climate change . craig kennedy says that , despite the new administration 's rhetoric , there are doubts in europe that obama will be serious about climate change .

expectations are high as the us president takes part in three major conferences across the continent . though it may not match the 200,000 people who turned up to hear " obama the candidate " speak in berlin , the us president is likely to receive a warm welcome from europe 's leaders and the general public on a visit that begins this tuesday . but there 's an even greater sense of expectation this time around .
europe wants to know if " obama the president " will live up to the hype . the first stop on his whirlwind tour is london , where he 'll be the star attraction at the thursday meeting of the group of 20 nations .
there is no question that the world economy will be at the top of the agenda , but what is not clear is whether obama and european leaders can agree on how to act . last week , czech prime minister mirek topolanek described obama 's economic stimulus package as the " road to hell . " while other european leaders distanced themselves from topolanek 's comment , there are serious differences of opinion between the us and european governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek said the us was repeating the mistakes of the 1930s craig kennedy , president of the german marshall fund in washington , said europe is concerned that the us approach includes too much stimulus and not enough regulation .

he 's also set to hold talks with russian president dmitry medvedev while in london . relations between the us and russia came under particular strain last year during the russian-georgian war .
washington is also concerned that moscow 's aid to tehran 's nuclear energy program could help the islamic republic develop nuclear weapons .
iran maintains its nuclear program serves only civilian purposes . russia , on the other hand , objects to us plans to build a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic , and disapproves of nato 's push to extend membership to the ex-soviet republics of ukraine and georgia . on with the tour after the g20 summit in london , obama heads to strasbourg , france , for a summit marking the 60th anniversary of the north atlantic treaty organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in afghanistan is at its highest level since us-led forces toppled the taliban in 2001 he 's set to use the occasion to urge nato countries to support his new strategy for afghanistan , which he outlined last week . obama announced the deployment of an extra 4,000 troops , on top of the 17,000 reinforcements already planned .
his new strategy also includes an increase of civilian personnel , and a greater focus on fighting al qaeda and the taliban , particularly along the afghan-pakistan border . european governments have welcomed obama 's new afghanistan strategy , but nato members know that obama will now expect increased contributions from them too . chancellor angela merkel has announced that germany will boost its training of police and security forces in afghanistan , but has previously ruled out an increase of combat troops . the forgotten issue somewhere down on the to-do list is climate change .
the issue is up for discussion at a meeting of the 27 european union heads of state in prague , the third stop on obama 's tour . the kyoto protocol is due to be replaced at talks in copenhagen at the end of the year , and climate change meetings are taking place across the globe in the lead-up to december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern said the us does not have a magic wand to fix the climate the obama administration made its international climate debut last weekend at un talks in bonn .

germany and france make the case for regulation financial crisis hindering african development goals merkel , medvedev unite on market reform before g20 summit economy -pipe- 31.03.2009 assertions of g20 unity mask underlying transatlantic tensions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g20 members have different views on market regulation and stimulus packages european countries are pushing for the g20 summit to focus on revamping the global financial architecture , but clashes with the us over stimulus packages continue to overshadow their drive ahead of the meeting this week . transatlantic tensions over the focus of the summit have marked the run-up to the april 2 meeting in london , which is supposed to be a demonstration of top-level unity between the world 's leading economic powers .
european leaders have repeatedly rebuffed us pressure to plough more money into their ailing economies as part of an international effort to revive withering global demand .
the dispute turned ugly last week when czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , described the united states ' ambitious but costly economic stimulus plans as " a way to hell . "
he also said " the united states is not on the right path " with its costly stimulus plans , and insisted " we need to read the history books " to avoid the same mistakes .
the remarks sent top aides scrambling to backtrack , with one insisting topolanek never made the " hell " remark .
since then , officials have been trying to paper over transatlantic differences .
tough talking ahead but world wants unity , says brown british prime minister gordon brown said on monday that tough talking would be needed but he felt that the world 's financial powers were united in finding solutions to the crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says he will do all he can to make the summit a success " we no doubt have some long days of negotiation ahead .
these are difficult and complex problems .
it will not be easy to reach the conclusions that i believe are necessary for the world economy , " said brown , but he added that his recent series of preparatory meetings with world leaders had made him feel certain that " the world wants to come together . "
brown said he would continue to do " all i can to build consensus and to enable an agreement to take us out of this recession and put the whole world back onto a path of growth . "
" this is a decisive moment for the world economy .
we have a choice to make .
we can either let the recession take its course and retreat into isolationism and protectionism ... or resolve as a world community to fight back against the global recession that is hurting people in every country and every continent , " said brown .
obama rejects " either or " approach in an interview with the financial times published on monday , us president barack obama said it was important that the summit should deliver a " message of unity . "
he rejected the idea of an " either or approach " between financial stimulus and regulation , saying that both were needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says both stimulus and regulation are needed " we need stimulus and regulation .
we need to deal with the problems right in front of us and we also need to make sure we 're taking steps to prevent these types of breakdowns from happening again , " obama said .
with respect to the stimulus there would be an accord in london that g20 countries " will do what is necessary to promote growth and trade , " he predicted .
however , he understood the " legitimate concerns " in some countries which had already initiated significant stimulus programs and wanted first to see how they worked .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso said on friday that there was " no dichotomy between stimulating the economy and improving global financial regulation . "
" we need both if we are to get the economy moving again and to restore confidence in a lasting way , " he added europe , us both committed to stimulus measures washington is spending trillions of dollars to support its banking system and drag the world 's biggest economy out of its deepest recession in decades .
meanwhile , the 27-nation european union has committed to economic stimulus measures in 2009 and 2010 worth 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 540 billion -rrb- , equivalent to 3.3 percent of the bloc 's gross domestic product .
the figure includes both national and eu level stimulus measures as well as automatic increases in social spending , such as unemployment benefits , which kick in when the economy weakens .
in berlin , a german spokesman said there were " no points of contention here between us and the us government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin insists there is no rift between obama and merkel " for both of us , and our position has been made clear for some time , regulation of financial markets is the focus of the meeting , " the spokesman said after chancellor angela merkel and us president barack obama held a video conference on thursday .
the rift between europe and the united states over the focus of the summit has been narrowed by washington 's latest announcement for sweeping financial regulatory reforms , including a single watchdog for all key financial institutions and payment systems .
like the united states , the eu wants to clamp down on hedge funds , private equity funds and the use of complicated credit derivatives as well as offshore tax havens .
europe is also in favor of doubling the international monetary fund 's resources for bailing out troubled countries to $ 500 billion , while washington wants to go even further by tripling its funds .
it also wants colleges of supervisors for all major cross-border financial institutions to be set up before the end of 2009 in order to keep a closer eye on big international groups .
talk of tensions is overblown but rifts exist , say experts experts in transatlantic relations say that despite the desire of all the major developed and developing powers at the g20 to show a united front , differences of emphasis do exist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some european nations are against pouring more money into the economy " the obama administration has been pushing europeans to spend much more , but the europeans are baulking at that , " kati suominen , a fellow with the german marshall fund of the united states , told afp .
" particularly the bigger countries , france , germany and the current holder of the european union presidency , czech republic , have been very adamantly opposed to new spending .
so there is a little bit of a rift there . "
dan price , a former assistant to president george w. bush for international economic affairs , argued that reports of discord between nations like france and germany and the united states were " somewhat overblown . "
he pointed out that washington had acted broadly to enact crisis rescue measures since the g20 finance ministers meeting in the uk just three weeks ago .
at those talks , us treasury secretary timothy geithner said washington would provide a capital assistance program for finance firms , and outline a plan to clear toxic assets from the books of crippled banks .
" i think the united states goes into the meeting having done what it said it would do , " said price , now senior partner for global issues at sidley austin llp .

germany and france make the case for regulation financial crisis hindering african development goals merkel , medvedev unite on market reform before g20 summit economy -pipe- 31.03.2009 assertions of g20 unity mask underlying transatlantic tensions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g20 members have different views on market regulation and stimulus packages european countries are pushing for the g20 summit to focus on revamping the global financial architecture , but clashes with the us over stimulus packages continue to overshadow their drive ahead of the meeting this week . transatlantic tensions over the focus of the summit have marked the run-up to the april 2 meeting in london , which is supposed to be a demonstration of top-level unity between the world 's leading economic powers .
european leaders have repeatedly rebuffed us pressure to plough more money into their ailing economies as part of an international effort to revive withering global demand .
the dispute turned ugly last week when czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , described the united states ' ambitious but costly economic stimulus plans as " a way to hell . "
he also said " the united states is not on the right path " with its costly stimulus plans , and insisted " we need to read the history books " to avoid the same mistakes .
the remarks sent top aides scrambling to backtrack , with one insisting topolanek never made the " hell " remark .
since then , officials have been trying to paper over transatlantic differences .
tough talking ahead but world wants unity , says brown british prime minister gordon brown said on monday that tough talking would be needed but he felt that the world 's financial powers were united in finding solutions to the crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says he will do all he can to make the summit a success " we no doubt have some long days of negotiation ahead .
these are difficult and complex problems .
it will not be easy to reach the conclusions that i believe are necessary for the world economy , " said brown , but he added that his recent series of preparatory meetings with world leaders had made him feel certain that " the world wants to come together . "
brown said he would continue to do " all i can to build consensus and to enable an agreement to take us out of this recession and put the whole world back onto a path of growth . "
" this is a decisive moment for the world economy .
we have a choice to make .
we can either let the recession take its course and retreat into isolationism and protectionism ... or resolve as a world community to fight back against the global recession that is hurting people in every country and every continent , " said brown .
obama rejects " either or " approach in an interview with the financial times published on monday , us president barack obama said it was important that the summit should deliver a " message of unity . "
he rejected the idea of an " either or approach " between financial stimulus and regulation , saying that both were needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says both stimulus and regulation are needed " we need stimulus and regulation .
we need to deal with the problems right in front of us and we also need to make sure we 're taking steps to prevent these types of breakdowns from happening again , " obama said .
with respect to the stimulus there would be an accord in london that g20 countries " will do what is necessary to promote growth and trade , " he predicted .
however , he understood the " legitimate concerns " in some countries which had already initiated significant stimulus programs and wanted first to see how they worked .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso said on friday that there was " no dichotomy between stimulating the economy and improving global financial regulation . "
" we need both if we are to get the economy moving again and to restore confidence in a lasting way , " he added europe , us both committed to stimulus measures washington is spending trillions of dollars to support its banking system and drag the world 's biggest economy out of its deepest recession in decades .
meanwhile , the 27-nation european union has committed to economic stimulus measures in 2009 and 2010 worth 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 540 billion -rrb- , equivalent to 3.3 percent of the bloc 's gross domestic product .
the figure includes both national and eu level stimulus measures as well as automatic increases in social spending , such as unemployment benefits , which kick in when the economy weakens .
in berlin , a german spokesman said there were " no points of contention here between us and the us government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin insists there is no rift between obama and merkel " for both of us , and our position has been made clear for some time , regulation of financial markets is the focus of the meeting , " the spokesman said after chancellor angela merkel and us president barack obama held a video conference on thursday .
the rift between europe and the united states over the focus of the summit has been narrowed by washington 's latest announcement for sweeping financial regulatory reforms , including a single watchdog for all key financial institutions and payment systems .
like the united states , the eu wants to clamp down on hedge funds , private equity funds and the use of complicated credit derivatives as well as offshore tax havens .
europe is also in favor of doubling the international monetary fund 's resources for bailing out troubled countries to $ 500 billion , while washington wants to go even further by tripling its funds .
it also wants colleges of supervisors for all major cross-border financial institutions to be set up before the end of 2009 in order to keep a closer eye on big international groups .
talk of tensions is overblown but rifts exist , say experts experts in transatlantic relations say that despite the desire of all the major developed and developing powers at the g20 to show a united front , differences of emphasis do exist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some european nations are against pouring more money into the economy " the obama administration has been pushing europeans to spend much more , but the europeans are baulking at that , " kati suominen , a fellow with the german marshall fund of the united states , told afp .
" particularly the bigger countries , france , germany and the current holder of the european union presidency , czech republic , have been very adamantly opposed to new spending .
so there is a little bit of a rift there . "
dan price , a former assistant to president george w. bush for international economic affairs , argued that reports of discord between nations like france and germany and the united states were " somewhat overblown . "
he pointed out that washington had acted broadly to enact crisis rescue measures since the g20 finance ministers meeting in the uk just three weeks ago .
at those talks , us treasury secretary timothy geithner said washington would provide a capital assistance program for finance firms , and outline a plan to clear toxic assets from the books of crippled banks .
" i think the united states goes into the meeting having done what it said it would do , " said price , now senior partner for global issues at sidley austin llp .

after considering the files , the prosecutor 's office said it would open a preliminary investigation into the firms , the first step towards a possible indictment on charges of dodging taxes and concealing the profits behind liechtenstein 's banking secrecy laws .
all three firms denied being the target of a money-laundering probe .
" the michelin group does not own a copa foundation , nor does it hold any accounts at the lgt bank in liechtenstein , " a spokesman for the firm told afp , denying claims in a report by french daily le parisien .
a spokeswoman for energy giant totalfinaelf said in a statement that it " formally denies " owning a foundation called " elf trading " in liechtenstein , while adidas told le parisien it had no knowledge of any such investigation .
" we have no activities in liechtenstein , with the exception of two service stations , " the total spokeswoman said in the statement .
french uncovered fraud files after german investigation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein has been trying to clamp down on tax evaders the files allegedly linking the three businesses to foundations which are suspected of being fronts for money laundering were uncovered after french authorities launched an investigation after a major german tax evasion scandal uncovered allegedly undeclared accounts held by foreign nationals within liechtenstein 's secretive banking sector .
french budget minister eric woerth confirmed on lci television that his ministry had transferred three files to prosecutors , but would neither confirm nor deny the names of the groups involved .
france 's finance ministry has been investigating 64 family-owned firms in connection with the scandal , of which 16 have since come clean and paid their overdue taxes and penalties , woerth said .
authorities estimated last year that french firms evaded up to one billion euros in taxes via liechtenstein , of which le parisien said elf , michelin and adidas accounted for " a large part " .
french president nicolas sarkozy recently said france would crack down on money laundering in european tax havens , including liechtenstein , luxembourg and andorra .
transparency international france estimates that corporate tax evasion via tax havens costs the french state some 10 billion euros per year .
leaders of the group of 20 meeting in london this week are set to draw up an international blacklist of tax havens , as worldwide pressure grows to clamp down on uncooperative nations and territories .
bowing to international pressure , liechtenstein agreed earlier this month to ease its strict banking secrecy rules and cooperate with foreign governments to combat tax fraud . nda / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german chancellor angela merkel has said she will form a team of experts to negotiate a new corporate structure for german carmaker opel in talks with its troubled us parent group , general motors . " we have 60 days in which to talk about how a future concept should look , " merkel said on tuesday , march 31 , referring to the two month restructuring deadline us president barack obama set general motors one day earlier . merkel made her comments during a speech to some 3,000 opel workers at the company 's main plant in ruesselsheim , near frankfurt . she said the german government and authorities from states with major opel factories would join forces with bankers and opel managers to " defend german interests " in talks with gm and us officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel addressed a crowd of 3,000 workers at the opel factory in ruesselsheim .
" we must lay the foundation for the creation of a european opel , " merkel said , adding that she would work to ensure the carmaker was made economically viable by 2012 . she added that opel would be an efficient and modern organization where " employees can say they 're building german 's future and leading the world . " opel managers have said they need some 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.38 billion -rrb- to restructure their operations and become independent of general motors .
but the german government has so far refused to provide the funds because it is concerned public money may be transferred across the atlantic to help plug holes in gm 's accounts political maneuvering with national elections due in september , merkel 's grand coalition government remains split over how far the state should go in saving the 110-year-old german carmaker , which has been a gm subsidiary since 1929 .

he said the move would give opel at least three months to reorganize and find a private investor . but german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg rejected the idea of buying directly into opel , arguing that berlin should limit itself to providing credit guarantees to attract investors . union makes concessions germany 's giant metalworkers union ig metall , meanwhile , has renewed calls for merkel to throw her full support behind efforts aimed at saving opel from bankruptcy . ig metal boss detlef wetzel questioned why merkel would provide billions of euros in a financial bail-out to banks but deny requests for aid from the " real economy . " meanwhile , the union 's regional director in frankfurt , armin schild , has indicated that opel workers are prepared to make significant concessions to keep the company afloat and prevent job cuts . he said possible changes could range from cutting working hours without compensatory wage increases to the negotiation of new collective agreements between employees and management . sje / sh / sms / dpa / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

medvedev even said the international community should have a say when the world 's richest countries make decisions with global implications , as in the us mortgage crisis . but analysts doubt russia 's plans will get many backers among group of 20 countries , be they established players or rising powerhouses such as brazil , india and china . economists say that while some of russia 's ideas - such as a world currency - are currently unfeasible , others it may offer will fail more due to moscow 's lack of diplomatic heft . though russia is a member of the group of eight industrial powers , it is still not among the 153 members of the world trade organization and is side-lined at meetings of group of seven finance ministers . while russia is among the top world energy producers and an undoubted political heavyweight , its economy is dwarfed by the united states and european union . amid reports that the g20 meeting may be devoted to crisis management rather than long-term reform , britain 's financial times has reported that the british foreign office has already relegated russia to the rank of second-division player . russia appears reluctant to accept this and has been talking up its reform plans for weeks . germany offers to mediate in gas dispute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : january 's gas dispute put a strain on eu-russia relations merkel also offered germany 's services on tuesday in resolving the dispute over gas between russia , and ukraine , which has made a deal to modernize its pipeline network with the european union last month . the chancellor said she would raise the issue with the european commission despite russia 's objection to the agreement . russia was angry at being left out of talks over the deal , calling the agreement an " unfriendly act .

germany and france make the case for regulation financial crisis hindering african development goals merkel , medvedev unite on market reform before g20 summit economy -pipe- 31.03.2009 assertions of g20 unity mask underlying transatlantic tensions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g20 members have different views on market regulation and stimulus packages european countries are pushing for the g20 summit to focus on revamping the global financial architecture , but clashes with the us over stimulus packages continue to overshadow their drive ahead of the meeting this week . transatlantic tensions over the focus of the summit have marked the run-up to the april 2 meeting in london , which is supposed to be a demonstration of top-level unity between the world 's leading economic powers .
european leaders have repeatedly rebuffed us pressure to plough more money into their ailing economies as part of an international effort to revive withering global demand .
the dispute turned ugly last week when czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , described the united states ' ambitious but costly economic stimulus plans as " a way to hell . "
he also said " the united states is not on the right path " with its costly stimulus plans , and insisted " we need to read the history books " to avoid the same mistakes .
the remarks sent top aides scrambling to backtrack , with one insisting topolanek never made the " hell " remark .
since then , officials have been trying to paper over transatlantic differences .
tough talking ahead but world wants unity , says brown british prime minister gordon brown said on monday that tough talking would be needed but he felt that the world 's financial powers were united in finding solutions to the crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says he will do all he can to make the summit a success " we no doubt have some long days of negotiation ahead .
these are difficult and complex problems .
it will not be easy to reach the conclusions that i believe are necessary for the world economy , " said brown , but he added that his recent series of preparatory meetings with world leaders had made him feel certain that " the world wants to come together . "
brown said he would continue to do " all i can to build consensus and to enable an agreement to take us out of this recession and put the whole world back onto a path of growth . "
" this is a decisive moment for the world economy .
we have a choice to make .
we can either let the recession take its course and retreat into isolationism and protectionism ... or resolve as a world community to fight back against the global recession that is hurting people in every country and every continent , " said brown .
obama rejects " either or " approach in an interview with the financial times published on monday , us president barack obama said it was important that the summit should deliver a " message of unity . "
he rejected the idea of an " either or approach " between financial stimulus and regulation , saying that both were needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says both stimulus and regulation are needed " we need stimulus and regulation .
we need to deal with the problems right in front of us and we also need to make sure we 're taking steps to prevent these types of breakdowns from happening again , " obama said .
with respect to the stimulus there would be an accord in london that g20 countries " will do what is necessary to promote growth and trade , " he predicted .
however , he understood the " legitimate concerns " in some countries which had already initiated significant stimulus programs and wanted first to see how they worked .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso said on friday that there was " no dichotomy between stimulating the economy and improving global financial regulation . "
" we need both if we are to get the economy moving again and to restore confidence in a lasting way , " he added europe , us both committed to stimulus measures washington is spending trillions of dollars to support its banking system and drag the world 's biggest economy out of its deepest recession in decades .
meanwhile , the 27-nation european union has committed to economic stimulus measures in 2009 and 2010 worth 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 540 billion -rrb- , equivalent to 3.3 percent of the bloc 's gross domestic product .
the figure includes both national and eu level stimulus measures as well as automatic increases in social spending , such as unemployment benefits , which kick in when the economy weakens .
in berlin , a german spokesman said there were " no points of contention here between us and the us government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin insists there is no rift between obama and merkel " for both of us , and our position has been made clear for some time , regulation of financial markets is the focus of the meeting , " the spokesman said after chancellor angela merkel and us president barack obama held a video conference on thursday .
the rift between europe and the united states over the focus of the summit has been narrowed by washington 's latest announcement for sweeping financial regulatory reforms , including a single watchdog for all key financial institutions and payment systems .
like the united states , the eu wants to clamp down on hedge funds , private equity funds and the use of complicated credit derivatives as well as offshore tax havens .
europe is also in favor of doubling the international monetary fund 's resources for bailing out troubled countries to $ 500 billion , while washington wants to go even further by tripling its funds .
it also wants colleges of supervisors for all major cross-border financial institutions to be set up before the end of 2009 in order to keep a closer eye on big international groups .
talk of tensions is overblown but rifts exist , say experts experts in transatlantic relations say that despite the desire of all the major developed and developing powers at the g20 to show a united front , differences of emphasis do exist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some european nations are against pouring more money into the economy " the obama administration has been pushing europeans to spend much more , but the europeans are baulking at that , " kati suominen , a fellow with the german marshall fund of the united states , told afp .
" particularly the bigger countries , france , germany and the current holder of the european union presidency , czech republic , have been very adamantly opposed to new spending .
so there is a little bit of a rift there . "
dan price , a former assistant to president george w. bush for international economic affairs , argued that reports of discord between nations like france and germany and the united states were " somewhat overblown . "
he pointed out that washington had acted broadly to enact crisis rescue measures since the g20 finance ministers meeting in the uk just three weeks ago .
at those talks , us treasury secretary timothy geithner said washington would provide a capital assistance program for finance firms , and outline a plan to clear toxic assets from the books of crippled banks .
" i think the united states goes into the meeting having done what it said it would do , " said price , now senior partner for global issues at sidley austin llp .
" the united states will be interested to hear what the other nations will do in this regard . " nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after considering the files , the prosecutor 's office said it would open a preliminary investigation into the firms , the first step towards a possible indictment on charges of dodging taxes and concealing the profits behind liechtenstein 's banking secrecy laws .
all three firms denied being the target of a money-laundering probe .
" the michelin group does not own a copa foundation , nor does it hold any accounts at the lgt bank in liechtenstein , " a spokesman for the firm told afp , denying claims in a report by french daily le parisien .
a spokeswoman for energy giant totalfinaelf said in a statement that it " formally denies " owning a foundation called " elf trading " in liechtenstein , while adidas told le parisien it had no knowledge of any such investigation .
" we have no activities in liechtenstein , with the exception of two service stations , " the total spokeswoman said in the statement .
french uncovered fraud files after german investigation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein has been trying to clamp down on tax evaders the files allegedly linking the three businesses to foundations which are suspected of being fronts for money laundering were uncovered after french authorities launched an investigation after a major german tax evasion scandal uncovered allegedly undeclared accounts held by foreign nationals within liechtenstein 's secretive banking sector .
french budget minister eric woerth confirmed on lci television that his ministry had transferred three files to prosecutors , but would neither confirm nor deny the names of the groups involved .
france 's finance ministry has been investigating 64 family-owned firms in connection with the scandal , of which 16 have since come clean and paid their overdue taxes and penalties , woerth said .
authorities estimated last year that french firms evaded up to one billion euros in taxes via liechtenstein , of which le parisien said elf , michelin and adidas accounted for " a large part " .
french president nicolas sarkozy recently said france would crack down on money laundering in european tax havens , including liechtenstein , luxembourg and andorra .
transparency international france estimates that corporate tax evasion via tax havens costs the french state some 10 billion euros per year .
leaders of the group of 20 meeting in london this week are set to draw up an international blacklist of tax havens , as worldwide pressure grows to clamp down on uncooperative nations and territories .
bowing to international pressure , liechtenstein agreed earlier this month to ease its strict banking secrecy rules and cooperate with foreign governments to combat tax fraud . nda / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany and france make the case for regulation financial crisis hindering african development goals merkel , medvedev unite on market reform before g20 summit economy -pipe- 31.03.2009 assertions of g20 unity mask underlying transatlantic tensions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g20 members have different views on market regulation and stimulus packages european countries are pushing for the g20 summit to focus on revamping the global financial architecture , but clashes with the us over stimulus packages continue to overshadow their drive ahead of the meeting this week . transatlantic tensions over the focus of the summit have marked the run-up to the april 2 meeting in london , which is supposed to be a demonstration of top-level unity between the world 's leading economic powers .
european leaders have repeatedly rebuffed us pressure to plough more money into their ailing economies as part of an international effort to revive withering global demand .
the dispute turned ugly last week when czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , described the united states ' ambitious but costly economic stimulus plans as " a way to hell . "
he also said " the united states is not on the right path " with its costly stimulus plans , and insisted " we need to read the history books " to avoid the same mistakes .
the remarks sent top aides scrambling to backtrack , with one insisting topolanek never made the " hell " remark .
since then , officials have been trying to paper over transatlantic differences .
tough talking ahead but world wants unity , says brown british prime minister gordon brown said on monday that tough talking would be needed but he felt that the world 's financial powers were united in finding solutions to the crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says he will do all he can to make the summit a success " we no doubt have some long days of negotiation ahead .
these are difficult and complex problems .
it will not be easy to reach the conclusions that i believe are necessary for the world economy , " said brown , but he added that his recent series of preparatory meetings with world leaders had made him feel certain that " the world wants to come together . "
brown said he would continue to do " all i can to build consensus and to enable an agreement to take us out of this recession and put the whole world back onto a path of growth . "
" this is a decisive moment for the world economy .
we have a choice to make .
we can either let the recession take its course and retreat into isolationism and protectionism ... or resolve as a world community to fight back against the global recession that is hurting people in every country and every continent , " said brown .
obama rejects " either or " approach in an interview with the financial times published on monday , us president barack obama said it was important that the summit should deliver a " message of unity . "
he rejected the idea of an " either or approach " between financial stimulus and regulation , saying that both were needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says both stimulus and regulation are needed " we need stimulus and regulation .
we need to deal with the problems right in front of us and we also need to make sure we 're taking steps to prevent these types of breakdowns from happening again , " obama said .
with respect to the stimulus there would be an accord in london that g20 countries " will do what is necessary to promote growth and trade , " he predicted .
however , he understood the " legitimate concerns " in some countries which had already initiated significant stimulus programs and wanted first to see how they worked .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso said on friday that there was " no dichotomy between stimulating the economy and improving global financial regulation . "
" we need both if we are to get the economy moving again and to restore confidence in a lasting way , " he added europe , us both committed to stimulus measures washington is spending trillions of dollars to support its banking system and drag the world 's biggest economy out of its deepest recession in decades .
meanwhile , the 27-nation european union has committed to economic stimulus measures in 2009 and 2010 worth 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 540 billion -rrb- , equivalent to 3.3 percent of the bloc 's gross domestic product .
the figure includes both national and eu level stimulus measures as well as automatic increases in social spending , such as unemployment benefits , which kick in when the economy weakens .
in berlin , a german spokesman said there were " no points of contention here between us and the us government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin insists there is no rift between obama and merkel " for both of us , and our position has been made clear for some time , regulation of financial markets is the focus of the meeting , " the spokesman said after chancellor angela merkel and us president barack obama held a video conference on thursday .
the rift between europe and the united states over the focus of the summit has been narrowed by washington 's latest announcement for sweeping financial regulatory reforms , including a single watchdog for all key financial institutions and payment systems .
like the united states , the eu wants to clamp down on hedge funds , private equity funds and the use of complicated credit derivatives as well as offshore tax havens .
europe is also in favor of doubling the international monetary fund 's resources for bailing out troubled countries to $ 500 billion , while washington wants to go even further by tripling its funds .
it also wants colleges of supervisors for all major cross-border financial institutions to be set up before the end of 2009 in order to keep a closer eye on big international groups .
talk of tensions is overblown but rifts exist , say experts experts in transatlantic relations say that despite the desire of all the major developed and developing powers at the g20 to show a united front , differences of emphasis do exist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some european nations are against pouring more money into the economy " the obama administration has been pushing europeans to spend much more , but the europeans are baulking at that , " kati suominen , a fellow with the german marshall fund of the united states , told afp .
" particularly the bigger countries , france , germany and the current holder of the european union presidency , czech republic , have been very adamantly opposed to new spending .
so there is a little bit of a rift there . "
dan price , a former assistant to president george w. bush for international economic affairs , argued that reports of discord between nations like france and germany and the united states were " somewhat overblown . "
he pointed out that washington had acted broadly to enact crisis rescue measures since the g20 finance ministers meeting in the uk just three weeks ago .
at those talks , us treasury secretary timothy geithner said washington would provide a capital assistance program for finance firms , and outline a plan to clear toxic assets from the books of crippled banks .
" i think the united states goes into the meeting having done what it said it would do , " said price , now senior partner for global issues at sidley austin llp .
" the united states will be interested to hear what the other nations will do in this regard . " nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 31.03.2009 obama gears up for european extravaganza großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is looking to obama to lead the way on several issues barack obama 's visit to europe marks his first major overseas trip since being sworn into office .
expectations are high as the us president takes part in three major conferences across the continent . though it may not match the 200,000 people who turned up to hear " obama the candidate " speak in berlin , the us president is likely to receive a warm welcome from europe 's leaders and the general public on a visit that begins this tuesday . but there 's an even greater sense of expectation this time around .
europe wants to know if " obama the president " will live up to the hype . the first stop on his whirlwind tour is london , where he 'll be the star attraction at the thursday meeting of the group of 20 nations .
there is no question that the world economy will be at the top of the agenda , but what is not clear is whether obama and european leaders can agree on how to act . last week , czech prime minister mirek topolanek described obama 's economic stimulus package as the " road to hell . " while other european leaders distanced themselves from topolanek 's comment , there are serious differences of opinion between the us and european governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek said the us was repeating the mistakes of the 1930s craig kennedy , president of the german marshall fund in washington , said europe is concerned that the us approach includes too much stimulus and not enough regulation . " the size of the american stimulus and the size of our resulting deficits are causing tremendous concern , " he said . restoring america 's standing obama is officially visiting europe to take part in international conferences , but the trip is a symbolic one too . the visit is a " fundamental part of the president 's agenda of restoring america 's standing in the world and particularly europe , " presidential advisor dennis mcdonough said . ties between europe and the us became strained during the previous administration of george w. bush , especially over the invasion of iraq . during his tour , obama will meet with the leaders of britain , france , germany , turkey and the czech republic .
he 's also set to hold talks with russian president dmitry medvedev while in london . relations between the us and russia came under particular strain last year during the russian-georgian war .
washington is also concerned that moscow 's aid to tehran 's nuclear energy program could help the islamic republic develop nuclear weapons .
iran maintains its nuclear program serves only civilian purposes . russia , on the other hand , objects to us plans to build a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic , and disapproves of nato 's push to extend membership to the ex-soviet republics of ukraine and georgia . on with the tour after the g20 summit in london , obama heads to strasbourg , france , for a summit marking the 60th anniversary of the north atlantic treaty organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in afghanistan is at its highest level since us-led forces toppled the taliban in 2001 he 's set to use the occasion to urge nato countries to support his new strategy for afghanistan , which he outlined last week . obama announced the deployment of an extra 4,000 troops , on top of the 17,000 reinforcements already planned .
his new strategy also includes an increase of civilian personnel , and a greater focus on fighting al qaeda and the taliban , particularly along the afghan-pakistan border . european governments have welcomed obama 's new afghanistan strategy , but nato members know that obama will now expect increased contributions from them too . chancellor angela merkel has announced that germany will boost its training of police and security forces in afghanistan , but has previously ruled out an increase of combat troops . the forgotten issue somewhere down on the to-do list is climate change .
the issue is up for discussion at a meeting of the 27 european union heads of state in prague , the third stop on obama 's tour . the kyoto protocol is due to be replaced at talks in copenhagen at the end of the year , and climate change meetings are taking place across the globe in the lead-up to december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern said the us does not have a magic wand to fix the climate the obama administration made its international climate debut last weekend at un talks in bonn .
todd stern , obama 's special climate envoy , pledged to " make up for lost time " and called for more action by all nations . stern did say , however , that the us wanted to work towards a treaty that was economically " doable . "
but comments like this have some observers concerned about the united states ' commitment to fighting climate change . craig kennedy says that , despite the new administration 's rhetoric , there are doubts in europe that obama will be serious about climate change . " people look at the deficit ; people look at the pressures on the american economy , and people are starting to ask whether or not this is really going to be the highest priority , " he said . cla / sh / sms / rtr / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu praises obama on afghanistan , pledges civilian surge the eu will embrace us president barack obama 's " european-style " strategy for afghanistan and will contribute to a " civilian surge " by providing more money and more police trainers , the bloc 's foreign ministers said .
-lrb- 27.03.2009 -rrb- obama voices support for nato expansion despite russian qualms us president barack obama said in a meeting with nato 's secretary general that he wants to improve relations with russia .
yet obama said he also feels the alliance should not be afraid of expanding its borders .

german chancellor angela merkel has said she will form a team of experts to negotiate a new corporate structure for german carmaker opel in talks with its troubled us parent group , general motors . " we have 60 days in which to talk about how a future concept should look , " merkel said on tuesday , march 31 , referring to the two month restructuring deadline us president barack obama set general motors one day earlier . merkel made her comments during a speech to some 3,000 opel workers at the company 's main plant in ruesselsheim , near frankfurt . she said the german government and authorities from states with major opel factories would join forces with bankers and opel managers to " defend german interests " in talks with gm and us officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel addressed a crowd of 3,000 workers at the opel factory in ruesselsheim .
" we must lay the foundation for the creation of a european opel , " merkel said , adding that she would work to ensure the carmaker was made economically viable by 2012 . she added that opel would be an efficient and modern organization where " employees can say they 're building german 's future and leading the world . " opel managers have said they need some 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.38 billion -rrb- to restructure their operations and become independent of general motors .

the two leaders said they hoped the summit would be a success . merkel called for an overhaul of the financial markets on tuesday , march 31 , after meeting with medvedev in the german capital . " the world is standing at a crossroads , " the chancellor told reporters at a joint press conference following the meeting .
" financial markets need to change in such a way that such crises are not repeated . " medvedev supported his german counterpart , adding that the g20 meeting would be the first of many meetings towards developing a new global financial system . " the g20 format does not have to provide the definitive solution , " he said .
" it should be the start of a new financial market design . " the two leaders also warned of protectionist policies implemented by some governments in response to the financial crisis . merkel said the g20 meeting must include a clear statement against protectionism . russia 's ambitious financial reform plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev heads to london with ambitious plans ahead of thursday 's summit in london , russia has come up with an ambitious plan to overhaul the entire global financial order .
medvedev even said the international community should have a say when the world 's richest countries make decisions with global implications , as in the us mortgage crisis . but analysts doubt russia 's plans will get many backers among group of 20 countries , be they established players or rising powerhouses such as brazil , india and china . economists say that while some of russia 's ideas - such as a world currency - are currently unfeasible , others it may offer will fail more due to moscow 's lack of diplomatic heft . though russia is a member of the group of eight industrial powers , it is still not among the 153 members of the world trade organization and is side-lined at meetings of group of seven finance ministers . while russia is among the top world energy producers and an undoubted political heavyweight , its economy is dwarfed by the united states and european union . amid reports that the g20 meeting may be devoted to crisis management rather than long-term reform , britain 's financial times has reported that the british foreign office has already relegated russia to the rank of second-division player . russia appears reluctant to accept this and has been talking up its reform plans for weeks . germany offers to mediate in gas dispute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : january 's gas dispute put a strain on eu-russia relations merkel also offered germany 's services on tuesday in resolving the dispute over gas between russia , and ukraine , which has made a deal to modernize its pipeline network with the european union last month . the chancellor said she would raise the issue with the european commission despite russia 's objection to the agreement . russia was angry at being left out of talks over the deal , calling the agreement an " unfriendly act . "
ukraine , however , has said its pipeline overhaul was not aimed at russia .
ukraine is a major transit country for russian energy headed to europe . merkel called on both parties not to let the situation escalate out of control . a gas dispute between russia and ukraine in january left some eu nations without gas for more than a week . cla / nda / sms / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany and france make the case for regulation financial crisis hindering african development goals merkel , medvedev unite on market reform before g20 summit economy -pipe- 31.03.2009 assertions of g20 unity mask underlying transatlantic tensions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g20 members have different views on market regulation and stimulus packages european countries are pushing for the g20 summit to focus on revamping the global financial architecture , but clashes with the us over stimulus packages continue to overshadow their drive ahead of the meeting this week . transatlantic tensions over the focus of the summit have marked the run-up to the april 2 meeting in london , which is supposed to be a demonstration of top-level unity between the world 's leading economic powers .
european leaders have repeatedly rebuffed us pressure to plough more money into their ailing economies as part of an international effort to revive withering global demand .
the dispute turned ugly last week when czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , described the united states ' ambitious but costly economic stimulus plans as " a way to hell . "
he also said " the united states is not on the right path " with its costly stimulus plans , and insisted " we need to read the history books " to avoid the same mistakes .
the remarks sent top aides scrambling to backtrack , with one insisting topolanek never made the " hell " remark .
since then , officials have been trying to paper over transatlantic differences .
tough talking ahead but world wants unity , says brown british prime minister gordon brown said on monday that tough talking would be needed but he felt that the world 's financial powers were united in finding solutions to the crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says he will do all he can to make the summit a success " we no doubt have some long days of negotiation ahead .
these are difficult and complex problems .
it will not be easy to reach the conclusions that i believe are necessary for the world economy , " said brown , but he added that his recent series of preparatory meetings with world leaders had made him feel certain that " the world wants to come together . "
brown said he would continue to do " all i can to build consensus and to enable an agreement to take us out of this recession and put the whole world back onto a path of growth . "
" this is a decisive moment for the world economy .
we have a choice to make .
we can either let the recession take its course and retreat into isolationism and protectionism ... or resolve as a world community to fight back against the global recession that is hurting people in every country and every continent , " said brown .
obama rejects " either or " approach in an interview with the financial times published on monday , us president barack obama said it was important that the summit should deliver a " message of unity . "
he rejected the idea of an " either or approach " between financial stimulus and regulation , saying that both were needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says both stimulus and regulation are needed " we need stimulus and regulation .
we need to deal with the problems right in front of us and we also need to make sure we 're taking steps to prevent these types of breakdowns from happening again , " obama said .
with respect to the stimulus there would be an accord in london that g20 countries " will do what is necessary to promote growth and trade , " he predicted .
however , he understood the " legitimate concerns " in some countries which had already initiated significant stimulus programs and wanted first to see how they worked .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso said on friday that there was " no dichotomy between stimulating the economy and improving global financial regulation . "
" we need both if we are to get the economy moving again and to restore confidence in a lasting way , " he added europe , us both committed to stimulus measures washington is spending trillions of dollars to support its banking system and drag the world 's biggest economy out of its deepest recession in decades .
meanwhile , the 27-nation european union has committed to economic stimulus measures in 2009 and 2010 worth 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 540 billion -rrb- , equivalent to 3.3 percent of the bloc 's gross domestic product .
the figure includes both national and eu level stimulus measures as well as automatic increases in social spending , such as unemployment benefits , which kick in when the economy weakens .
in berlin , a german spokesman said there were " no points of contention here between us and the us government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin insists there is no rift between obama and merkel " for both of us , and our position has been made clear for some time , regulation of financial markets is the focus of the meeting , " the spokesman said after chancellor angela merkel and us president barack obama held a video conference on thursday .
the rift between europe and the united states over the focus of the summit has been narrowed by washington 's latest announcement for sweeping financial regulatory reforms , including a single watchdog for all key financial institutions and payment systems .
like the united states , the eu wants to clamp down on hedge funds , private equity funds and the use of complicated credit derivatives as well as offshore tax havens .
europe is also in favor of doubling the international monetary fund 's resources for bailing out troubled countries to $ 500 billion , while washington wants to go even further by tripling its funds .
it also wants colleges of supervisors for all major cross-border financial institutions to be set up before the end of 2009 in order to keep a closer eye on big international groups .
talk of tensions is overblown but rifts exist , say experts experts in transatlantic relations say that despite the desire of all the major developed and developing powers at the g20 to show a united front , differences of emphasis do exist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some european nations are against pouring more money into the economy " the obama administration has been pushing europeans to spend much more , but the europeans are baulking at that , " kati suominen , a fellow with the german marshall fund of the united states , told afp .
" particularly the bigger countries , france , germany and the current holder of the european union presidency , czech republic , have been very adamantly opposed to new spending .
so there is a little bit of a rift there . "
dan price , a former assistant to president george w. bush for international economic affairs , argued that reports of discord between nations like france and germany and the united states were " somewhat overblown . "
he pointed out that washington had acted broadly to enact crisis rescue measures since the g20 finance ministers meeting in the uk just three weeks ago .
at those talks , us treasury secretary timothy geithner said washington would provide a capital assistance program for finance firms , and outline a plan to clear toxic assets from the books of crippled banks .
" i think the united states goes into the meeting having done what it said it would do , " said price , now senior partner for global issues at sidley austin llp .
" the united states will be interested to hear what the other nations will do in this regard . " nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

expectations are high as the us president takes part in three major conferences across the continent . though it may not match the 200,000 people who turned up to hear " obama the candidate " speak in berlin , the us president is likely to receive a warm welcome from europe 's leaders and the general public on a visit that begins this tuesday . but there 's an even greater sense of expectation this time around .
europe wants to know if " obama the president " will live up to the hype . the first stop on his whirlwind tour is london , where he 'll be the star attraction at the thursday meeting of the group of 20 nations .
there is no question that the world economy will be at the top of the agenda , but what is not clear is whether obama and european leaders can agree on how to act . last week , czech prime minister mirek topolanek described obama 's economic stimulus package as the " road to hell . " while other european leaders distanced themselves from topolanek 's comment , there are serious differences of opinion between the us and european governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek said the us was repeating the mistakes of the 1930s craig kennedy , president of the german marshall fund in washington , said europe is concerned that the us approach includes too much stimulus and not enough regulation . " the size of the american stimulus and the size of our resulting deficits are causing tremendous concern , " he said . restoring america 's standing obama is officially visiting europe to take part in international conferences , but the trip is a symbolic one too . the visit is a " fundamental part of the president 's agenda of restoring america 's standing in the world and particularly europe , " presidential advisor dennis mcdonough said . ties between europe and the us became strained during the previous administration of george w. bush , especially over the invasion of iraq . during his tour , obama will meet with the leaders of britain , france , germany , turkey and the czech republic .
he 's also set to hold talks with russian president dmitry medvedev while in london . relations between the us and russia came under particular strain last year during the russian-georgian war .
washington is also concerned that moscow 's aid to tehran 's nuclear energy program could help the islamic republic develop nuclear weapons .
iran maintains its nuclear program serves only civilian purposes . russia , on the other hand , objects to us plans to build a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic , and disapproves of nato 's push to extend membership to the ex-soviet republics of ukraine and georgia . on with the tour after the g20 summit in london , obama heads to strasbourg , france , for a summit marking the 60th anniversary of the north atlantic treaty organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in afghanistan is at its highest level since us-led forces toppled the taliban in 2001 he 's set to use the occasion to urge nato countries to support his new strategy for afghanistan , which he outlined last week . obama announced the deployment of an extra 4,000 troops , on top of the 17,000 reinforcements already planned .
his new strategy also includes an increase of civilian personnel , and a greater focus on fighting al qaeda and the taliban , particularly along the afghan-pakistan border . european governments have welcomed obama 's new afghanistan strategy , but nato members know that obama will now expect increased contributions from them too . chancellor angela merkel has announced that germany will boost its training of police and security forces in afghanistan , but has previously ruled out an increase of combat troops . the forgotten issue somewhere down on the to-do list is climate change .
the issue is up for discussion at a meeting of the 27 european union heads of state in prague , the third stop on obama 's tour . the kyoto protocol is due to be replaced at talks in copenhagen at the end of the year , and climate change meetings are taking place across the globe in the lead-up to december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern said the us does not have a magic wand to fix the climate the obama administration made its international climate debut last weekend at un talks in bonn .
todd stern , obama 's special climate envoy , pledged to " make up for lost time " and called for more action by all nations . stern did say , however , that the us wanted to work towards a treaty that was economically " doable . "
but comments like this have some observers concerned about the united states ' commitment to fighting climate change . craig kennedy says that , despite the new administration 's rhetoric , there are doubts in europe that obama will be serious about climate change . " people look at the deficit ; people look at the pressures on the american economy , and people are starting to ask whether or not this is really going to be the highest priority , " he said . cla / sh / sms / rtr / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany and france make the case for regulation financial crisis hindering african development goals assertions of g20 unity mask underlying transatlantic tensions international relations -pipe- 31.03.2009 merkel , medvedev unite on market reform before g20 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev and merkel focused on finance during talks in berlin german chancellor angela merkel and russian president dmitry medvedev will head to the g20 summit with similar goals and expectations .
the two leaders said they hoped the summit would be a success . merkel called for an overhaul of the financial markets on tuesday , march 31 , after meeting with medvedev in the german capital . " the world is standing at a crossroads , " the chancellor told reporters at a joint press conference following the meeting .
" financial markets need to change in such a way that such crises are not repeated . " medvedev supported his german counterpart , adding that the g20 meeting would be the first of many meetings towards developing a new global financial system . " the g20 format does not have to provide the definitive solution , " he said .
" it should be the start of a new financial market design . " the two leaders also warned of protectionist policies implemented by some governments in response to the financial crisis . merkel said the g20 meeting must include a clear statement against protectionism . russia 's ambitious financial reform plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev heads to london with ambitious plans ahead of thursday 's summit in london , russia has come up with an ambitious plan to overhaul the entire global financial order .
medvedev even said the international community should have a say when the world 's richest countries make decisions with global implications , as in the us mortgage crisis . but analysts doubt russia 's plans will get many backers among group of 20 countries , be they established players or rising powerhouses such as brazil , india and china . economists say that while some of russia 's ideas - such as a world currency - are currently unfeasible , others it may offer will fail more due to moscow 's lack of diplomatic heft . though russia is a member of the group of eight industrial powers , it is still not among the 153 members of the world trade organization and is side-lined at meetings of group of seven finance ministers . while russia is among the top world energy producers and an undoubted political heavyweight , its economy is dwarfed by the united states and european union . amid reports that the g20 meeting may be devoted to crisis management rather than long-term reform , britain 's financial times has reported that the british foreign office has already relegated russia to the rank of second-division player . russia appears reluctant to accept this and has been talking up its reform plans for weeks . germany offers to mediate in gas dispute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : january 's gas dispute put a strain on eu-russia relations merkel also offered germany 's services on tuesday in resolving the dispute over gas between russia , and ukraine , which has made a deal to modernize its pipeline network with the european union last month . the chancellor said she would raise the issue with the european commission despite russia 's objection to the agreement . russia was angry at being left out of talks over the deal , calling the agreement an " unfriendly act . "
ukraine , however , has said its pipeline overhaul was not aimed at russia .

german chancellor angela merkel has said she will form a team of experts to negotiate a new corporate structure for german carmaker opel in talks with its troubled us parent group , general motors . " we have 60 days in which to talk about how a future concept should look , " merkel said on tuesday , march 31 , referring to the two month restructuring deadline us president barack obama set general motors one day earlier . merkel made her comments during a speech to some 3,000 opel workers at the company 's main plant in ruesselsheim , near frankfurt . she said the german government and authorities from states with major opel factories would join forces with bankers and opel managers to " defend german interests " in talks with gm and us officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel addressed a crowd of 3,000 workers at the opel factory in ruesselsheim .
" we must lay the foundation for the creation of a european opel , " merkel said , adding that she would work to ensure the carmaker was made economically viable by 2012 . she added that opel would be an efficient and modern organization where " employees can say they 're building german 's future and leading the world . " opel managers have said they need some 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.38 billion -rrb- to restructure their operations and become independent of general motors .
but the german government has so far refused to provide the funds because it is concerned public money may be transferred across the atlantic to help plug holes in gm 's accounts political maneuvering with national elections due in september , merkel 's grand coalition government remains split over how far the state should go in saving the 110-year-old german carmaker , which has been a gm subsidiary since 1929 .
merkel 's christian democratic union would prefer a private investor to rescue opel , while her junior coalition partners from the social democratic party want the state to make direct investments aimed at saving the company 's 26,000-strong workforce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel could become a major election issue in september .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat who will challenge merkel for the chancellorship , laid out a 10-point plan on monday and has said the german government must take action immediately . steinmeier proposed that the federal and state governments join forces with a consortium of opel dealers and managers to purchase a holding of 50 percent plus one share , leaving gm with the minority stake .
he said the move would give opel at least three months to reorganize and find a private investor . but german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg rejected the idea of buying directly into opel , arguing that berlin should limit itself to providing credit guarantees to attract investors . union makes concessions germany 's giant metalworkers union ig metall , meanwhile , has renewed calls for merkel to throw her full support behind efforts aimed at saving opel from bankruptcy . ig metal boss detlef wetzel questioned why merkel would provide billions of euros in a financial bail-out to banks but deny requests for aid from the " real economy . " meanwhile , the union 's regional director in frankfurt , armin schild , has indicated that opel workers are prepared to make significant concessions to keep the company afloat and prevent job cuts . he said possible changes could range from cutting working hours without compensatory wage increases to the negotiation of new collective agreements between employees and management . sje / sh / sms / dpa / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany and france make the case for regulation financial crisis hindering african development goals merkel , medvedev unite on market reform before g20 summit economy -pipe- 31.03.2009 assertions of g20 unity mask underlying transatlantic tensions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g20 members have different views on market regulation and stimulus packages european countries are pushing for the g20 summit to focus on revamping the global financial architecture , but clashes with the us over stimulus packages continue to overshadow their drive ahead of the meeting this week . transatlantic tensions over the focus of the summit have marked the run-up to the april 2 meeting in london , which is supposed to be a demonstration of top-level unity between the world 's leading economic powers .
european leaders have repeatedly rebuffed us pressure to plough more money into their ailing economies as part of an international effort to revive withering global demand .
the dispute turned ugly last week when czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , described the united states ' ambitious but costly economic stimulus plans as " a way to hell . "
he also said " the united states is not on the right path " with its costly stimulus plans , and insisted " we need to read the history books " to avoid the same mistakes .
the remarks sent top aides scrambling to backtrack , with one insisting topolanek never made the " hell " remark .
since then , officials have been trying to paper over transatlantic differences .
tough talking ahead but world wants unity , says brown british prime minister gordon brown said on monday that tough talking would be needed but he felt that the world 's financial powers were united in finding solutions to the crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says he will do all he can to make the summit a success " we no doubt have some long days of negotiation ahead .
these are difficult and complex problems .
it will not be easy to reach the conclusions that i believe are necessary for the world economy , " said brown , but he added that his recent series of preparatory meetings with world leaders had made him feel certain that " the world wants to come together . "
brown said he would continue to do " all i can to build consensus and to enable an agreement to take us out of this recession and put the whole world back onto a path of growth . "
" this is a decisive moment for the world economy .
we have a choice to make .
we can either let the recession take its course and retreat into isolationism and protectionism ... or resolve as a world community to fight back against the global recession that is hurting people in every country and every continent , " said brown .
obama rejects " either or " approach in an interview with the financial times published on monday , us president barack obama said it was important that the summit should deliver a " message of unity . "
he rejected the idea of an " either or approach " between financial stimulus and regulation , saying that both were needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says both stimulus and regulation are needed " we need stimulus and regulation .
we need to deal with the problems right in front of us and we also need to make sure we 're taking steps to prevent these types of breakdowns from happening again , " obama said .
with respect to the stimulus there would be an accord in london that g20 countries " will do what is necessary to promote growth and trade , " he predicted .
however , he understood the " legitimate concerns " in some countries which had already initiated significant stimulus programs and wanted first to see how they worked .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso said on friday that there was " no dichotomy between stimulating the economy and improving global financial regulation . "
" we need both if we are to get the economy moving again and to restore confidence in a lasting way , " he added europe , us both committed to stimulus measures washington is spending trillions of dollars to support its banking system and drag the world 's biggest economy out of its deepest recession in decades .
meanwhile , the 27-nation european union has committed to economic stimulus measures in 2009 and 2010 worth 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 540 billion -rrb- , equivalent to 3.3 percent of the bloc 's gross domestic product .
the figure includes both national and eu level stimulus measures as well as automatic increases in social spending , such as unemployment benefits , which kick in when the economy weakens .
in berlin , a german spokesman said there were " no points of contention here between us and the us government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin insists there is no rift between obama and merkel " for both of us , and our position has been made clear for some time , regulation of financial markets is the focus of the meeting , " the spokesman said after chancellor angela merkel and us president barack obama held a video conference on thursday .
the rift between europe and the united states over the focus of the summit has been narrowed by washington 's latest announcement for sweeping financial regulatory reforms , including a single watchdog for all key financial institutions and payment systems .
like the united states , the eu wants to clamp down on hedge funds , private equity funds and the use of complicated credit derivatives as well as offshore tax havens .
europe is also in favor of doubling the international monetary fund 's resources for bailing out troubled countries to $ 500 billion , while washington wants to go even further by tripling its funds .
it also wants colleges of supervisors for all major cross-border financial institutions to be set up before the end of 2009 in order to keep a closer eye on big international groups .
talk of tensions is overblown but rifts exist , say experts experts in transatlantic relations say that despite the desire of all the major developed and developing powers at the g20 to show a united front , differences of emphasis do exist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some european nations are against pouring more money into the economy " the obama administration has been pushing europeans to spend much more , but the europeans are baulking at that , " kati suominen , a fellow with the german marshall fund of the united states , told afp .
" particularly the bigger countries , france , germany and the current holder of the european union presidency , czech republic , have been very adamantly opposed to new spending .
so there is a little bit of a rift there . "
dan price , a former assistant to president george w. bush for international economic affairs , argued that reports of discord between nations like france and germany and the united states were " somewhat overblown . "
he pointed out that washington had acted broadly to enact crisis rescue measures since the g20 finance ministers meeting in the uk just three weeks ago .
at those talks , us treasury secretary timothy geithner said washington would provide a capital assistance program for finance firms , and outline a plan to clear toxic assets from the books of crippled banks .
" i think the united states goes into the meeting having done what it said it would do , " said price , now senior partner for global issues at sidley austin llp .

germany and france make the case for regulation financial crisis hindering african development goals merkel , medvedev unite on market reform before g20 summit economy -pipe- 31.03.2009 assertions of g20 unity mask underlying transatlantic tensions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g20 members have different views on market regulation and stimulus packages european countries are pushing for the g20 summit to focus on revamping the global financial architecture , but clashes with the us over stimulus packages continue to overshadow their drive ahead of the meeting this week . transatlantic tensions over the focus of the summit have marked the run-up to the april 2 meeting in london , which is supposed to be a demonstration of top-level unity between the world 's leading economic powers .
european leaders have repeatedly rebuffed us pressure to plough more money into their ailing economies as part of an international effort to revive withering global demand .
the dispute turned ugly last week when czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , described the united states ' ambitious but costly economic stimulus plans as " a way to hell . "
he also said " the united states is not on the right path " with its costly stimulus plans , and insisted " we need to read the history books " to avoid the same mistakes .
the remarks sent top aides scrambling to backtrack , with one insisting topolanek never made the " hell " remark .
since then , officials have been trying to paper over transatlantic differences .
tough talking ahead but world wants unity , says brown british prime minister gordon brown said on monday that tough talking would be needed but he felt that the world 's financial powers were united in finding solutions to the crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says he will do all he can to make the summit a success " we no doubt have some long days of negotiation ahead .
these are difficult and complex problems .
it will not be easy to reach the conclusions that i believe are necessary for the world economy , " said brown , but he added that his recent series of preparatory meetings with world leaders had made him feel certain that " the world wants to come together . "
brown said he would continue to do " all i can to build consensus and to enable an agreement to take us out of this recession and put the whole world back onto a path of growth . "
" this is a decisive moment for the world economy .
we have a choice to make .
we can either let the recession take its course and retreat into isolationism and protectionism ... or resolve as a world community to fight back against the global recession that is hurting people in every country and every continent , " said brown .
obama rejects " either or " approach in an interview with the financial times published on monday , us president barack obama said it was important that the summit should deliver a " message of unity . "
he rejected the idea of an " either or approach " between financial stimulus and regulation , saying that both were needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says both stimulus and regulation are needed " we need stimulus and regulation .
we need to deal with the problems right in front of us and we also need to make sure we 're taking steps to prevent these types of breakdowns from happening again , " obama said .
with respect to the stimulus there would be an accord in london that g20 countries " will do what is necessary to promote growth and trade , " he predicted .
however , he understood the " legitimate concerns " in some countries which had already initiated significant stimulus programs and wanted first to see how they worked .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso said on friday that there was " no dichotomy between stimulating the economy and improving global financial regulation . "
" we need both if we are to get the economy moving again and to restore confidence in a lasting way , " he added europe , us both committed to stimulus measures washington is spending trillions of dollars to support its banking system and drag the world 's biggest economy out of its deepest recession in decades .
meanwhile , the 27-nation european union has committed to economic stimulus measures in 2009 and 2010 worth 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 540 billion -rrb- , equivalent to 3.3 percent of the bloc 's gross domestic product .
the figure includes both national and eu level stimulus measures as well as automatic increases in social spending , such as unemployment benefits , which kick in when the economy weakens .
in berlin , a german spokesman said there were " no points of contention here between us and the us government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin insists there is no rift between obama and merkel " for both of us , and our position has been made clear for some time , regulation of financial markets is the focus of the meeting , " the spokesman said after chancellor angela merkel and us president barack obama held a video conference on thursday .
the rift between europe and the united states over the focus of the summit has been narrowed by washington 's latest announcement for sweeping financial regulatory reforms , including a single watchdog for all key financial institutions and payment systems .
like the united states , the eu wants to clamp down on hedge funds , private equity funds and the use of complicated credit derivatives as well as offshore tax havens .
europe is also in favor of doubling the international monetary fund 's resources for bailing out troubled countries to $ 500 billion , while washington wants to go even further by tripling its funds .
it also wants colleges of supervisors for all major cross-border financial institutions to be set up before the end of 2009 in order to keep a closer eye on big international groups .
talk of tensions is overblown but rifts exist , say experts experts in transatlantic relations say that despite the desire of all the major developed and developing powers at the g20 to show a united front , differences of emphasis do exist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some european nations are against pouring more money into the economy " the obama administration has been pushing europeans to spend much more , but the europeans are baulking at that , " kati suominen , a fellow with the german marshall fund of the united states , told afp .
" particularly the bigger countries , france , germany and the current holder of the european union presidency , czech republic , have been very adamantly opposed to new spending .
so there is a little bit of a rift there . "
dan price , a former assistant to president george w. bush for international economic affairs , argued that reports of discord between nations like france and germany and the united states were " somewhat overblown . "
he pointed out that washington had acted broadly to enact crisis rescue measures since the g20 finance ministers meeting in the uk just three weeks ago .
at those talks , us treasury secretary timothy geithner said washington would provide a capital assistance program for finance firms , and outline a plan to clear toxic assets from the books of crippled banks .
" i think the united states goes into the meeting having done what it said it would do , " said price , now senior partner for global issues at sidley austin llp .

after considering the files , the prosecutor 's office said it would open a preliminary investigation into the firms , the first step towards a possible indictment on charges of dodging taxes and concealing the profits behind liechtenstein 's banking secrecy laws .
all three firms denied being the target of a money-laundering probe .
" the michelin group does not own a copa foundation , nor does it hold any accounts at the lgt bank in liechtenstein , " a spokesman for the firm told afp , denying claims in a report by french daily le parisien .
a spokeswoman for energy giant totalfinaelf said in a statement that it " formally denies " owning a foundation called " elf trading " in liechtenstein , while adidas told le parisien it had no knowledge of any such investigation .
" we have no activities in liechtenstein , with the exception of two service stations , " the total spokeswoman said in the statement .
french uncovered fraud files after german investigation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein has been trying to clamp down on tax evaders the files allegedly linking the three businesses to foundations which are suspected of being fronts for money laundering were uncovered after french authorities launched an investigation after a major german tax evasion scandal uncovered allegedly undeclared accounts held by foreign nationals within liechtenstein 's secretive banking sector .
french budget minister eric woerth confirmed on lci television that his ministry had transferred three files to prosecutors , but would neither confirm nor deny the names of the groups involved .
france 's finance ministry has been investigating 64 family-owned firms in connection with the scandal , of which 16 have since come clean and paid their overdue taxes and penalties , woerth said .
authorities estimated last year that french firms evaded up to one billion euros in taxes via liechtenstein , of which le parisien said elf , michelin and adidas accounted for " a large part " .
french president nicolas sarkozy recently said france would crack down on money laundering in european tax havens , including liechtenstein , luxembourg and andorra .
transparency international france estimates that corporate tax evasion via tax havens costs the french state some 10 billion euros per year .
leaders of the group of 20 meeting in london this week are set to draw up an international blacklist of tax havens , as worldwide pressure grows to clamp down on uncooperative nations and territories .
bowing to international pressure , liechtenstein agreed earlier this month to ease its strict banking secrecy rules and cooperate with foreign governments to combat tax fraud . nda / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" opel managers have said they need some 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.38 billion -rrb- to restructure their operations and become independent of general motors .

" meanwhile , the union 's regional director in frankfurt , armin schild , has indicated that opel workers are prepared to make significant concessions to keep the company afloat and prevent job cuts . he said possible changes could range from cutting working hours without compensatory wage increases to the negotiation of new collective agreements between employees and management . sje / sh / sms / dpa / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" meanwhile , the union 's regional director in frankfurt , armin schild , has indicated that opel workers are prepared to make significant concessions to keep the company afloat and prevent job cuts . he said possible changes could range from cutting working hours without compensatory wage increases to the negotiation of new collective agreements between employees and management . sje / sh / sms / dpa / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after considering the files , the prosecutor 's office said it would open a preliminary investigation into the firms , the first step towards a possible indictment on charges of dodging taxes and concealing the profits behind liechtenstein 's banking secrecy laws .
all three firms denied being the target of a money-laundering probe .
" the michelin group does not own a copa foundation , nor does it hold any accounts at the lgt bank in liechtenstein , " a spokesman for the firm told afp , denying claims in a report by french daily le parisien .
a spokeswoman for energy giant totalfinaelf said in a statement that it " formally denies " owning a foundation called " elf trading " in liechtenstein , while adidas told le parisien it had no knowledge of any such investigation .
" we have no activities in liechtenstein , with the exception of two service stations , " the total spokeswoman said in the statement .
french uncovered fraud files after german investigation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein has been trying to clamp down on tax evaders the files allegedly linking the three businesses to foundations which are suspected of being fronts for money laundering were uncovered after french authorities launched an investigation after a major german tax evasion scandal uncovered allegedly undeclared accounts held by foreign nationals within liechtenstein 's secretive banking sector .
french budget minister eric woerth confirmed on lci television that his ministry had transferred three files to prosecutors , but would neither confirm nor deny the names of the groups involved .
france 's finance ministry has been investigating 64 family-owned firms in connection with the scandal , of which 16 have since come clean and paid their overdue taxes and penalties , woerth said .
authorities estimated last year that french firms evaded up to one billion euros in taxes via liechtenstein , of which le parisien said elf , michelin and adidas accounted for " a large part " .
french president nicolas sarkozy recently said france would crack down on money laundering in european tax havens , including liechtenstein , luxembourg and andorra .
transparency international france estimates that corporate tax evasion via tax havens costs the french state some 10 billion euros per year .
leaders of the group of 20 meeting in london this week are set to draw up an international blacklist of tax havens , as worldwide pressure grows to clamp down on uncooperative nations and territories .
bowing to international pressure , liechtenstein agreed earlier this month to ease its strict banking secrecy rules and cooperate with foreign governments to combat tax fraud . nda / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german chancellor angela merkel has said she will form a team of experts to negotiate a new corporate structure for german carmaker opel in talks with its troubled us parent group , general motors . " we have 60 days in which to talk about how a future concept should look , " merkel said on tuesday , march 31 , referring to the two month restructuring deadline us president barack obama set general motors one day earlier . merkel made her comments during a speech to some 3,000 opel workers at the company 's main plant in ruesselsheim , near frankfurt . she said the german government and authorities from states with major opel factories would join forces with bankers and opel managers to " defend german interests " in talks with gm and us officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel addressed a crowd of 3,000 workers at the opel factory in ruesselsheim .
" we must lay the foundation for the creation of a european opel , " merkel said , adding that she would work to ensure the carmaker was made economically viable by 2012 . she added that opel would be an efficient and modern organization where " employees can say they 're building german 's future and leading the world . " opel managers have said they need some 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.38 billion -rrb- to restructure their operations and become independent of general motors .
but the german government has so far refused to provide the funds because it is concerned public money may be transferred across the atlantic to help plug holes in gm 's accounts political maneuvering with national elections due in september , merkel 's grand coalition government remains split over how far the state should go in saving the 110-year-old german carmaker , which has been a gm subsidiary since 1929 .
merkel 's christian democratic union would prefer a private investor to rescue opel , while her junior coalition partners from the social democratic party want the state to make direct investments aimed at saving the company 's 26,000-strong workforce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel could become a major election issue in september .

expectations are high as the us president takes part in three major conferences across the continent . though it may not match the 200,000 people who turned up to hear " obama the candidate " speak in berlin , the us president is likely to receive a warm welcome from europe 's leaders and the general public on a visit that begins this tuesday . but there 's an even greater sense of expectation this time around .
europe wants to know if " obama the president " will live up to the hype . the first stop on his whirlwind tour is london , where he 'll be the star attraction at the thursday meeting of the group of 20 nations .
there is no question that the world economy will be at the top of the agenda , but what is not clear is whether obama and european leaders can agree on how to act . last week , czech prime minister mirek topolanek described obama 's economic stimulus package as the " road to hell . " while other european leaders distanced themselves from topolanek 's comment , there are serious differences of opinion between the us and european governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek said the us was repeating the mistakes of the 1930s craig kennedy , president of the german marshall fund in washington , said europe is concerned that the us approach includes too much stimulus and not enough regulation . " the size of the american stimulus and the size of our resulting deficits are causing tremendous concern , " he said . restoring america 's standing obama is officially visiting europe to take part in international conferences , but the trip is a symbolic one too . the visit is a " fundamental part of the president 's agenda of restoring america 's standing in the world and particularly europe , " presidential advisor dennis mcdonough said . ties between europe and the us became strained during the previous administration of george w. bush , especially over the invasion of iraq . during his tour , obama will meet with the leaders of britain , france , germany , turkey and the czech republic .
he 's also set to hold talks with russian president dmitry medvedev while in london . relations between the us and russia came under particular strain last year during the russian-georgian war .
washington is also concerned that moscow 's aid to tehran 's nuclear energy program could help the islamic republic develop nuclear weapons .
iran maintains its nuclear program serves only civilian purposes . russia , on the other hand , objects to us plans to build a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic , and disapproves of nato 's push to extend membership to the ex-soviet republics of ukraine and georgia . on with the tour after the g20 summit in london , obama heads to strasbourg , france , for a summit marking the 60th anniversary of the north atlantic treaty organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in afghanistan is at its highest level since us-led forces toppled the taliban in 2001 he 's set to use the occasion to urge nato countries to support his new strategy for afghanistan , which he outlined last week . obama announced the deployment of an extra 4,000 troops , on top of the 17,000 reinforcements already planned .
his new strategy also includes an increase of civilian personnel , and a greater focus on fighting al qaeda and the taliban , particularly along the afghan-pakistan border . european governments have welcomed obama 's new afghanistan strategy , but nato members know that obama will now expect increased contributions from them too . chancellor angela merkel has announced that germany will boost its training of police and security forces in afghanistan , but has previously ruled out an increase of combat troops . the forgotten issue somewhere down on the to-do list is climate change .
the issue is up for discussion at a meeting of the 27 european union heads of state in prague , the third stop on obama 's tour . the kyoto protocol is due to be replaced at talks in copenhagen at the end of the year , and climate change meetings are taking place across the globe in the lead-up to december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern said the us does not have a magic wand to fix the climate the obama administration made its international climate debut last weekend at un talks in bonn .
todd stern , obama 's special climate envoy , pledged to " make up for lost time " and called for more action by all nations . stern did say , however , that the us wanted to work towards a treaty that was economically " doable . "
but comments like this have some observers concerned about the united states ' commitment to fighting climate change . craig kennedy says that , despite the new administration 's rhetoric , there are doubts in europe that obama will be serious about climate change . " people look at the deficit ; people look at the pressures on the american economy , and people are starting to ask whether or not this is really going to be the highest priority , " he said . cla / sh / sms / rtr / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany and france make the case for regulation financial crisis hindering african development goals merkel , medvedev unite on market reform before g20 summit economy -pipe- 31.03.2009 assertions of g20 unity mask underlying transatlantic tensions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g20 members have different views on market regulation and stimulus packages european countries are pushing for the g20 summit to focus on revamping the global financial architecture , but clashes with the us over stimulus packages continue to overshadow their drive ahead of the meeting this week . transatlantic tensions over the focus of the summit have marked the run-up to the april 2 meeting in london , which is supposed to be a demonstration of top-level unity between the world 's leading economic powers .
european leaders have repeatedly rebuffed us pressure to plough more money into their ailing economies as part of an international effort to revive withering global demand .
the dispute turned ugly last week when czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , described the united states ' ambitious but costly economic stimulus plans as " a way to hell . "
he also said " the united states is not on the right path " with its costly stimulus plans , and insisted " we need to read the history books " to avoid the same mistakes .
the remarks sent top aides scrambling to backtrack , with one insisting topolanek never made the " hell " remark .
since then , officials have been trying to paper over transatlantic differences .
tough talking ahead but world wants unity , says brown british prime minister gordon brown said on monday that tough talking would be needed but he felt that the world 's financial powers were united in finding solutions to the crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says he will do all he can to make the summit a success " we no doubt have some long days of negotiation ahead .
these are difficult and complex problems .
it will not be easy to reach the conclusions that i believe are necessary for the world economy , " said brown , but he added that his recent series of preparatory meetings with world leaders had made him feel certain that " the world wants to come together . "
brown said he would continue to do " all i can to build consensus and to enable an agreement to take us out of this recession and put the whole world back onto a path of growth . "
" this is a decisive moment for the world economy .
we have a choice to make .
we can either let the recession take its course and retreat into isolationism and protectionism ... or resolve as a world community to fight back against the global recession that is hurting people in every country and every continent , " said brown .
obama rejects " either or " approach in an interview with the financial times published on monday , us president barack obama said it was important that the summit should deliver a " message of unity . "
he rejected the idea of an " either or approach " between financial stimulus and regulation , saying that both were needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says both stimulus and regulation are needed " we need stimulus and regulation .
we need to deal with the problems right in front of us and we also need to make sure we 're taking steps to prevent these types of breakdowns from happening again , " obama said .
with respect to the stimulus there would be an accord in london that g20 countries " will do what is necessary to promote growth and trade , " he predicted .
however , he understood the " legitimate concerns " in some countries which had already initiated significant stimulus programs and wanted first to see how they worked .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso said on friday that there was " no dichotomy between stimulating the economy and improving global financial regulation . "
" we need both if we are to get the economy moving again and to restore confidence in a lasting way , " he added europe , us both committed to stimulus measures washington is spending trillions of dollars to support its banking system and drag the world 's biggest economy out of its deepest recession in decades .
meanwhile , the 27-nation european union has committed to economic stimulus measures in 2009 and 2010 worth 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 540 billion -rrb- , equivalent to 3.3 percent of the bloc 's gross domestic product .
the figure includes both national and eu level stimulus measures as well as automatic increases in social spending , such as unemployment benefits , which kick in when the economy weakens .
in berlin , a german spokesman said there were " no points of contention here between us and the us government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin insists there is no rift between obama and merkel " for both of us , and our position has been made clear for some time , regulation of financial markets is the focus of the meeting , " the spokesman said after chancellor angela merkel and us president barack obama held a video conference on thursday .
the rift between europe and the united states over the focus of the summit has been narrowed by washington 's latest announcement for sweeping financial regulatory reforms , including a single watchdog for all key financial institutions and payment systems .
like the united states , the eu wants to clamp down on hedge funds , private equity funds and the use of complicated credit derivatives as well as offshore tax havens .
europe is also in favor of doubling the international monetary fund 's resources for bailing out troubled countries to $ 500 billion , while washington wants to go even further by tripling its funds .
it also wants colleges of supervisors for all major cross-border financial institutions to be set up before the end of 2009 in order to keep a closer eye on big international groups .
talk of tensions is overblown but rifts exist , say experts experts in transatlantic relations say that despite the desire of all the major developed and developing powers at the g20 to show a united front , differences of emphasis do exist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some european nations are against pouring more money into the economy " the obama administration has been pushing europeans to spend much more , but the europeans are baulking at that , " kati suominen , a fellow with the german marshall fund of the united states , told afp .
" particularly the bigger countries , france , germany and the current holder of the european union presidency , czech republic , have been very adamantly opposed to new spending .
so there is a little bit of a rift there . "
dan price , a former assistant to president george w. bush for international economic affairs , argued that reports of discord between nations like france and germany and the united states were " somewhat overblown . "
he pointed out that washington had acted broadly to enact crisis rescue measures since the g20 finance ministers meeting in the uk just three weeks ago .
at those talks , us treasury secretary timothy geithner said washington would provide a capital assistance program for finance firms , and outline a plan to clear toxic assets from the books of crippled banks .
" i think the united states goes into the meeting having done what it said it would do , " said price , now senior partner for global issues at sidley austin llp .
" the united states will be interested to hear what the other nations will do in this regard . " nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

expectations are high as the us president takes part in three major conferences across the continent . though it may not match the 200,000 people who turned up to hear " obama the candidate " speak in berlin , the us president is likely to receive a warm welcome from europe 's leaders and the general public on a visit that begins this tuesday . but there 's an even greater sense of expectation this time around .
europe wants to know if " obama the president " will live up to the hype . the first stop on his whirlwind tour is london , where he 'll be the star attraction at the thursday meeting of the group of 20 nations .
there is no question that the world economy will be at the top of the agenda , but what is not clear is whether obama and european leaders can agree on how to act . last week , czech prime minister mirek topolanek described obama 's economic stimulus package as the " road to hell . " while other european leaders distanced themselves from topolanek 's comment , there are serious differences of opinion between the us and european governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek said the us was repeating the mistakes of the 1930s craig kennedy , president of the german marshall fund in washington , said europe is concerned that the us approach includes too much stimulus and not enough regulation . " the size of the american stimulus and the size of our resulting deficits are causing tremendous concern , " he said . restoring america 's standing obama is officially visiting europe to take part in international conferences , but the trip is a symbolic one too . the visit is a " fundamental part of the president 's agenda of restoring america 's standing in the world and particularly europe , " presidential advisor dennis mcdonough said . ties between europe and the us became strained during the previous administration of george w. bush , especially over the invasion of iraq . during his tour , obama will meet with the leaders of britain , france , germany , turkey and the czech republic .
he 's also set to hold talks with russian president dmitry medvedev while in london . relations between the us and russia came under particular strain last year during the russian-georgian war .
washington is also concerned that moscow 's aid to tehran 's nuclear energy program could help the islamic republic develop nuclear weapons .
iran maintains its nuclear program serves only civilian purposes . russia , on the other hand , objects to us plans to build a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic , and disapproves of nato 's push to extend membership to the ex-soviet republics of ukraine and georgia . on with the tour after the g20 summit in london , obama heads to strasbourg , france , for a summit marking the 60th anniversary of the north atlantic treaty organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in afghanistan is at its highest level since us-led forces toppled the taliban in 2001 he 's set to use the occasion to urge nato countries to support his new strategy for afghanistan , which he outlined last week . obama announced the deployment of an extra 4,000 troops , on top of the 17,000 reinforcements already planned .
his new strategy also includes an increase of civilian personnel , and a greater focus on fighting al qaeda and the taliban , particularly along the afghan-pakistan border . european governments have welcomed obama 's new afghanistan strategy , but nato members know that obama will now expect increased contributions from them too . chancellor angela merkel has announced that germany will boost its training of police and security forces in afghanistan , but has previously ruled out an increase of combat troops . the forgotten issue somewhere down on the to-do list is climate change .
the issue is up for discussion at a meeting of the 27 european union heads of state in prague , the third stop on obama 's tour . the kyoto protocol is due to be replaced at talks in copenhagen at the end of the year , and climate change meetings are taking place across the globe in the lead-up to december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern said the us does not have a magic wand to fix the climate the obama administration made its international climate debut last weekend at un talks in bonn .
todd stern , obama 's special climate envoy , pledged to " make up for lost time " and called for more action by all nations . stern did say , however , that the us wanted to work towards a treaty that was economically " doable . "
but comments like this have some observers concerned about the united states ' commitment to fighting climate change . craig kennedy says that , despite the new administration 's rhetoric , there are doubts in europe that obama will be serious about climate change . " people look at the deficit ; people look at the pressures on the american economy , and people are starting to ask whether or not this is really going to be the highest priority , " he said . cla / sh / sms / rtr / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she is 18 today and vividly remembers the time when she spent a holiday in one of the groups summer camps at the age of 11 .
" we had to get up fairly early , " she explains .
" then there was a roll call with trumpets and flags .

germany and france make the case for regulation financial crisis hindering african development goals merkel , medvedev unite on market reform before g20 summit economy -pipe- 31.03.2009 assertions of g20 unity mask underlying transatlantic tensions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g20 members have different views on market regulation and stimulus packages european countries are pushing for the g20 summit to focus on revamping the global financial architecture , but clashes with the us over stimulus packages continue to overshadow their drive ahead of the meeting this week . transatlantic tensions over the focus of the summit have marked the run-up to the april 2 meeting in london , which is supposed to be a demonstration of top-level unity between the world 's leading economic powers .
european leaders have repeatedly rebuffed us pressure to plough more money into their ailing economies as part of an international effort to revive withering global demand .
the dispute turned ugly last week when czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , described the united states ' ambitious but costly economic stimulus plans as " a way to hell . "
he also said " the united states is not on the right path " with its costly stimulus plans , and insisted " we need to read the history books " to avoid the same mistakes .
the remarks sent top aides scrambling to backtrack , with one insisting topolanek never made the " hell " remark .
since then , officials have been trying to paper over transatlantic differences .
tough talking ahead but world wants unity , says brown british prime minister gordon brown said on monday that tough talking would be needed but he felt that the world 's financial powers were united in finding solutions to the crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says he will do all he can to make the summit a success " we no doubt have some long days of negotiation ahead .
these are difficult and complex problems .
it will not be easy to reach the conclusions that i believe are necessary for the world economy , " said brown , but he added that his recent series of preparatory meetings with world leaders had made him feel certain that " the world wants to come together . "
brown said he would continue to do " all i can to build consensus and to enable an agreement to take us out of this recession and put the whole world back onto a path of growth . "
" this is a decisive moment for the world economy .
we have a choice to make .
we can either let the recession take its course and retreat into isolationism and protectionism ... or resolve as a world community to fight back against the global recession that is hurting people in every country and every continent , " said brown .
obama rejects " either or " approach in an interview with the financial times published on monday , us president barack obama said it was important that the summit should deliver a " message of unity . "
he rejected the idea of an " either or approach " between financial stimulus and regulation , saying that both were needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says both stimulus and regulation are needed " we need stimulus and regulation .
we need to deal with the problems right in front of us and we also need to make sure we 're taking steps to prevent these types of breakdowns from happening again , " obama said .
with respect to the stimulus there would be an accord in london that g20 countries " will do what is necessary to promote growth and trade , " he predicted .
however , he understood the " legitimate concerns " in some countries which had already initiated significant stimulus programs and wanted first to see how they worked .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso said on friday that there was " no dichotomy between stimulating the economy and improving global financial regulation . "
" we need both if we are to get the economy moving again and to restore confidence in a lasting way , " he added europe , us both committed to stimulus measures washington is spending trillions of dollars to support its banking system and drag the world 's biggest economy out of its deepest recession in decades .
meanwhile , the 27-nation european union has committed to economic stimulus measures in 2009 and 2010 worth 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 540 billion -rrb- , equivalent to 3.3 percent of the bloc 's gross domestic product .
the figure includes both national and eu level stimulus measures as well as automatic increases in social spending , such as unemployment benefits , which kick in when the economy weakens .
in berlin , a german spokesman said there were " no points of contention here between us and the us government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin insists there is no rift between obama and merkel " for both of us , and our position has been made clear for some time , regulation of financial markets is the focus of the meeting , " the spokesman said after chancellor angela merkel and us president barack obama held a video conference on thursday .
the rift between europe and the united states over the focus of the summit has been narrowed by washington 's latest announcement for sweeping financial regulatory reforms , including a single watchdog for all key financial institutions and payment systems .
like the united states , the eu wants to clamp down on hedge funds , private equity funds and the use of complicated credit derivatives as well as offshore tax havens .
europe is also in favor of doubling the international monetary fund 's resources for bailing out troubled countries to $ 500 billion , while washington wants to go even further by tripling its funds .
it also wants colleges of supervisors for all major cross-border financial institutions to be set up before the end of 2009 in order to keep a closer eye on big international groups .
talk of tensions is overblown but rifts exist , say experts experts in transatlantic relations say that despite the desire of all the major developed and developing powers at the g20 to show a united front , differences of emphasis do exist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some european nations are against pouring more money into the economy " the obama administration has been pushing europeans to spend much more , but the europeans are baulking at that , " kati suominen , a fellow with the german marshall fund of the united states , told afp .
" particularly the bigger countries , france , germany and the current holder of the european union presidency , czech republic , have been very adamantly opposed to new spending .
so there is a little bit of a rift there . "
dan price , a former assistant to president george w. bush for international economic affairs , argued that reports of discord between nations like france and germany and the united states were " somewhat overblown . "
he pointed out that washington had acted broadly to enact crisis rescue measures since the g20 finance ministers meeting in the uk just three weeks ago .
at those talks , us treasury secretary timothy geithner said washington would provide a capital assistance program for finance firms , and outline a plan to clear toxic assets from the books of crippled banks .
" i think the united states goes into the meeting having done what it said it would do , " said price , now senior partner for global issues at sidley austin llp .
" the united states will be interested to hear what the other nations will do in this regard . " nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the two leaders said they hoped the summit would be a success . merkel called for an overhaul of the financial markets on tuesday , march 31 , after meeting with medvedev in the german capital . " the world is standing at a crossroads , " the chancellor told reporters at a joint press conference following the meeting .
" financial markets need to change in such a way that such crises are not repeated . " medvedev supported his german counterpart , adding that the g20 meeting would be the first of many meetings towards developing a new global financial system . " the g20 format does not have to provide the definitive solution , " he said .
" it should be the start of a new financial market design . " the two leaders also warned of protectionist policies implemented by some governments in response to the financial crisis . merkel said the g20 meeting must include a clear statement against protectionism . russia 's ambitious financial reform plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev heads to london with ambitious plans ahead of thursday 's summit in london , russia has come up with an ambitious plan to overhaul the entire global financial order .
medvedev even said the international community should have a say when the world 's richest countries make decisions with global implications , as in the us mortgage crisis . but analysts doubt russia 's plans will get many backers among group of 20 countries , be they established players or rising powerhouses such as brazil , india and china . economists say that while some of russia 's ideas - such as a world currency - are currently unfeasible , others it may offer will fail more due to moscow 's lack of diplomatic heft . though russia is a member of the group of eight industrial powers , it is still not among the 153 members of the world trade organization and is side-lined at meetings of group of seven finance ministers . while russia is among the top world energy producers and an undoubted political heavyweight , its economy is dwarfed by the united states and european union . amid reports that the g20 meeting may be devoted to crisis management rather than long-term reform , britain 's financial times has reported that the british foreign office has already relegated russia to the rank of second-division player . russia appears reluctant to accept this and has been talking up its reform plans for weeks . germany offers to mediate in gas dispute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : january 's gas dispute put a strain on eu-russia relations merkel also offered germany 's services on tuesday in resolving the dispute over gas between russia , and ukraine , which has made a deal to modernize its pipeline network with the european union last month . the chancellor said she would raise the issue with the european commission despite russia 's objection to the agreement . russia was angry at being left out of talks over the deal , calling the agreement an " unfriendly act . "
ukraine , however , has said its pipeline overhaul was not aimed at russia .

german chancellor angela merkel has said she will form a team of experts to negotiate a new corporate structure for german carmaker opel in talks with its troubled us parent group , general motors . " we have 60 days in which to talk about how a future concept should look , " merkel said on tuesday , march 31 , referring to the two month restructuring deadline us president barack obama set general motors one day earlier . merkel made her comments during a speech to some 3,000 opel workers at the company 's main plant in ruesselsheim , near frankfurt . she said the german government and authorities from states with major opel factories would join forces with bankers and opel managers to " defend german interests " in talks with gm and us officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel addressed a crowd of 3,000 workers at the opel factory in ruesselsheim .
" we must lay the foundation for the creation of a european opel , " merkel said , adding that she would work to ensure the carmaker was made economically viable by 2012 . she added that opel would be an efficient and modern organization where " employees can say they 're building german 's future and leading the world . " opel managers have said they need some 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.38 billion -rrb- to restructure their operations and become independent of general motors .
but the german government has so far refused to provide the funds because it is concerned public money may be transferred across the atlantic to help plug holes in gm 's accounts political maneuvering with national elections due in september , merkel 's grand coalition government remains split over how far the state should go in saving the 110-year-old german carmaker , which has been a gm subsidiary since 1929 .
merkel 's christian democratic union would prefer a private investor to rescue opel , while her junior coalition partners from the social democratic party want the state to make direct investments aimed at saving the company 's 26,000-strong workforce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel could become a major election issue in september .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat who will challenge merkel for the chancellorship , laid out a 10-point plan on monday and has said the german government must take action immediately . steinmeier proposed that the federal and state governments join forces with a consortium of opel dealers and managers to purchase a holding of 50 percent plus one share , leaving gm with the minority stake .
he said the move would give opel at least three months to reorganize and find a private investor . but german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg rejected the idea of buying directly into opel , arguing that berlin should limit itself to providing credit guarantees to attract investors . union makes concessions germany 's giant metalworkers union ig metall , meanwhile , has renewed calls for merkel to throw her full support behind efforts aimed at saving opel from bankruptcy . ig metal boss detlef wetzel questioned why merkel would provide billions of euros in a financial bail-out to banks but deny requests for aid from the " real economy . " meanwhile , the union 's regional director in frankfurt , armin schild , has indicated that opel workers are prepared to make significant concessions to keep the company afloat and prevent job cuts . he said possible changes could range from cutting working hours without compensatory wage increases to the negotiation of new collective agreements between employees and management . sje / sh / sms / dpa / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

-lrb- 30.03.2009 -rrb- direct stake in opel would be bad news for germany , says merkel chancellor angela merkel made resolute use of the word " no " during a closely watched television appearance , stressing that germany will neither buy a direct stake in the failing carmaker opel , nor hold early elections .

" we have 60 days in which to talk about how a future concept should look , " merkel said on tuesday , march 31 , referring to the two month restructuring deadline us president barack obama set general motors one day earlier . merkel made her comments during a speech to some 3,000 opel workers at the company 's main plant in ruesselsheim , near frankfurt . she said the german government and authorities from states with major opel factories would join forces with bankers and opel managers to " defend german interests " in talks with gm and us officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel addressed a crowd of 3,000 workers at the opel factory in ruesselsheim .
" we must lay the foundation for the creation of a european opel , " merkel said , adding that she would work to ensure the carmaker was made economically viable by 2012 . she added that opel would be an efficient and modern organization where " employees can say they 're building german 's future and leading the world . " opel managers have said they need some 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.38 billion -rrb- to restructure their operations and become independent of general motors .
but the german government has so far refused to provide the funds because it is concerned public money may be transferred across the atlantic to help plug holes in gm 's accounts political maneuvering with national elections due in september , merkel 's grand coalition government remains split over how far the state should go in saving the 110-year-old german carmaker , which has been a gm subsidiary since 1929 .

german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat who will challenge merkel for the chancellorship , laid out a 10-point plan on monday and has said the german government must take action immediately . steinmeier proposed that the federal and state governments join forces with a consortium of opel dealers and managers to purchase a holding of 50 percent plus one share , leaving gm with the minority stake .
he said the move would give opel at least three months to reorganize and find a private investor . but german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg rejected the idea of buying directly into opel , arguing that berlin should limit itself to providing credit guarantees to attract investors . union makes concessions germany 's giant metalworkers union ig metall , meanwhile , has renewed calls for merkel to throw her full support behind efforts aimed at saving opel from bankruptcy . ig metal boss detlef wetzel questioned why merkel would provide billions of euros in a financial bail-out to banks but deny requests for aid from the " real economy . " meanwhile , the union 's regional director in frankfurt , armin schild , has indicated that opel workers are prepared to make significant concessions to keep the company afloat and prevent job cuts . he said possible changes could range from cutting working hours without compensatory wage increases to the negotiation of new collective agreements between employees and management . sje / sh / sms / dpa / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after considering the files , the prosecutor 's office said it would open a preliminary investigation into the firms , the first step towards a possible indictment on charges of dodging taxes and concealing the profits behind liechtenstein 's banking secrecy laws .
all three firms denied being the target of a money-laundering probe .
" the michelin group does not own a copa foundation , nor does it hold any accounts at the lgt bank in liechtenstein , " a spokesman for the firm told afp , denying claims in a report by french daily le parisien .
a spokeswoman for energy giant totalfinaelf said in a statement that it " formally denies " owning a foundation called " elf trading " in liechtenstein , while adidas told le parisien it had no knowledge of any such investigation .
" we have no activities in liechtenstein , with the exception of two service stations , " the total spokeswoman said in the statement .
french uncovered fraud files after german investigation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein has been trying to clamp down on tax evaders the files allegedly linking the three businesses to foundations which are suspected of being fronts for money laundering were uncovered after french authorities launched an investigation after a major german tax evasion scandal uncovered allegedly undeclared accounts held by foreign nationals within liechtenstein 's secretive banking sector .
french budget minister eric woerth confirmed on lci television that his ministry had transferred three files to prosecutors , but would neither confirm nor deny the names of the groups involved .
france 's finance ministry has been investigating 64 family-owned firms in connection with the scandal , of which 16 have since come clean and paid their overdue taxes and penalties , woerth said .

german chancellor angela merkel has said she will form a team of experts to negotiate a new corporate structure for german carmaker opel in talks with its troubled us parent group , general motors . " we have 60 days in which to talk about how a future concept should look , " merkel said on tuesday , march 31 , referring to the two month restructuring deadline us president barack obama set general motors one day earlier . merkel made her comments during a speech to some 3,000 opel workers at the company 's main plant in ruesselsheim , near frankfurt . she said the german government and authorities from states with major opel factories would join forces with bankers and opel managers to " defend german interests " in talks with gm and us officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel addressed a crowd of 3,000 workers at the opel factory in ruesselsheim .
" we must lay the foundation for the creation of a european opel , " merkel said , adding that she would work to ensure the carmaker was made economically viable by 2012 . she added that opel would be an efficient and modern organization where " employees can say they 're building german 's future and leading the world . " opel managers have said they need some 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.38 billion -rrb- to restructure their operations and become independent of general motors .

expectations are high as the us president takes part in three major conferences across the continent . though it may not match the 200,000 people who turned up to hear " obama the candidate " speak in berlin , the us president is likely to receive a warm welcome from europe 's leaders and the general public on a visit that begins this tuesday . but there 's an even greater sense of expectation this time around .
europe wants to know if " obama the president " will live up to the hype . the first stop on his whirlwind tour is london , where he 'll be the star attraction at the thursday meeting of the group of 20 nations .
there is no question that the world economy will be at the top of the agenda , but what is not clear is whether obama and european leaders can agree on how to act . last week , czech prime minister mirek topolanek described obama 's economic stimulus package as the " road to hell . " while other european leaders distanced themselves from topolanek 's comment , there are serious differences of opinion between the us and european governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek said the us was repeating the mistakes of the 1930s craig kennedy , president of the german marshall fund in washington , said europe is concerned that the us approach includes too much stimulus and not enough regulation . " the size of the american stimulus and the size of our resulting deficits are causing tremendous concern , " he said . restoring america 's standing obama is officially visiting europe to take part in international conferences , but the trip is a symbolic one too . the visit is a " fundamental part of the president 's agenda of restoring america 's standing in the world and particularly europe , " presidential advisor dennis mcdonough said . ties between europe and the us became strained during the previous administration of george w. bush , especially over the invasion of iraq . during his tour , obama will meet with the leaders of britain , france , germany , turkey and the czech republic .
he 's also set to hold talks with russian president dmitry medvedev while in london . relations between the us and russia came under particular strain last year during the russian-georgian war .
washington is also concerned that moscow 's aid to tehran 's nuclear energy program could help the islamic republic develop nuclear weapons .
iran maintains its nuclear program serves only civilian purposes . russia , on the other hand , objects to us plans to build a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic , and disapproves of nato 's push to extend membership to the ex-soviet republics of ukraine and georgia . on with the tour after the g20 summit in london , obama heads to strasbourg , france , for a summit marking the 60th anniversary of the north atlantic treaty organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in afghanistan is at its highest level since us-led forces toppled the taliban in 2001 he 's set to use the occasion to urge nato countries to support his new strategy for afghanistan , which he outlined last week . obama announced the deployment of an extra 4,000 troops , on top of the 17,000 reinforcements already planned .
his new strategy also includes an increase of civilian personnel , and a greater focus on fighting al qaeda and the taliban , particularly along the afghan-pakistan border . european governments have welcomed obama 's new afghanistan strategy , but nato members know that obama will now expect increased contributions from them too . chancellor angela merkel has announced that germany will boost its training of police and security forces in afghanistan , but has previously ruled out an increase of combat troops . the forgotten issue somewhere down on the to-do list is climate change .
the issue is up for discussion at a meeting of the 27 european union heads of state in prague , the third stop on obama 's tour . the kyoto protocol is due to be replaced at talks in copenhagen at the end of the year , and climate change meetings are taking place across the globe in the lead-up to december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern said the us does not have a magic wand to fix the climate the obama administration made its international climate debut last weekend at un talks in bonn .
todd stern , obama 's special climate envoy , pledged to " make up for lost time " and called for more action by all nations . stern did say , however , that the us wanted to work towards a treaty that was economically " doable . "
but comments like this have some observers concerned about the united states ' commitment to fighting climate change . craig kennedy says that , despite the new administration 's rhetoric , there are doubts in europe that obama will be serious about climate change .

expectations are high as the us president takes part in three major conferences across the continent . though it may not match the 200,000 people who turned up to hear " obama the candidate " speak in berlin , the us president is likely to receive a warm welcome from europe 's leaders and the general public on a visit that begins this tuesday . but there 's an even greater sense of expectation this time around .
europe wants to know if " obama the president " will live up to the hype . the first stop on his whirlwind tour is london , where he 'll be the star attraction at the thursday meeting of the group of 20 nations .
there is no question that the world economy will be at the top of the agenda , but what is not clear is whether obama and european leaders can agree on how to act . last week , czech prime minister mirek topolanek described obama 's economic stimulus package as the " road to hell . " while other european leaders distanced themselves from topolanek 's comment , there are serious differences of opinion between the us and european governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek said the us was repeating the mistakes of the 1930s craig kennedy , president of the german marshall fund in washington , said europe is concerned that the us approach includes too much stimulus and not enough regulation . " the size of the american stimulus and the size of our resulting deficits are causing tremendous concern , " he said . restoring america 's standing obama is officially visiting europe to take part in international conferences , but the trip is a symbolic one too . the visit is a " fundamental part of the president 's agenda of restoring america 's standing in the world and particularly europe , " presidential advisor dennis mcdonough said . ties between europe and the us became strained during the previous administration of george w. bush , especially over the invasion of iraq . during his tour , obama will meet with the leaders of britain , france , germany , turkey and the czech republic .
he 's also set to hold talks with russian president dmitry medvedev while in london . relations between the us and russia came under particular strain last year during the russian-georgian war .
washington is also concerned that moscow 's aid to tehran 's nuclear energy program could help the islamic republic develop nuclear weapons .
iran maintains its nuclear program serves only civilian purposes . russia , on the other hand , objects to us plans to build a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic , and disapproves of nato 's push to extend membership to the ex-soviet republics of ukraine and georgia . on with the tour after the g20 summit in london , obama heads to strasbourg , france , for a summit marking the 60th anniversary of the north atlantic treaty organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in afghanistan is at its highest level since us-led forces toppled the taliban in 2001 he 's set to use the occasion to urge nato countries to support his new strategy for afghanistan , which he outlined last week . obama announced the deployment of an extra 4,000 troops , on top of the 17,000 reinforcements already planned .
his new strategy also includes an increase of civilian personnel , and a greater focus on fighting al qaeda and the taliban , particularly along the afghan-pakistan border . european governments have welcomed obama 's new afghanistan strategy , but nato members know that obama will now expect increased contributions from them too . chancellor angela merkel has announced that germany will boost its training of police and security forces in afghanistan , but has previously ruled out an increase of combat troops . the forgotten issue somewhere down on the to-do list is climate change .
the issue is up for discussion at a meeting of the 27 european union heads of state in prague , the third stop on obama 's tour . the kyoto protocol is due to be replaced at talks in copenhagen at the end of the year , and climate change meetings are taking place across the globe in the lead-up to december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern said the us does not have a magic wand to fix the climate the obama administration made its international climate debut last weekend at un talks in bonn .
todd stern , obama 's special climate envoy , pledged to " make up for lost time " and called for more action by all nations . stern did say , however , that the us wanted to work towards a treaty that was economically " doable . "
but comments like this have some observers concerned about the united states ' commitment to fighting climate change . craig kennedy says that , despite the new administration 's rhetoric , there are doubts in europe that obama will be serious about climate change . " people look at the deficit ; people look at the pressures on the american economy , and people are starting to ask whether or not this is really going to be the highest priority , " he said . cla / sh / sms / rtr / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" finally we are on the path to a joint strategy , which will bring us joint success , " he said on tuesday , march 31 .
obama 's policy , which was unveiled last week , stresses the need to cooperate with regional players such as iran , pakistan , russia and india to tackle the deepening insurgency in the country seven years after the other throw of the taliban .
another central plank of the strategy is to boost the amount of civilian assistance to the country .
germany to increase aid to afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to expand its training program for afghan security personnel " we will have to strengthen our civilian effort , " steinmeier said , adding that it was important to find the right balance between the deployment of troops and reconstruction projects .

steinmeier also announced a " significant increase " in german financial aid for the training of afghan security forces , but he did not name any figures .
the russian foreign minister sergei lavrov expressed his country 's willingness to help .
" we need to combine the anti-terrorist measures with the socio-economic measures to rebuild afghanistan , " he said .
his dutch counterpart maxime verhagen said afghanistan and the international community were at the " crossroads . "
" we have serious choices to make and the challenge is not just eliminating individual terrorists - it is far more complex , " he said .
" what we need is a new afghan bond , a bond that unites those afghan citizens and the government , which unites afghans and their neighbors . "

in her address , clinton offered taliban fighters who renounce violence an " honorable form of reconciliation and reintegration into a peaceful society . "
" we must support efforts by the government to separate the extremists of al qaeda and the taliban from those who have joined their ranks not out of conviction , but out of desperation , " she said . afghan president hamid karzai welcomed obama 's " fresh , strong and judicious leadership " , but said his own government should take the lead in approaches to the taliban . jg / sms / dpa / ap / epd / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany and france make the case for regulation financial crisis hindering african development goals merkel , medvedev unite on market reform before g20 summit economy -pipe- 31.03.2009 assertions of g20 unity mask underlying transatlantic tensions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g20 members have different views on market regulation and stimulus packages european countries are pushing for the g20 summit to focus on revamping the global financial architecture , but clashes with the us over stimulus packages continue to overshadow their drive ahead of the meeting this week . transatlantic tensions over the focus of the summit have marked the run-up to the april 2 meeting in london , which is supposed to be a demonstration of top-level unity between the world 's leading economic powers .
european leaders have repeatedly rebuffed us pressure to plough more money into their ailing economies as part of an international effort to revive withering global demand .
the dispute turned ugly last week when czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , described the united states ' ambitious but costly economic stimulus plans as " a way to hell . "
he also said " the united states is not on the right path " with its costly stimulus plans , and insisted " we need to read the history books " to avoid the same mistakes .
the remarks sent top aides scrambling to backtrack , with one insisting topolanek never made the " hell " remark .
since then , officials have been trying to paper over transatlantic differences .
tough talking ahead but world wants unity , says brown british prime minister gordon brown said on monday that tough talking would be needed but he felt that the world 's financial powers were united in finding solutions to the crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says he will do all he can to make the summit a success " we no doubt have some long days of negotiation ahead .
these are difficult and complex problems .
it will not be easy to reach the conclusions that i believe are necessary for the world economy , " said brown , but he added that his recent series of preparatory meetings with world leaders had made him feel certain that " the world wants to come together . "
brown said he would continue to do " all i can to build consensus and to enable an agreement to take us out of this recession and put the whole world back onto a path of growth . "
" this is a decisive moment for the world economy .
we have a choice to make .
we can either let the recession take its course and retreat into isolationism and protectionism ... or resolve as a world community to fight back against the global recession that is hurting people in every country and every continent , " said brown .
obama rejects " either or " approach in an interview with the financial times published on monday , us president barack obama said it was important that the summit should deliver a " message of unity . "
he rejected the idea of an " either or approach " between financial stimulus and regulation , saying that both were needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says both stimulus and regulation are needed " we need stimulus and regulation .
we need to deal with the problems right in front of us and we also need to make sure we 're taking steps to prevent these types of breakdowns from happening again , " obama said .
with respect to the stimulus there would be an accord in london that g20 countries " will do what is necessary to promote growth and trade , " he predicted .
however , he understood the " legitimate concerns " in some countries which had already initiated significant stimulus programs and wanted first to see how they worked .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso said on friday that there was " no dichotomy between stimulating the economy and improving global financial regulation . "
" we need both if we are to get the economy moving again and to restore confidence in a lasting way , " he added europe , us both committed to stimulus measures washington is spending trillions of dollars to support its banking system and drag the world 's biggest economy out of its deepest recession in decades .
meanwhile , the 27-nation european union has committed to economic stimulus measures in 2009 and 2010 worth 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 540 billion -rrb- , equivalent to 3.3 percent of the bloc 's gross domestic product .
the figure includes both national and eu level stimulus measures as well as automatic increases in social spending , such as unemployment benefits , which kick in when the economy weakens .
in berlin , a german spokesman said there were " no points of contention here between us and the us government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin insists there is no rift between obama and merkel " for both of us , and our position has been made clear for some time , regulation of financial markets is the focus of the meeting , " the spokesman said after chancellor angela merkel and us president barack obama held a video conference on thursday .
the rift between europe and the united states over the focus of the summit has been narrowed by washington 's latest announcement for sweeping financial regulatory reforms , including a single watchdog for all key financial institutions and payment systems .
like the united states , the eu wants to clamp down on hedge funds , private equity funds and the use of complicated credit derivatives as well as offshore tax havens .
europe is also in favor of doubling the international monetary fund 's resources for bailing out troubled countries to $ 500 billion , while washington wants to go even further by tripling its funds .
it also wants colleges of supervisors for all major cross-border financial institutions to be set up before the end of 2009 in order to keep a closer eye on big international groups .
talk of tensions is overblown but rifts exist , say experts experts in transatlantic relations say that despite the desire of all the major developed and developing powers at the g20 to show a united front , differences of emphasis do exist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some european nations are against pouring more money into the economy " the obama administration has been pushing europeans to spend much more , but the europeans are baulking at that , " kati suominen , a fellow with the german marshall fund of the united states , told afp .
" particularly the bigger countries , france , germany and the current holder of the european union presidency , czech republic , have been very adamantly opposed to new spending .
so there is a little bit of a rift there . "
dan price , a former assistant to president george w. bush for international economic affairs , argued that reports of discord between nations like france and germany and the united states were " somewhat overblown . "
he pointed out that washington had acted broadly to enact crisis rescue measures since the g20 finance ministers meeting in the uk just three weeks ago .
at those talks , us treasury secretary timothy geithner said washington would provide a capital assistance program for finance firms , and outline a plan to clear toxic assets from the books of crippled banks .
" i think the united states goes into the meeting having done what it said it would do , " said price , now senior partner for global issues at sidley austin llp .

germany and france make the case for regulation financial crisis hindering african development goals merkel , medvedev unite on market reform before g20 summit economy -pipe- 31.03.2009 assertions of g20 unity mask underlying transatlantic tensions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g20 members have different views on market regulation and stimulus packages european countries are pushing for the g20 summit to focus on revamping the global financial architecture , but clashes with the us over stimulus packages continue to overshadow their drive ahead of the meeting this week . transatlantic tensions over the focus of the summit have marked the run-up to the april 2 meeting in london , which is supposed to be a demonstration of top-level unity between the world 's leading economic powers .
european leaders have repeatedly rebuffed us pressure to plough more money into their ailing economies as part of an international effort to revive withering global demand .
the dispute turned ugly last week when czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , described the united states ' ambitious but costly economic stimulus plans as " a way to hell . "
he also said " the united states is not on the right path " with its costly stimulus plans , and insisted " we need to read the history books " to avoid the same mistakes .
the remarks sent top aides scrambling to backtrack , with one insisting topolanek never made the " hell " remark .
since then , officials have been trying to paper over transatlantic differences .
tough talking ahead but world wants unity , says brown british prime minister gordon brown said on monday that tough talking would be needed but he felt that the world 's financial powers were united in finding solutions to the crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says he will do all he can to make the summit a success " we no doubt have some long days of negotiation ahead .
these are difficult and complex problems .
it will not be easy to reach the conclusions that i believe are necessary for the world economy , " said brown , but he added that his recent series of preparatory meetings with world leaders had made him feel certain that " the world wants to come together . "
brown said he would continue to do " all i can to build consensus and to enable an agreement to take us out of this recession and put the whole world back onto a path of growth . "
" this is a decisive moment for the world economy .
we have a choice to make .
we can either let the recession take its course and retreat into isolationism and protectionism ... or resolve as a world community to fight back against the global recession that is hurting people in every country and every continent , " said brown .
obama rejects " either or " approach in an interview with the financial times published on monday , us president barack obama said it was important that the summit should deliver a " message of unity . "
he rejected the idea of an " either or approach " between financial stimulus and regulation , saying that both were needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says both stimulus and regulation are needed " we need stimulus and regulation .
we need to deal with the problems right in front of us and we also need to make sure we 're taking steps to prevent these types of breakdowns from happening again , " obama said .
with respect to the stimulus there would be an accord in london that g20 countries " will do what is necessary to promote growth and trade , " he predicted .
however , he understood the " legitimate concerns " in some countries which had already initiated significant stimulus programs and wanted first to see how they worked .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso said on friday that there was " no dichotomy between stimulating the economy and improving global financial regulation . "
" we need both if we are to get the economy moving again and to restore confidence in a lasting way , " he added europe , us both committed to stimulus measures washington is spending trillions of dollars to support its banking system and drag the world 's biggest economy out of its deepest recession in decades .
meanwhile , the 27-nation european union has committed to economic stimulus measures in 2009 and 2010 worth 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 540 billion -rrb- , equivalent to 3.3 percent of the bloc 's gross domestic product .
the figure includes both national and eu level stimulus measures as well as automatic increases in social spending , such as unemployment benefits , which kick in when the economy weakens .
in berlin , a german spokesman said there were " no points of contention here between us and the us government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin insists there is no rift between obama and merkel " for both of us , and our position has been made clear for some time , regulation of financial markets is the focus of the meeting , " the spokesman said after chancellor angela merkel and us president barack obama held a video conference on thursday .
the rift between europe and the united states over the focus of the summit has been narrowed by washington 's latest announcement for sweeping financial regulatory reforms , including a single watchdog for all key financial institutions and payment systems .
like the united states , the eu wants to clamp down on hedge funds , private equity funds and the use of complicated credit derivatives as well as offshore tax havens .
europe is also in favor of doubling the international monetary fund 's resources for bailing out troubled countries to $ 500 billion , while washington wants to go even further by tripling its funds .
it also wants colleges of supervisors for all major cross-border financial institutions to be set up before the end of 2009 in order to keep a closer eye on big international groups .
talk of tensions is overblown but rifts exist , say experts experts in transatlantic relations say that despite the desire of all the major developed and developing powers at the g20 to show a united front , differences of emphasis do exist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some european nations are against pouring more money into the economy " the obama administration has been pushing europeans to spend much more , but the europeans are baulking at that , " kati suominen , a fellow with the german marshall fund of the united states , told afp .
" particularly the bigger countries , france , germany and the current holder of the european union presidency , czech republic , have been very adamantly opposed to new spending .
so there is a little bit of a rift there . "
dan price , a former assistant to president george w. bush for international economic affairs , argued that reports of discord between nations like france and germany and the united states were " somewhat overblown . "
he pointed out that washington had acted broadly to enact crisis rescue measures since the g20 finance ministers meeting in the uk just three weeks ago .
at those talks , us treasury secretary timothy geithner said washington would provide a capital assistance program for finance firms , and outline a plan to clear toxic assets from the books of crippled banks .
" i think the united states goes into the meeting having done what it said it would do , " said price , now senior partner for global issues at sidley austin llp .

brown said he would continue to do " all i can to build consensus and to enable an agreement to take us out of this recession and put the whole world back onto a path of growth . "
" this is a decisive moment for the world economy .
we have a choice to make .
we can either let the recession take its course and retreat into isolationism and protectionism ... or resolve as a world community to fight back against the global recession that is hurting people in every country and every continent , " said brown .
obama rejects " either or " approach in an interview with the financial times published on monday , us president barack obama said it was important that the summit should deliver a " message of unity . "
he rejected the idea of an " either or approach " between financial stimulus and regulation , saying that both were needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says both stimulus and regulation are needed " we need stimulus and regulation .
we need to deal with the problems right in front of us and we also need to make sure we 're taking steps to prevent these types of breakdowns from happening again , " obama said .
with respect to the stimulus there would be an accord in london that g20 countries " will do what is necessary to promote growth and trade , " he predicted .
however , he understood the " legitimate concerns " in some countries which had already initiated significant stimulus programs and wanted first to see how they worked .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso said on friday that there was " no dichotomy between stimulating the economy and improving global financial regulation . "
" we need both if we are to get the economy moving again and to restore confidence in a lasting way , " he added europe , us both committed to stimulus measures washington is spending trillions of dollars to support its banking system and drag the world 's biggest economy out of its deepest recession in decades .
meanwhile , the 27-nation european union has committed to economic stimulus measures in 2009 and 2010 worth 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 540 billion -rrb- , equivalent to 3.3 percent of the bloc 's gross domestic product .
the figure includes both national and eu level stimulus measures as well as automatic increases in social spending , such as unemployment benefits , which kick in when the economy weakens .
in berlin , a german spokesman said there were " no points of contention here between us and the us government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin insists there is no rift between obama and merkel " for both of us , and our position has been made clear for some time , regulation of financial markets is the focus of the meeting , " the spokesman said after chancellor angela merkel and us president barack obama held a video conference on thursday .
the rift between europe and the united states over the focus of the summit has been narrowed by washington 's latest announcement for sweeping financial regulatory reforms , including a single watchdog for all key financial institutions and payment systems .
like the united states , the eu wants to clamp down on hedge funds , private equity funds and the use of complicated credit derivatives as well as offshore tax havens .
europe is also in favor of doubling the international monetary fund 's resources for bailing out troubled countries to $ 500 billion , while washington wants to go even further by tripling its funds .
it also wants colleges of supervisors for all major cross-border financial institutions to be set up before the end of 2009 in order to keep a closer eye on big international groups .
talk of tensions is overblown but rifts exist , say experts experts in transatlantic relations say that despite the desire of all the major developed and developing powers at the g20 to show a united front , differences of emphasis do exist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some european nations are against pouring more money into the economy " the obama administration has been pushing europeans to spend much more , but the europeans are baulking at that , " kati suominen , a fellow with the german marshall fund of the united states , told afp .
" particularly the bigger countries , france , germany and the current holder of the european union presidency , czech republic , have been very adamantly opposed to new spending .
so there is a little bit of a rift there . "
dan price , a former assistant to president george w. bush for international economic affairs , argued that reports of discord between nations like france and germany and the united states were " somewhat overblown . "
he pointed out that washington had acted broadly to enact crisis rescue measures since the g20 finance ministers meeting in the uk just three weeks ago .
at those talks , us treasury secretary timothy geithner said washington would provide a capital assistance program for finance firms , and outline a plan to clear toxic assets from the books of crippled banks .
" i think the united states goes into the meeting having done what it said it would do , " said price , now senior partner for global issues at sidley austin llp .
" the united states will be interested to hear what the other nations will do in this regard . " nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" medvedev supported his german counterpart , adding that the g20 meeting would be the first of many meetings towards developing a new global financial system . " the g20 format does not have to provide the definitive solution , " he said .
" it should be the start of a new financial market design . " the two leaders also warned of protectionist policies implemented by some governments in response to the financial crisis . merkel said the g20 meeting must include a clear statement against protectionism . russia 's ambitious financial reform plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev heads to london with ambitious plans ahead of thursday 's summit in london , russia has come up with an ambitious plan to overhaul the entire global financial order .
medvedev even said the international community should have a say when the world 's richest countries make decisions with global implications , as in the us mortgage crisis . but analysts doubt russia 's plans will get many backers among group of 20 countries , be they established players or rising powerhouses such as brazil , india and china . economists say that while some of russia 's ideas - such as a world currency - are currently unfeasible , others it may offer will fail more due to moscow 's lack of diplomatic heft . though russia is a member of the group of eight industrial powers , it is still not among the 153 members of the world trade organization and is side-lined at meetings of group of seven finance ministers . while russia is among the top world energy producers and an undoubted political heavyweight , its economy is dwarfed by the united states and european union . amid reports that the g20 meeting may be devoted to crisis management rather than long-term reform , britain 's financial times has reported that the british foreign office has already relegated russia to the rank of second-division player . russia appears reluctant to accept this and has been talking up its reform plans for weeks . germany offers to mediate in gas dispute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : january 's gas dispute put a strain on eu-russia relations merkel also offered germany 's services on tuesday in resolving the dispute over gas between russia , and ukraine , which has made a deal to modernize its pipeline network with the european union last month . the chancellor said she would raise the issue with the european commission despite russia 's objection to the agreement . russia was angry at being left out of talks over the deal , calling the agreement an " unfriendly act . "
ukraine , however , has said its pipeline overhaul was not aimed at russia .

some 200 police officers swooped on the headquarters of cologne 's local transport company , kvb , and on offices of building firms involved in the underground project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as well as the cost to human life , the collapse of the archive wiped out a priceless collection chief state prosecutor guenther feld said frankfurt , berlin , munich , essen , duesseldorf , karlsruhe and wiesbaden were among the cities where tuesday 's raids had taken place . the cologne state prosecutor 's office is investigating on suspicion of negligent homicide and endangering a building .
feld said the raids had been necessary even though those involved had been cooperative up to now .
" we still do not suspect any individual in particular , " said the city 's top chief prosecutor . building of subway restarts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is what the scene of destruction looked like from above meanwhile , the construction of the subway line continues .
a temporary halt in building work was rescinded on tuesday , march 31 , after independent experts had inspected the building sites .
the city transport 's supervisory board has decided to retain the technical director walter reinarz -lrb- cdu -rrb- in his post while the investigations are ongoing .
reinarz has come under fire for failing to pass on important information about groundwater problems in the metro construction site near the historic archive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city 's mayor believes he has been unfairly attacked over the affair cologne mayor fritz schramma -lrb- cdu -rrb- continues to back reinarz .
on sunday , however , schramma himself announced that he would not be standing again for re-election in summer , in part because of anonymous attacks from the ranks of his own party for his handling of the crisis . the city mayor said that he had been placed under general suspicion and described the attempt to find the culprits for the disaster as a " politically motivated search for scapegoats .

dw-world : germany and france make the case for regulation dw-world : financial crisis hindering african development goals dw-world : merkel , medvedev unite on market reform before g20 summit economy -pipe- 31.03.2009 assertions of g20 unity mask underlying transatlantic tensions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g20 members have different views on market regulation and stimulus packages european countries are pushing for the g20 summit to focus on revamping the global financial architecture , but clashes with the us over stimulus packages continue to overshadow their drive ahead of the meeting this week . transatlantic tensions over the focus of the summit have marked the run-up to the april 2 meeting in london , which is supposed to be a demonstration of top-level unity between the world 's leading economic powers .
european leaders have repeatedly rebuffed us pressure to plough more money into their ailing economies as part of an international effort to revive withering global demand .
the dispute turned ugly last week when czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , described the united states ' ambitious but costly economic stimulus plans as " a way to hell . "
he also said " the united states is not on the right path " with its costly stimulus plans , and insisted " we need to read the history books " to avoid the same mistakes .
the remarks sent top aides scrambling to backtrack , with one insisting topolanek never made the " hell " remark .
since then , officials have been trying to paper over transatlantic differences .
tough talking ahead but world wants unity , says brown british prime minister gordon brown said on monday that tough talking would be needed but he felt that the world 's financial powers were united in finding solutions to the crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown says he will do all he can to make the summit a success " we no doubt have some long days of negotiation ahead .
these are difficult and complex problems .
it will not be easy to reach the conclusions that i believe are necessary for the world economy , " said brown , but he added that his recent series of preparatory meetings with world leaders had made him feel certain that " the world wants to come together . "
brown said he would continue to do " all i can to build consensus and to enable an agreement to take us out of this recession and put the whole world back onto a path of growth . "
" this is a decisive moment for the world economy .
we have a choice to make .
we can either let the recession take its course and retreat into isolationism and protectionism ... or resolve as a world community to fight back against the global recession that is hurting people in every country and every continent , " said brown .
obama rejects " either or " approach in an interview with the financial times published on monday , us president barack obama said it was important that the summit should deliver a " message of unity . "
he rejected the idea of an " either or approach " between financial stimulus and regulation , saying that both were needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says both stimulus and regulation are needed " we need stimulus and regulation .
we need to deal with the problems right in front of us and we also need to make sure we 're taking steps to prevent these types of breakdowns from happening again , " obama said .
with respect to the stimulus there would be an accord in london that g20 countries " will do what is necessary to promote growth and trade , " he predicted .
however , he understood the " legitimate concerns " in some countries which had already initiated significant stimulus programs and wanted first to see how they worked .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso said on friday that there was " no dichotomy between stimulating the economy and improving global financial regulation . "
" we need both if we are to get the economy moving again and to restore confidence in a lasting way , " he added europe , us both committed to stimulus measures washington is spending trillions of dollars to support its banking system and drag the world 's biggest economy out of its deepest recession in decades .
meanwhile , the 27-nation european union has committed to economic stimulus measures in 2009 and 2010 worth 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 540 billion -rrb- , equivalent to 3.3 percent of the bloc 's gross domestic product .
the figure includes both national and eu level stimulus measures as well as automatic increases in social spending , such as unemployment benefits , which kick in when the economy weakens .
in berlin , a german spokesman said there were " no points of contention here between us and the us government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin insists there is no rift between obama and merkel " for both of us , and our position has been made clear for some time , regulation of financial markets is the focus of the meeting , " the spokesman said after chancellor angela merkel and us president barack obama held a video conference on thursday .
the rift between europe and the united states over the focus of the summit has been narrowed by washington 's latest announcement for sweeping financial regulatory reforms , including a single watchdog for all key financial institutions and payment systems .
like the united states , the eu wants to clamp down on hedge funds , private equity funds and the use of complicated credit derivatives as well as offshore tax havens .
europe is also in favor of doubling the international monetary fund 's resources for bailing out troubled countries to $ 500 billion , while washington wants to go even further by tripling its funds .
it also wants colleges of supervisors for all major cross-border financial institutions to be set up before the end of 2009 in order to keep a closer eye on big international groups .
talk of tensions is overblown but rifts exist , say experts experts in transatlantic relations say that despite the desire of all the major developed and developing powers at the g20 to show a united front , differences of emphasis do exist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some european nations are against pouring more money into the economy " the obama administration has been pushing europeans to spend much more , but the europeans are baulking at that , " kati suominen , a fellow with the german marshall fund of the united states , told afp .
" particularly the bigger countries , france , germany and the current holder of the european union presidency , czech republic , have been very adamantly opposed to new spending .
so there is a little bit of a rift there . "
dan price , a former assistant to president george w. bush for international economic affairs , argued that reports of discord between nations like france and germany and the united states were " somewhat overblown . "
he pointed out that washington had acted broadly to enact crisis rescue measures since the g20 finance ministers meeting in the uk just three weeks ago .
at those talks , us treasury secretary timothy geithner said washington would provide a capital assistance program for finance firms , and outline a plan to clear toxic assets from the books of crippled banks .
" i think the united states goes into the meeting having done what it said it would do , " said price , now senior partner for global issues at sidley austin llp .
" the united states will be interested to hear what the other nations will do in this regard . " nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

advertisement this school in porthmadog , gwynedd was highlighted for its good practice in teaching reading and writing primary school pupils in wales are not making enough progress in reading and writing , the inspection body estyn says .
it found the proportion of five to seven-year-olds with good levels of reading and writing has stopped rising over the past five years .
estyn said more schools need to adopt best practice to improve young pupils ' skills in both english and welsh .
the assembly government said it " could not afford to be complacent " .
the report found the overall quality of teaching in english and welsh of most five to seven-year-olds is good .

estyn inspectors visited around 400 primary schools between 2005-2008 , looking at the teaching of the four strands of language : listening , speaking , reading and writing on the basis that the strands are interrelated and develop together .
education experts say a pupil 's difficulty with listening and speaking , known as oracy , limits progress in learning to read and write .
estyn said by the age of seven , the gap between boys ' and girls ' performance is almost three times wider than in maths and science .
the slow rate at which boys develop reading and writing skills is recognised as one of the contributory factors that lead to an even wider gender gap later on in learning .
good practice case study idea : " real world " writing experiences for pupils , taken up by a large primary school in swansea strategy : year 2 pupils taken to a cafe , where they met the owner , customers , tried on the uniforms , tasted food result : " high quality " writing , with pupils gaining and using a wider vocabulary inspectors found that this gap can be greatly reduced if teachers understand the characteristics and behaviours of individual boys very well and adapt their teaching to meet boys ' learning needs .
the report found the percentage of seven-year-old pupils achieving at least level 2 -lrb- an expected attainment level -rrb- in english and welsh has remained at a similar level since 2000 .
in 2008 , around one in five primary pupils did not achieve the level expected of the great majority .
the report said : " when pupils have limited oral skills , this has a direct effect on their early progress in developing reading and writing skills .
" improving pupils ' oracy skills must therefore be a vital component of schools ' work to raise standards of reading and writing . "
the service 's chief inspector , dr bill maxwell , said schools in wales had helped standards to improve in english and welsh with a focus ten years ago on improving the planning and teaching of reading .
he said many schools needed to focus on areas which included improving pupils ' oracy skills and developing pupils ' reading and writing skills in their subject studies .
dr maxwell also said schools should look at improving provision for more able and talented pupils and focusing more strongly on improving pupils ' writing skills .
he said : " being able to read and write accurately , fluently and with confidence and understanding is crucial not only for achieving high standards in english and welsh , but also for giving pupils more opportunities for success in all subjects . "
' literacy ' a welsh assembly government spokesperson said : " it is pleasing to note that the inspectorate has confirmed that many pupils gain good reading and writing skills in english and welsh as a first language that enable them to progress well in their learning .
" our foundation phase places a firm emphasis on language , literacy and communication skills to support the development of children 's skills in speaking , listening , reading , writing and communicating .
" the findings will be especially relevant to practitioners engaged in the roll-out of the foundation phase .
" although we are making good progress in this area we ca n't afford to be complacent .
the findings will inform wider initiatives to improve literacy . "

advertisement this school in porthmadog , gwynedd was highlighted for its good practice in teaching reading and writing primary school pupils in wales are not making enough progress in reading and writing , the inspection body estyn says .
it found the proportion of five to seven-year-olds with good levels of reading and writing has stopped rising over the past five years .
estyn said more schools need to adopt best practice to improve young pupils ' skills in both english and welsh .
the assembly government said it " could not afford to be complacent " .
the report found the overall quality of teaching in english and welsh of most five to seven-year-olds is good .

estyn inspectors visited around 400 primary schools between 2005-2008 , looking at the teaching of the four strands of language : listening , speaking , reading and writing on the basis that the strands are interrelated and develop together .
education experts say a pupil 's difficulty with listening and speaking , known as oracy , limits progress in learning to read and write .
estyn said by the age of seven , the gap between boys ' and girls ' performance is almost three times wider than in maths and science .
the slow rate at which boys develop reading and writing skills is recognised as one of the contributory factors that lead to an even wider gender gap later on in learning .
good practice case study idea : " real world " writing experiences for pupils , taken up by a large primary school in swansea strategy : year 2 pupils taken to a cafe , where they met the owner , customers , tried on the uniforms , tasted food result : " high quality " writing , with pupils gaining and using a wider vocabulary inspectors found that this gap can be greatly reduced if teachers understand the characteristics and behaviours of individual boys very well and adapt their teaching to meet boys ' learning needs .
the report found the percentage of seven-year-old pupils achieving at least level 2 -lrb- an expected attainment level -rrb- in english and welsh has remained at a similar level since 2000 .
in 2008 , around one in five primary pupils did not achieve the level expected of the great majority .
the report said : " when pupils have limited oral skills , this has a direct effect on their early progress in developing reading and writing skills .
" improving pupils ' oracy skills must therefore be a vital component of schools ' work to raise standards of reading and writing . "
the service 's chief inspector , dr bill maxwell , said schools in wales had helped standards to improve in english and welsh with a focus ten years ago on improving the planning and teaching of reading .
he said many schools needed to focus on areas which included improving pupils ' oracy skills and developing pupils ' reading and writing skills in their subject studies .
dr maxwell also said schools should look at improving provision for more able and talented pupils and focusing more strongly on improving pupils ' writing skills .

a beaufort omnibus poll for bbc wales asked at what age children should have their first mobile phone .
a total of 23 % of parents said they would let a child under 10 have a mobile , with 42 % saying 11 or under .
suzie hayman from parentline plus said some under-10s having a mobile was a " positively good thing " .
in the poll , which sampled 1,002 people between 6-15 march 2009 , a fifth of parents -lrb- 19 % -rrb- indicated that 11 is the right age to have one 's first mobile phone .
another 18 % considered 12 the right age , suggesting that 60 % of parents in wales are prepared to equip a child with a mobile phone by the end of their first year in secondary school -lrb- year 7 -rrb- .
at what age should children have their first mobile phone ? "
children at primary school have absolutely no need for a mobile phone .
they should be spending their time there learning how to spell correctly , add up correctly and read correctly - skills sadly lacking in this generation .
a mobile phone at too young an age is nothing more than a distraction and as some others have already pointed out , a very expensive toy " j s mitchell , london one in 10 parents -lrb- 11 % -rrb- said children should be aged 16 or over before they have their first mobile phone .
cheryl wheldon , president of head teachers ' union naht cymru , said the results of the survey reflected her experience as head teacher at coedffranc primary school in neath .
" i think these figures are right , " she said .
" the majority of the children in the 7-11-year-old group here have got a mobile phone , or access to one . "
ms wheldon explained that her school had experienced " some issues arising from bullying through text messages " . "
there are lots of ways in which a parents can set down guidelines for their children " suzie hayman , parentline plus " eighteen months ago we had a nasty incident with 10-11-year-olds texting each other quite nastily after school .
" it was quite a difficult issue to address .
i spoke to the pupils and their parents and it was only through their help that i could deal with it . "
for this and other reasons , she explained , coedffranc has banned pupils from bringing in mobiles .

ms hayman said her organisation gets " a lot of calls from parents " on the subject of children having mobile phones .

" young people are slightly more independent at that age , and have to stay for after-school clubs and so on .

she said : " if a child 's father , for example , does not live with the family , then having a mobile can allow the child to regulate when they get to speak to him , and that is a positively good thing ; very much so with children under 10 .

a beaufort omnibus poll for bbc wales asked at what age children should have their first mobile phone .
a total of 23 % of parents said they would let a child under 10 have a mobile , with 42 % saying 11 or under .
suzie hayman from parentline plus said some under-10s having a mobile was a " positively good thing " .
in the poll , which sampled 1,002 people between 6-15 march 2009 , a fifth of parents -lrb- 19 % -rrb- indicated that 11 is the right age to have one 's first mobile phone .

cheryl wheldon , president of head teachers ' union naht cymru , said the results of the survey reflected her experience as head teacher at coedffranc primary school in neath .

a beaufort omnibus poll for bbc wales asked at what age children should have their first mobile phone .
a total of 23 % of parents said they would let a child under 10 have a mobile , with 42 % saying 11 or under .
suzie hayman from parentline plus said some under-10s having a mobile was a " positively good thing " .
in the poll , which sampled 1,002 people between 6-15 march 2009 , a fifth of parents -lrb- 19 % -rrb- indicated that 11 is the right age to have one 's first mobile phone .
another 18 % considered 12 the right age , suggesting that 60 % of parents in wales are prepared to equip a child with a mobile phone by the end of their first year in secondary school -lrb- year 7 -rrb- .
at what age should children have their first mobile phone ?
children at primary school have absolutely no need for a mobile phone .
they should be spending their time there learning how to spell correctly , add up correctly and read correctly - skills sadly lacking in this generation .
a mobile phone at too young an age is nothing more than a distraction and as some others have already pointed out , a very expensive toy j s mitchell , london one in 10 parents -lrb- 11 % -rrb- said children should be aged 16 or over before they have their first mobile phone .
cheryl wheldon , president of head teachers ' union naht cymru , said the results of the survey reflected her experience as head teacher at coedffranc primary school in neath .
" i think these figures are right , " she said .
" the majority of the children in the 7-11-year-old group here have got a mobile phone , or access to one . "
ms wheldon explained that her school had experienced " some issues arising from bullying through text messages " .
there are lots of ways in which a parents can set down guidelines for their children suzie hayman , parentline plus " eighteen months ago we had a nasty incident with 10-11-year-olds texting each other quite nastily after school .
" it was quite a difficult issue to address .
i spoke to the pupils and their parents and it was only through their help that i could deal with it . "
for this and other reasons , she explained , coedffranc has banned pupils from bringing in mobiles .
" the policy at our school is that they should not bring them in .
the issues are theft , misplacement , damage and , more to the point , it 's a question of mobile phones going off in the middle of a lesson , " she said .
" young children having a mobile is a good thing and a bad thing .
safety does come into it .

bbc wales asks at what age a child should have a mobile phone ms hayman said her organisation gets " a lot of calls from parents " on the subject of children having mobile phones .
" it 's generally considered appropriate for a child to have a mobile at secondary school level , " she said .
" young people are slightly more independent at that age , and have to stay for after-school clubs and so on .
parents want to know they have a link to them . "
however , ms hayman added that she would encourage children in divided families to have a mobile phone at a younger age .
she said : " if a child 's father , for example , does not live with the family , then having a mobile can allow the child to regulate when they get to speak to him , and that is a positively good thing ; very much so with children under 10 .
" clearly there are issues about being mugged , running up enormous phone bills and cyber-bullying , but what we do is help parents manage these issues rather than just banning the use of a mobile phone .

conficker has infected up to 15 million computers to date and is set to change the way it works on wednesday .
there have been some reports the worm could trigger poisoned machines to access personal files , send spam , clog networks or crash sites .
" we do n't know what will happen but do n't expect anything dramatic , " symantec 's vincent weafer told the bbc .
he added : " we believe the software is geared towards making money .
the characteristic of this type of worm is to keep it slow and low , keep it under the radar to slowly maximise profits over the long term . "
from the today programme more from today programme q & a : how do i protect myself ?
timeline : conficker virus mr weafer , vice-president of security response at anti-virus firm symantec , said : " we are going to be on high alert for a long time .
come 2 april we will still be watching while most people will have moved their focus elsewhere . "
origins conficker , also known as downadup or kido , first appeared last november .
the worm is self-replicating and has attacked a vulnerability in machines using microsoft 's windows operating system , the software that runs most computers .
it can infect machines via a net connection or by hiding on usb memory drives used to ferry data from one computer to another .
once in a computer , it digs deeps , setting up defences making it hard to extract .
among those affected by the virus have been the house of commons and the defence forces of the uk , germany and france .
the reason for the hype and the concern around conficker is that 1 april is the day the worm is set to change the way it updates itself , moving to a system that is much harder to combat .
five months ago a consortium of web security firms banded together to form the conficker working group , to learn more about the worm and to try to stop it .
last weekend the team located what they call a " fingerprint " or " signature " for the virus that means they can detect how an infected machine can be identified on a network much quicker than previously .
security researcher dan kaminsky , a member of the group and director of penetration testing at ioactive , told the bbc this was a major breakthrough .
" we know these bad guys are in places they really should n't be .
with this new trick it is much easier to find them .
it means we can say , ok , i do n't know what will happen but i can tell you 10,000 systems are under the control of the bad guys and here they are . "
lucrative while no-one in the industry is 100 % sure of the aim of conficker , they are positive the people behind it are more concerned about making money than causing mayhem .
that is a view backed by pc magazine editor-in-chief lance ulanoff .
" people write malware today not because they want to make a public splash .
it 's old school to want to make computer screens turn red and say love bug .
" today crime syndicates run these things because they are interested in making money and if they are not making money there is no point in it . "
a recent report by security firm finjan claimed that cybercrime is as lucrative a business as drug trafficking .
its cybercrime intelligence report found that a single hacker could make as much as $ 10,800 -lrb- £ 7,300 -rrb- a day , which the company extrapolated to $ 3.9m -lrb- £ 2.6m -rrb- a year .
finjan 's chief technology officer yuval ben-itzhak said : " cybercrime today is a very , very big business and those behind conficker have spent a lot of money organising , writing code and securing these machines so they will be looking for a return soon .
" this type of cybercrime activity is here to stay and will grow because there is so much money involved and its hard to get caught . "
" arms race " in february microsoft put up a bounty of $ 250,000 to anyone who could help identify those behind conficker .
it also issued patches to address the vulnerability .
industry experts say consumers and companies should regularly update their security software and apply windows updates as well as protect computers and files with strong passwords .
symantec has issued a free trial version of its products that will detect and remove the worm .
verisign , one of the guardians of the networked world , believes these bugs exist because the general level of security is just not high enough .
" this is a testament to making consumer products useable and user friendly , which means security has to be relaxed a little , " said verisign 's chief technology officer ken silva .
" if all the security measures were deployed that should be deployed , they would become too annoying and too difficult for most consumers . "
many in the industry describe conficker as one of the worst worms they have seen for years and certainly one of the more aggressive .
" this is an arms race , " said mr kaminsky .
" we have to find these guys .
we have done it in the past .
i can do what i can as a geek but there is as much need for law enforcement and state action as there is for technical creativity .
" but people should feel good because the good guys are working to stop these bad guys . "

timeline : conficker virus mr weafer , vice-president of security response at anti-virus firm symantec , said : " we are going to be on high alert for a long time .
come 2 april we will still be watching while most people will have moved their focus elsewhere . "
origins conficker , also known as downadup or kido , first appeared last november .
the worm is self-replicating and has attacked a vulnerability in machines using microsoft 's windows operating system , the software that runs most computers .
it can infect machines via a net connection or by hiding on usb memory drives used to ferry data from one computer to another .
once in a computer , it digs deeps , setting up defences making it hard to extract .
microsoft put up $ 250,000 to catch those behind conficker among those affected by the virus have been the house of commons and the defence forces of the uk , germany and france .
the reason for the hype and the concern around conficker is that 1 april is the day the worm is set to change the way it updates itself , moving to a system that is much harder to combat .
five months ago a consortium of web security firms banded together to form the conficker working group , to learn more about the worm and to try to stop it .
last weekend the team located what they call a " fingerprint " or " signature " for the virus that means they can detect how an infected machine can be identified on a network much quicker than previously .
security researcher dan kaminsky , a member of the group and director of penetration testing at ioactive , told the bbc this was a major breakthrough .
" we know these bad guys are in places they really should n't be .
with this new trick it is much easier to find them .
it means we can say , ok , i do n't know what will happen but i can tell you 10,000 systems are under the control of the bad guys and here they are . "
lucrative while no-one in the industry is 100 % sure of the aim of conficker , they are positive the people behind it are more concerned about making money than causing mayhem .
that is a view backed by pc magazine editor-in-chief lance ulanoff .
" people write malware today not because they want to make a public splash .
it 's old school to want to make computer screens turn red and say love bug .
the worm has also been able to spread via usb flash drives .
" today crime syndicates run these things because they are interested in making money and if they are not making money there is no point in it . "
a recent report by security firm finjan claimed that cybercrime is as lucrative a business as drug trafficking .
its cybercrime intelligence report found that a single hacker could make as much as $ 10,800 -lrb- £ 7,300 -rrb- a day , which the company extrapolated to $ 3.9m -lrb- £ 2.6m -rrb- a year .
finjan 's chief technology officer yuval ben-itzhak said : " cybercrime today is a very , very big business and those behind conficker have spent a lot of money organising , writing code and securing these machines so they will be looking for a return soon .
" this type of cybercrime activity is here to stay and will grow because there is so much money involved and its hard to get caught . "
" arms race " in february microsoft put up a bounty of $ 250,000 to anyone who could help identify those behind conficker .
it also issued patches to address the vulnerability .
industry experts say consumers and companies should regularly update their security software and apply windows updates as well as protect computers and files with strong passwords .
conficker is an aggressive worm that has crawled into millions of machines symantec has issued a free trial version of its products that will detect and remove the worm .
verisign , one of the guardians of the networked world , believes these bugs exist because the general level of security is just not high enough .
" this is a testament to making consumer products useable and user friendly , which means security has to be relaxed a little , " said verisign 's chief technology officer ken silva .
" if all the security measures were deployed that should be deployed , they would become too annoying and too difficult for most consumers . "
many in the industry describe conficker as one of the worst worms they have seen for years and certainly one of the more aggressive .
" this is an arms race , " said mr kaminsky .
" we have to find these guys .
we have done it in the past .
i can do what i can as a geek but there is as much need for law enforcement and state action as there is for technical creativity .
" but people should feel good because the good guys are working to stop these bad guys . "

timeline : conficker virus mr weafer , vice-president of security response at anti-virus firm symantec , said : " we are going to be on high alert for a long time .
come 2 april we will still be watching while most people will have moved their focus elsewhere . "
origins conficker , also known as downadup or kido , first appeared last november .
the worm is self-replicating and has attacked a vulnerability in machines using microsoft 's windows operating system , the software that runs most computers .
it can infect machines via a net connection or by hiding on usb memory drives used to ferry data from one computer to another .
once in a computer , it digs deeps , setting up defences making it hard to extract .
microsoft put up $ 250,000 to catch those behind conficker among those affected by the virus have been the house of commons and the defence forces of the uk , germany and france .
the reason for the hype and the concern around conficker is that 1 april is the day the worm is set to change the way it updates itself , moving to a system that is much harder to combat .
five months ago a consortium of web security firms banded together to form the conficker working group , to learn more about the worm and to try to stop it .
last weekend the team located what they call a " fingerprint " or " signature " for the virus that means they can detect how an infected machine can be identified on a network much quicker than previously .
security researcher dan kaminsky , a member of the group and director of penetration testing at ioactive , told the bbc this was a major breakthrough .
" we know these bad guys are in places they really should n't be .

lucrative while no-one in the industry is 100 % sure of the aim of conficker , they are positive the people behind it are more concerned about making money than causing mayhem .
that is a view backed by pc magazine editor-in-chief lance ulanoff .

the worm has also been able to spread via usb flash drives .
" today crime syndicates run these things because they are interested in making money and if they are not making money there is no point in it . "
a recent report by security firm finjan claimed that cybercrime is as lucrative a business as drug trafficking .
its cybercrime intelligence report found that a single hacker could make as much as $ 10,800 -lrb- £ 7,300 -rrb- a day , which the company extrapolated to $ 3.9m -lrb- £ 2.6m -rrb- a year .
finjan 's chief technology officer yuval ben-itzhak said : " cybercrime today is a very , very big business and those behind conficker have spent a lot of money organising , writing code and securing these machines so they will be looking for a return soon .
" this type of cybercrime activity is here to stay and will grow because there is so much money involved and its hard to get caught . "

industry experts say consumers and companies should regularly update their security software and apply windows updates as well as protect computers and files with strong passwords .
conficker is an aggressive worm that has crawled into millions of machines symantec has issued a free trial version of its products that will detect and remove the worm .
verisign , one of the guardians of the networked world , believes these bugs exist because the general level of security is just not high enough .

ask internet users what they want from their service and 99 times out of 100 the answer will be the same : more - more speed , more bandwidth and more flexibility of use .
nobody knows this better than internet infrastructure providers , who for years have devoted the vast majority of their development budgets to meeting consumer demands for faster , more flexible networks .
security has often been an afterthought .
for the most part , this market-driven approach has been a boon to the internet and its users , but recent events have begun to illustrate the dangers of this single-minded focus .
the openness and interconnectedness that are the internet 's hallmarks ensure that there will always be vulnerabilities for attackers to exploit .
in the past couple of years , two serious incidents have sent ripples throughout the global internet , causing real damage and painting a troubling picture of vulnerabilities that could someday bring this vital engine of commerce and communication to a grinding halt , imperilling billions of dollars in commerce and worse , as the internet becomes an ever more critical component of our daily lives .
the simple truth is that our global investment in the security and stability of the internet has not kept pace with our relentless pursuit of greater speed and flexibility .
if we do n't correct this growing imbalance , and soon , we face the possibility of a global online incident , the impact of which could be felt for years to come .
in april 2007 , a spat between estonia and russia over a soviet-era war memorial erupted into what has been described as the first modern " cyber war " as russian-based attackers effectively took the entire nation of estonia offline for a period of weeks .
in february 2008 , the pakistani government , responding to an anti-islamic video clip appearing on youtube , unintentionally set in motion a series of events that prevented most of the world 's internet users from visiting the site - one of the internet 's most popular - for a period of hours .
perhaps the most remarkable thing about both of these incidents is how unremarkable they were - at least from a technical standpoint .
silva : more can be done to secure the open internet although remarkably well coordinated , the estonian attack was not the largest ever recorded , nor was it particularly novel in its methods .
more than anything , the incident demonstrates just how damaging even a " typical " attack can be when timed properly to strike vulnerable targets .
as is the case in the hundreds of similar attacks that take place each day , the perpetrators harnessed the power of corrupted personal computers to swamp their targets in a sea of bogus internet traffic , effectively cutting off whole neighborhoods of the estonian internet from legitimate traffic .
millions of these infected " zombie " computers exist .
used in concert , they can generate attacks that few systems on earth are capable of withstanding .
the pakistan-youtube incident was even more commonplace - the result of two seemingly benign errors and a quirk in an internet protocol designed at a time when most of the global network ran on trust and virtual handshakes .
the details of the incident are less important than the fact that the circumstances that allowed it to occur remain unchanged , as do scores of similar vulnerabilities endemic to the internet 's open architecture .
the message is that these sorts of incidents can - and almost certainly will - happen again .
and if history tells us anything , it 's that the next time will be worse .
more powerful computers hooked up to more robust internet connections translate into more severe and disruptive attacks .
also , as we rely on the internet to a greater and greater extent , the likelihood that such an incident will cause real harm to our lives and livelihoods only increases .
many home computers are part of zombie networks it would be wrong to suggest that this is entirely preventable .
the openness and interconnectedness that are the internet 's hallmarks ensure that there will always be vulnerabilities for attackers to exploit .
but we can do a much , much better job of securing the critical internet infrastructure on which we all rely .
stability and security must become a higher priority for everyone involved in the development and stewardship of the global internet .
companies may not be able to monetise security in the same way that they monetise speed , but nobody in this space can afford to remain ignorant of the costs associated with getting it wrong .
the " choice " between speed and flexibility on one hand , and stability and security on the other is more a product of cost than anything else .
the cost of providing secure , stable network infrastructure is equal to , and in some cases , greater than the cost of increasing network speeds .

ask internet users what they want from their service and 99 times out of 100 the answer will be the same : more - more speed , more bandwidth and more flexibility of use .
nobody knows this better than internet infrastructure providers , who for years have devoted the vast majority of their development budgets to meeting consumer demands for faster , more flexible networks .
security has often been an afterthought .
for the most part , this market-driven approach has been a boon to the internet and its users , but recent events have begun to illustrate the dangers of this single-minded focus .
the openness and interconnectedness that are the internet 's hallmarks ensure that there will always be vulnerabilities for attackers to exploit .
in the past couple of years , two serious incidents have sent ripples throughout the global internet , causing real damage and painting a troubling picture of vulnerabilities that could someday bring this vital engine of commerce and communication to a grinding halt , imperilling billions of dollars in commerce and worse , as the internet becomes an ever more critical component of our daily lives .
the simple truth is that our global investment in the security and stability of the internet has not kept pace with our relentless pursuit of greater speed and flexibility .
if we do n't correct this growing imbalance , and soon , we face the possibility of a global online incident , the impact of which could be felt for years to come .
in april 2007 , a spat between estonia and russia over a soviet-era war memorial erupted into what has been described as the first modern " cyber war " as russian-based attackers effectively took the entire nation of estonia offline for a period of weeks .
in february 2008 , the pakistani government , responding to an anti-islamic video clip appearing on youtube , unintentionally set in motion a series of events that prevented most of the world 's internet users from visiting the site - one of the internet 's most popular - for a period of hours .
perhaps the most remarkable thing about both of these incidents is how unremarkable they were - at least from a technical standpoint .
silva : more can be done to secure the open internet although remarkably well coordinated , the estonian attack was not the largest ever recorded , nor was it particularly novel in its methods .
more than anything , the incident demonstrates just how damaging even a " typical " attack can be when timed properly to strike vulnerable targets .
as is the case in the hundreds of similar attacks that take place each day , the perpetrators harnessed the power of corrupted personal computers to swamp their targets in a sea of bogus internet traffic , effectively cutting off whole neighborhoods of the estonian internet from legitimate traffic .
millions of these infected " zombie " computers exist .
used in concert , they can generate attacks that few systems on earth are capable of withstanding .
the pakistan-youtube incident was even more commonplace - the result of two seemingly benign errors and a quirk in an internet protocol designed at a time when most of the global network ran on trust and virtual handshakes .
the details of the incident are less important than the fact that the circumstances that allowed it to occur remain unchanged , as do scores of similar vulnerabilities endemic to the internet 's open architecture .
the message is that these sorts of incidents can - and almost certainly will - happen again .
and if history tells us anything , it 's that the next time will be worse .
more powerful computers hooked up to more robust internet connections translate into more severe and disruptive attacks .
also , as we rely on the internet to a greater and greater extent , the likelihood that such an incident will cause real harm to our lives and livelihoods only increases .
many home computers are part of zombie networks it would be wrong to suggest that this is entirely preventable .
the openness and interconnectedness that are the internet 's hallmarks ensure that there will always be vulnerabilities for attackers to exploit .
but we can do a much , much better job of securing the critical internet infrastructure on which we all rely .
stability and security must become a higher priority for everyone involved in the development and stewardship of the global internet .
companies may not be able to monetise security in the same way that they monetise speed , but nobody in this space can afford to remain ignorant of the costs associated with getting it wrong .
the " choice " between speed and flexibility on one hand , and stability and security on the other is more a product of cost than anything else .
the cost of providing secure , stable network infrastructure is equal to , and in some cases , greater than the cost of increasing network speeds .

ask internet users what they want from their service and 99 times out of 100 the answer will be the same : more - more speed , more bandwidth and more flexibility of use .
nobody knows this better than internet infrastructure providers , who for years have devoted the vast majority of their development budgets to meeting consumer demands for faster , more flexible networks .
security has often been an afterthought .
for the most part , this market-driven approach has been a boon to the internet and its users , but recent events have begun to illustrate the dangers of this single-minded focus .
the openness and interconnectedness that are the internet 's hallmarks ensure that there will always be vulnerabilities for attackers to exploit .
in the past couple of years , two serious incidents have sent ripples throughout the global internet , causing real damage and painting a troubling picture of vulnerabilities that could someday bring this vital engine of commerce and communication to a grinding halt , imperilling billions of dollars in commerce and worse , as the internet becomes an ever more critical component of our daily lives .
the simple truth is that our global investment in the security and stability of the internet has not kept pace with our relentless pursuit of greater speed and flexibility .
if we do n't correct this growing imbalance , and soon , we face the possibility of a global online incident , the impact of which could be felt for years to come .
in april 2007 , a spat between estonia and russia over a soviet-era war memorial erupted into what has been described as the first modern " cyber war " as russian-based attackers effectively took the entire nation of estonia offline for a period of weeks .
in february 2008 , the pakistani government , responding to an anti-islamic video clip appearing on youtube , unintentionally set in motion a series of events that prevented most of the world 's internet users from visiting the site - one of the internet 's most popular - for a period of hours .
perhaps the most remarkable thing about both of these incidents is how unremarkable they were - at least from a technical standpoint .
silva : more can be done to secure the open internet although remarkably well coordinated , the estonian attack was not the largest ever recorded , nor was it particularly novel in its methods .
more than anything , the incident demonstrates just how damaging even a " typical " attack can be when timed properly to strike vulnerable targets .
as is the case in the hundreds of similar attacks that take place each day , the perpetrators harnessed the power of corrupted personal computers to swamp their targets in a sea of bogus internet traffic , effectively cutting off whole neighborhoods of the estonian internet from legitimate traffic .
millions of these infected " zombie " computers exist .
used in concert , they can generate attacks that few systems on earth are capable of withstanding .
the pakistan-youtube incident was even more commonplace - the result of two seemingly benign errors and a quirk in an internet protocol designed at a time when most of the global network ran on trust and virtual handshakes .
the details of the incident are less important than the fact that the circumstances that allowed it to occur remain unchanged , as do scores of similar vulnerabilities endemic to the internet 's open architecture .
the message is that these sorts of incidents can - and almost certainly will - happen again .
and if history tells us anything , it 's that the next time will be worse .
more powerful computers hooked up to more robust internet connections translate into more severe and disruptive attacks .
also , as we rely on the internet to a greater and greater extent , the likelihood that such an incident will cause real harm to our lives and livelihoods only increases .
many home computers are part of zombie networks it would be wrong to suggest that this is entirely preventable .
the openness and interconnectedness that are the internet 's hallmarks ensure that there will always be vulnerabilities for attackers to exploit .
but we can do a much , much better job of securing the critical internet infrastructure on which we all rely .
stability and security must become a higher priority for everyone involved in the development and stewardship of the global internet .
companies may not be able to monetise security in the same way that they monetise speed , but nobody in this space can afford to remain ignorant of the costs associated with getting it wrong .
the " choice " between speed and flexibility on one hand , and stability and security on the other is more a product of cost than anything else .
the cost of providing secure , stable network infrastructure is equal to , and in some cases , greater than the cost of increasing network speeds .
the good news is that there is n't , for the most part , a fundamental technological tension between flexibility and stability on the internet .
indeed , one of the most critical components of stability - excess capacity - is also essential to providing greater speed and flexibility .
this challenge does n't require technological breakthroughs or dramatic paradigm shifts .
we know what needs to be done if we are to bring the security and stability of this global network up to par with its stunning speed and flexibility .
the choice is so simple that it is n't a choice at all : invest the time and resources necessary to safeguard the internet against known dangers , or face the sort of failure that could permanently change the face of the internet for the worse .

ask internet users what they want from their service and 99 times out of 100 the answer will be the same : more - more speed , more bandwidth and more flexibility of use .
nobody knows this better than internet infrastructure providers , who for years have devoted the vast majority of their development budgets to meeting consumer demands for faster , more flexible networks .
security has often been an afterthought .
for the most part , this market-driven approach has been a boon to the internet and its users , but recent events have begun to illustrate the dangers of this single-minded focus .
the openness and interconnectedness that are the internet 's hallmarks ensure that there will always be vulnerabilities for attackers to exploit .
in the past couple of years , two serious incidents have sent ripples throughout the global internet , causing real damage and painting a troubling picture of vulnerabilities that could someday bring this vital engine of commerce and communication to a grinding halt , imperilling billions of dollars in commerce and worse , as the internet becomes an ever more critical component of our daily lives .
the simple truth is that our global investment in the security and stability of the internet has not kept pace with our relentless pursuit of greater speed and flexibility .
if we do n't correct this growing imbalance , and soon , we face the possibility of a global online incident , the impact of which could be felt for years to come .
in april 2007 , a spat between estonia and russia over a soviet-era war memorial erupted into what has been described as the first modern " cyber war " as russian-based attackers effectively took the entire nation of estonia offline for a period of weeks .
in february 2008 , the pakistani government , responding to an anti-islamic video clip appearing on youtube , unintentionally set in motion a series of events that prevented most of the world 's internet users from visiting the site - one of the internet 's most popular - for a period of hours .
perhaps the most remarkable thing about both of these incidents is how unremarkable they were - at least from a technical standpoint .
silva : more can be done to secure the open internet although remarkably well coordinated , the estonian attack was not the largest ever recorded , nor was it particularly novel in its methods .
more than anything , the incident demonstrates just how damaging even a " typical " attack can be when timed properly to strike vulnerable targets .
as is the case in the hundreds of similar attacks that take place each day , the perpetrators harnessed the power of corrupted personal computers to swamp their targets in a sea of bogus internet traffic , effectively cutting off whole neighborhoods of the estonian internet from legitimate traffic .
millions of these infected " zombie " computers exist .
used in concert , they can generate attacks that few systems on earth are capable of withstanding .
the pakistan-youtube incident was even more commonplace - the result of two seemingly benign errors and a quirk in an internet protocol designed at a time when most of the global network ran on trust and virtual handshakes .
the details of the incident are less important than the fact that the circumstances that allowed it to occur remain unchanged , as do scores of similar vulnerabilities endemic to the internet 's open architecture .
the message is that these sorts of incidents can - and almost certainly will - happen again .
and if history tells us anything , it 's that the next time will be worse .
more powerful computers hooked up to more robust internet connections translate into more severe and disruptive attacks .
also , as we rely on the internet to a greater and greater extent , the likelihood that such an incident will cause real harm to our lives and livelihoods only increases .
many home computers are part of zombie networks it would be wrong to suggest that this is entirely preventable .
the openness and interconnectedness that are the internet 's hallmarks ensure that there will always be vulnerabilities for attackers to exploit .
but we can do a much , much better job of securing the critical internet infrastructure on which we all rely .
stability and security must become a higher priority for everyone involved in the development and stewardship of the global internet .
companies may not be able to monetise security in the same way that they monetise speed , but nobody in this space can afford to remain ignorant of the costs associated with getting it wrong .
the " choice " between speed and flexibility on one hand , and stability and security on the other is more a product of cost than anything else .
the cost of providing secure , stable network infrastructure is equal to , and in some cases , greater than the cost of increasing network speeds .
the good news is that there is n't , for the most part , a fundamental technological tension between flexibility and stability on the internet .
indeed , one of the most critical components of stability - excess capacity - is also essential to providing greater speed and flexibility .
this challenge does n't require technological breakthroughs or dramatic paradigm shifts .
we know what needs to be done if we are to bring the security and stability of this global network up to par with its stunning speed and flexibility .
the choice is so simple that it is n't a choice at all : invest the time and resources necessary to safeguard the internet against known dangers , or face the sort of failure that could permanently change the face of the internet for the worse .
