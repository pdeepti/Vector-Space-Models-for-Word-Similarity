program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 05.10.2009 pittsburgh summit shows positive signs for developing countries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-20 leaders will meet twice in 2010 the g-20 summit has agreed on more money for development banks and now includes developing countries in the decision making process .
that can be seen as a positive outcome of the economic crisis , argues dr. peter wolff . the third g-20 summit that just concluded in pittsburgh has quite manifestly established the g-20 as the forum for global economic cooperation .
in pittsburgh the final touches were put on the alterations to the institutional architecture agreed on at the london summit in april 2009 : with the backing of the large developing countries , the international financial institutions -lrb- ifis -rrb- are set to be further strengthened on the basis of the additional funds already agreed on for the imf as well as capital increases for world bank and regional development banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heads of states agreed on changing the global financial markets the price the industrialised countries are to pay for the developing country ’ s assent to efforts to strengthen these institutions so unloved in the south is , at first glance , not very high .
the former are to cede a certain percentage share of their voting rights to emerging countries from the developing world : two percent at the imf and three percent at the world bank .
that will do little to change the fundamental power relations there , and it is likely to be achieved mainly at the expense of a few small european countries .
old north south discourse gives way to new cooperation but one thing that is surprising is how quick the developing countries in the g-20 were to buy into the ‘ deal ’ to strengthen the role of the ifis .
the deal is , be it said , also the only condition under which china , brazil , and other emerging countries will now be prepared to make additional resources available to the imf for the purpose of the combating the ongoing crisis , e.g. in eastern europe .
the old north-south discourse – it will now , it seems , soon be a thing of the past .
the perceptive observer will have noticed that the final document also shows unmistakable signs of the approach of the copenhagen climate conference .
true , it has nothing to say about binding emissions targets .
but it does contain lots of shoptalk about sustainable growth policies .
and one thing relevant for the developing countries : it cedes to the world bank a leading role in climate policy , calling on the g-20 finance ministers to examine , prior to copenhagen , the options available to fund climate policy , propagating programmes designed to supply the poor with renewable energies , and setting out a commitment on the part of the g-20 countries to cut their subsidies for fossil energies and to replace them with targeted social transfers for the poor .
this will prove to be a huge challenge for countries like india and indonesia that spend large shares of their official budgets for just such subsidies , primarily to the benefit of their urban middle classes .
emerging economies to show little interest for poorer countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-20 wants to boost economic recovery and prevent further financial meltdowns so far the developing countries now represented in the g-20 , and in particular china , have of course weathered the crisis relatively well , thanks to their comparatively good pre-crisis economic policies , which gave them they space they needed to deploy stabilising economic stimulus programmes .
in doing so , though , they often showed little regard for the interests of poorer and smaller developing countries , opting instead for support programmes designed to promote national economic sectors and putting a whole array of protectionist measures in place to boost domestic growth .
all this naturally at the expense of other developing countries that lacked policy space for economic stimulus programmes .
g 20 still favour domestic interests and markets this protectionism is assuming the form less of tariffs than of national subsidies and political preference for domestic businesses .
the bottom line : most g-20 countries have not honoured the commitment they made at their first summit to refrain from adopting protectionist measures .
the aim now must be to reverse this process on the basis of the goal , re-affirmed in pittsburgh , to bring the doha round to a successful conclusion in 2010 .
it is above all the economic heavyweights among the developing countries that now must be expected to open their markets , at least in favour of poorer developing countries .
more economic growth needed in developing nations the final document of the pittsburgh summit repeatedly underlines that one central element of the global path out of the crisis must be more growth in developing countries .
it lists a whole array of measures designed to improve , in developing countries , access to food , energy , and financial services as well as to promote growth and prevent major population groups from sinking into poverty .
much of this is not new .
it is , however , noteworthy that now , with the g-20 , the focus is not only on special crisis-related issues like banker bonuses and financial market regulation , and that development-related issues are now increasingly placed in a global context and discussed at the highest level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter wolff heads die 's world economy department the g-8 had done much the same thing , e.g. in gleneagles in 2005 , where , with a paternalist gesture , more assistance was pledged for the developing countries .
indeed , the fact that the large developing countries are now directly involved in the decision-making process must certainly be seen as one of the more positive outcomes of the financial crisis .
dr. peter wolff heads the department ' world economy and development financing ' at the german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- .
based in bonn , the german development institute draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .
it consults on the basis of independent research findings in germany and worldwide and deals with current issues in cooperation between industrial and developing countries . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 07 environment listen to our weekly show about the environment or check out reports and past episodes .

he says that trade unions need to get involved . speaking in berlin at celebrations to mark 60 years since the foundation of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- on monday , horst koehler said decisions taken at the recent g-20 meeting in pittsburg had failed to convince him that enough was being done to prevent a repeat of the current global economic crisis .
" i do n't see the monster being tamed , " he told his audience in berlin , adding that the financial markets were still characterized by shell games , lack of transparency and speculation on commodities markets .
koehler bemoaned what he described as a lack of self-reflection from global financial actors and warned against the principle of hope .
he said nobody should think that growth could cover over or eradicate the memories of what has already happened .
the president , a former head of the international monetary fund , said the financial sector needs strong state and inter-state regulatory policies and stressed the important role of the world 's trade unions in " any fundamental reform of the global financial order . "
he called on employee representatives attending the celebrations to " get involved . "
making work a priority he called for a cooperative employment climate and a culture of co-determination in which everyone could have the feeling they were needed .
" work for all , " he said " must be and must remain a main political target . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions need to be involved in reform efforts , koehler said much has changed since the inception of the dgb in 1949 .
back then , germany was struggling to emerge from the rubble of the second world war , and needed all hands on deck to push ahead with its reconstruction effort .
the dgb came into being in order to ensure the country 's workers a good deal and what then chairman hans boeckler described as " a larger portion of the material , intellectual and cultural goods of society . "
on monday , the current dgb leader michael sommer praised the work of germany 's trade unions over the past six decades , saying they had " genuinely made a major contribution " to national reconstruction efforts .
he said it was thanks to the unions that germany was a respected member of the international community which demonstrated an obligation to the preservation of employees ' rights. tkw / afp / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to the interior ministry website , the socialists have won an absolute majority , winning 160 seats in the 300-seat parliament .
" we stand united to face the big responsibility to change our country into a nation of justice , solidaritzy , humanity and green development , " said papandreou to a cheering crowd .
the ruling conservative new democracy party came in second with just 34 percent of the vote , which translates to 93 seats .
papandreou called the results " a message of hope , for change , and a just society , a more democratic and transparent society . "
sunday 's vote was the third face-off for 57-year-old us-born papandreou , and prime minister costas karamanlis , 53 , a powerful speaker who appeals to the average greek .
both men are heirs to two of the country 's most powerful political dynasties .
scandals and economic woes weakened by scandals and a fragile parliamentary majority , karamanlis called the snap poll in september , gambling he had a better chance of winning now than later in his four-year term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the third face-off for the two leaders first elected in 2004 , karamanlis said ahead of the vote that he needed a strong new mandate to tackle greece 's economic troubles .
the vote comes at a time when the mediterranean country , seen as the eurozone 's weakest link , needs a strong government to deal with an economy on the verge of recession .
papandreou now faces a budget deficit topping six percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , rising unemployment and deep dissatisfaction over the education system , social security and immigration .
extravagant promises ?
the socialist leader promised a three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.36 billion -rrb- stimulus package on a platform of taxing the rich and helping the poor , while incumbent prime minister costas karamanlis called for two years of austerity .
some economists have questioned the wisdom of papandreou 's spending plan , saying it could lead to more borrowing at a time when greece already has the eurozone 's second biggest debt after italy as a percentage of gdp .
after years of robust growth , greece 's output , about 2.5 percent of the eurozone 's total economy , is set to slow to zero growth or even enter negative territory this year , with key drivers and job providers like tourism particularly hard-hit. av / rb / dpa / reuters / ap editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de publishing -pipe- 05.10.2009 top german magazine trades models for " real women " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will brigitte 's decision lead to more readers ?
germany 's top-circulation women 's magazine said it will stop using professional models in its photo shoots .
the decision is part of a wider debate over fashion and body image in the media . " brigitte " is the fashion-and-lifestyle bible for the german everywoman . like most mass-circulation women 's magazines , its photo spreads are peopled by professional models - usually very thin ones .
at least , they were until now .
starting in the new year , that will no longer be the case , say editors-in- chief andreas lebert and brigitte huber .
" we are going to make a magazine for women as they are , and not as other people wish them to be , " lebert told a press conference in hamburg .
the plan is to feature musicians , actors , politicians , and readers , to be chosen by the magazine 's editors , instead of models in future editions of the magazine .
that means photo spreads will feature women " who have an identity " and not just " protruding bones , " lebert said .
the move is just the latest salvo in the ongoing ground war against overly thin fashion models .
recently , the topic has made headlines in connection to several international fashion weeks .
four large associations associated with the berlin fashion week last year agreed not to use overly thin models for the catwalk or fashion ads .
in madrid in 2008 , an underweight model was sent home , amid much publicity .
and this year 's london 's fashion week saw a campaign for more femininity - and curves - on the haute couture runways .
but " brigitte " editors said the magazine 's new strategy of changing size-zero models for normal folks does n't aim to declare war on the fashion industry - it merely aims to send a signal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a preference for thin models dominates the fashion industry " there is a great deal of discomfort in the fashion industry on the subject , but no one takes responsibility , " lebert said .

new trendsetters : bruni , obama for her part , " brigitte " editor huber commented that " these days , attractiveness has many faces . "
the days when fashion companies dictated style are over , she says ; today , fashion is dictated by people like the wife of the french president , carla bruni , or michelle obama , " as well as athletes , students , and " women on the streets of the major metropolises . "
in addition to making a statement about women and body image , the move may well be aimed at boosting circulation .
" brigitte " has seen a steady drop in readers in recent years , and the current bust in the ad business is making magazine publishers have to search for a new angle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 05.10.2009 press review : ireland and the lisbon treaty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european newspapers welcome the irish ' yes ' ireland 's endorsement of the lisbon treaty has been largely saluted across the 27 nations of the eu .
here 's what some of europe 's papers have to say about the resounding ' yes ' vote and the future of the reform treaty . germany 's neue osnabruecker zeitung welcomed ireland 's acceptance of the lisbon treaty , but said it was primarily motivated by money .
" nothing fanned the flames of love for europe among the irish as much as the thought of having to fight their way out of the crisis without cash injections from brussels . "
the paper was critical of the fact that the irish were the only people in the 27 nation block allowed to vote on a treaty " with such reach " .
it said all citizens of europe should have been allowed to have their say at the ballot box .
in the netherlands , de volkskrant said the second irish poll was no longer really about the treaty , but about whether or not the people of ireland wanted to remain in the eu at all .
" the mood has changed radically since the last referendum .
the financial crisis has taught the ' celtic tiger ' that it is safer to be in the eu harbor during a storm . "
in paris , the conservative le figaro said it was now up to the czech president to do the right thing by the citizens of europe .
" the resounding ' yes ' from ireland ought to have cleared the path for the ratification of the lisbon treaty .
the resistance - albeit fierce - from one man can not oppose the will of 500 million europeans . "
it added that vaclav klaus might like , against the wishes of his government and his people , to hold the treaty hostage until the conservatives take up the reins of power in britain .
but such a manoeuvre , it concluded , would be " dishonourable . "
bildunterschrift : ' yes ' was the word on the lips of 67 percent of voters in ireland the british daily , the times says the ireland vote represents another surrender to brussels and laments the fact that the british population never got their chance at a referendum .
" if the british saw the lisbon treaty as a genuine agreement among independent nations , which had been ratified either by a referendum or a general election , they might accept it .
but it is not , and they do not .
they are now asking themselves whether the benefits of belonging to a complex bureaucratic regional block of ageing powers and declining economies outweigh the sacrifice of british sovereignty .
whether it is in britain 's interest to remain in the european union has become a matter of legitimate debate . "
poland 's left-liberal gazeta wyborcza said the green light from the emerald isle meant the eu was now going to have to face some major challenges .
" the first test of the effectiveness of the eu under the new treaty will be expansion .
french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel said expansion would not be possible without the lisbon treaty .
now that its implementation is as good as guaranteed , they will have to take their foot off the brakes . "
it added that croatia , iceland , turkey , serbia , bosnia and herzegovina , montenegro and kosovo are waiting to join .
" in 2010 , ukraine will apply for membership and sooner or later , belarus and moldavia will follow suit . "
austria 's der standard praised the irish for their ' yes ' vote , saying they had left little room for czech president to throw a last minute spanner in the works .
but the question now , the paper wrote , is whether or not the treaty will prove a success .
" can labored joint policies push through planned reforms on migration , domestic security , external relations and increased democracy in eu institutions ? "
in order to do so , the paper wrote , member states will have to stop demonstrating signs of " national small-mindedness and egotism . " tkw / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the real winner was norway . norwegians enjoy the highest standard of living in the world .
the oil-rich scandinavian country , with its well-developed social welfare system , landed first place on the 2009 united nations index for human development .
australia and iceland took second and third places , respectively , and germany took a disappointing 22nd place out of 182 countries .
germany 's relatively low rank was partly due to a sinking per capita income in the wake of reunification , the report said .
other industrialized nations have increased their standing .
france , for instance , climbed to eighth place from 11th in the ranking .

according to the interior ministry website , the socialists have won an absolute majority , winning 160 seats in the 300-seat parliament .
" we stand united to face the big responsibility to change our country into a nation of justice , solidaritzy , humanity and green development , " said papandreou to a cheering crowd .
the ruling conservative new democracy party came in second with just 34 percent of the vote , which translates to 93 seats .
papandreou called the results " a message of hope , for change , and a just society , a more democratic and transparent society . "
sunday 's vote was the third face-off for 57-year-old us-born papandreou , and prime minister costas karamanlis , 53 , a powerful speaker who appeals to the average greek .
both men are heirs to two of the country 's most powerful political dynasties .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the third face-off for the two leaders first elected in 2004 , karamanlis said ahead of the vote that he needed a strong new mandate to tackle greece 's economic troubles .
the vote comes at a time when the mediterranean country , seen as the eurozone 's weakest link , needs a strong government to deal with an economy on the verge of recession .
papandreou now faces a budget deficit topping six percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , rising unemployment and deep dissatisfaction over the education system , social security and immigration .

the socialist leader promised a three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.36 billion -rrb- stimulus package on a platform of taxing the rich and helping the poor , while incumbent prime minister costas karamanlis called for two years of austerity .
some economists have questioned the wisdom of papandreou 's spending plan , saying it could lead to more borrowing at a time when greece already has the eurozone 's second biggest debt after italy as a percentage of gdp .
after years of robust growth , greece 's output , about 2.5 percent of the eurozone 's total economy , is set to slow to zero growth or even enter negative territory this year , with key drivers and job providers like tourism particularly hard-hit. av / rb / dpa / reuters / ap editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 05.10.2009 german coalition partners face tough talks and compromise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu and fdp will share power in the reichstag chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats and the liberal free democrats start coalition talks on monday to form a new government , but they will first have to agree on a wide range of policy issues . a good week after winning the general election , the two sides are gathering in berlin with a slew of negotiators to hammer out the differences between what they have been saying in public and where they are willing to compromise in private .
the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have gone on the offensive with the bavarian state party leader , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , who is also a possible candidate for justice minister , arguing that the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- can not simply dictate what can , and can not , be done .
" they know our election platform and they know which of their policies we have criticized in recent years , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and westerwelle are heading into tough coalition talks the key issues in the coalition talks , fdp leader guido westerwelle has said , will be taxes , finance policies , the national deficit .
equally high up on the agenda will be domestic security , labor market and health system reforms , and securing future energy resources .
stark differences have already emerged the fdp wants to dismantle the national health fund , which was only introduced at the beginning of this year ; a tall order that chancellor merkel rejects .
but , either way , with a rapidly aging population and shrinking workforce , germany urgently needs to revamp its employee-financed health care system .
the fdp insists on making it easier to fire employees , while opposing the introduction of sector-specific minimum wages .
the cdu wants to keep the minimum wage accords agreed on with the social democrats in the outgoing government and opposes labor market reforms .
the fdp has indicated , however , that this is not a top priority .
clashes are all but certain on topics like domestic security where the fdp vehemently opposes online searches and other measures , which they claim undercut personal data protection .
the cdu argues that these measures are necessary to combat terrorism and the growing scourge of internet crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government surveillance has stirred opposition on energy issues , both parties have said they would like to extend the operation of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants .
there is currently a law that calls for phasing out nuclear energy by 2020 .
although they agree on an extension , they differ on how the profits earned from that should be used .
the cdu wants to use them to keep electricity prices down , while the fdp wants to reduce subsidies for renewable energy .
tax cuts and the deficit on the deficit , the fdp wants to cut spending , which is expected to be twice the european union limit next year .
the fdp says it wants to axe state subsidies , end the " waste " of taxpayer 's money and reduce military spending .
merkel has rejected wholesale spending cuts , while some in her party have suggested raising the sales tax - an idea merkel has dismissed .
the tax issue will perhaps be the toughest nut to crack in the coalition talks in light of germany 's gaping budget deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cutting expenditures and taxes will be difficult fdp general-secretary dirk niebel has called for " a major tax structure reform " and said he was confident that " a coalition consensus could be reached for the next four years . "
but , that may be easier said than done .
saxony 's cdu state premier stanislav tillich urgently warned against lowering taxes , saying " the coalition talks must not agree on budgetary measures that burden our children and grandchildren . "
the position of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , however , is more in line with the fdp .
csu general-secretary alexander dobrindt has said " only investment in the economy and in jobs can lead to more employment and the retention of jobs .
that ultimately also leads to more financial flexibility . "
" cuts in social welfare programs would not be necessary , " he added .
the tax cuts proposed by the cdu would amount to about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.8 billion -rrb- annually .
the fdp has promised cuts worth up to 35 billion euros and wants to implement them soon .
the party also wants to simplify the tax system .
fdp finance spokesman hermann otto solms said his party would not " chicken out " of its campaign pledge. gb / dpa / ap / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the real winner was norway . norwegians enjoy the highest standard of living in the world .
the oil-rich scandinavian country , with its well-developed social welfare system , landed first place on the 2009 united nations index for human development .
australia and iceland took second and third places , respectively , and germany took a disappointing 22nd place out of 182 countries .
germany 's relatively low rank was partly due to a sinking per capita income in the wake of reunification , the report said .
other industrialized nations have increased their standing .
france , for instance , climbed to eighth place from 11th in the ranking .
ireland ranked fifth , austria 14th and spain 15th .
" progress is unevenly distributed , " said jeni klugman , the main author of the report .
" many countries have experienced setbacks in the past decades in the face of economic recession , conflict - crises and the hiv / aids epidemic setbacks experienced , " she said .
dramatic differences in life expectancy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in many african countries have a lower life expectancy than their european counterparts the worst results were for the african country of niger .
a child who is born in niger can expect to live to be just 50 years old - 30 years less than a child born in norway , according to the report .
afghanistan , sierra leone and the central african republic were also at the bottom of the list . the index combined values for life expectancy , literacy , school enrollment rates and gross domestic product per capita to arrive at an " aggregate measure of human welfare . "

but the real winner was norway . norwegians enjoy the highest standard of living in the world .
the oil-rich scandinavian country , with its well-developed social welfare system , landed first place on the 2009 united nations index for human development .
australia and iceland took second and third places , respectively , and germany took a disappointing 22nd place out of 182 countries .
germany 's relatively low rank was partly due to a sinking per capita income in the wake of reunification , the report said .
other industrialized nations have increased their standing .
france , for instance , climbed to eighth place from 11th in the ranking .
ireland ranked fifth , austria 14th and spain 15th .
" progress is unevenly distributed , " said jeni klugman , the main author of the report .
" many countries have experienced setbacks in the past decades in the face of economic recession , conflict - crises and the hiv / aids epidemic setbacks experienced , " she said .
dramatic differences in life expectancy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in many african countries have a lower life expectancy than their european counterparts the worst results were for the african country of niger .
a child who is born in niger can expect to live to be just 50 years old - 30 years less than a child born in norway , according to the report .
afghanistan , sierra leone and the central african republic were also at the bottom of the list . the index combined values for life expectancy , literacy , school enrollment rates and gross domestic product per capita to arrive at an " aggregate measure of human welfare . "

according to the interior ministry website , the socialists have won an absolute majority , winning 160 seats in the 300-seat parliament .
" we stand united to face the big responsibility to change our country into a nation of justice , solidaritzy , humanity and green development , " said papandreou to a cheering crowd .
the ruling conservative new democracy party came in second with just 34 percent of the vote , which translates to 93 seats .
papandreou called the results " a message of hope , for change , and a just society , a more democratic and transparent society . "
sunday 's vote was the third face-off for 57-year-old us-born papandreou , and prime minister costas karamanlis , 53 , a powerful speaker who appeals to the average greek .
both men are heirs to two of the country 's most powerful political dynasties .
scandals and economic woes weakened by scandals and a fragile parliamentary majority , karamanlis called the snap poll in september , gambling he had a better chance of winning now than later in his four-year term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the third face-off for the two leaders first elected in 2004 , karamanlis said ahead of the vote that he needed a strong new mandate to tackle greece 's economic troubles .
the vote comes at a time when the mediterranean country , seen as the eurozone 's weakest link , needs a strong government to deal with an economy on the verge of recession .
papandreou now faces a budget deficit topping six percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , rising unemployment and deep dissatisfaction over the education system , social security and immigration .
extravagant promises ?
the socialist leader promised a three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.36 billion -rrb- stimulus package on a platform of taxing the rich and helping the poor , while incumbent prime minister costas karamanlis called for two years of austerity .
some economists have questioned the wisdom of papandreou 's spending plan , saying it could lead to more borrowing at a time when greece already has the eurozone 's second biggest debt after italy as a percentage of gdp .
after years of robust growth , greece 's output , about 2.5 percent of the eurozone 's total economy , is set to slow to zero growth or even enter negative territory this year , with key drivers and job providers like tourism particularly hard-hit. av / rb / dpa / reuters / ap editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the real winner was norway . norwegians enjoy the highest standard of living in the world .
the oil-rich scandinavian country , with its well-developed social welfare system , landed first place on the 2009 united nations index for human development .
australia and iceland took second and third places , respectively , and germany took a disappointing 22nd place out of 182 countries .
germany 's relatively low rank was partly due to a sinking per capita income in the wake of reunification , the report said .
other industrialized nations have increased their standing .
france , for instance , climbed to eighth place from 11th in the ranking .
ireland ranked fifth , austria 14th and spain 15th .
" progress is unevenly distributed , " said jeni klugman , the main author of the report .
" many countries have experienced setbacks in the past decades in the face of economic recession , conflict - crises and the hiv / aids epidemic setbacks experienced , " she said .
dramatic differences in life expectancy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in many african countries have a lower life expectancy than their european counterparts the worst results were for the african country of niger .
a child who is born in niger can expect to live to be just 50 years old - 30 years less than a child born in norway , according to the report .
afghanistan , sierra leone and the central african republic were also at the bottom of the list . the index combined values for life expectancy , literacy , school enrollment rates and gross domestic product per capita to arrive at an " aggregate measure of human welfare . "

they ’ re trying to influence the eu agriculture ministers ' meeting on the milk market and get further concessions . about 1,000 dairy farmers from germany , france and other countries converged on brussels on monday , clogging the streets with around 200 tractors .
they also brought cowbells , whistles , and even eggs – which they hurled at the eu headquarters – in a bid to add volume to their cries . they are campaigning for help from the eu so they can turn a profit .
milk production is higher than demand in europe and , therefore , prices are currently low , which is putting some farmers ' livelihoods at stake . germany 's agriculture minister ilse aigner , like her french counterpart bruno le maire , has tried to position herself clearly in the dairy farmers ' camp for monday 's informal lunch meeting in brussels . " the milk sector is in dire need of further supporting measures , " aigner says in an interview with the passauer neuen presse newspaper . " sadly , however , the various representatives of the milk industry still have very different opinions on what should be done .
nevertheless , i am going to brussels with a clear task at hand . " aigner says that 20 european nations are in favor of the milk plan spearheaded by germany and france , which calls for manufacturing subsidies to encourage increased production , and for unused eu funds to be reallocated to national governments so they can help milk farmers .
the plan also advocates tighter - or at least unchanged - milk quotas , regional limits on production set by brussels in a bid to encourage widespread dairy farming . however , great britain , denmark , the netherlands , and others oppose milk quotas , saying that the controlled market is the root cause of the problem .
bildunterschrift : " we might as well be throwing it away , " farmers say frequent protests the uproar in brussels is but the latest instalment in a string of dairy farmer protests .
they argue that prices are now so low that it 's almost impossible to produce profit making milk .
many german farmers already protested by spraying thousands of tons of the white stuff on paddocks , instead of selling it to milk and cheese factories . some french farmers even caused consternation by dumping milk in a lake , killing freshwater fish in the process . the dairy farmers want higher prices , subsidies to help boost production , and schemes to help increase demand - for example pushing milk back onto the menus in european schools .
most eu agriculture ministers seem determined to assuage the farmers ; however , many experts see these desires as unrealistic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe makes too much , and drinks too little " it 's going to take a long time until the milk sector is stable again , " says industry expert professor hannes weindlmaier from the technical university of munich . " the main problem is a simple case of over-production - we make too much milk . " yet weindlmaier also acknowledges that the current milk prices - especially for german dairy farmers - barely cover costs , with smaller operations in the south of the country suffering most .
if germany wants to maintain nationwide milk production , government schemes will be necessary to keep higher-cost dairy farmers in business , he says . monday ’ s meeting in brussels is only meant as a chance to discuss the new proposal from france and germany to help the dairy farmers .

" aigner says that 20 european nations are in favor of the milk plan spearheaded by germany and france , which calls for manufacturing subsidies to encourage increased production , and for unused eu funds to be reallocated to national governments so they can help milk farmers .
the plan also advocates tighter - or at least unchanged - milk quotas , regional limits on production set by brussels in a bid to encourage widespread dairy farming . however , great britain , denmark , the netherlands , and others oppose milk quotas , saying that the controlled market is the root cause of the problem .
bildunterschrift : " we might as well be throwing it away , " farmers say frequent protests the uproar in brussels is but the latest instalment in a string of dairy farmer protests .
they argue that prices are now so low that it 's almost impossible to produce profit making milk .
many german farmers already protested by spraying thousands of tons of the white stuff on paddocks , instead of selling it to milk and cheese factories . some french farmers even caused consternation by dumping milk in a lake , killing freshwater fish in the process . the dairy farmers want higher prices , subsidies to help boost production , and schemes to help increase demand - for example pushing milk back onto the menus in european schools .
most eu agriculture ministers seem determined to assuage the farmers ; however , many experts see these desires as unrealistic .

" the main problem is a simple case of over-production - we make too much milk . " yet weindlmaier also acknowledges that the current milk prices - especially for german dairy farmers - barely cover costs , with smaller operations in the south of the country suffering most .

they ’ re trying to influence the eu agriculture ministers ' meeting on the milk market and get further concessions . about 1,000 dairy farmers from germany , france and other countries converged on brussels on monday , clogging the streets with around 200 tractors .
they also brought cowbells , whistles , and even eggs – which they hurled at the eu headquarters – in a bid to add volume to their cries . they are campaigning for help from the eu so they can turn a profit .
milk production is higher than demand in europe and , therefore , prices are currently low , which is putting some farmers ' livelihoods at stake . germany 's agriculture minister ilse aigner , like her french counterpart bruno le maire , has tried to position herself clearly in the dairy farmers ' camp for monday 's informal lunch meeting in brussels . " the milk sector is in dire need of further supporting measures , " aigner says in an interview with the passauer neuen presse newspaper . " sadly , however , the various representatives of the milk industry still have very different opinions on what should be done .
nevertheless , i am going to brussels with a clear task at hand . " aigner says that 20 european nations are in favor of the milk plan spearheaded by germany and france , which calls for manufacturing subsidies to encourage increased production , and for unused eu funds to be reallocated to national governments so they can help milk farmers .

the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have gone on the offensive with the bavarian state party leader , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , who is also a possible candidate for justice minister , arguing that the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- can not simply dictate what can , and can not , be done .
" they know our election platform and they know which of their policies we have criticized in recent years , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and westerwelle are heading into tough coalition talks the key issues in the coalition talks , fdp leader guido westerwelle has said , will be taxes , finance policies , the national deficit .
equally high up on the agenda will be domestic security , labor market and health system reforms , and securing future energy resources .
stark differences have already emerged the fdp wants to dismantle the national health fund , which was only introduced at the beginning of this year ; a tall order that chancellor merkel rejects .
but , either way , with a rapidly aging population and shrinking workforce , germany urgently needs to revamp its employee-financed health care system .
the fdp insists on making it easier to fire employees , while opposing the introduction of sector-specific minimum wages .
the cdu wants to keep the minimum wage accords agreed on with the social democrats in the outgoing government and opposes labor market reforms .
the fdp has indicated , however , that this is not a top priority .
clashes are all but certain on topics like domestic security where the fdp vehemently opposes online searches and other measures , which they claim undercut personal data protection .
the cdu argues that these measures are necessary to combat terrorism and the growing scourge of internet crime .

there is currently a law that calls for phasing out nuclear energy by 2020 .

the fdp says it wants to axe state subsidies , end the " waste " of taxpayer 's money and reduce military spending .
merkel has rejected wholesale spending cuts , while some in her party have suggested raising the sales tax - an idea merkel has dismissed .
the tax issue will perhaps be the toughest nut to crack in the coalition talks in light of germany 's gaping budget deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cutting expenditures and taxes will be difficult fdp general-secretary dirk niebel has called for " a major tax structure reform " and said he was confident that " a coalition consensus could be reached for the next four years . "
but , that may be easier said than done .
saxony 's cdu state premier stanislav tillich urgently warned against lowering taxes , saying " the coalition talks must not agree on budgetary measures that burden our children and grandchildren . "
the position of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , however , is more in line with the fdp .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 05.10.2009 press review : ireland and the lisbon treaty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european newspapers welcome the irish ' yes ' ireland 's endorsement of the lisbon treaty has been largely saluted across the 27 nations of the eu .
here 's what some of europe 's papers have to say about the resounding ' yes ' vote and the future of the reform treaty . germany 's neue osnabruecker zeitung welcomed ireland 's acceptance of the lisbon treaty , but said it was primarily motivated by money .
" nothing fanned the flames of love for europe among the irish as much as the thought of having to fight their way out of the crisis without cash injections from brussels . "
the paper was critical of the fact that the irish were the only people in the 27 nation block allowed to vote on a treaty " with such reach " .
it said all citizens of europe should have been allowed to have their say at the ballot box .
in the netherlands , de volkskrant said the second irish poll was no longer really about the treaty , but about whether or not the people of ireland wanted to remain in the eu at all .
" the mood has changed radically since the last referendum .
the financial crisis has taught the ' celtic tiger ' that it is safer to be in the eu harbor during a storm . "
in paris , the conservative le figaro said it was now up to the czech president to do the right thing by the citizens of europe .
" the resounding ' yes ' from ireland ought to have cleared the path for the ratification of the lisbon treaty .
the resistance - albeit fierce - from one man can not oppose the will of 500 million europeans . "
it added that vaclav klaus might like , against the wishes of his government and his people , to hold the treaty hostage until the conservatives take up the reins of power in britain .
but such a manoeuvre , it concluded , would be " dishonourable . "
bildunterschrift : ' yes ' was the word on the lips of 67 percent of voters in ireland the british daily , the times says the ireland vote represents another surrender to brussels and laments the fact that the british population never got their chance at a referendum .
" if the british saw the lisbon treaty as a genuine agreement among independent nations , which had been ratified either by a referendum or a general election , they might accept it .
but it is not , and they do not .
they are now asking themselves whether the benefits of belonging to a complex bureaucratic regional block of ageing powers and declining economies outweigh the sacrifice of british sovereignty .
whether it is in britain 's interest to remain in the european union has become a matter of legitimate debate . "
poland 's left-liberal gazeta wyborcza said the green light from the emerald isle meant the eu was now going to have to face some major challenges .
" the first test of the effectiveness of the eu under the new treaty will be expansion .
french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel said expansion would not be possible without the lisbon treaty .
now that its implementation is as good as guaranteed , they will have to take their foot off the brakes . "
it added that croatia , iceland , turkey , serbia , bosnia and herzegovina , montenegro and kosovo are waiting to join .
" in 2010 , ukraine will apply for membership and sooner or later , belarus and moldavia will follow suit . "
austria 's der standard praised the irish for their ' yes ' vote , saying they had left little room for czech president to throw a last minute spanner in the works .
but the question now , the paper wrote , is whether or not the treaty will prove a success .
" can labored joint policies push through planned reforms on migration , domestic security , external relations and increased democracy in eu institutions ? "
in order to do so , the paper wrote , member states will have to stop demonstrating signs of " national small-mindedness and egotism . " tkw / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's top-circulation women 's magazine said it will stop using professional models in its photo shoots .
the decision is part of a wider debate over fashion and body image in the media . " brigitte " is the fashion-and-lifestyle bible for the german everywoman . like most mass-circulation women 's magazines , its photo spreads are peopled by professional models - usually very thin ones .
at least , they were until now .
starting in the new year , that will no longer be the case , say editors-in- chief andreas lebert and brigitte huber .
" we are going to make a magazine for women as they are , and not as other people wish them to be , " lebert told a press conference in hamburg .
the plan is to feature musicians , actors , politicians , and readers , to be chosen by the magazine 's editors , instead of models in future editions of the magazine .
that means photo spreads will feature women " who have an identity " and not just " protruding bones , " lebert said .
the move is just the latest salvo in the ongoing ground war against overly thin fashion models .
recently , the topic has made headlines in connection to several international fashion weeks .
four large associations associated with the berlin fashion week last year agreed not to use overly thin models for the catwalk or fashion ads .
in madrid in 2008 , an underweight model was sent home , amid much publicity .
and this year 's london 's fashion week saw a campaign for more femininity - and curves - on the haute couture runways .
but " brigitte " editors said the magazine 's new strategy of changing size-zero models for normal folks does n't aim to declare war on the fashion industry - it merely aims to send a signal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a preference for thin models dominates the fashion industry " there is a great deal of discomfort in the fashion industry on the subject , but no one takes responsibility , " lebert said .
" maybe one medium has to say : ' we are deciding to present ourselves differently . " '
new trendsetters : bruni , obama for her part , " brigitte " editor huber commented that " these days , attractiveness has many faces . "
the days when fashion companies dictated style are over , she says ; today , fashion is dictated by people like the wife of the french president , carla bruni , or michelle obama , " as well as athletes , students , and " women on the streets of the major metropolises . "
in addition to making a statement about women and body image , the move may well be aimed at boosting circulation .
" brigitte " has seen a steady drop in readers in recent years , and the current bust in the ad business is making magazine publishers have to search for a new angle .
the magazine sold some 720,000 copies in the third quarter of 2009 , down from 757,000 a year earlier. jen / dpa / ap / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's top-circulation women 's magazine said it will stop using professional models in its photo shoots .
the decision is part of a wider debate over fashion and body image in the media . " brigitte " is the fashion-and-lifestyle bible for the german everywoman . like most mass-circulation women 's magazines , its photo spreads are peopled by professional models - usually very thin ones .
at least , they were until now .
starting in the new year , that will no longer be the case , say editors-in- chief andreas lebert and brigitte huber .
" we are going to make a magazine for women as they are , and not as other people wish them to be , " lebert told a press conference in hamburg .
the plan is to feature musicians , actors , politicians , and readers , to be chosen by the magazine 's editors , instead of models in future editions of the magazine .
that means photo spreads will feature women " who have an identity " and not just " protruding bones , " lebert said .
the move is just the latest salvo in the ongoing ground war against overly thin fashion models .
recently , the topic has made headlines in connection to several international fashion weeks .
four large associations associated with the berlin fashion week last year agreed not to use overly thin models for the catwalk or fashion ads .
in madrid in 2008 , an underweight model was sent home , amid much publicity .
and this year 's london 's fashion week saw a campaign for more femininity - and curves - on the haute couture runways .
but " brigitte " editors said the magazine 's new strategy of changing size-zero models for normal folks does n't aim to declare war on the fashion industry - it merely aims to send a signal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a preference for thin models dominates the fashion industry " there is a great deal of discomfort in the fashion industry on the subject , but no one takes responsibility , " lebert said .
" maybe one medium has to say : ' we are deciding to present ourselves differently . " '
new trendsetters : bruni , obama for her part , " brigitte " editor huber commented that " these days , attractiveness has many faces . "
the days when fashion companies dictated style are over , she says ; today , fashion is dictated by people like the wife of the french president , carla bruni , or michelle obama , " as well as athletes , students , and " women on the streets of the major metropolises . "

here 's what some of europe 's papers have to say about the resounding ' yes ' vote and the future of the reform treaty . germany 's neue osnabruecker zeitung welcomed ireland 's acceptance of the lisbon treaty , but said it was primarily motivated by money .
" nothing fanned the flames of love for europe among the irish as much as the thought of having to fight their way out of the crisis without cash injections from brussels . "
the paper was critical of the fact that the irish were the only people in the 27 nation block allowed to vote on a treaty " with such reach " .
it said all citizens of europe should have been allowed to have their say at the ballot box .
in the netherlands , de volkskrant said the second irish poll was no longer really about the treaty , but about whether or not the people of ireland wanted to remain in the eu at all .
" the mood has changed radically since the last referendum .
the financial crisis has taught the ' celtic tiger ' that it is safer to be in the eu harbor during a storm . "
in paris , the conservative le figaro said it was now up to the czech president to do the right thing by the citizens of europe .
" the resounding ' yes ' from ireland ought to have cleared the path for the ratification of the lisbon treaty .
the resistance - albeit fierce - from one man can not oppose the will of 500 million europeans . "
it added that vaclav klaus might like , against the wishes of his government and his people , to hold the treaty hostage until the conservatives take up the reins of power in britain .
but such a manoeuvre , it concluded , would be " dishonourable . "
bildunterschrift : ' yes ' was the word on the lips of 67 percent of voters in ireland the british daily , the times says the ireland vote represents another surrender to brussels and laments the fact that the british population never got their chance at a referendum .
" if the british saw the lisbon treaty as a genuine agreement among independent nations , which had been ratified either by a referendum or a general election , they might accept it .
but it is not , and they do not .
they are now asking themselves whether the benefits of belonging to a complex bureaucratic regional block of ageing powers and declining economies outweigh the sacrifice of british sovereignty .
whether it is in britain 's interest to remain in the european union has become a matter of legitimate debate . "
poland 's left-liberal gazeta wyborcza said the green light from the emerald isle meant the eu was now going to have to face some major challenges .
" the first test of the effectiveness of the eu under the new treaty will be expansion .
french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel said expansion would not be possible without the lisbon treaty .
now that its implementation is as good as guaranteed , they will have to take their foot off the brakes . "
it added that croatia , iceland , turkey , serbia , bosnia and herzegovina , montenegro and kosovo are waiting to join .
" in 2010 , ukraine will apply for membership and sooner or later , belarus and moldavia will follow suit . "
austria 's der standard praised the irish for their ' yes ' vote , saying they had left little room for czech president to throw a last minute spanner in the works .
but the question now , the paper wrote , is whether or not the treaty will prove a success .

here 's what some of europe 's papers have to say about the resounding ' yes ' vote and the future of the reform treaty . germany 's neue osnabruecker zeitung welcomed ireland 's acceptance of the lisbon treaty , but said it was primarily motivated by money .
" nothing fanned the flames of love for europe among the irish as much as the thought of having to fight their way out of the crisis without cash injections from brussels . "
the paper was critical of the fact that the irish were the only people in the 27 nation block allowed to vote on a treaty " with such reach " .
it said all citizens of europe should have been allowed to have their say at the ballot box .
in the netherlands , de volkskrant said the second irish poll was no longer really about the treaty , but about whether or not the people of ireland wanted to remain in the eu at all .
" the mood has changed radically since the last referendum .
the financial crisis has taught the ' celtic tiger ' that it is safer to be in the eu harbor during a storm . "
in paris , the conservative le figaro said it was now up to the czech president to do the right thing by the citizens of europe .
" the resounding ' yes ' from ireland ought to have cleared the path for the ratification of the lisbon treaty .
the resistance - albeit fierce - from one man can not oppose the will of 500 million europeans . "
it added that vaclav klaus might like , against the wishes of his government and his people , to hold the treaty hostage until the conservatives take up the reins of power in britain .
but such a manoeuvre , it concluded , would be " dishonourable . "
bildunterschrift : ' yes ' was the word on the lips of 67 percent of voters in ireland the british daily , the times says the ireland vote represents another surrender to brussels and laments the fact that the british population never got their chance at a referendum .
" if the british saw the lisbon treaty as a genuine agreement among independent nations , which had been ratified either by a referendum or a general election , they might accept it .
but it is not , and they do not .
they are now asking themselves whether the benefits of belonging to a complex bureaucratic regional block of ageing powers and declining economies outweigh the sacrifice of british sovereignty .
whether it is in britain 's interest to remain in the european union has become a matter of legitimate debate . "
poland 's left-liberal gazeta wyborcza said the green light from the emerald isle meant the eu was now going to have to face some major challenges .
" the first test of the effectiveness of the eu under the new treaty will be expansion .
french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel said expansion would not be possible without the lisbon treaty .
now that its implementation is as good as guaranteed , they will have to take their foot off the brakes . "
it added that croatia , iceland , turkey , serbia , bosnia and herzegovina , montenegro and kosovo are waiting to join .
" in 2010 , ukraine will apply for membership and sooner or later , belarus and moldavia will follow suit . "
austria 's der standard praised the irish for their ' yes ' vote , saying they had left little room for czech president to throw a last minute spanner in the works .
but the question now , the paper wrote , is whether or not the treaty will prove a success .
" can labored joint policies push through planned reforms on migration , domestic security , external relations and increased democracy in eu institutions ? "
in order to do so , the paper wrote , member states will have to stop demonstrating signs of " national small-mindedness and egotism . " tkw / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 05.10.2009 pittsburgh summit shows positive signs for developing countries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-20 leaders will meet twice in 2010 the g-20 summit has agreed on more money for development banks and now includes developing countries in the decision making process .
that can be seen as a positive outcome of the economic crisis , argues dr. peter wolff . the third g-20 summit that just concluded in pittsburgh has quite manifestly established the g-20 as the forum for global economic cooperation .
in pittsburgh the final touches were put on the alterations to the institutional architecture agreed on at the london summit in april 2009 : with the backing of the large developing countries , the international financial institutions -lrb- ifis -rrb- are set to be further strengthened on the basis of the additional funds already agreed on for the imf as well as capital increases for world bank and regional development banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heads of states agreed on changing the global financial markets the price the industrialised countries are to pay for the developing country ’ s assent to efforts to strengthen these institutions so unloved in the south is , at first glance , not very high .
the former are to cede a certain percentage share of their voting rights to emerging countries from the developing world : two percent at the imf and three percent at the world bank .
that will do little to change the fundamental power relations there , and it is likely to be achieved mainly at the expense of a few small european countries .
old north south discourse gives way to new cooperation but one thing that is surprising is how quick the developing countries in the g-20 were to buy into the ‘ deal ’ to strengthen the role of the ifis .
the deal is , be it said , also the only condition under which china , brazil , and other emerging countries will now be prepared to make additional resources available to the imf for the purpose of the combating the ongoing crisis , e.g. in eastern europe .
the old north-south discourse – it will now , it seems , soon be a thing of the past .
the perceptive observer will have noticed that the final document also shows unmistakable signs of the approach of the copenhagen climate conference .
true , it has nothing to say about binding emissions targets .
but it does contain lots of shoptalk about sustainable growth policies .
and one thing relevant for the developing countries : it cedes to the world bank a leading role in climate policy , calling on the g-20 finance ministers to examine , prior to copenhagen , the options available to fund climate policy , propagating programmes designed to supply the poor with renewable energies , and setting out a commitment on the part of the g-20 countries to cut their subsidies for fossil energies and to replace them with targeted social transfers for the poor .
this will prove to be a huge challenge for countries like india and indonesia that spend large shares of their official budgets for just such subsidies , primarily to the benefit of their urban middle classes .
emerging economies to show little interest for poorer countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-20 wants to boost economic recovery and prevent further financial meltdowns so far the developing countries now represented in the g-20 , and in particular china , have of course weathered the crisis relatively well , thanks to their comparatively good pre-crisis economic policies , which gave them they space they needed to deploy stabilising economic stimulus programmes .
in doing so , though , they often showed little regard for the interests of poorer and smaller developing countries , opting instead for support programmes designed to promote national economic sectors and putting a whole array of protectionist measures in place to boost domestic growth .
all this naturally at the expense of other developing countries that lacked policy space for economic stimulus programmes .
g 20 still favour domestic interests and markets this protectionism is assuming the form less of tariffs than of national subsidies and political preference for domestic businesses .
the bottom line : most g-20 countries have not honoured the commitment they made at their first summit to refrain from adopting protectionist measures .
the aim now must be to reverse this process on the basis of the goal , re-affirmed in pittsburgh , to bring the doha round to a successful conclusion in 2010 .
it is above all the economic heavyweights among the developing countries that now must be expected to open their markets , at least in favour of poorer developing countries .
more economic growth needed in developing nations the final document of the pittsburgh summit repeatedly underlines that one central element of the global path out of the crisis must be more growth in developing countries .
it lists a whole array of measures designed to improve , in developing countries , access to food , energy , and financial services as well as to promote growth and prevent major population groups from sinking into poverty .
much of this is not new .
it is , however , noteworthy that now , with the g-20 , the focus is not only on special crisis-related issues like banker bonuses and financial market regulation , and that development-related issues are now increasingly placed in a global context and discussed at the highest level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter wolff heads die 's world economy department the g-8 had done much the same thing , e.g. in gleneagles in 2005 , where , with a paternalist gesture , more assistance was pledged for the developing countries .
indeed , the fact that the large developing countries are now directly involved in the decision-making process must certainly be seen as one of the more positive outcomes of the financial crisis .

the former are to cede a certain percentage share of their voting rights to emerging countries from the developing world : two percent at the imf and three percent at the world bank .
that will do little to change the fundamental power relations there , and it is likely to be achieved mainly at the expense of a few small european countries .
old north south discourse gives way to new cooperation but one thing that is surprising is how quick the developing countries in the g-20 were to buy into the ‘ deal ’ to strengthen the role of the ifis .
the deal is , be it said , also the only condition under which china , brazil , and other emerging countries will now be prepared to make additional resources available to the imf for the purpose of the combating the ongoing crisis , e.g. in eastern europe .
the old north-south discourse – it will now , it seems , soon be a thing of the past .
the perceptive observer will have noticed that the final document also shows unmistakable signs of the approach of the copenhagen climate conference .
true , it has nothing to say about binding emissions targets .
but it does contain lots of shoptalk about sustainable growth policies .
and one thing relevant for the developing countries : it cedes to the world bank a leading role in climate policy , calling on the g-20 finance ministers to examine , prior to copenhagen , the options available to fund climate policy , propagating programmes designed to supply the poor with renewable energies , and setting out a commitment on the part of the g-20 countries to cut their subsidies for fossil energies and to replace them with targeted social transfers for the poor .
this will prove to be a huge challenge for countries like india and indonesia that spend large shares of their official budgets for just such subsidies , primarily to the benefit of their urban middle classes .
emerging economies to show little interest for poorer countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-20 wants to boost economic recovery and prevent further financial meltdowns so far the developing countries now represented in the g-20 , and in particular china , have of course weathered the crisis relatively well , thanks to their comparatively good pre-crisis economic policies , which gave them they space they needed to deploy stabilising economic stimulus programmes .
in doing so , though , they often showed little regard for the interests of poorer and smaller developing countries , opting instead for support programmes designed to promote national economic sectors and putting a whole array of protectionist measures in place to boost domestic growth .
all this naturally at the expense of other developing countries that lacked policy space for economic stimulus programmes .
g 20 still favour domestic interests and markets this protectionism is assuming the form less of tariffs than of national subsidies and political preference for domestic businesses .
the bottom line : most g-20 countries have not honoured the commitment they made at their first summit to refrain from adopting protectionist measures .
the aim now must be to reverse this process on the basis of the goal , re-affirmed in pittsburgh , to bring the doha round to a successful conclusion in 2010 .
it is above all the economic heavyweights among the developing countries that now must be expected to open their markets , at least in favour of poorer developing countries .
more economic growth needed in developing nations the final document of the pittsburgh summit repeatedly underlines that one central element of the global path out of the crisis must be more growth in developing countries .
it lists a whole array of measures designed to improve , in developing countries , access to food , energy , and financial services as well as to promote growth and prevent major population groups from sinking into poverty .
much of this is not new .
it is , however , noteworthy that now , with the g-20 , the focus is not only on special crisis-related issues like banker bonuses and financial market regulation , and that development-related issues are now increasingly placed in a global context and discussed at the highest level .

their work is seen as having an important impact on research into cancer and aging .
telomerase is called an " immortality enzyme ; " it could play a role in treating the uncontrolled spread of cancer cells .
the three researchers will share the prize , worth 10 million swedish crowns , or around a million euros -lrb- $ 1.4 million -rrb- .
solving problems on protecting chromosomes professor hans jornvall of the nobel assembly said their discoveries were crucial for research on cancer , aging and inherited genetic diseases , .
a statement by the assembly said the three scientists solved a fundamental problem in biology on " how chromosomes can be copied in a complete way and how they are protected against degradation . "
the statement said the discovery of " how chromosomes are protected by telomeres and the enzyme telomerase " had stimulated the development of " new therapeutic strategies . "
recipient says she was " thrilled " " i was just thrilled , " greider told swedish radio , saying she was doing laundry when she received the telephone call about the award from the karolinska institute .
american greider is a professor at johns hopkins university school of medicine in baltimore , australia-native blackburn is a professor at the university of california in san francisco , and szostak , born in the uk , is a professor at the harvard medical school .

he says that trade unions need to get involved . speaking in berlin at celebrations to mark 60 years since the foundation of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- on monday , horst koehler said decisions taken at the recent g-20 meeting in pittsburg had failed to convince him that enough was being done to prevent a repeat of the current global economic crisis .
" i do n't see the monster being tamed , " he told his audience in berlin , adding that the financial markets were still characterized by shell games , lack of transparency and speculation on commodities markets .
koehler bemoaned what he described as a lack of self-reflection from global financial actors and warned against the principle of hope .
he said nobody should think that growth could cover over or eradicate the memories of what has already happened .
the president , a former head of the international monetary fund , said the financial sector needs strong state and inter-state regulatory policies and stressed the important role of the world 's trade unions in " any fundamental reform of the global financial order . "
he called on employee representatives attending the celebrations to " get involved . "
making work a priority he called for a cooperative employment climate and a culture of co-determination in which everyone could have the feeling they were needed .

the dgb came into being in order to ensure the country 's workers a good deal and what then chairman hans boeckler described as " a larger portion of the material , intellectual and cultural goods of society . "
on monday , the current dgb leader michael sommer praised the work of germany 's trade unions over the past six decades , saying they had " genuinely made a major contribution " to national reconstruction efforts .
he said it was thanks to the unions that germany was a respected member of the international community which demonstrated an obligation to the preservation of employees ' rights. tkw / afp / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he says that trade unions need to get involved . speaking in berlin at celebrations to mark 60 years since the foundation of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- on monday , horst koehler said decisions taken at the recent g-20 meeting in pittsburg had failed to convince him that enough was being done to prevent a repeat of the current global economic crisis .
" i do n't see the monster being tamed , " he told his audience in berlin , adding that the financial markets were still characterized by shell games , lack of transparency and speculation on commodities markets .
koehler bemoaned what he described as a lack of self-reflection from global financial actors and warned against the principle of hope .
he said nobody should think that growth could cover over or eradicate the memories of what has already happened .
the president , a former head of the international monetary fund , said the financial sector needs strong state and inter-state regulatory policies and stressed the important role of the world 's trade unions in " any fundamental reform of the global financial order . "
he called on employee representatives attending the celebrations to " get involved . "
making work a priority he called for a cooperative employment climate and a culture of co-determination in which everyone could have the feeling they were needed .
" work for all , " he said " must be and must remain a main political target . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions need to be involved in reform efforts , koehler said much has changed since the inception of the dgb in 1949 .
back then , germany was struggling to emerge from the rubble of the second world war , and needed all hands on deck to push ahead with its reconstruction effort .
the dgb came into being in order to ensure the country 's workers a good deal and what then chairman hans boeckler described as " a larger portion of the material , intellectual and cultural goods of society . "
on monday , the current dgb leader michael sommer praised the work of germany 's trade unions over the past six decades , saying they had " genuinely made a major contribution " to national reconstruction efforts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 05.10.2009 german coalition partners face tough talks and compromise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu and fdp will share power in the reichstag chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats and the liberal free democrats start coalition talks on monday to form a new government , but they will first have to agree on a wide range of policy issues . a good week after winning the general election , the two sides are gathering in berlin with a slew of negotiators to hammer out the differences between what they have been saying in public and where they are willing to compromise in private .
the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have gone on the offensive with the bavarian state party leader , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , who is also a possible candidate for justice minister , arguing that the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- can not simply dictate what can , and can not , be done .
" they know our election platform and they know which of their policies we have criticized in recent years , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and westerwelle are heading into tough coalition talks the key issues in the coalition talks , fdp leader guido westerwelle has said , will be taxes , finance policies , the national deficit .
equally high up on the agenda will be domestic security , labor market and health system reforms , and securing future energy resources .
stark differences have already emerged the fdp wants to dismantle the national health fund , which was only introduced at the beginning of this year ; a tall order that chancellor merkel rejects .
but , either way , with a rapidly aging population and shrinking workforce , germany urgently needs to revamp its employee-financed health care system .
the fdp insists on making it easier to fire employees , while opposing the introduction of sector-specific minimum wages .
the cdu wants to keep the minimum wage accords agreed on with the social democrats in the outgoing government and opposes labor market reforms .
the fdp has indicated , however , that this is not a top priority .
clashes are all but certain on topics like domestic security where the fdp vehemently opposes online searches and other measures , which they claim undercut personal data protection .
the cdu argues that these measures are necessary to combat terrorism and the growing scourge of internet crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government surveillance has stirred opposition on energy issues , both parties have said they would like to extend the operation of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants .
there is currently a law that calls for phasing out nuclear energy by 2020 .
although they agree on an extension , they differ on how the profits earned from that should be used .
the cdu wants to use them to keep electricity prices down , while the fdp wants to reduce subsidies for renewable energy .
tax cuts and the deficit on the deficit , the fdp wants to cut spending , which is expected to be twice the european union limit next year .
the fdp says it wants to axe state subsidies , end the " waste " of taxpayer 's money and reduce military spending .
merkel has rejected wholesale spending cuts , while some in her party have suggested raising the sales tax - an idea merkel has dismissed .
the tax issue will perhaps be the toughest nut to crack in the coalition talks in light of germany 's gaping budget deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cutting expenditures and taxes will be difficult fdp general-secretary dirk niebel has called for " a major tax structure reform " and said he was confident that " a coalition consensus could be reached for the next four years . "
but , that may be easier said than done .
saxony 's cdu state premier stanislav tillich urgently warned against lowering taxes , saying " the coalition talks must not agree on budgetary measures that burden our children and grandchildren . "
the position of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , however , is more in line with the fdp .
csu general-secretary alexander dobrindt has said " only investment in the economy and in jobs can lead to more employment and the retention of jobs .
that ultimately also leads to more financial flexibility . "
" cuts in social welfare programs would not be necessary , " he added .
the tax cuts proposed by the cdu would amount to about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.8 billion -rrb- annually .
the fdp has promised cuts worth up to 35 billion euros and wants to implement them soon .
the party also wants to simplify the tax system .
fdp finance spokesman hermann otto solms said his party would not " chicken out " of its campaign pledge. gb / dpa / ap / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" nothing fanned the flames of love for europe among the irish as much as the thought of having to fight their way out of the crisis without cash injections from brussels . "

here 's what some of europe 's papers have to say about the resounding ' yes ' vote and the future of the reform treaty . germany 's neue osnabruecker zeitung welcomed ireland 's acceptance of the lisbon treaty , but said it was primarily motivated by money .
" nothing fanned the flames of love for europe among the irish as much as the thought of having to fight their way out of the crisis without cash injections from brussels . "
the paper was critical of the fact that the irish were the only people in the 27 nation block allowed to vote on a treaty " with such reach " .
it said all citizens of europe should have been allowed to have their say at the ballot box .
in the netherlands , de volkskrant said the second irish poll was no longer really about the treaty , but about whether or not the people of ireland wanted to remain in the eu at all .
" the mood has changed radically since the last referendum .
the financial crisis has taught the ' celtic tiger ' that it is safer to be in the eu harbor during a storm . "
in paris , the conservative le figaro said it was now up to the czech president to do the right thing by the citizens of europe .
" the resounding ' yes ' from ireland ought to have cleared the path for the ratification of the lisbon treaty .
the resistance - albeit fierce - from one man can not oppose the will of 500 million europeans . "
it added that vaclav klaus might like , against the wishes of his government and his people , to hold the treaty hostage until the conservatives take up the reins of power in britain .
but such a manoeuvre , it concluded , would be " dishonourable . "
bildunterschrift : ' yes ' was the word on the lips of 67 percent of voters in ireland the british daily , the times says the ireland vote represents another surrender to brussels and laments the fact that the british population never got their chance at a referendum .
" if the british saw the lisbon treaty as a genuine agreement among independent nations , which had been ratified either by a referendum or a general election , they might accept it .
but it is not , and they do not .
they are now asking themselves whether the benefits of belonging to a complex bureaucratic regional block of ageing powers and declining economies outweigh the sacrifice of british sovereignty .
whether it is in britain 's interest to remain in the european union has become a matter of legitimate debate . "
poland 's left-liberal gazeta wyborcza said the green light from the emerald isle meant the eu was now going to have to face some major challenges .
" the first test of the effectiveness of the eu under the new treaty will be expansion .
french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel said expansion would not be possible without the lisbon treaty .
now that its implementation is as good as guaranteed , they will have to take their foot off the brakes . "
it added that croatia , iceland , turkey , serbia , bosnia and herzegovina , montenegro and kosovo are waiting to join .
" in 2010 , ukraine will apply for membership and sooner or later , belarus and moldavia will follow suit . "
austria 's der standard praised the irish for their ' yes ' vote , saying they had left little room for czech president to throw a last minute spanner in the works .
but the question now , the paper wrote , is whether or not the treaty will prove a success .
" can labored joint policies push through planned reforms on migration , domestic security , external relations and increased democracy in eu institutions ? "
in order to do so , the paper wrote , member states will have to stop demonstrating signs of " national small-mindedness and egotism . " tkw / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the real winner was norway . norwegians enjoy the highest standard of living in the world .
the oil-rich scandinavian country , with its well-developed social welfare system , landed first place on the 2009 united nations index for human development .
australia and iceland took second and third places , respectively , and germany took a disappointing 22nd place out of 182 countries .
germany 's relatively low rank was partly due to a sinking per capita income in the wake of reunification , the report said .
other industrialized nations have increased their standing .
france , for instance , climbed to eighth place from 11th in the ranking .
ireland ranked fifth , austria 14th and spain 15th .
" progress is unevenly distributed , " said jeni klugman , the main author of the report .
" many countries have experienced setbacks in the past decades in the face of economic recession , conflict - crises and the hiv / aids epidemic setbacks experienced , " she said .
dramatic differences in life expectancy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in many african countries have a lower life expectancy than their european counterparts the worst results were for the african country of niger .
a child who is born in niger can expect to live to be just 50 years old - 30 years less than a child born in norway , according to the report .
afghanistan , sierra leone and the central african republic were also at the bottom of the list . the index combined values for life expectancy , literacy , school enrollment rates and gross domestic product per capita to arrive at an " aggregate measure of human welfare . "

they ’ re trying to influence the eu agriculture ministers ' meeting on the milk market and get further concessions . about 1,000 dairy farmers from germany , france and other countries converged on brussels on monday , clogging the streets with around 200 tractors .
they also brought cowbells , whistles , and even eggs – which they hurled at the eu headquarters – in a bid to add volume to their cries . they are campaigning for help from the eu so they can turn a profit .
milk production is higher than demand in europe and , therefore , prices are currently low , which is putting some farmers ' livelihoods at stake . germany 's agriculture minister ilse aigner , like her french counterpart bruno le maire , has tried to position herself clearly in the dairy farmers ' camp for monday 's informal lunch meeting in brussels . " the milk sector is in dire need of further supporting measures , " aigner says in an interview with the passauer neuen presse newspaper . " sadly , however , the various representatives of the milk industry still have very different opinions on what should be done .
nevertheless , i am going to brussels with a clear task at hand . " aigner says that 20 european nations are in favor of the milk plan spearheaded by germany and france , which calls for manufacturing subsidies to encourage increased production , and for unused eu funds to be reallocated to national governments so they can help milk farmers .
the plan also advocates tighter - or at least unchanged - milk quotas , regional limits on production set by brussels in a bid to encourage widespread dairy farming . however , great britain , denmark , the netherlands , and others oppose milk quotas , saying that the controlled market is the root cause of the problem .
bildunterschrift : " we might as well be throwing it away , " farmers say frequent protests the uproar in brussels is but the latest instalment in a string of dairy farmer protests .
they argue that prices are now so low that it 's almost impossible to produce profit making milk .
many german farmers already protested by spraying thousands of tons of the white stuff on paddocks , instead of selling it to milk and cheese factories . some french farmers even caused consternation by dumping milk in a lake , killing freshwater fish in the process . the dairy farmers want higher prices , subsidies to help boost production , and schemes to help increase demand - for example pushing milk back onto the menus in european schools .
most eu agriculture ministers seem determined to assuage the farmers ; however , many experts see these desires as unrealistic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe makes too much , and drinks too little " it 's going to take a long time until the milk sector is stable again , " says industry expert professor hannes weindlmaier from the technical university of munich . " the main problem is a simple case of over-production - we make too much milk . " yet weindlmaier also acknowledges that the current milk prices - especially for german dairy farmers - barely cover costs , with smaller operations in the south of the country suffering most .
if germany wants to maintain nationwide milk production , government schemes will be necessary to keep higher-cost dairy farmers in business , he says . monday ’ s meeting in brussels is only meant as a chance to discuss the new proposal from france and germany to help the dairy farmers .
agriculture ministers are not expected to make a firm decision until a meeting in luxembourg on october 19. msh / ap / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he took a small printing company and built it into one of the world 's top five media empires . reinhard mohn , the great-great grandson of company founder carl bertelsmann , died over the weekend .
he was born in 1921 in the small german town of guetersloh in north rhine-westphalia , where the bertelsmann corporation is still based .
in 1939 , at the age of 18 , he was drafted into the german army .
he eventually became a lieutenant in the africa corps .
eventually captured by the americans , he spent the rest of the war in a prison camp in kansas .
on his return to germany in 1946 , he found a town and company in ruins .
his father was bedridden , and although mohn had no plans to go into the publishing business , he acquiesced to his father 's wishes and took over the company .
initially , he and nearly a hundred employees worked to clean up the debris from the allied bombings to get the company up and running again .
humble beginnings the firm was originally a small publishing house that was founded by a printer named carl bertelsmann in 1835 .
it had its own printing plant and was mainly known for producing christian song books .
around the turn of the century , johannes mohn , reinhard 's grandfather married into the bertelsmann family and took over the running of the business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertelsmann 's corporate headquarters is still in guetersloh in 1950 , mohn started the bertelsmann book club .
the idea was very simple .
by joining the book club , customers could buy books at a discount but , they had to agree to buy books on a regular basis .
at its height , the book club had 20 million members around the world .
the steady stream of income generated by the book club sales allowed mohn to expand the company and to acquire other media properties .
these media companies include the us book publisher random house , the german tv broadcaster rtl , magazine publisher gruner + jahr and the direct group book and media clubs .

philanthropy in 1971 mohn converted the family business into a stock corporation and he became its chairman and ceo .
when there was a danger of the company going public , the family stopped it by buying back a 25 percent stake owned by a belgian holding company for $ 6.5 billion in 2006 .
the company is now privately held , with the mohn family owning 23.1 percent and the rest being owned by the bertelsmann foundation .
mohn retired in 1981 at the age of 60 but became the honorary chairman of the supervisory board .
he was also on the board of trustees of the bertelsmann foundation .
private life mohn was married twice and fathered three children with his first wife whom he married in 1949 .
he met his second wife liz mohn at a company function when she was just 17 and he was 38 .
he had three children with her and finally married her in 1982 .

but the real winner was norway . norwegians enjoy the highest standard of living in the world .
the oil-rich scandinavian country , with its well-developed social welfare system , landed first place on the 2009 united nations index for human development .
australia and iceland took second and third places , respectively , and germany took a disappointing 22nd place out of 182 countries .
germany 's relatively low rank was partly due to a sinking per capita income in the wake of reunification , the report said .
other industrialized nations have increased their standing .
france , for instance , climbed to eighth place from 11th in the ranking .
ireland ranked fifth , austria 14th and spain 15th .
" progress is unevenly distributed , " said jeni klugman , the main author of the report .
" many countries have experienced setbacks in the past decades in the face of economic recession , conflict - crises and the hiv / aids epidemic setbacks experienced , " she said .
dramatic differences in life expectancy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in many african countries have a lower life expectancy than their european counterparts the worst results were for the african country of niger .
a child who is born in niger can expect to live to be just 50 years old - 30 years less than a child born in norway , according to the report .
afghanistan , sierra leone and the central african republic were also at the bottom of the list . the index combined values for life expectancy , literacy , school enrollment rates and gross domestic product per capita to arrive at an " aggregate measure of human welfare . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 05.10.2009 pittsburgh summit shows positive signs for developing countries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-20 leaders will meet twice in 2010 the g-20 summit has agreed on more money for development banks and now includes developing countries in the decision making process .
that can be seen as a positive outcome of the economic crisis , argues dr. peter wolff . the third g-20 summit that just concluded in pittsburgh has quite manifestly established the g-20 as the forum for global economic cooperation .
in pittsburgh the final touches were put on the alterations to the institutional architecture agreed on at the london summit in april 2009 : with the backing of the large developing countries , the international financial institutions -lrb- ifis -rrb- are set to be further strengthened on the basis of the additional funds already agreed on for the imf as well as capital increases for world bank and regional development banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heads of states agreed on changing the global financial markets the price the industrialised countries are to pay for the developing country ’ s assent to efforts to strengthen these institutions so unloved in the south is , at first glance , not very high .
the former are to cede a certain percentage share of their voting rights to emerging countries from the developing world : two percent at the imf and three percent at the world bank .
that will do little to change the fundamental power relations there , and it is likely to be achieved mainly at the expense of a few small european countries .
old north south discourse gives way to new cooperation but one thing that is surprising is how quick the developing countries in the g-20 were to buy into the ‘ deal ’ to strengthen the role of the ifis .
the deal is , be it said , also the only condition under which china , brazil , and other emerging countries will now be prepared to make additional resources available to the imf for the purpose of the combating the ongoing crisis , e.g. in eastern europe .
the old north-south discourse – it will now , it seems , soon be a thing of the past .
the perceptive observer will have noticed that the final document also shows unmistakable signs of the approach of the copenhagen climate conference .
true , it has nothing to say about binding emissions targets .
but it does contain lots of shoptalk about sustainable growth policies .
and one thing relevant for the developing countries : it cedes to the world bank a leading role in climate policy , calling on the g-20 finance ministers to examine , prior to copenhagen , the options available to fund climate policy , propagating programmes designed to supply the poor with renewable energies , and setting out a commitment on the part of the g-20 countries to cut their subsidies for fossil energies and to replace them with targeted social transfers for the poor .
this will prove to be a huge challenge for countries like india and indonesia that spend large shares of their official budgets for just such subsidies , primarily to the benefit of their urban middle classes .
emerging economies to show little interest for poorer countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-20 wants to boost economic recovery and prevent further financial meltdowns so far the developing countries now represented in the g-20 , and in particular china , have of course weathered the crisis relatively well , thanks to their comparatively good pre-crisis economic policies , which gave them they space they needed to deploy stabilising economic stimulus programmes .
in doing so , though , they often showed little regard for the interests of poorer and smaller developing countries , opting instead for support programmes designed to promote national economic sectors and putting a whole array of protectionist measures in place to boost domestic growth .
all this naturally at the expense of other developing countries that lacked policy space for economic stimulus programmes .
g 20 still favour domestic interests and markets this protectionism is assuming the form less of tariffs than of national subsidies and political preference for domestic businesses .
the bottom line : most g-20 countries have not honoured the commitment they made at their first summit to refrain from adopting protectionist measures .
the aim now must be to reverse this process on the basis of the goal , re-affirmed in pittsburgh , to bring the doha round to a successful conclusion in 2010 .
it is above all the economic heavyweights among the developing countries that now must be expected to open their markets , at least in favour of poorer developing countries .
more economic growth needed in developing nations the final document of the pittsburgh summit repeatedly underlines that one central element of the global path out of the crisis must be more growth in developing countries .

that can be seen as a positive outcome of the economic crisis , argues dr. peter wolff . the third g-20 summit that just concluded in pittsburgh has quite manifestly established the g-20 as the forum for global economic cooperation .
in pittsburgh the final touches were put on the alterations to the institutional architecture agreed on at the london summit in april 2009 : with the backing of the large developing countries , the international financial institutions -lrb- ifis -rrb- are set to be further strengthened on the basis of the additional funds already agreed on for the imf as well as capital increases for world bank and regional development banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heads of states agreed on changing the global financial markets the price the industrialised countries are to pay for the developing country ’ s assent to efforts to strengthen these institutions so unloved in the south is , at first glance , not very high .
the former are to cede a certain percentage share of their voting rights to emerging countries from the developing world : two percent at the imf and three percent at the world bank .
that will do little to change the fundamental power relations there , and it is likely to be achieved mainly at the expense of a few small european countries .
old north south discourse gives way to new cooperation but one thing that is surprising is how quick the developing countries in the g-20 were to buy into the ‘ deal ’ to strengthen the role of the ifis .
the deal is , be it said , also the only condition under which china , brazil , and other emerging countries will now be prepared to make additional resources available to the imf for the purpose of the combating the ongoing crisis , e.g. in eastern europe .
the old north-south discourse – it will now , it seems , soon be a thing of the past .
the perceptive observer will have noticed that the final document also shows unmistakable signs of the approach of the copenhagen climate conference .
true , it has nothing to say about binding emissions targets .
but it does contain lots of shoptalk about sustainable growth policies .
and one thing relevant for the developing countries : it cedes to the world bank a leading role in climate policy , calling on the g-20 finance ministers to examine , prior to copenhagen , the options available to fund climate policy , propagating programmes designed to supply the poor with renewable energies , and setting out a commitment on the part of the g-20 countries to cut their subsidies for fossil energies and to replace them with targeted social transfers for the poor .
this will prove to be a huge challenge for countries like india and indonesia that spend large shares of their official budgets for just such subsidies , primarily to the benefit of their urban middle classes .
emerging economies to show little interest for poorer countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-20 wants to boost economic recovery and prevent further financial meltdowns so far the developing countries now represented in the g-20 , and in particular china , have of course weathered the crisis relatively well , thanks to their comparatively good pre-crisis economic policies , which gave them they space they needed to deploy stabilising economic stimulus programmes .
in doing so , though , they often showed little regard for the interests of poorer and smaller developing countries , opting instead for support programmes designed to promote national economic sectors and putting a whole array of protectionist measures in place to boost domestic growth .
all this naturally at the expense of other developing countries that lacked policy space for economic stimulus programmes .
g 20 still favour domestic interests and markets this protectionism is assuming the form less of tariffs than of national subsidies and political preference for domestic businesses .
the bottom line : most g-20 countries have not honoured the commitment they made at their first summit to refrain from adopting protectionist measures .
the aim now must be to reverse this process on the basis of the goal , re-affirmed in pittsburgh , to bring the doha round to a successful conclusion in 2010 .
it is above all the economic heavyweights among the developing countries that now must be expected to open their markets , at least in favour of poorer developing countries .
more economic growth needed in developing nations the final document of the pittsburgh summit repeatedly underlines that one central element of the global path out of the crisis must be more growth in developing countries .

the statement said the discovery of " how chromosomes are protected by telomeres and the enzyme telomerase " had stimulated the development of " new therapeutic strategies . "

he says that trade unions need to get involved . speaking in berlin at celebrations to mark 60 years since the foundation of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- on monday , horst koehler said decisions taken at the recent g-20 meeting in pittsburg had failed to convince him that enough was being done to prevent a repeat of the current global economic crisis .
" i do n't see the monster being tamed , " he told his audience in berlin , adding that the financial markets were still characterized by shell games , lack of transparency and speculation on commodities markets .
koehler bemoaned what he described as a lack of self-reflection from global financial actors and warned against the principle of hope .
he said nobody should think that growth could cover over or eradicate the memories of what has already happened .
the president , a former head of the international monetary fund , said the financial sector needs strong state and inter-state regulatory policies and stressed the important role of the world 's trade unions in " any fundamental reform of the global financial order . "
he called on employee representatives attending the celebrations to " get involved . "
making work a priority he called for a cooperative employment climate and a culture of co-determination in which everyone could have the feeling they were needed .
" work for all , " he said " must be and must remain a main political target . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions need to be involved in reform efforts , koehler said much has changed since the inception of the dgb in 1949 .
back then , germany was struggling to emerge from the rubble of the second world war , and needed all hands on deck to push ahead with its reconstruction effort .
the dgb came into being in order to ensure the country 's workers a good deal and what then chairman hans boeckler described as " a larger portion of the material , intellectual and cultural goods of society . "
on monday , the current dgb leader michael sommer praised the work of germany 's trade unions over the past six decades , saying they had " genuinely made a major contribution " to national reconstruction efforts .
he said it was thanks to the unions that germany was a respected member of the international community which demonstrated an obligation to the preservation of employees ' rights. tkw / afp / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hre set to become fully state-owned the squeeze-out marks the final step in the first nationalization of a german bank since the republic was founded in 1949 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " ms. merkel ... today you 're expropriating my child , " the sign reads the government moved to nationalize hre earlier this year to prevent the bank from collapsing , which , authorities said , would have threatened the entire german banking sector .
it had to take direct control after intervening repeatedly to shore up the company with loan guarantees of around 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 146 billion -rrb- .
in june , the government 's financial-sector rescue fund secured 90 percent of hre when the majority of shareholders accepted an offer that valued the shares at 1.39 euros each .
the german lender also announced on monday that it needs seven billion euros in fresh cash to cover losses for 2009 and the following years .
that money comes in addition to three billion euros already received and the massive multi-billion euro loan guarantees by the german financial market stabilization fund soffin . hre will need several years to repay the state aid , wieandt said .
" the group will not be in a position to repay in full before the year 2015 . " db / afp / ap / reuters / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's top-circulation women 's magazine said it will stop using professional models in its photo shoots .
the decision is part of a wider debate over fashion and body image in the media . " brigitte " is the fashion-and-lifestyle bible for the german everywoman . like most mass-circulation women 's magazines , its photo spreads are peopled by professional models - usually very thin ones .
at least , they were until now .
starting in the new year , that will no longer be the case , say editors-in- chief andreas lebert and brigitte huber .
" we are going to make a magazine for women as they are , and not as other people wish them to be , " lebert told a press conference in hamburg .
the plan is to feature musicians , actors , politicians , and readers , to be chosen by the magazine 's editors , instead of models in future editions of the magazine .
that means photo spreads will feature women " who have an identity " and not just " protruding bones , " lebert said .
the move is just the latest salvo in the ongoing ground war against overly thin fashion models .
recently , the topic has made headlines in connection to several international fashion weeks .
four large associations associated with the berlin fashion week last year agreed not to use overly thin models for the catwalk or fashion ads .
in madrid in 2008 , an underweight model was sent home , amid much publicity .
and this year 's london 's fashion week saw a campaign for more femininity - and curves - on the haute couture runways .
but " brigitte " editors said the magazine 's new strategy of changing size-zero models for normal folks does n't aim to declare war on the fashion industry - it merely aims to send a signal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a preference for thin models dominates the fashion industry " there is a great deal of discomfort in the fashion industry on the subject , but no one takes responsibility , " lebert said .
" maybe one medium has to say : ' we are deciding to present ourselves differently . " '
new trendsetters : bruni , obama for her part , " brigitte " editor huber commented that " these days , attractiveness has many faces . "
the days when fashion companies dictated style are over , she says ; today , fashion is dictated by people like the wife of the french president , carla bruni , or michelle obama , " as well as athletes , students , and " women on the streets of the major metropolises . "
in addition to making a statement about women and body image , the move may well be aimed at boosting circulation .
" brigitte " has seen a steady drop in readers in recent years , and the current bust in the ad business is making magazine publishers have to search for a new angle .
the magazine sold some 720,000 copies in the third quarter of 2009 , down from 757,000 a year earlier. jen / dpa / ap / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have gone on the offensive with the bavarian state party leader , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , who is also a possible candidate for justice minister , arguing that the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- can not simply dictate what can , and can not , be done .
" they know our election platform and they know which of their policies we have criticized in recent years , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and westerwelle are heading into tough coalition talks the key issues in the coalition talks , fdp leader guido westerwelle has said , will be taxes , finance policies , the national deficit .
equally high up on the agenda will be domestic security , labor market and health system reforms , and securing future energy resources .
stark differences have already emerged the fdp wants to dismantle the national health fund , which was only introduced at the beginning of this year ; a tall order that chancellor merkel rejects .
but , either way , with a rapidly aging population and shrinking workforce , germany urgently needs to revamp its employee-financed health care system .
the fdp insists on making it easier to fire employees , while opposing the introduction of sector-specific minimum wages .
the cdu wants to keep the minimum wage accords agreed on with the social democrats in the outgoing government and opposes labor market reforms .
the fdp has indicated , however , that this is not a top priority .
clashes are all but certain on topics like domestic security where the fdp vehemently opposes online searches and other measures , which they claim undercut personal data protection .
the cdu argues that these measures are necessary to combat terrorism and the growing scourge of internet crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government surveillance has stirred opposition on energy issues , both parties have said they would like to extend the operation of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants .
there is currently a law that calls for phasing out nuclear energy by 2020 .
although they agree on an extension , they differ on how the profits earned from that should be used .
the cdu wants to use them to keep electricity prices down , while the fdp wants to reduce subsidies for renewable energy .
tax cuts and the deficit on the deficit , the fdp wants to cut spending , which is expected to be twice the european union limit next year .
the fdp says it wants to axe state subsidies , end the " waste " of taxpayer 's money and reduce military spending .
merkel has rejected wholesale spending cuts , while some in her party have suggested raising the sales tax - an idea merkel has dismissed .
the tax issue will perhaps be the toughest nut to crack in the coalition talks in light of germany 's gaping budget deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cutting expenditures and taxes will be difficult fdp general-secretary dirk niebel has called for " a major tax structure reform " and said he was confident that " a coalition consensus could be reached for the next four years . "
but , that may be easier said than done .
saxony 's cdu state premier stanislav tillich urgently warned against lowering taxes , saying " the coalition talks must not agree on budgetary measures that burden our children and grandchildren . "
the position of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , however , is more in line with the fdp .
csu general-secretary alexander dobrindt has said " only investment in the economy and in jobs can lead to more employment and the retention of jobs .
that ultimately also leads to more financial flexibility . "
" cuts in social welfare programs would not be necessary , " he added .
the tax cuts proposed by the cdu would amount to about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.8 billion -rrb- annually .
the fdp has promised cuts worth up to 35 billion euros and wants to implement them soon .

stark differences have already emerged the fdp wants to dismantle the national health fund , which was only introduced at the beginning of this year ; a tall order that chancellor merkel rejects .
but , either way , with a rapidly aging population and shrinking workforce , germany urgently needs to revamp its employee-financed health care system .

germany 's top-circulation women 's magazine said it will stop using professional models in its photo shoots .
the decision is part of a wider debate over fashion and body image in the media . " brigitte " is the fashion-and-lifestyle bible for the german everywoman . like most mass-circulation women 's magazines , its photo spreads are peopled by professional models - usually very thin ones .
at least , they were until now .
starting in the new year , that will no longer be the case , say editors-in- chief andreas lebert and brigitte huber .
" we are going to make a magazine for women as they are , and not as other people wish them to be , " lebert told a press conference in hamburg .
the plan is to feature musicians , actors , politicians , and readers , to be chosen by the magazine 's editors , instead of models in future editions of the magazine .
that means photo spreads will feature women " who have an identity " and not just " protruding bones , " lebert said .
the move is just the latest salvo in the ongoing ground war against overly thin fashion models .
recently , the topic has made headlines in connection to several international fashion weeks .
four large associations associated with the berlin fashion week last year agreed not to use overly thin models for the catwalk or fashion ads .
in madrid in 2008 , an underweight model was sent home , amid much publicity .
and this year 's london 's fashion week saw a campaign for more femininity - and curves - on the haute couture runways .
but " brigitte " editors said the magazine 's new strategy of changing size-zero models for normal folks does n't aim to declare war on the fashion industry - it merely aims to send a signal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a preference for thin models dominates the fashion industry " there is a great deal of discomfort in the fashion industry on the subject , but no one takes responsibility , " lebert said .
" maybe one medium has to say : ' we are deciding to present ourselves differently . " '
new trendsetters : bruni , obama for her part , " brigitte " editor huber commented that " these days , attractiveness has many faces . "
the days when fashion companies dictated style are over , she says ; today , fashion is dictated by people like the wife of the french president , carla bruni , or michelle obama , " as well as athletes , students , and " women on the streets of the major metropolises . "
in addition to making a statement about women and body image , the move may well be aimed at boosting circulation .
" brigitte " has seen a steady drop in readers in recent years , and the current bust in the ad business is making magazine publishers have to search for a new angle .
the magazine sold some 720,000 copies in the third quarter of 2009 , down from 757,000 a year earlier. jen / dpa / ap / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the real winner was norway . norwegians enjoy the highest standard of living in the world .
the oil-rich scandinavian country , with its well-developed social welfare system , landed first place on the 2009 united nations index for human development .
australia and iceland took second and third places , respectively , and germany took a disappointing 22nd place out of 182 countries .
germany 's relatively low rank was partly due to a sinking per capita income in the wake of reunification , the report said .
other industrialized nations have increased their standing .
france , for instance , climbed to eighth place from 11th in the ranking .
ireland ranked fifth , austria 14th and spain 15th .
" progress is unevenly distributed , " said jeni klugman , the main author of the report .
" many countries have experienced setbacks in the past decades in the face of economic recession , conflict - crises and the hiv / aids epidemic setbacks experienced , " she said .
dramatic differences in life expectancy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in many african countries have a lower life expectancy than their european counterparts the worst results were for the african country of niger .
a child who is born in niger can expect to live to be just 50 years old - 30 years less than a child born in norway , according to the report .
afghanistan , sierra leone and the central african republic were also at the bottom of the list . the index combined values for life expectancy , literacy , school enrollment rates and gross domestic product per capita to arrive at an " aggregate measure of human welfare . "

stark differences have already emerged the fdp wants to dismantle the national health fund , which was only introduced at the beginning of this year ; a tall order that chancellor merkel rejects .
but , either way , with a rapidly aging population and shrinking workforce , germany urgently needs to revamp its employee-financed health care system .
the fdp insists on making it easier to fire employees , while opposing the introduction of sector-specific minimum wages .
the cdu wants to keep the minimum wage accords agreed on with the social democrats in the outgoing government and opposes labor market reforms .
the fdp has indicated , however , that this is not a top priority .
clashes are all but certain on topics like domestic security where the fdp vehemently opposes online searches and other measures , which they claim undercut personal data protection .
the cdu argues that these measures are necessary to combat terrorism and the growing scourge of internet crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government surveillance has stirred opposition on energy issues , both parties have said they would like to extend the operation of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants .
there is currently a law that calls for phasing out nuclear energy by 2020 .
although they agree on an extension , they differ on how the profits earned from that should be used .
the cdu wants to use them to keep electricity prices down , while the fdp wants to reduce subsidies for renewable energy .
tax cuts and the deficit on the deficit , the fdp wants to cut spending , which is expected to be twice the european union limit next year .
the fdp says it wants to axe state subsidies , end the " waste " of taxpayer 's money and reduce military spending .
merkel has rejected wholesale spending cuts , while some in her party have suggested raising the sales tax - an idea merkel has dismissed .
the tax issue will perhaps be the toughest nut to crack in the coalition talks in light of germany 's gaping budget deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cutting expenditures and taxes will be difficult fdp general-secretary dirk niebel has called for " a major tax structure reform " and said he was confident that " a coalition consensus could be reached for the next four years . "
but , that may be easier said than done .
saxony 's cdu state premier stanislav tillich urgently warned against lowering taxes , saying " the coalition talks must not agree on budgetary measures that burden our children and grandchildren . "
the position of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , however , is more in line with the fdp .
csu general-secretary alexander dobrindt has said " only investment in the economy and in jobs can lead to more employment and the retention of jobs .
that ultimately also leads to more financial flexibility . "
" cuts in social welfare programs would not be necessary , " he added .
the tax cuts proposed by the cdu would amount to about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.8 billion -rrb- annually .
the fdp has promised cuts worth up to 35 billion euros and wants to implement them soon .
the party also wants to simplify the tax system .
fdp finance spokesman hermann otto solms said his party would not " chicken out " of its campaign pledge. gb / dpa / ap / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to the interior ministry website , the socialists have won an absolute majority , winning 160 seats in the 300-seat parliament .
" we stand united to face the big responsibility to change our country into a nation of justice , solidaritzy , humanity and green development , " said papandreou to a cheering crowd .
the ruling conservative new democracy party came in second with just 34 percent of the vote , which translates to 93 seats .
papandreou called the results " a message of hope , for change , and a just society , a more democratic and transparent society . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 05.10.2009 milk prices up for debate - and protest - in brussels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milk protests are becoming commonplace in brussels disgruntled dairy farmers drove tractors into brussels on monday and hurled eggs at the eu headquarters .
they ’ re trying to influence the eu agriculture ministers ' meeting on the milk market and get further concessions . about 1,000 dairy farmers from germany , france and other countries converged on brussels on monday , clogging the streets with around 200 tractors .
they also brought cowbells , whistles , and even eggs – which they hurled at the eu headquarters – in a bid to add volume to their cries . they are campaigning for help from the eu so they can turn a profit .
milk production is higher than demand in europe and , therefore , prices are currently low , which is putting some farmers ' livelihoods at stake . germany 's agriculture minister ilse aigner , like her french counterpart bruno le maire , has tried to position herself clearly in the dairy farmers ' camp for monday 's informal lunch meeting in brussels . " the milk sector is in dire need of further supporting measures , " aigner says in an interview with the passauer neuen presse newspaper . " sadly , however , the various representatives of the milk industry still have very different opinions on what should be done .
nevertheless , i am going to brussels with a clear task at hand . " aigner says that 20 european nations are in favor of the milk plan spearheaded by germany and france , which calls for manufacturing subsidies to encourage increased production , and for unused eu funds to be reallocated to national governments so they can help milk farmers .
the plan also advocates tighter - or at least unchanged - milk quotas , regional limits on production set by brussels in a bid to encourage widespread dairy farming . however , great britain , denmark , the netherlands , and others oppose milk quotas , saying that the controlled market is the root cause of the problem .
bildunterschrift : " we might as well be throwing it away , " farmers say frequent protests the uproar in brussels is but the latest instalment in a string of dairy farmer protests .
they argue that prices are now so low that it 's almost impossible to produce profit making milk .
many german farmers already protested by spraying thousands of tons of the white stuff on paddocks , instead of selling it to milk and cheese factories . some french farmers even caused consternation by dumping milk in a lake , killing freshwater fish in the process . the dairy farmers want higher prices , subsidies to help boost production , and schemes to help increase demand - for example pushing milk back onto the menus in european schools .
most eu agriculture ministers seem determined to assuage the farmers ; however , many experts see these desires as unrealistic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe makes too much , and drinks too little " it 's going to take a long time until the milk sector is stable again , " says industry expert professor hannes weindlmaier from the technical university of munich . " the main problem is a simple case of over-production - we make too much milk . " yet weindlmaier also acknowledges that the current milk prices - especially for german dairy farmers - barely cover costs , with smaller operations in the south of the country suffering most .
if germany wants to maintain nationwide milk production , government schemes will be necessary to keep higher-cost dairy farmers in business , he says . monday ’ s meeting in brussels is only meant as a chance to discuss the new proposal from france and germany to help the dairy farmers .
agriculture ministers are not expected to make a firm decision until a meeting in luxembourg on october 19. msh / ap / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eventually captured by the americans , he spent the rest of the war in a prison camp in kansas .
on his return to germany in 1946 , he found a town and company in ruins .
his father was bedridden , and although mohn had no plans to go into the publishing business , he acquiesced to his father 's wishes and took over the company .
initially , he and nearly a hundred employees worked to clean up the debris from the allied bombings to get the company up and running again .
humble beginnings the firm was originally a small publishing house that was founded by a printer named carl bertelsmann in 1835 .

by joining the book club , customers could buy books at a discount but , they had to agree to buy books on a regular basis .

the steady stream of income generated by the book club sales allowed mohn to expand the company and to acquire other media properties .
these media companies include the us book publisher random house , the german tv broadcaster rtl , magazine publisher gruner + jahr and the direct group book and media clubs .
at one point it also owned 50 percent of the music company sony bmg .

philanthropy in 1971 mohn converted the family business into a stock corporation and he became its chairman and ceo .
when there was a danger of the company going public , the family stopped it by buying back a 25 percent stake owned by a belgian holding company for $ 6.5 billion in 2006 .
the company is now privately held , with the mohn family owning 23.1 percent and the rest being owned by the bertelsmann foundation .
mohn retired in 1981 at the age of 60 but became the honorary chairman of the supervisory board .
he was also on the board of trustees of the bertelsmann foundation .
private life mohn was married twice and fathered three children with his first wife whom he married in 1949 .
he met his second wife liz mohn at a company function when she was just 17 and he was 38 .
he had three children with her and finally married her in 1982 .
mohn was recognized internationally for his good works and was given numerous awards including the commander 's cross of the order of merit of the federal republic of germany in 1994 , the order of merit with star of the federal republic of germany in 1998 and he was also named an honorary member of the club of rome in april 1996 .

he took a small printing company and built it into one of the world 's top five media empires . reinhard mohn , the great-great grandson of company founder carl bertelsmann , died over the weekend .
he was born in 1921 in the small german town of guetersloh in north rhine-westphalia , where the bertelsmann corporation is still based .
in 1939 , at the age of 18 , he was drafted into the german army .
he eventually became a lieutenant in the africa corps .
eventually captured by the americans , he spent the rest of the war in a prison camp in kansas .
on his return to germany in 1946 , he found a town and company in ruins .
his father was bedridden , and although mohn had no plans to go into the publishing business , he acquiesced to his father 's wishes and took over the company .
initially , he and nearly a hundred employees worked to clean up the debris from the allied bombings to get the company up and running again .
humble beginnings the firm was originally a small publishing house that was founded by a printer named carl bertelsmann in 1835 .
it had its own printing plant and was mainly known for producing christian song books .
around the turn of the century , johannes mohn , reinhard 's grandfather married into the bertelsmann family and took over the running of the business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertelsmann 's corporate headquarters is still in guetersloh in 1950 , mohn started the bertelsmann book club .
the idea was very simple .
by joining the book club , customers could buy books at a discount but , they had to agree to buy books on a regular basis .
at its height , the book club had 20 million members around the world .
the steady stream of income generated by the book club sales allowed mohn to expand the company and to acquire other media properties .
these media companies include the us book publisher random house , the german tv broadcaster rtl , magazine publisher gruner + jahr and the direct group book and media clubs .
at one point it also owned 50 percent of the music company sony bmg .
the company has over 100,000 employees in more than 60 countries and revenues of approximately 16 billion euros -lrb- $ 24.7 billion -rrb- .
philanthropy in 1971 mohn converted the family business into a stock corporation and he became its chairman and ceo .
when there was a danger of the company going public , the family stopped it by buying back a 25 percent stake owned by a belgian holding company for $ 6.5 billion in 2006 .
the company is now privately held , with the mohn family owning 23.1 percent and the rest being owned by the bertelsmann foundation .
mohn retired in 1981 at the age of 60 but became the honorary chairman of the supervisory board .
he was also on the board of trustees of the bertelsmann foundation .
private life mohn was married twice and fathered three children with his first wife whom he married in 1949 .
he met his second wife liz mohn at a company function when she was just 17 and he was 38 .
he had three children with her and finally married her in 1982 .
mohn was recognized internationally for his good works and was given numerous awards including the commander 's cross of the order of merit of the federal republic of germany in 1994 , the order of merit with star of the federal republic of germany in 1998 and he was also named an honorary member of the club of rome in april 1996 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 05.10.2009 socialist george papandreou claims victory in greek elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou waves after winning the snap poll the greek socialists , led by george papandreou , have won the election , ousting the governing conservatives of premier kostas karamanlis who angered voters by failing to tackle corruption and the economy . with 87 percent of the vote counted , greece 's main opposition , the socialist pasok , has claimed victory .
according to the interior ministry website , the socialists have won an absolute majority , winning 160 seats in the 300-seat parliament .
" we stand united to face the big responsibility to change our country into a nation of justice , solidaritzy , humanity and green development , " said papandreou to a cheering crowd .
the ruling conservative new democracy party came in second with just 34 percent of the vote , which translates to 93 seats .
papandreou called the results " a message of hope , for change , and a just society , a more democratic and transparent society . "
sunday 's vote was the third face-off for 57-year-old us-born papandreou , and prime minister costas karamanlis , 53 , a powerful speaker who appeals to the average greek .
both men are heirs to two of the country 's most powerful political dynasties .
scandals and economic woes weakened by scandals and a fragile parliamentary majority , karamanlis called the snap poll in september , gambling he had a better chance of winning now than later in his four-year term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the third face-off for the two leaders first elected in 2004 , karamanlis said ahead of the vote that he needed a strong new mandate to tackle greece 's economic troubles .
the vote comes at a time when the mediterranean country , seen as the eurozone 's weakest link , needs a strong government to deal with an economy on the verge of recession .
papandreou now faces a budget deficit topping six percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , rising unemployment and deep dissatisfaction over the education system , social security and immigration .
extravagant promises ?
the socialist leader promised a three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.36 billion -rrb- stimulus package on a platform of taxing the rich and helping the poor , while incumbent prime minister costas karamanlis called for two years of austerity .
some economists have questioned the wisdom of papandreou 's spending plan , saying it could lead to more borrowing at a time when greece already has the eurozone 's second biggest debt after italy as a percentage of gdp .
after years of robust growth , greece 's output , about 2.5 percent of the eurozone 's total economy , is set to slow to zero growth or even enter negative territory this year , with key drivers and job providers like tourism particularly hard-hit. av / rb / dpa / reuters / ap editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's top-circulation women 's magazine said it will stop using professional models in its photo shoots .
the decision is part of a wider debate over fashion and body image in the media . " brigitte " is the fashion-and-lifestyle bible for the german everywoman . like most mass-circulation women 's magazines , its photo spreads are peopled by professional models - usually very thin ones .
at least , they were until now .
starting in the new year , that will no longer be the case , say editors-in- chief andreas lebert and brigitte huber .
" we are going to make a magazine for women as they are , and not as other people wish them to be , " lebert told a press conference in hamburg .
the plan is to feature musicians , actors , politicians , and readers , to be chosen by the magazine 's editors , instead of models in future editions of the magazine .
that means photo spreads will feature women " who have an identity " and not just " protruding bones , " lebert said .
the move is just the latest salvo in the ongoing ground war against overly thin fashion models .
recently , the topic has made headlines in connection to several international fashion weeks .
four large associations associated with the berlin fashion week last year agreed not to use overly thin models for the catwalk or fashion ads .
in madrid in 2008 , an underweight model was sent home , amid much publicity .
and this year 's london 's fashion week saw a campaign for more femininity - and curves - on the haute couture runways .
but " brigitte " editors said the magazine 's new strategy of changing size-zero models for normal folks does n't aim to declare war on the fashion industry - it merely aims to send a signal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a preference for thin models dominates the fashion industry " there is a great deal of discomfort in the fashion industry on the subject , but no one takes responsibility , " lebert said .
" maybe one medium has to say : ' we are deciding to present ourselves differently . " '
new trendsetters : bruni , obama for her part , " brigitte " editor huber commented that " these days , attractiveness has many faces . "
the days when fashion companies dictated style are over , she says ; today , fashion is dictated by people like the wife of the french president , carla bruni , or michelle obama , " as well as athletes , students , and " women on the streets of the major metropolises . "
in addition to making a statement about women and body image , the move may well be aimed at boosting circulation .
" brigitte " has seen a steady drop in readers in recent years , and the current bust in the ad business is making magazine publishers have to search for a new angle .
the magazine sold some 720,000 copies in the third quarter of 2009 , down from 757,000 a year earlier. jen / dpa / ap / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's top-circulation women 's magazine said it will stop using professional models in its photo shoots .
the decision is part of a wider debate over fashion and body image in the media . " brigitte " is the fashion-and-lifestyle bible for the german everywoman . like most mass-circulation women 's magazines , its photo spreads are peopled by professional models - usually very thin ones .
at least , they were until now .
starting in the new year , that will no longer be the case , say editors-in- chief andreas lebert and brigitte huber .
" we are going to make a magazine for women as they are , and not as other people wish them to be , " lebert told a press conference in hamburg .
the plan is to feature musicians , actors , politicians , and readers , to be chosen by the magazine 's editors , instead of models in future editions of the magazine .
that means photo spreads will feature women " who have an identity " and not just " protruding bones , " lebert said .
the move is just the latest salvo in the ongoing ground war against overly thin fashion models .
recently , the topic has made headlines in connection to several international fashion weeks .
four large associations associated with the berlin fashion week last year agreed not to use overly thin models for the catwalk or fashion ads .
in madrid in 2008 , an underweight model was sent home , amid much publicity .
and this year 's london 's fashion week saw a campaign for more femininity - and curves - on the haute couture runways .
but " brigitte " editors said the magazine 's new strategy of changing size-zero models for normal folks does n't aim to declare war on the fashion industry - it merely aims to send a signal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a preference for thin models dominates the fashion industry " there is a great deal of discomfort in the fashion industry on the subject , but no one takes responsibility , " lebert said .
" maybe one medium has to say : ' we are deciding to present ourselves differently . " '
new trendsetters : bruni , obama for her part , " brigitte " editor huber commented that " these days , attractiveness has many faces . "
the days when fashion companies dictated style are over , she says ; today , fashion is dictated by people like the wife of the french president , carla bruni , or michelle obama , " as well as athletes , students , and " women on the streets of the major metropolises . "
in addition to making a statement about women and body image , the move may well be aimed at boosting circulation .
" brigitte " has seen a steady drop in readers in recent years , and the current bust in the ad business is making magazine publishers have to search for a new angle .
the magazine sold some 720,000 copies in the third quarter of 2009 , down from 757,000 a year earlier. jen / dpa / ap / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the real winner was norway . norwegians enjoy the highest standard of living in the world .
the oil-rich scandinavian country , with its well-developed social welfare system , landed first place on the 2009 united nations index for human development .
australia and iceland took second and third places , respectively , and germany took a disappointing 22nd place out of 182 countries .
germany 's relatively low rank was partly due to a sinking per capita income in the wake of reunification , the report said .
other industrialized nations have increased their standing .
france , for instance , climbed to eighth place from 11th in the ranking .
ireland ranked fifth , austria 14th and spain 15th .
" progress is unevenly distributed , " said jeni klugman , the main author of the report .
" many countries have experienced setbacks in the past decades in the face of economic recession , conflict - crises and the hiv / aids epidemic setbacks experienced , " she said .
dramatic differences in life expectancy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in many african countries have a lower life expectancy than their european counterparts the worst results were for the african country of niger .
a child who is born in niger can expect to live to be just 50 years old - 30 years less than a child born in norway , according to the report .
afghanistan , sierra leone and the central african republic were also at the bottom of the list . the index combined values for life expectancy , literacy , school enrollment rates and gross domestic product per capita to arrive at an " aggregate measure of human welfare . "

he says that trade unions need to get involved . speaking in berlin at celebrations to mark 60 years since the foundation of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- on monday , horst koehler said decisions taken at the recent g-20 meeting in pittsburg had failed to convince him that enough was being done to prevent a repeat of the current global economic crisis .
" i do n't see the monster being tamed , " he told his audience in berlin , adding that the financial markets were still characterized by shell games , lack of transparency and speculation on commodities markets .
koehler bemoaned what he described as a lack of self-reflection from global financial actors and warned against the principle of hope .
he said nobody should think that growth could cover over or eradicate the memories of what has already happened .
the president , a former head of the international monetary fund , said the financial sector needs strong state and inter-state regulatory policies and stressed the important role of the world 's trade unions in " any fundamental reform of the global financial order . "
he called on employee representatives attending the celebrations to " get involved . "
making work a priority he called for a cooperative employment climate and a culture of co-determination in which everyone could have the feeling they were needed .
" work for all , " he said " must be and must remain a main political target . "

back then , germany was struggling to emerge from the rubble of the second world war , and needed all hands on deck to push ahead with its reconstruction effort .
the dgb came into being in order to ensure the country 's workers a good deal and what then chairman hans boeckler described as " a larger portion of the material , intellectual and cultural goods of society . "
on monday , the current dgb leader michael sommer praised the work of germany 's trade unions over the past six decades , saying they had " genuinely made a major contribution " to national reconstruction efforts .
he said it was thanks to the unions that germany was a respected member of the international community which demonstrated an obligation to the preservation of employees ' rights. tkw / afp / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i do n't see the monster being tamed , " he told his audience in berlin , adding that the financial markets were still characterized by shell games , lack of transparency and speculation on commodities markets .
koehler bemoaned what he described as a lack of self-reflection from global financial actors and warned against the principle of hope .
he said nobody should think that growth could cover over or eradicate the memories of what has already happened .
the president , a former head of the international monetary fund , said the financial sector needs strong state and inter-state regulatory policies and stressed the important role of the world 's trade unions in " any fundamental reform of the global financial order . "
he called on employee representatives attending the celebrations to " get involved . "

the dgb came into being in order to ensure the country 's workers a good deal and what then chairman hans boeckler described as " a larger portion of the material , intellectual and cultural goods of society . "
on monday , the current dgb leader michael sommer praised the work of germany 's trade unions over the past six decades , saying they had " genuinely made a major contribution " to national reconstruction efforts .
he said it was thanks to the unions that germany was a respected member of the international community which demonstrated an obligation to the preservation of employees ' rights. tkw / afp / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their work is seen as having an important impact on research into cancer and aging .
telomerase is called an " immortality enzyme ; " it could play a role in treating the uncontrolled spread of cancer cells .
the three researchers will share the prize , worth 10 million swedish crowns , or around a million euros -lrb- $ 1.4 million -rrb- .
solving problems on protecting chromosomes professor hans jornvall of the nobel assembly said their discoveries were crucial for research on cancer , aging and inherited genetic diseases , .
a statement by the assembly said the three scientists solved a fundamental problem in biology on " how chromosomes can be copied in a complete way and how they are protected against degradation . "
the statement said the discovery of " how chromosomes are protected by telomeres and the enzyme telomerase " had stimulated the development of " new therapeutic strategies . "
recipient says she was " thrilled " " i was just thrilled , " greider told swedish radio , saying she was doing laundry when she received the telephone call about the award from the karolinska institute .
american greider is a professor at johns hopkins university school of medicine in baltimore , australia-native blackburn is a professor at the university of california in san francisco , and szostak , born in the uk , is a professor at the harvard medical school .
last year , the medicine prize went to german virologist harald zur hausen , as well as french virologists francoise barre-sinoussi and luc montaigner , for their work on identifying viruses that cause aids and cervical cancer .
based on their research , a vaccine has been developed to protect against a certain kind of virus that can cause cervical cancer .

their work is seen as having an important impact on research into cancer and aging .
telomerase is called an " immortality enzyme ; " it could play a role in treating the uncontrolled spread of cancer cells .
the three researchers will share the prize , worth 10 million swedish crowns , or around a million euros -lrb- $ 1.4 million -rrb- .
solving problems on protecting chromosomes professor hans jornvall of the nobel assembly said their discoveries were crucial for research on cancer , aging and inherited genetic diseases , .
a statement by the assembly said the three scientists solved a fundamental problem in biology on " how chromosomes can be copied in a complete way and how they are protected against degradation . "
the statement said the discovery of " how chromosomes are protected by telomeres and the enzyme telomerase " had stimulated the development of " new therapeutic strategies . "
recipient says she was " thrilled " " i was just thrilled , " greider told swedish radio , saying she was doing laundry when she received the telephone call about the award from the karolinska institute .
american greider is a professor at johns hopkins university school of medicine in baltimore , australia-native blackburn is a professor at the university of california in san francisco , and szostak , born in the uk , is a professor at the harvard medical school .
last year , the medicine prize went to german virologist harald zur hausen , as well as french virologists francoise barre-sinoussi and luc montaigner , for their work on identifying viruses that cause aids and cervical cancer .
based on their research , a vaccine has been developed to protect against a certain kind of virus that can cause cervical cancer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 05.10.2009 pittsburgh summit shows positive signs for developing countries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-20 leaders will meet twice in 2010 the g-20 summit has agreed on more money for development banks and now includes developing countries in the decision making process .
that can be seen as a positive outcome of the economic crisis , argues dr. peter wolff . the third g-20 summit that just concluded in pittsburgh has quite manifestly established the g-20 as the forum for global economic cooperation .
in pittsburgh the final touches were put on the alterations to the institutional architecture agreed on at the london summit in april 2009 : with the backing of the large developing countries , the international financial institutions -lrb- ifis -rrb- are set to be further strengthened on the basis of the additional funds already agreed on for the imf as well as capital increases for world bank and regional development banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heads of states agreed on changing the global financial markets the price the industrialised countries are to pay for the developing country ’ s assent to efforts to strengthen these institutions so unloved in the south is , at first glance , not very high .
the former are to cede a certain percentage share of their voting rights to emerging countries from the developing world : two percent at the imf and three percent at the world bank .
that will do little to change the fundamental power relations there , and it is likely to be achieved mainly at the expense of a few small european countries .
old north south discourse gives way to new cooperation but one thing that is surprising is how quick the developing countries in the g-20 were to buy into the ‘ deal ’ to strengthen the role of the ifis .
the deal is , be it said , also the only condition under which china , brazil , and other emerging countries will now be prepared to make additional resources available to the imf for the purpose of the combating the ongoing crisis , e.g. in eastern europe .
the old north-south discourse – it will now , it seems , soon be a thing of the past .
the perceptive observer will have noticed that the final document also shows unmistakable signs of the approach of the copenhagen climate conference .
true , it has nothing to say about binding emissions targets .
but it does contain lots of shoptalk about sustainable growth policies .
and one thing relevant for the developing countries : it cedes to the world bank a leading role in climate policy , calling on the g-20 finance ministers to examine , prior to copenhagen , the options available to fund climate policy , propagating programmes designed to supply the poor with renewable energies , and setting out a commitment on the part of the g-20 countries to cut their subsidies for fossil energies and to replace them with targeted social transfers for the poor .
this will prove to be a huge challenge for countries like india and indonesia that spend large shares of their official budgets for just such subsidies , primarily to the benefit of their urban middle classes .
emerging economies to show little interest for poorer countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-20 wants to boost economic recovery and prevent further financial meltdowns so far the developing countries now represented in the g-20 , and in particular china , have of course weathered the crisis relatively well , thanks to their comparatively good pre-crisis economic policies , which gave them they space they needed to deploy stabilising economic stimulus programmes .
in doing so , though , they often showed little regard for the interests of poorer and smaller developing countries , opting instead for support programmes designed to promote national economic sectors and putting a whole array of protectionist measures in place to boost domestic growth .
all this naturally at the expense of other developing countries that lacked policy space for economic stimulus programmes .
g 20 still favour domestic interests and markets this protectionism is assuming the form less of tariffs than of national subsidies and political preference for domestic businesses .
the bottom line : most g-20 countries have not honoured the commitment they made at their first summit to refrain from adopting protectionist measures .
the aim now must be to reverse this process on the basis of the goal , re-affirmed in pittsburgh , to bring the doha round to a successful conclusion in 2010 .
it is above all the economic heavyweights among the developing countries that now must be expected to open their markets , at least in favour of poorer developing countries .
more economic growth needed in developing nations the final document of the pittsburgh summit repeatedly underlines that one central element of the global path out of the crisis must be more growth in developing countries .
it lists a whole array of measures designed to improve , in developing countries , access to food , energy , and financial services as well as to promote growth and prevent major population groups from sinking into poverty .
much of this is not new .
it is , however , noteworthy that now , with the g-20 , the focus is not only on special crisis-related issues like banker bonuses and financial market regulation , and that development-related issues are now increasingly placed in a global context and discussed at the highest level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter wolff heads die 's world economy department the g-8 had done much the same thing , e.g. in gleneagles in 2005 , where , with a paternalist gesture , more assistance was pledged for the developing countries .
indeed , the fact that the large developing countries are now directly involved in the decision-making process must certainly be seen as one of the more positive outcomes of the financial crisis .
dr. peter wolff heads the department ' world economy and development financing ' at the german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- .
based in bonn , the german development institute draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .
it consults on the basis of independent research findings in germany and worldwide and deals with current issues in cooperation between industrial and developing countries . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9801 environment listen to our weekly show about the environment or check out reports and past episodes .

that can be seen as a positive outcome of the economic crisis , argues dr. peter wolff . the third g-20 summit that just concluded in pittsburgh has quite manifestly established the g-20 as the forum for global economic cooperation .
in pittsburgh the final touches were put on the alterations to the institutional architecture agreed on at the london summit in april 2009 : with the backing of the large developing countries , the international financial institutions -lrb- ifis -rrb- are set to be further strengthened on the basis of the additional funds already agreed on for the imf as well as capital increases for world bank and regional development banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heads of states agreed on changing the global financial markets the price the industrialised countries are to pay for the developing country ’ s assent to efforts to strengthen these institutions so unloved in the south is , at first glance , not very high .
the former are to cede a certain percentage share of their voting rights to emerging countries from the developing world : two percent at the imf and three percent at the world bank .
that will do little to change the fundamental power relations there , and it is likely to be achieved mainly at the expense of a few small european countries .
old north south discourse gives way to new cooperation but one thing that is surprising is how quick the developing countries in the g-20 were to buy into the ‘ deal ’ to strengthen the role of the ifis .
the deal is , be it said , also the only condition under which china , brazil , and other emerging countries will now be prepared to make additional resources available to the imf for the purpose of the combating the ongoing crisis , e.g. in eastern europe .
the old north-south discourse – it will now , it seems , soon be a thing of the past .
the perceptive observer will have noticed that the final document also shows unmistakable signs of the approach of the copenhagen climate conference .
true , it has nothing to say about binding emissions targets .
but it does contain lots of shoptalk about sustainable growth policies .
and one thing relevant for the developing countries : it cedes to the world bank a leading role in climate policy , calling on the g-20 finance ministers to examine , prior to copenhagen , the options available to fund climate policy , propagating programmes designed to supply the poor with renewable energies , and setting out a commitment on the part of the g-20 countries to cut their subsidies for fossil energies and to replace them with targeted social transfers for the poor .
this will prove to be a huge challenge for countries like india and indonesia that spend large shares of their official budgets for just such subsidies , primarily to the benefit of their urban middle classes .
emerging economies to show little interest for poorer countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-20 wants to boost economic recovery and prevent further financial meltdowns so far the developing countries now represented in the g-20 , and in particular china , have of course weathered the crisis relatively well , thanks to their comparatively good pre-crisis economic policies , which gave them they space they needed to deploy stabilising economic stimulus programmes .

that can be seen as a positive outcome of the economic crisis , argues dr. peter wolff . the third g-20 summit that just concluded in pittsburgh has quite manifestly established the g-20 as the forum for global economic cooperation .
in pittsburgh the final touches were put on the alterations to the institutional architecture agreed on at the london summit in april 2009 : with the backing of the large developing countries , the international financial institutions -lrb- ifis -rrb- are set to be further strengthened on the basis of the additional funds already agreed on for the imf as well as capital increases for world bank and regional development banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heads of states agreed on changing the global financial markets the price the industrialised countries are to pay for the developing country ’ s assent to efforts to strengthen these institutions so unloved in the south is , at first glance , not very high .
the former are to cede a certain percentage share of their voting rights to emerging countries from the developing world : two percent at the imf and three percent at the world bank .
that will do little to change the fundamental power relations there , and it is likely to be achieved mainly at the expense of a few small european countries .
old north south discourse gives way to new cooperation but one thing that is surprising is how quick the developing countries in the g-20 were to buy into the ‘ deal ’ to strengthen the role of the ifis .
the deal is , be it said , also the only condition under which china , brazil , and other emerging countries will now be prepared to make additional resources available to the imf for the purpose of the combating the ongoing crisis , e.g. in eastern europe .
the old north-south discourse – it will now , it seems , soon be a thing of the past .
the perceptive observer will have noticed that the final document also shows unmistakable signs of the approach of the copenhagen climate conference .
true , it has nothing to say about binding emissions targets .
but it does contain lots of shoptalk about sustainable growth policies .
and one thing relevant for the developing countries : it cedes to the world bank a leading role in climate policy , calling on the g-20 finance ministers to examine , prior to copenhagen , the options available to fund climate policy , propagating programmes designed to supply the poor with renewable energies , and setting out a commitment on the part of the g-20 countries to cut their subsidies for fossil energies and to replace them with targeted social transfers for the poor .
this will prove to be a huge challenge for countries like india and indonesia that spend large shares of their official budgets for just such subsidies , primarily to the benefit of their urban middle classes .
emerging economies to show little interest for poorer countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-20 wants to boost economic recovery and prevent further financial meltdowns so far the developing countries now represented in the g-20 , and in particular china , have of course weathered the crisis relatively well , thanks to their comparatively good pre-crisis economic policies , which gave them they space they needed to deploy stabilising economic stimulus programmes .
in doing so , though , they often showed little regard for the interests of poorer and smaller developing countries , opting instead for support programmes designed to promote national economic sectors and putting a whole array of protectionist measures in place to boost domestic growth .
all this naturally at the expense of other developing countries that lacked policy space for economic stimulus programmes .
g 20 still favour domestic interests and markets this protectionism is assuming the form less of tariffs than of national subsidies and political preference for domestic businesses .
the bottom line : most g-20 countries have not honoured the commitment they made at their first summit to refrain from adopting protectionist measures .
the aim now must be to reverse this process on the basis of the goal , re-affirmed in pittsburgh , to bring the doha round to a successful conclusion in 2010 .
it is above all the economic heavyweights among the developing countries that now must be expected to open their markets , at least in favour of poorer developing countries .
more economic growth needed in developing nations the final document of the pittsburgh summit repeatedly underlines that one central element of the global path out of the crisis must be more growth in developing countries .
it lists a whole array of measures designed to improve , in developing countries , access to food , energy , and financial services as well as to promote growth and prevent major population groups from sinking into poverty .
much of this is not new .
it is , however , noteworthy that now , with the g-20 , the focus is not only on special crisis-related issues like banker bonuses and financial market regulation , and that development-related issues are now increasingly placed in a global context and discussed at the highest level .

here 's what some of europe 's papers have to say about the resounding ' yes ' vote and the future of the reform treaty . germany 's neue osnabruecker zeitung welcomed ireland 's acceptance of the lisbon treaty , but said it was primarily motivated by money .
" nothing fanned the flames of love for europe among the irish as much as the thought of having to fight their way out of the crisis without cash injections from brussels . "
the paper was critical of the fact that the irish were the only people in the 27 nation block allowed to vote on a treaty " with such reach " .
it said all citizens of europe should have been allowed to have their say at the ballot box .
in the netherlands , de volkskrant said the second irish poll was no longer really about the treaty , but about whether or not the people of ireland wanted to remain in the eu at all .
" the mood has changed radically since the last referendum .
the financial crisis has taught the ' celtic tiger ' that it is safer to be in the eu harbor during a storm . "
in paris , the conservative le figaro said it was now up to the czech president to do the right thing by the citizens of europe .
" the resounding ' yes ' from ireland ought to have cleared the path for the ratification of the lisbon treaty .
the resistance - albeit fierce - from one man can not oppose the will of 500 million europeans . "
it added that vaclav klaus might like , against the wishes of his government and his people , to hold the treaty hostage until the conservatives take up the reins of power in britain .
but such a manoeuvre , it concluded , would be " dishonourable . "
bildunterschrift : ' yes ' was the word on the lips of 67 percent of voters in ireland the british daily , the times says the ireland vote represents another surrender to brussels and laments the fact that the british population never got their chance at a referendum .
" if the british saw the lisbon treaty as a genuine agreement among independent nations , which had been ratified either by a referendum or a general election , they might accept it .
but it is not , and they do not .
they are now asking themselves whether the benefits of belonging to a complex bureaucratic regional block of ageing powers and declining economies outweigh the sacrifice of british sovereignty .
whether it is in britain 's interest to remain in the european union has become a matter of legitimate debate . "
poland 's left-liberal gazeta wyborcza said the green light from the emerald isle meant the eu was now going to have to face some major challenges .
" the first test of the effectiveness of the eu under the new treaty will be expansion .
french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel said expansion would not be possible without the lisbon treaty .
now that its implementation is as good as guaranteed , they will have to take their foot off the brakes . "

austria 's der standard praised the irish for their ' yes ' vote , saying they had left little room for czech president to throw a last minute spanner in the works .
but the question now , the paper wrote , is whether or not the treaty will prove a success .

here 's what some of europe 's papers have to say about the resounding ' yes ' vote and the future of the reform treaty . germany 's neue osnabruecker zeitung welcomed ireland 's acceptance of the lisbon treaty , but said it was primarily motivated by money .
" nothing fanned the flames of love for europe among the irish as much as the thought of having to fight their way out of the crisis without cash injections from brussels . "
the paper was critical of the fact that the irish were the only people in the 27 nation block allowed to vote on a treaty " with such reach " .
it said all citizens of europe should have been allowed to have their say at the ballot box .
in the netherlands , de volkskrant said the second irish poll was no longer really about the treaty , but about whether or not the people of ireland wanted to remain in the eu at all .
" the mood has changed radically since the last referendum .
the financial crisis has taught the ' celtic tiger ' that it is safer to be in the eu harbor during a storm . "
in paris , the conservative le figaro said it was now up to the czech president to do the right thing by the citizens of europe .
" the resounding ' yes ' from ireland ought to have cleared the path for the ratification of the lisbon treaty .
the resistance - albeit fierce - from one man can not oppose the will of 500 million europeans . "
it added that vaclav klaus might like , against the wishes of his government and his people , to hold the treaty hostage until the conservatives take up the reins of power in britain .
but such a manoeuvre , it concluded , would be " dishonourable . "
bildunterschrift : ' yes ' was the word on the lips of 67 percent of voters in ireland the british daily , the times says the ireland vote represents another surrender to brussels and laments the fact that the british population never got their chance at a referendum .
" if the british saw the lisbon treaty as a genuine agreement among independent nations , which had been ratified either by a referendum or a general election , they might accept it .
but it is not , and they do not .
they are now asking themselves whether the benefits of belonging to a complex bureaucratic regional block of ageing powers and declining economies outweigh the sacrifice of british sovereignty .
whether it is in britain 's interest to remain in the european union has become a matter of legitimate debate . "
poland 's left-liberal gazeta wyborcza said the green light from the emerald isle meant the eu was now going to have to face some major challenges .
" the first test of the effectiveness of the eu under the new treaty will be expansion .
french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel said expansion would not be possible without the lisbon treaty .
now that its implementation is as good as guaranteed , they will have to take their foot off the brakes . "
it added that croatia , iceland , turkey , serbia , bosnia and herzegovina , montenegro and kosovo are waiting to join .
" in 2010 , ukraine will apply for membership and sooner or later , belarus and moldavia will follow suit . "
austria 's der standard praised the irish for their ' yes ' vote , saying they had left little room for czech president to throw a last minute spanner in the works .
but the question now , the paper wrote , is whether or not the treaty will prove a success .
" can labored joint policies push through planned reforms on migration , domestic security , external relations and increased democracy in eu institutions ? "
in order to do so , the paper wrote , member states will have to stop demonstrating signs of " national small-mindedness and egotism . " tkw / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have gone on the offensive with the bavarian state party leader , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , who is also a possible candidate for justice minister , arguing that the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- can not simply dictate what can , and can not , be done .
" they know our election platform and they know which of their policies we have criticized in recent years , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and westerwelle are heading into tough coalition talks the key issues in the coalition talks , fdp leader guido westerwelle has said , will be taxes , finance policies , the national deficit .
equally high up on the agenda will be domestic security , labor market and health system reforms , and securing future energy resources .
stark differences have already emerged the fdp wants to dismantle the national health fund , which was only introduced at the beginning of this year ; a tall order that chancellor merkel rejects .
but , either way , with a rapidly aging population and shrinking workforce , germany urgently needs to revamp its employee-financed health care system .
the fdp insists on making it easier to fire employees , while opposing the introduction of sector-specific minimum wages .
the cdu wants to keep the minimum wage accords agreed on with the social democrats in the outgoing government and opposes labor market reforms .
the fdp has indicated , however , that this is not a top priority .
clashes are all but certain on topics like domestic security where the fdp vehemently opposes online searches and other measures , which they claim undercut personal data protection .
the cdu argues that these measures are necessary to combat terrorism and the growing scourge of internet crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government surveillance has stirred opposition on energy issues , both parties have said they would like to extend the operation of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants .
there is currently a law that calls for phasing out nuclear energy by 2020 .
although they agree on an extension , they differ on how the profits earned from that should be used .
the cdu wants to use them to keep electricity prices down , while the fdp wants to reduce subsidies for renewable energy .
tax cuts and the deficit on the deficit , the fdp wants to cut spending , which is expected to be twice the european union limit next year .
the fdp says it wants to axe state subsidies , end the " waste " of taxpayer 's money and reduce military spending .
merkel has rejected wholesale spending cuts , while some in her party have suggested raising the sales tax - an idea merkel has dismissed .
the tax issue will perhaps be the toughest nut to crack in the coalition talks in light of germany 's gaping budget deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cutting expenditures and taxes will be difficult fdp general-secretary dirk niebel has called for " a major tax structure reform " and said he was confident that " a coalition consensus could be reached for the next four years . "
but , that may be easier said than done .
saxony 's cdu state premier stanislav tillich urgently warned against lowering taxes , saying " the coalition talks must not agree on budgetary measures that burden our children and grandchildren . "
the position of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , however , is more in line with the fdp .
csu general-secretary alexander dobrindt has said " only investment in the economy and in jobs can lead to more employment and the retention of jobs .
that ultimately also leads to more financial flexibility . "
" cuts in social welfare programs would not be necessary , " he added .
the tax cuts proposed by the cdu would amount to about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.8 billion -rrb- annually .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 05.10.2009 socialist george papandreou claims victory in greek elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou waves after winning the snap poll the greek socialists , led by george papandreou , have won the election , ousting the governing conservatives of premier kostas karamanlis who angered voters by failing to tackle corruption and the economy . with 87 percent of the vote counted , greece 's main opposition , the socialist pasok , has claimed victory .
according to the interior ministry website , the socialists have won an absolute majority , winning 160 seats in the 300-seat parliament .
" we stand united to face the big responsibility to change our country into a nation of justice , solidaritzy , humanity and green development , " said papandreou to a cheering crowd .
the ruling conservative new democracy party came in second with just 34 percent of the vote , which translates to 93 seats .
papandreou called the results " a message of hope , for change , and a just society , a more democratic and transparent society . "
sunday 's vote was the third face-off for 57-year-old us-born papandreou , and prime minister costas karamanlis , 53 , a powerful speaker who appeals to the average greek .
both men are heirs to two of the country 's most powerful political dynasties .
scandals and economic woes weakened by scandals and a fragile parliamentary majority , karamanlis called the snap poll in september , gambling he had a better chance of winning now than later in his four-year term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the third face-off for the two leaders first elected in 2004 , karamanlis said ahead of the vote that he needed a strong new mandate to tackle greece 's economic troubles .
the vote comes at a time when the mediterranean country , seen as the eurozone 's weakest link , needs a strong government to deal with an economy on the verge of recession .
papandreou now faces a budget deficit topping six percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , rising unemployment and deep dissatisfaction over the education system , social security and immigration .
extravagant promises ?
the socialist leader promised a three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.36 billion -rrb- stimulus package on a platform of taxing the rich and helping the poor , while incumbent prime minister costas karamanlis called for two years of austerity .
some economists have questioned the wisdom of papandreou 's spending plan , saying it could lead to more borrowing at a time when greece already has the eurozone 's second biggest debt after italy as a percentage of gdp .
after years of robust growth , greece 's output , about 2.5 percent of the eurozone 's total economy , is set to slow to zero growth or even enter negative territory this year , with key drivers and job providers like tourism particularly hard-hit. av / rb / dpa / reuters / ap editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 05.10.2009 pittsburgh summit shows positive signs for developing countries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-20 leaders will meet twice in 2010 the g-20 summit has agreed on more money for development banks and now includes developing countries in the decision making process .
that can be seen as a positive outcome of the economic crisis , argues dr. peter wolff . the third g-20 summit that just concluded in pittsburgh has quite manifestly established the g-20 as the forum for global economic cooperation .
in pittsburgh the final touches were put on the alterations to the institutional architecture agreed on at the london summit in april 2009 : with the backing of the large developing countries , the international financial institutions -lrb- ifis -rrb- are set to be further strengthened on the basis of the additional funds already agreed on for the imf as well as capital increases for world bank and regional development banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heads of states agreed on changing the global financial markets the price the industrialised countries are to pay for the developing country ’ s assent to efforts to strengthen these institutions so unloved in the south is , at first glance , not very high .
the former are to cede a certain percentage share of their voting rights to emerging countries from the developing world : two percent at the imf and three percent at the world bank .
that will do little to change the fundamental power relations there , and it is likely to be achieved mainly at the expense of a few small european countries .
old north south discourse gives way to new cooperation but one thing that is surprising is how quick the developing countries in the g-20 were to buy into the ‘ deal ’ to strengthen the role of the ifis .
the deal is , be it said , also the only condition under which china , brazil , and other emerging countries will now be prepared to make additional resources available to the imf for the purpose of the combating the ongoing crisis , e.g. in eastern europe .
the old north-south discourse – it will now , it seems , soon be a thing of the past .
the perceptive observer will have noticed that the final document also shows unmistakable signs of the approach of the copenhagen climate conference .
true , it has nothing to say about binding emissions targets .
but it does contain lots of shoptalk about sustainable growth policies .
and one thing relevant for the developing countries : it cedes to the world bank a leading role in climate policy , calling on the g-20 finance ministers to examine , prior to copenhagen , the options available to fund climate policy , propagating programmes designed to supply the poor with renewable energies , and setting out a commitment on the part of the g-20 countries to cut their subsidies for fossil energies and to replace them with targeted social transfers for the poor .
this will prove to be a huge challenge for countries like india and indonesia that spend large shares of their official budgets for just such subsidies , primarily to the benefit of their urban middle classes .
emerging economies to show little interest for poorer countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-20 wants to boost economic recovery and prevent further financial meltdowns so far the developing countries now represented in the g-20 , and in particular china , have of course weathered the crisis relatively well , thanks to their comparatively good pre-crisis economic policies , which gave them they space they needed to deploy stabilising economic stimulus programmes .
in doing so , though , they often showed little regard for the interests of poorer and smaller developing countries , opting instead for support programmes designed to promote national economic sectors and putting a whole array of protectionist measures in place to boost domestic growth .
all this naturally at the expense of other developing countries that lacked policy space for economic stimulus programmes .
g 20 still favour domestic interests and markets this protectionism is assuming the form less of tariffs than of national subsidies and political preference for domestic businesses .
the bottom line : most g-20 countries have not honoured the commitment they made at their first summit to refrain from adopting protectionist measures .
the aim now must be to reverse this process on the basis of the goal , re-affirmed in pittsburgh , to bring the doha round to a successful conclusion in 2010 .
it is above all the economic heavyweights among the developing countries that now must be expected to open their markets , at least in favour of poorer developing countries .
more economic growth needed in developing nations the final document of the pittsburgh summit repeatedly underlines that one central element of the global path out of the crisis must be more growth in developing countries .
it lists a whole array of measures designed to improve , in developing countries , access to food , energy , and financial services as well as to promote growth and prevent major population groups from sinking into poverty .
much of this is not new .
it is , however , noteworthy that now , with the g-20 , the focus is not only on special crisis-related issues like banker bonuses and financial market regulation , and that development-related issues are now increasingly placed in a global context and discussed at the highest level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter wolff heads die 's world economy department the g-8 had done much the same thing , e.g. in gleneagles in 2005 , where , with a paternalist gesture , more assistance was pledged for the developing countries .
indeed , the fact that the large developing countries are now directly involved in the decision-making process must certainly be seen as one of the more positive outcomes of the financial crisis .
dr. peter wolff heads the department ' world economy and development financing ' at the german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- .
based in bonn , the german development institute draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .
it consults on the basis of independent research findings in germany and worldwide and deals with current issues in cooperation between industrial and developing countries . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the real winner was norway . norwegians enjoy the highest standard of living in the world .
the oil-rich scandinavian country , with its well-developed social welfare system , landed first place on the 2009 united nations index for human development .
australia and iceland took second and third places , respectively , and germany took a disappointing 22nd place out of 182 countries .
germany 's relatively low rank was partly due to a sinking per capita income in the wake of reunification , the report said .
other industrialized nations have increased their standing .
france , for instance , climbed to eighth place from 11th in the ranking .
ireland ranked fifth , austria 14th and spain 15th .
" progress is unevenly distributed , " said jeni klugman , the main author of the report .
" many countries have experienced setbacks in the past decades in the face of economic recession , conflict - crises and the hiv / aids epidemic setbacks experienced , " she said .
dramatic differences in life expectancy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in many african countries have a lower life expectancy than their european counterparts the worst results were for the african country of niger .
a child who is born in niger can expect to live to be just 50 years old - 30 years less than a child born in norway , according to the report .
afghanistan , sierra leone and the central african republic were also at the bottom of the list . the index combined values for life expectancy , literacy , school enrollment rates and gross domestic product per capita to arrive at an " aggregate measure of human welfare . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 05.10.2009 milk prices up for debate - and protest - in brussels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milk protests are becoming commonplace in brussels disgruntled dairy farmers drove tractors into brussels on monday and hurled eggs at the eu headquarters .
they ’ re trying to influence the eu agriculture ministers ' meeting on the milk market and get further concessions . about 1,000 dairy farmers from germany , france and other countries converged on brussels on monday , clogging the streets with around 200 tractors .
they also brought cowbells , whistles , and even eggs – which they hurled at the eu headquarters – in a bid to add volume to their cries . they are campaigning for help from the eu so they can turn a profit .
milk production is higher than demand in europe and , therefore , prices are currently low , which is putting some farmers ' livelihoods at stake . germany 's agriculture minister ilse aigner , like her french counterpart bruno le maire , has tried to position herself clearly in the dairy farmers ' camp for monday 's informal lunch meeting in brussels . " the milk sector is in dire need of further supporting measures , " aigner says in an interview with the passauer neuen presse newspaper . " sadly , however , the various representatives of the milk industry still have very different opinions on what should be done .
nevertheless , i am going to brussels with a clear task at hand . " aigner says that 20 european nations are in favor of the milk plan spearheaded by germany and france , which calls for manufacturing subsidies to encourage increased production , and for unused eu funds to be reallocated to national governments so they can help milk farmers .
the plan also advocates tighter - or at least unchanged - milk quotas , regional limits on production set by brussels in a bid to encourage widespread dairy farming . however , great britain , denmark , the netherlands , and others oppose milk quotas , saying that the controlled market is the root cause of the problem .
bildunterschrift : " we might as well be throwing it away , " farmers say frequent protests the uproar in brussels is but the latest instalment in a string of dairy farmer protests .
they argue that prices are now so low that it 's almost impossible to produce profit making milk .
many german farmers already protested by spraying thousands of tons of the white stuff on paddocks , instead of selling it to milk and cheese factories . some french farmers even caused consternation by dumping milk in a lake , killing freshwater fish in the process . the dairy farmers want higher prices , subsidies to help boost production , and schemes to help increase demand - for example pushing milk back onto the menus in european schools .
most eu agriculture ministers seem determined to assuage the farmers ; however , many experts see these desires as unrealistic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe makes too much , and drinks too little " it 's going to take a long time until the milk sector is stable again , " says industry expert professor hannes weindlmaier from the technical university of munich . " the main problem is a simple case of over-production - we make too much milk . " yet weindlmaier also acknowledges that the current milk prices - especially for german dairy farmers - barely cover costs , with smaller operations in the south of the country suffering most .
if germany wants to maintain nationwide milk production , government schemes will be necessary to keep higher-cost dairy farmers in business , he says . monday ’ s meeting in brussels is only meant as a chance to discuss the new proposal from france and germany to help the dairy farmers .
agriculture ministers are not expected to make a firm decision until a meeting in luxembourg on october 19. msh / ap / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they ’ re trying to influence the eu agriculture ministers ' meeting on the milk market and get further concessions . about 1,000 dairy farmers from germany , france and other countries converged on brussels on monday , clogging the streets with around 200 tractors .
they also brought cowbells , whistles , and even eggs – which they hurled at the eu headquarters – in a bid to add volume to their cries . they are campaigning for help from the eu so they can turn a profit .
milk production is higher than demand in europe and , therefore , prices are currently low , which is putting some farmers ' livelihoods at stake . germany 's agriculture minister ilse aigner , like her french counterpart bruno le maire , has tried to position herself clearly in the dairy farmers ' camp for monday 's informal lunch meeting in brussels . " the milk sector is in dire need of further supporting measures , " aigner says in an interview with the passauer neuen presse newspaper . " sadly , however , the various representatives of the milk industry still have very different opinions on what should be done .
nevertheless , i am going to brussels with a clear task at hand . " aigner says that 20 european nations are in favor of the milk plan spearheaded by germany and france , which calls for manufacturing subsidies to encourage increased production , and for unused eu funds to be reallocated to national governments so they can help milk farmers .
the plan also advocates tighter - or at least unchanged - milk quotas , regional limits on production set by brussels in a bid to encourage widespread dairy farming . however , great britain , denmark , the netherlands , and others oppose milk quotas , saying that the controlled market is the root cause of the problem .
bildunterschrift : " we might as well be throwing it away , " farmers say frequent protests the uproar in brussels is but the latest instalment in a string of dairy farmer protests .
they argue that prices are now so low that it 's almost impossible to produce profit making milk .
many german farmers already protested by spraying thousands of tons of the white stuff on paddocks , instead of selling it to milk and cheese factories . some french farmers even caused consternation by dumping milk in a lake , killing freshwater fish in the process . the dairy farmers want higher prices , subsidies to help boost production , and schemes to help increase demand - for example pushing milk back onto the menus in european schools .
most eu agriculture ministers seem determined to assuage the farmers ; however , many experts see these desires as unrealistic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe makes too much , and drinks too little " it 's going to take a long time until the milk sector is stable again , " says industry expert professor hannes weindlmaier from the technical university of munich . " the main problem is a simple case of over-production - we make too much milk . " yet weindlmaier also acknowledges that the current milk prices - especially for german dairy farmers - barely cover costs , with smaller operations in the south of the country suffering most .
if germany wants to maintain nationwide milk production , government schemes will be necessary to keep higher-cost dairy farmers in business , he says . monday ’ s meeting in brussels is only meant as a chance to discuss the new proposal from france and germany to help the dairy farmers .

the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have gone on the offensive with the bavarian state party leader , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , who is also a possible candidate for justice minister , arguing that the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- can not simply dictate what can , and can not , be done .
" they know our election platform and they know which of their policies we have criticized in recent years , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and westerwelle are heading into tough coalition talks the key issues in the coalition talks , fdp leader guido westerwelle has said , will be taxes , finance policies , the national deficit .
equally high up on the agenda will be domestic security , labor market and health system reforms , and securing future energy resources .
stark differences have already emerged the fdp wants to dismantle the national health fund , which was only introduced at the beginning of this year ; a tall order that chancellor merkel rejects .
but , either way , with a rapidly aging population and shrinking workforce , germany urgently needs to revamp its employee-financed health care system .
the fdp insists on making it easier to fire employees , while opposing the introduction of sector-specific minimum wages .
the cdu wants to keep the minimum wage accords agreed on with the social democrats in the outgoing government and opposes labor market reforms .
the fdp has indicated , however , that this is not a top priority .
clashes are all but certain on topics like domestic security where the fdp vehemently opposes online searches and other measures , which they claim undercut personal data protection .
the cdu argues that these measures are necessary to combat terrorism and the growing scourge of internet crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government surveillance has stirred opposition on energy issues , both parties have said they would like to extend the operation of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants .
there is currently a law that calls for phasing out nuclear energy by 2020 .
although they agree on an extension , they differ on how the profits earned from that should be used .
the cdu wants to use them to keep electricity prices down , while the fdp wants to reduce subsidies for renewable energy .
tax cuts and the deficit on the deficit , the fdp wants to cut spending , which is expected to be twice the european union limit next year .
the fdp says it wants to axe state subsidies , end the " waste " of taxpayer 's money and reduce military spending .
merkel has rejected wholesale spending cuts , while some in her party have suggested raising the sales tax - an idea merkel has dismissed .
the tax issue will perhaps be the toughest nut to crack in the coalition talks in light of germany 's gaping budget deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cutting expenditures and taxes will be difficult fdp general-secretary dirk niebel has called for " a major tax structure reform " and said he was confident that " a coalition consensus could be reached for the next four years . "
but , that may be easier said than done .
saxony 's cdu state premier stanislav tillich urgently warned against lowering taxes , saying " the coalition talks must not agree on budgetary measures that burden our children and grandchildren . "
the position of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , however , is more in line with the fdp .
csu general-secretary alexander dobrindt has said " only investment in the economy and in jobs can lead to more employment and the retention of jobs .
that ultimately also leads to more financial flexibility . "
" cuts in social welfare programs would not be necessary , " he added .
the tax cuts proposed by the cdu would amount to about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.8 billion -rrb- annually .
the fdp has promised cuts worth up to 35 billion euros and wants to implement them soon .
the party also wants to simplify the tax system .
fdp finance spokesman hermann otto solms said his party would not " chicken out " of its campaign pledge. gb / dpa / ap / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 05.10.2009 press review : ireland and the lisbon treaty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european newspapers welcome the irish ' yes ' ireland 's endorsement of the lisbon treaty has been largely saluted across the 27 nations of the eu .
here 's what some of europe 's papers have to say about the resounding ' yes ' vote and the future of the reform treaty . germany 's neue osnabruecker zeitung welcomed ireland 's acceptance of the lisbon treaty , but said it was primarily motivated by money .
" nothing fanned the flames of love for europe among the irish as much as the thought of having to fight their way out of the crisis without cash injections from brussels . "
the paper was critical of the fact that the irish were the only people in the 27 nation block allowed to vote on a treaty " with such reach " .
it said all citizens of europe should have been allowed to have their say at the ballot box .
in the netherlands , de volkskrant said the second irish poll was no longer really about the treaty , but about whether or not the people of ireland wanted to remain in the eu at all .
" the mood has changed radically since the last referendum .
the financial crisis has taught the ' celtic tiger ' that it is safer to be in the eu harbor during a storm . "
in paris , the conservative le figaro said it was now up to the czech president to do the right thing by the citizens of europe .
" the resounding ' yes ' from ireland ought to have cleared the path for the ratification of the lisbon treaty .
the resistance - albeit fierce - from one man can not oppose the will of 500 million europeans . "
it added that vaclav klaus might like , against the wishes of his government and his people , to hold the treaty hostage until the conservatives take up the reins of power in britain .
but such a manoeuvre , it concluded , would be " dishonourable . "
bildunterschrift : ' yes ' was the word on the lips of 67 percent of voters in ireland the british daily , the times says the ireland vote represents another surrender to brussels and laments the fact that the british population never got their chance at a referendum .
" if the british saw the lisbon treaty as a genuine agreement among independent nations , which had been ratified either by a referendum or a general election , they might accept it .
but it is not , and they do not .
they are now asking themselves whether the benefits of belonging to a complex bureaucratic regional block of ageing powers and declining economies outweigh the sacrifice of british sovereignty .
whether it is in britain 's interest to remain in the european union has become a matter of legitimate debate . "
poland 's left-liberal gazeta wyborcza said the green light from the emerald isle meant the eu was now going to have to face some major challenges .
" the first test of the effectiveness of the eu under the new treaty will be expansion .
french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel said expansion would not be possible without the lisbon treaty .
now that its implementation is as good as guaranteed , they will have to take their foot off the brakes . "
it added that croatia , iceland , turkey , serbia , bosnia and herzegovina , montenegro and kosovo are waiting to join .
" in 2010 , ukraine will apply for membership and sooner or later , belarus and moldavia will follow suit . "
austria 's der standard praised the irish for their ' yes ' vote , saying they had left little room for czech president to throw a last minute spanner in the works .
but the question now , the paper wrote , is whether or not the treaty will prove a success .
" can labored joint policies push through planned reforms on migration , domestic security , external relations and increased democracy in eu institutions ? "
in order to do so , the paper wrote , member states will have to stop demonstrating signs of " national small-mindedness and egotism . " tkw / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

here 's what some of europe 's papers have to say about the resounding ' yes ' vote and the future of the reform treaty . germany 's neue osnabruecker zeitung welcomed ireland 's acceptance of the lisbon treaty , but said it was primarily motivated by money .
" nothing fanned the flames of love for europe among the irish as much as the thought of having to fight their way out of the crisis without cash injections from brussels . "
the paper was critical of the fact that the irish were the only people in the 27 nation block allowed to vote on a treaty " with such reach " .
it said all citizens of europe should have been allowed to have their say at the ballot box .
in the netherlands , de volkskrant said the second irish poll was no longer really about the treaty , but about whether or not the people of ireland wanted to remain in the eu at all .
" the mood has changed radically since the last referendum .
the financial crisis has taught the ' celtic tiger ' that it is safer to be in the eu harbor during a storm . "
in paris , the conservative le figaro said it was now up to the czech president to do the right thing by the citizens of europe .
" the resounding ' yes ' from ireland ought to have cleared the path for the ratification of the lisbon treaty .
the resistance - albeit fierce - from one man can not oppose the will of 500 million europeans . "
it added that vaclav klaus might like , against the wishes of his government and his people , to hold the treaty hostage until the conservatives take up the reins of power in britain .
but such a manoeuvre , it concluded , would be " dishonourable . "
bildunterschrift : ' yes ' was the word on the lips of 67 percent of voters in ireland the british daily , the times says the ireland vote represents another surrender to brussels and laments the fact that the british population never got their chance at a referendum .
" if the british saw the lisbon treaty as a genuine agreement among independent nations , which had been ratified either by a referendum or a general election , they might accept it .
but it is not , and they do not .
they are now asking themselves whether the benefits of belonging to a complex bureaucratic regional block of ageing powers and declining economies outweigh the sacrifice of british sovereignty .
whether it is in britain 's interest to remain in the european union has become a matter of legitimate debate . "
poland 's left-liberal gazeta wyborcza said the green light from the emerald isle meant the eu was now going to have to face some major challenges .
" the first test of the effectiveness of the eu under the new treaty will be expansion .
french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel said expansion would not be possible without the lisbon treaty .
now that its implementation is as good as guaranteed , they will have to take their foot off the brakes . "

according to the interior ministry website , the socialists have won an absolute majority , winning 160 seats in the 300-seat parliament .
" we stand united to face the big responsibility to change our country into a nation of justice , solidaritzy , humanity and green development , " said papandreou to a cheering crowd .
the ruling conservative new democracy party came in second with just 34 percent of the vote , which translates to 93 seats .
papandreou called the results " a message of hope , for change , and a just society , a more democratic and transparent society . "
sunday 's vote was the third face-off for 57-year-old us-born papandreou , and prime minister costas karamanlis , 53 , a powerful speaker who appeals to the average greek .
both men are heirs to two of the country 's most powerful political dynasties .
scandals and economic woes weakened by scandals and a fragile parliamentary majority , karamanlis called the snap poll in september , gambling he had a better chance of winning now than later in his four-year term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the third face-off for the two leaders first elected in 2004 , karamanlis said ahead of the vote that he needed a strong new mandate to tackle greece 's economic troubles .
the vote comes at a time when the mediterranean country , seen as the eurozone 's weakest link , needs a strong government to deal with an economy on the verge of recession .
papandreou now faces a budget deficit topping six percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , rising unemployment and deep dissatisfaction over the education system , social security and immigration .
extravagant promises ?
the socialist leader promised a three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.36 billion -rrb- stimulus package on a platform of taxing the rich and helping the poor , while incumbent prime minister costas karamanlis called for two years of austerity .
some economists have questioned the wisdom of papandreou 's spending plan , saying it could lead to more borrowing at a time when greece already has the eurozone 's second biggest debt after italy as a percentage of gdp .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 05.10.2009 pittsburgh summit shows positive signs for developing countries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-20 leaders will meet twice in 2010 the g-20 summit has agreed on more money for development banks and now includes developing countries in the decision making process .
that can be seen as a positive outcome of the economic crisis , argues dr. peter wolff . the third g-20 summit that just concluded in pittsburgh has quite manifestly established the g-20 as the forum for global economic cooperation .
in pittsburgh the final touches were put on the alterations to the institutional architecture agreed on at the london summit in april 2009 : with the backing of the large developing countries , the international financial institutions -lrb- ifis -rrb- are set to be further strengthened on the basis of the additional funds already agreed on for the imf as well as capital increases for world bank and regional development banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heads of states agreed on changing the global financial markets the price the industrialised countries are to pay for the developing country ’ s assent to efforts to strengthen these institutions so unloved in the south is , at first glance , not very high .
the former are to cede a certain percentage share of their voting rights to emerging countries from the developing world : two percent at the imf and three percent at the world bank .
that will do little to change the fundamental power relations there , and it is likely to be achieved mainly at the expense of a few small european countries .
old north south discourse gives way to new cooperation but one thing that is surprising is how quick the developing countries in the g-20 were to buy into the ‘ deal ’ to strengthen the role of the ifis .
the deal is , be it said , also the only condition under which china , brazil , and other emerging countries will now be prepared to make additional resources available to the imf for the purpose of the combating the ongoing crisis , e.g. in eastern europe .
the old north-south discourse – it will now , it seems , soon be a thing of the past .
the perceptive observer will have noticed that the final document also shows unmistakable signs of the approach of the copenhagen climate conference .
true , it has nothing to say about binding emissions targets .
but it does contain lots of shoptalk about sustainable growth policies .
and one thing relevant for the developing countries : it cedes to the world bank a leading role in climate policy , calling on the g-20 finance ministers to examine , prior to copenhagen , the options available to fund climate policy , propagating programmes designed to supply the poor with renewable energies , and setting out a commitment on the part of the g-20 countries to cut their subsidies for fossil energies and to replace them with targeted social transfers for the poor .
this will prove to be a huge challenge for countries like india and indonesia that spend large shares of their official budgets for just such subsidies , primarily to the benefit of their urban middle classes .
emerging economies to show little interest for poorer countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-20 wants to boost economic recovery and prevent further financial meltdowns so far the developing countries now represented in the g-20 , and in particular china , have of course weathered the crisis relatively well , thanks to their comparatively good pre-crisis economic policies , which gave them they space they needed to deploy stabilising economic stimulus programmes .
in doing so , though , they often showed little regard for the interests of poorer and smaller developing countries , opting instead for support programmes designed to promote national economic sectors and putting a whole array of protectionist measures in place to boost domestic growth .
all this naturally at the expense of other developing countries that lacked policy space for economic stimulus programmes .
g 20 still favour domestic interests and markets this protectionism is assuming the form less of tariffs than of national subsidies and political preference for domestic businesses .
the bottom line : most g-20 countries have not honoured the commitment they made at their first summit to refrain from adopting protectionist measures .
the aim now must be to reverse this process on the basis of the goal , re-affirmed in pittsburgh , to bring the doha round to a successful conclusion in 2010 .
it is above all the economic heavyweights among the developing countries that now must be expected to open their markets , at least in favour of poorer developing countries .
more economic growth needed in developing nations the final document of the pittsburgh summit repeatedly underlines that one central element of the global path out of the crisis must be more growth in developing countries .
it lists a whole array of measures designed to improve , in developing countries , access to food , energy , and financial services as well as to promote growth and prevent major population groups from sinking into poverty .
much of this is not new .
it is , however , noteworthy that now , with the g-20 , the focus is not only on special crisis-related issues like banker bonuses and financial market regulation , and that development-related issues are now increasingly placed in a global context and discussed at the highest level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter wolff heads die 's world economy department the g-8 had done much the same thing , e.g. in gleneagles in 2005 , where , with a paternalist gesture , more assistance was pledged for the developing countries .
indeed , the fact that the large developing countries are now directly involved in the decision-making process must certainly be seen as one of the more positive outcomes of the financial crisis .

that can be seen as a positive outcome of the economic crisis , argues dr. peter wolff . the third g-20 summit that just concluded in pittsburgh has quite manifestly established the g-20 as the forum for global economic cooperation .
in pittsburgh the final touches were put on the alterations to the institutional architecture agreed on at the london summit in april 2009 : with the backing of the large developing countries , the international financial institutions -lrb- ifis -rrb- are set to be further strengthened on the basis of the additional funds already agreed on for the imf as well as capital increases for world bank and regional development banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heads of states agreed on changing the global financial markets the price the industrialised countries are to pay for the developing country ’ s assent to efforts to strengthen these institutions so unloved in the south is , at first glance , not very high .
the former are to cede a certain percentage share of their voting rights to emerging countries from the developing world : two percent at the imf and three percent at the world bank .
that will do little to change the fundamental power relations there , and it is likely to be achieved mainly at the expense of a few small european countries .
old north south discourse gives way to new cooperation but one thing that is surprising is how quick the developing countries in the g-20 were to buy into the ‘ deal ’ to strengthen the role of the ifis .
the deal is , be it said , also the only condition under which china , brazil , and other emerging countries will now be prepared to make additional resources available to the imf for the purpose of the combating the ongoing crisis , e.g. in eastern europe .
the old north-south discourse – it will now , it seems , soon be a thing of the past .
the perceptive observer will have noticed that the final document also shows unmistakable signs of the approach of the copenhagen climate conference .
true , it has nothing to say about binding emissions targets .
but it does contain lots of shoptalk about sustainable growth policies .
and one thing relevant for the developing countries : it cedes to the world bank a leading role in climate policy , calling on the g-20 finance ministers to examine , prior to copenhagen , the options available to fund climate policy , propagating programmes designed to supply the poor with renewable energies , and setting out a commitment on the part of the g-20 countries to cut their subsidies for fossil energies and to replace them with targeted social transfers for the poor .
this will prove to be a huge challenge for countries like india and indonesia that spend large shares of their official budgets for just such subsidies , primarily to the benefit of their urban middle classes .
emerging economies to show little interest for poorer countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-20 wants to boost economic recovery and prevent further financial meltdowns so far the developing countries now represented in the g-20 , and in particular china , have of course weathered the crisis relatively well , thanks to their comparatively good pre-crisis economic policies , which gave them they space they needed to deploy stabilising economic stimulus programmes .
in doing so , though , they often showed little regard for the interests of poorer and smaller developing countries , opting instead for support programmes designed to promote national economic sectors and putting a whole array of protectionist measures in place to boost domestic growth .
all this naturally at the expense of other developing countries that lacked policy space for economic stimulus programmes .
g 20 still favour domestic interests and markets this protectionism is assuming the form less of tariffs than of national subsidies and political preference for domestic businesses .
the bottom line : most g-20 countries have not honoured the commitment they made at their first summit to refrain from adopting protectionist measures .
the aim now must be to reverse this process on the basis of the goal , re-affirmed in pittsburgh , to bring the doha round to a successful conclusion in 2010 .
it is above all the economic heavyweights among the developing countries that now must be expected to open their markets , at least in favour of poorer developing countries .
more economic growth needed in developing nations the final document of the pittsburgh summit repeatedly underlines that one central element of the global path out of the crisis must be more growth in developing countries .
it lists a whole array of measures designed to improve , in developing countries , access to food , energy , and financial services as well as to promote growth and prevent major population groups from sinking into poverty .
much of this is not new .
it is , however , noteworthy that now , with the g-20 , the focus is not only on special crisis-related issues like banker bonuses and financial market regulation , and that development-related issues are now increasingly placed in a global context and discussed at the highest level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter wolff heads die 's world economy department the g-8 had done much the same thing , e.g. in gleneagles in 2005 , where , with a paternalist gesture , more assistance was pledged for the developing countries .
indeed , the fact that the large developing countries are now directly involved in the decision-making process must certainly be seen as one of the more positive outcomes of the financial crisis .

according to the interior ministry website , the socialists have won an absolute majority , winning 160 seats in the 300-seat parliament .
" we stand united to face the big responsibility to change our country into a nation of justice , solidaritzy , humanity and green development , " said papandreou to a cheering crowd .
the ruling conservative new democracy party came in second with just 34 percent of the vote , which translates to 93 seats .
papandreou called the results " a message of hope , for change , and a just society , a more democratic and transparent society . "
sunday 's vote was the third face-off for 57-year-old us-born papandreou , and prime minister costas karamanlis , 53 , a powerful speaker who appeals to the average greek .
both men are heirs to two of the country 's most powerful political dynasties .
scandals and economic woes weakened by scandals and a fragile parliamentary majority , karamanlis called the snap poll in september , gambling he had a better chance of winning now than later in his four-year term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the third face-off for the two leaders first elected in 2004 , karamanlis said ahead of the vote that he needed a strong new mandate to tackle greece 's economic troubles .
the vote comes at a time when the mediterranean country , seen as the eurozone 's weakest link , needs a strong government to deal with an economy on the verge of recession .
papandreou now faces a budget deficit topping six percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , rising unemployment and deep dissatisfaction over the education system , social security and immigration .
extravagant promises ?
the socialist leader promised a three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.36 billion -rrb- stimulus package on a platform of taxing the rich and helping the poor , while incumbent prime minister costas karamanlis called for two years of austerity .
some economists have questioned the wisdom of papandreou 's spending plan , saying it could lead to more borrowing at a time when greece already has the eurozone 's second biggest debt after italy as a percentage of gdp .
after years of robust growth , greece 's output , about 2.5 percent of the eurozone 's total economy , is set to slow to zero growth or even enter negative territory this year , with key drivers and job providers like tourism particularly hard-hit. av / rb / dpa / reuters / ap editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their work is seen as having an important impact on research into cancer and aging .
telomerase is called an " immortality enzyme ; " it could play a role in treating the uncontrolled spread of cancer cells .
the three researchers will share the prize , worth 10 million swedish crowns , or around a million euros -lrb- $ 1.4 million -rrb- .
solving problems on protecting chromosomes professor hans jornvall of the nobel assembly said their discoveries were crucial for research on cancer , aging and inherited genetic diseases , .
a statement by the assembly said the three scientists solved a fundamental problem in biology on " how chromosomes can be copied in a complete way and how they are protected against degradation . "
the statement said the discovery of " how chromosomes are protected by telomeres and the enzyme telomerase " had stimulated the development of " new therapeutic strategies . "
recipient says she was " thrilled " " i was just thrilled , " greider told swedish radio , saying she was doing laundry when she received the telephone call about the award from the karolinska institute .
american greider is a professor at johns hopkins university school of medicine in baltimore , australia-native blackburn is a professor at the university of california in san francisco , and szostak , born in the uk , is a professor at the harvard medical school .
last year , the medicine prize went to german virologist harald zur hausen , as well as french virologists francoise barre-sinoussi and luc montaigner , for their work on identifying viruses that cause aids and cervical cancer .
based on their research , a vaccine has been developed to protect against a certain kind of virus that can cause cervical cancer .
the nobel in medicine is the first of a series of nobel prizes that will be announced this week ; the prize will be officially handed out in a ceremony in stockholm on december 10. jen / dpa / afp / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their work is seen as having an important impact on research into cancer and aging .
telomerase is called an " immortality enzyme ; " it could play a role in treating the uncontrolled spread of cancer cells .
the three researchers will share the prize , worth 10 million swedish crowns , or around a million euros -lrb- $ 1.4 million -rrb- .
solving problems on protecting chromosomes professor hans jornvall of the nobel assembly said their discoveries were crucial for research on cancer , aging and inherited genetic diseases , .
a statement by the assembly said the three scientists solved a fundamental problem in biology on " how chromosomes can be copied in a complete way and how they are protected against degradation . "
the statement said the discovery of " how chromosomes are protected by telomeres and the enzyme telomerase " had stimulated the development of " new therapeutic strategies . "
recipient says she was " thrilled " " i was just thrilled , " greider told swedish radio , saying she was doing laundry when she received the telephone call about the award from the karolinska institute .
american greider is a professor at johns hopkins university school of medicine in baltimore , australia-native blackburn is a professor at the university of california in san francisco , and szostak , born in the uk , is a professor at the harvard medical school .
last year , the medicine prize went to german virologist harald zur hausen , as well as french virologists francoise barre-sinoussi and luc montaigner , for their work on identifying viruses that cause aids and cervical cancer .
based on their research , a vaccine has been developed to protect against a certain kind of virus that can cause cervical cancer .

he says that trade unions need to get involved . speaking in berlin at celebrations to mark 60 years since the foundation of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- on monday , horst koehler said decisions taken at the recent g-20 meeting in pittsburg had failed to convince him that enough was being done to prevent a repeat of the current global economic crisis .
" i do n't see the monster being tamed , " he told his audience in berlin , adding that the financial markets were still characterized by shell games , lack of transparency and speculation on commodities markets .
koehler bemoaned what he described as a lack of self-reflection from global financial actors and warned against the principle of hope .
he said nobody should think that growth could cover over or eradicate the memories of what has already happened .
the president , a former head of the international monetary fund , said the financial sector needs strong state and inter-state regulatory policies and stressed the important role of the world 's trade unions in " any fundamental reform of the global financial order . "
he called on employee representatives attending the celebrations to " get involved . "
making work a priority he called for a cooperative employment climate and a culture of co-determination in which everyone could have the feeling they were needed .
" work for all , " he said " must be and must remain a main political target . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions need to be involved in reform efforts , koehler said much has changed since the inception of the dgb in 1949 .
back then , germany was struggling to emerge from the rubble of the second world war , and needed all hands on deck to push ahead with its reconstruction effort .
the dgb came into being in order to ensure the country 's workers a good deal and what then chairman hans boeckler described as " a larger portion of the material , intellectual and cultural goods of society . "
on monday , the current dgb leader michael sommer praised the work of germany 's trade unions over the past six decades , saying they had " genuinely made a major contribution " to national reconstruction efforts .
he said it was thanks to the unions that germany was a respected member of the international community which demonstrated an obligation to the preservation of employees ' rights. tkw / afp / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he says that trade unions need to get involved . speaking in berlin at celebrations to mark 60 years since the foundation of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- on monday , horst koehler said decisions taken at the recent g-20 meeting in pittsburg had failed to convince him that enough was being done to prevent a repeat of the current global economic crisis .
" i do n't see the monster being tamed , " he told his audience in berlin , adding that the financial markets were still characterized by shell games , lack of transparency and speculation on commodities markets .
koehler bemoaned what he described as a lack of self-reflection from global financial actors and warned against the principle of hope .
he said nobody should think that growth could cover over or eradicate the memories of what has already happened .
the president , a former head of the international monetary fund , said the financial sector needs strong state and inter-state regulatory policies and stressed the important role of the world 's trade unions in " any fundamental reform of the global financial order . "
he called on employee representatives attending the celebrations to " get involved . "
making work a priority he called for a cooperative employment climate and a culture of co-determination in which everyone could have the feeling they were needed .
" work for all , " he said " must be and must remain a main political target . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions need to be involved in reform efforts , koehler said much has changed since the inception of the dgb in 1949 .
back then , germany was struggling to emerge from the rubble of the second world war , and needed all hands on deck to push ahead with its reconstruction effort .
the dgb came into being in order to ensure the country 's workers a good deal and what then chairman hans boeckler described as " a larger portion of the material , intellectual and cultural goods of society . "
on monday , the current dgb leader michael sommer praised the work of germany 's trade unions over the past six decades , saying they had " genuinely made a major contribution " to national reconstruction efforts .
he said it was thanks to the unions that germany was a respected member of the international community which demonstrated an obligation to the preservation of employees ' rights. tkw / afp / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's top-circulation women 's magazine said it will stop using professional models in its photo shoots .
the decision is part of a wider debate over fashion and body image in the media . " brigitte " is the fashion-and-lifestyle bible for the german everywoman . like most mass-circulation women 's magazines , its photo spreads are peopled by professional models - usually very thin ones .
at least , they were until now .
starting in the new year , that will no longer be the case , say editors-in- chief andreas lebert and brigitte huber .
" we are going to make a magazine for women as they are , and not as other people wish them to be , " lebert told a press conference in hamburg .
the plan is to feature musicians , actors , politicians , and readers , to be chosen by the magazine 's editors , instead of models in future editions of the magazine .
that means photo spreads will feature women " who have an identity " and not just " protruding bones , " lebert said .
the move is just the latest salvo in the ongoing ground war against overly thin fashion models .
recently , the topic has made headlines in connection to several international fashion weeks .
four large associations associated with the berlin fashion week last year agreed not to use overly thin models for the catwalk or fashion ads .
in madrid in 2008 , an underweight model was sent home , amid much publicity .
and this year 's london 's fashion week saw a campaign for more femininity - and curves - on the haute couture runways .
but " brigitte " editors said the magazine 's new strategy of changing size-zero models for normal folks does n't aim to declare war on the fashion industry - it merely aims to send a signal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a preference for thin models dominates the fashion industry " there is a great deal of discomfort in the fashion industry on the subject , but no one takes responsibility , " lebert said .
" maybe one medium has to say : ' we are deciding to present ourselves differently . " '
new trendsetters : bruni , obama for her part , " brigitte " editor huber commented that " these days , attractiveness has many faces . "
the days when fashion companies dictated style are over , she says ; today , fashion is dictated by people like the wife of the french president , carla bruni , or michelle obama , " as well as athletes , students , and " women on the streets of the major metropolises . "
in addition to making a statement about women and body image , the move may well be aimed at boosting circulation .
" brigitte " has seen a steady drop in readers in recent years , and the current bust in the ad business is making magazine publishers have to search for a new angle .

germany 's top-circulation women 's magazine said it will stop using professional models in its photo shoots .
the decision is part of a wider debate over fashion and body image in the media . " brigitte " is the fashion-and-lifestyle bible for the german everywoman . like most mass-circulation women 's magazines , its photo spreads are peopled by professional models - usually very thin ones .
at least , they were until now .
starting in the new year , that will no longer be the case , say editors-in- chief andreas lebert and brigitte huber .
" we are going to make a magazine for women as they are , and not as other people wish them to be , " lebert told a press conference in hamburg .
the plan is to feature musicians , actors , politicians , and readers , to be chosen by the magazine 's editors , instead of models in future editions of the magazine .
that means photo spreads will feature women " who have an identity " and not just " protruding bones , " lebert said .
the move is just the latest salvo in the ongoing ground war against overly thin fashion models .
recently , the topic has made headlines in connection to several international fashion weeks .
four large associations associated with the berlin fashion week last year agreed not to use overly thin models for the catwalk or fashion ads .
in madrid in 2008 , an underweight model was sent home , amid much publicity .
and this year 's london 's fashion week saw a campaign for more femininity - and curves - on the haute couture runways .
but " brigitte " editors said the magazine 's new strategy of changing size-zero models for normal folks does n't aim to declare war on the fashion industry - it merely aims to send a signal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a preference for thin models dominates the fashion industry " there is a great deal of discomfort in the fashion industry on the subject , but no one takes responsibility , " lebert said .
" maybe one medium has to say : ' we are deciding to present ourselves differently . " '
new trendsetters : bruni , obama for her part , " brigitte " editor huber commented that " these days , attractiveness has many faces . "
the days when fashion companies dictated style are over , she says ; today , fashion is dictated by people like the wife of the french president , carla bruni , or michelle obama , " as well as athletes , students , and " women on the streets of the major metropolises . "
in addition to making a statement about women and body image , the move may well be aimed at boosting circulation .
" brigitte " has seen a steady drop in readers in recent years , and the current bust in the ad business is making magazine publishers have to search for a new angle .
the magazine sold some 720,000 copies in the third quarter of 2009 , down from 757,000 a year earlier. jen / dpa / ap / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 05.10.2009 pittsburgh summit shows positive signs for developing countries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-20 leaders will meet twice in 2010 the g-20 summit has agreed on more money for development banks and now includes developing countries in the decision making process .
that can be seen as a positive outcome of the economic crisis , argues dr. peter wolff . the third g-20 summit that just concluded in pittsburgh has quite manifestly established the g-20 as the forum for global economic cooperation .
in pittsburgh the final touches were put on the alterations to the institutional architecture agreed on at the london summit in april 2009 : with the backing of the large developing countries , the international financial institutions -lrb- ifis -rrb- are set to be further strengthened on the basis of the additional funds already agreed on for the imf as well as capital increases for world bank and regional development banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heads of states agreed on changing the global financial markets the price the industrialised countries are to pay for the developing country ’ s assent to efforts to strengthen these institutions so unloved in the south is , at first glance , not very high .
the former are to cede a certain percentage share of their voting rights to emerging countries from the developing world : two percent at the imf and three percent at the world bank .
that will do little to change the fundamental power relations there , and it is likely to be achieved mainly at the expense of a few small european countries .
old north south discourse gives way to new cooperation but one thing that is surprising is how quick the developing countries in the g-20 were to buy into the ‘ deal ’ to strengthen the role of the ifis .
the deal is , be it said , also the only condition under which china , brazil , and other emerging countries will now be prepared to make additional resources available to the imf for the purpose of the combating the ongoing crisis , e.g. in eastern europe .
the old north-south discourse – it will now , it seems , soon be a thing of the past .
the perceptive observer will have noticed that the final document also shows unmistakable signs of the approach of the copenhagen climate conference .
true , it has nothing to say about binding emissions targets .
but it does contain lots of shoptalk about sustainable growth policies .
and one thing relevant for the developing countries : it cedes to the world bank a leading role in climate policy , calling on the g-20 finance ministers to examine , prior to copenhagen , the options available to fund climate policy , propagating programmes designed to supply the poor with renewable energies , and setting out a commitment on the part of the g-20 countries to cut their subsidies for fossil energies and to replace them with targeted social transfers for the poor .
this will prove to be a huge challenge for countries like india and indonesia that spend large shares of their official budgets for just such subsidies , primarily to the benefit of their urban middle classes .
emerging economies to show little interest for poorer countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-20 wants to boost economic recovery and prevent further financial meltdowns so far the developing countries now represented in the g-20 , and in particular china , have of course weathered the crisis relatively well , thanks to their comparatively good pre-crisis economic policies , which gave them they space they needed to deploy stabilising economic stimulus programmes .
in doing so , though , they often showed little regard for the interests of poorer and smaller developing countries , opting instead for support programmes designed to promote national economic sectors and putting a whole array of protectionist measures in place to boost domestic growth .
all this naturally at the expense of other developing countries that lacked policy space for economic stimulus programmes .
g 20 still favour domestic interests and markets this protectionism is assuming the form less of tariffs than of national subsidies and political preference for domestic businesses .
the bottom line : most g-20 countries have not honoured the commitment they made at their first summit to refrain from adopting protectionist measures .
the aim now must be to reverse this process on the basis of the goal , re-affirmed in pittsburgh , to bring the doha round to a successful conclusion in 2010 .
it is above all the economic heavyweights among the developing countries that now must be expected to open their markets , at least in favour of poorer developing countries .
more economic growth needed in developing nations the final document of the pittsburgh summit repeatedly underlines that one central element of the global path out of the crisis must be more growth in developing countries .
it lists a whole array of measures designed to improve , in developing countries , access to food , energy , and financial services as well as to promote growth and prevent major population groups from sinking into poverty .
much of this is not new .
it is , however , noteworthy that now , with the g-20 , the focus is not only on special crisis-related issues like banker bonuses and financial market regulation , and that development-related issues are now increasingly placed in a global context and discussed at the highest level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter wolff heads die 's world economy department the g-8 had done much the same thing , e.g. in gleneagles in 2005 , where , with a paternalist gesture , more assistance was pledged for the developing countries .
indeed , the fact that the large developing countries are now directly involved in the decision-making process must certainly be seen as one of the more positive outcomes of the financial crisis .
dr. peter wolff heads the department ' world economy and development financing ' at the german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- .
based in bonn , the german development institute draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .
it consults on the basis of independent research findings in germany and worldwide and deals with current issues in cooperation between industrial and developing countries . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the real winner was norway . norwegians enjoy the highest standard of living in the world .
the oil-rich scandinavian country , with its well-developed social welfare system , landed first place on the 2009 united nations index for human development .
australia and iceland took second and third places , respectively , and germany took a disappointing 22nd place out of 182 countries .
germany 's relatively low rank was partly due to a sinking per capita income in the wake of reunification , the report said .
other industrialized nations have increased their standing .
france , for instance , climbed to eighth place from 11th in the ranking .
ireland ranked fifth , austria 14th and spain 15th .
" progress is unevenly distributed , " said jeni klugman , the main author of the report .
" many countries have experienced setbacks in the past decades in the face of economic recession , conflict - crises and the hiv / aids epidemic setbacks experienced , " she said .
dramatic differences in life expectancy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in many african countries have a lower life expectancy than their european counterparts the worst results were for the african country of niger .
a child who is born in niger can expect to live to be just 50 years old - 30 years less than a child born in norway , according to the report .
afghanistan , sierra leone and the central african republic were also at the bottom of the list . the index combined values for life expectancy , literacy , school enrollment rates and gross domestic product per capita to arrive at an " aggregate measure of human welfare . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 05.10.2009 german coalition partners face tough talks and compromise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu and fdp will share power in the reichstag chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats and the liberal free democrats start coalition talks on monday to form a new government , but they will first have to agree on a wide range of policy issues . a good week after winning the general election , the two sides are gathering in berlin with a slew of negotiators to hammer out the differences between what they have been saying in public and where they are willing to compromise in private .
the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have gone on the offensive with the bavarian state party leader , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , who is also a possible candidate for justice minister , arguing that the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- can not simply dictate what can , and can not , be done .
" they know our election platform and they know which of their policies we have criticized in recent years , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and westerwelle are heading into tough coalition talks the key issues in the coalition talks , fdp leader guido westerwelle has said , will be taxes , finance policies , the national deficit .
equally high up on the agenda will be domestic security , labor market and health system reforms , and securing future energy resources .
stark differences have already emerged the fdp wants to dismantle the national health fund , which was only introduced at the beginning of this year ; a tall order that chancellor merkel rejects .
but , either way , with a rapidly aging population and shrinking workforce , germany urgently needs to revamp its employee-financed health care system .
the fdp insists on making it easier to fire employees , while opposing the introduction of sector-specific minimum wages .
the cdu wants to keep the minimum wage accords agreed on with the social democrats in the outgoing government and opposes labor market reforms .
the fdp has indicated , however , that this is not a top priority .
clashes are all but certain on topics like domestic security where the fdp vehemently opposes online searches and other measures , which they claim undercut personal data protection .
the cdu argues that these measures are necessary to combat terrorism and the growing scourge of internet crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government surveillance has stirred opposition on energy issues , both parties have said they would like to extend the operation of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants .
there is currently a law that calls for phasing out nuclear energy by 2020 .
although they agree on an extension , they differ on how the profits earned from that should be used .
the cdu wants to use them to keep electricity prices down , while the fdp wants to reduce subsidies for renewable energy .
tax cuts and the deficit on the deficit , the fdp wants to cut spending , which is expected to be twice the european union limit next year .
the fdp says it wants to axe state subsidies , end the " waste " of taxpayer 's money and reduce military spending .
merkel has rejected wholesale spending cuts , while some in her party have suggested raising the sales tax - an idea merkel has dismissed .
the tax issue will perhaps be the toughest nut to crack in the coalition talks in light of germany 's gaping budget deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cutting expenditures and taxes will be difficult fdp general-secretary dirk niebel has called for " a major tax structure reform " and said he was confident that " a coalition consensus could be reached for the next four years . "
but , that may be easier said than done .
saxony 's cdu state premier stanislav tillich urgently warned against lowering taxes , saying " the coalition talks must not agree on budgetary measures that burden our children and grandchildren . "
the position of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , however , is more in line with the fdp .
csu general-secretary alexander dobrindt has said " only investment in the economy and in jobs can lead to more employment and the retention of jobs .
that ultimately also leads to more financial flexibility . "
" cuts in social welfare programs would not be necessary , " he added .
the tax cuts proposed by the cdu would amount to about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.8 billion -rrb- annually .
the fdp has promised cuts worth up to 35 billion euros and wants to implement them soon .
the party also wants to simplify the tax system .
fdp finance spokesman hermann otto solms said his party would not " chicken out " of its campaign pledge. gb / dpa / ap / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's top-circulation women 's magazine said it will stop using professional models in its photo shoots .
the decision is part of a wider debate over fashion and body image in the media . " brigitte " is the fashion-and-lifestyle bible for the german everywoman . like most mass-circulation women 's magazines , its photo spreads are peopled by professional models - usually very thin ones .
at least , they were until now .
starting in the new year , that will no longer be the case , say editors-in- chief andreas lebert and brigitte huber .
" we are going to make a magazine for women as they are , and not as other people wish them to be , " lebert told a press conference in hamburg .
the plan is to feature musicians , actors , politicians , and readers , to be chosen by the magazine 's editors , instead of models in future editions of the magazine .
that means photo spreads will feature women " who have an identity " and not just " protruding bones , " lebert said .
the move is just the latest salvo in the ongoing ground war against overly thin fashion models .
recently , the topic has made headlines in connection to several international fashion weeks .
four large associations associated with the berlin fashion week last year agreed not to use overly thin models for the catwalk or fashion ads .
in madrid in 2008 , an underweight model was sent home , amid much publicity .
and this year 's london 's fashion week saw a campaign for more femininity - and curves - on the haute couture runways .
but " brigitte " editors said the magazine 's new strategy of changing size-zero models for normal folks does n't aim to declare war on the fashion industry - it merely aims to send a signal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a preference for thin models dominates the fashion industry " there is a great deal of discomfort in the fashion industry on the subject , but no one takes responsibility , " lebert said .

the days when fashion companies dictated style are over , she says ; today , fashion is dictated by people like the wife of the french president , carla bruni , or michelle obama , " as well as athletes , students , and " women on the streets of the major metropolises . "
in addition to making a statement about women and body image , the move may well be aimed at boosting circulation .
" brigitte " has seen a steady drop in readers in recent years , and the current bust in the ad business is making magazine publishers have to search for a new angle .

germany 's top-circulation women 's magazine said it will stop using professional models in its photo shoots .
the decision is part of a wider debate over fashion and body image in the media . " brigitte " is the fashion-and-lifestyle bible for the german everywoman . like most mass-circulation women 's magazines , its photo spreads are peopled by professional models - usually very thin ones .
at least , they were until now .
starting in the new year , that will no longer be the case , say editors-in- chief andreas lebert and brigitte huber .
" we are going to make a magazine for women as they are , and not as other people wish them to be , " lebert told a press conference in hamburg .
the plan is to feature musicians , actors , politicians , and readers , to be chosen by the magazine 's editors , instead of models in future editions of the magazine .
that means photo spreads will feature women " who have an identity " and not just " protruding bones , " lebert said .
the move is just the latest salvo in the ongoing ground war against overly thin fashion models .
recently , the topic has made headlines in connection to several international fashion weeks .
four large associations associated with the berlin fashion week last year agreed not to use overly thin models for the catwalk or fashion ads .
in madrid in 2008 , an underweight model was sent home , amid much publicity .
and this year 's london 's fashion week saw a campaign for more femininity - and curves - on the haute couture runways .
but " brigitte " editors said the magazine 's new strategy of changing size-zero models for normal folks does n't aim to declare war on the fashion industry - it merely aims to send a signal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a preference for thin models dominates the fashion industry " there is a great deal of discomfort in the fashion industry on the subject , but no one takes responsibility , " lebert said .
" maybe one medium has to say : ' we are deciding to present ourselves differently . " '
new trendsetters : bruni , obama for her part , " brigitte " editor huber commented that " these days , attractiveness has many faces . "
the days when fashion companies dictated style are over , she says ; today , fashion is dictated by people like the wife of the french president , carla bruni , or michelle obama , " as well as athletes , students , and " women on the streets of the major metropolises . "
in addition to making a statement about women and body image , the move may well be aimed at boosting circulation .
" brigitte " has seen a steady drop in readers in recent years , and the current bust in the ad business is making magazine publishers have to search for a new angle .
the magazine sold some 720,000 copies in the third quarter of 2009 , down from 757,000 a year earlier. jen / dpa / ap / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he says that trade unions need to get involved . speaking in berlin at celebrations to mark 60 years since the foundation of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- on monday , horst koehler said decisions taken at the recent g-20 meeting in pittsburg had failed to convince him that enough was being done to prevent a repeat of the current global economic crisis .
" i do n't see the monster being tamed , " he told his audience in berlin , adding that the financial markets were still characterized by shell games , lack of transparency and speculation on commodities markets .
koehler bemoaned what he described as a lack of self-reflection from global financial actors and warned against the principle of hope .
he said nobody should think that growth could cover over or eradicate the memories of what has already happened .
the president , a former head of the international monetary fund , said the financial sector needs strong state and inter-state regulatory policies and stressed the important role of the world 's trade unions in " any fundamental reform of the global financial order . "
he called on employee representatives attending the celebrations to " get involved . "
making work a priority he called for a cooperative employment climate and a culture of co-determination in which everyone could have the feeling they were needed .
" work for all , " he said " must be and must remain a main political target . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions need to be involved in reform efforts , koehler said much has changed since the inception of the dgb in 1949 .
back then , germany was struggling to emerge from the rubble of the second world war , and needed all hands on deck to push ahead with its reconstruction effort .
the dgb came into being in order to ensure the country 's workers a good deal and what then chairman hans boeckler described as " a larger portion of the material , intellectual and cultural goods of society . "
on monday , the current dgb leader michael sommer praised the work of germany 's trade unions over the past six decades , saying they had " genuinely made a major contribution " to national reconstruction efforts .
he said it was thanks to the unions that germany was a respected member of the international community which demonstrated an obligation to the preservation of employees ' rights. tkw / afp / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" to this end , we will be seeking critical institutional reforms in any consideration of additional resources , said us treasury secretary timothy geithner in a statement at a meeting of the bank 's development committee in istanbul on monday .
douglas alexander , britain 's secretary of state for international development , and alistair darling , chancellor of the exchequer , said the world bank needs to become more transparent about how it is using its resources .
" we believe that the bank still has ample headroom and can continue to do more with its existing resources , " they said in a statement .
" the bank needs a more equitable shareholding structure , which gives developing country members a stronger voice . "
french finance minister christine lagarde said she did not think the world bank needed a fresh influx of capital for the time being .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world bank headquarters in washington but some developing countries argued that they were depending on the world bank to fill the gap created by lower foreign investment levels , as a result of the crisis .
indian finance minister pranab mukherjee called on richer shareholders to " do their bit by supporting a capital increase . "
the world bank and its affiliated institution , the international monetary fund , are holding their annual meetings this year in istanbul , turkey , where the discussion has focused on internal reforms .
president stressing reform agenda world bank president robert zoellick acknowledged that the bank has to " stress a reform agenda . "
but he added that the bank was experiencing record demand for loans which would put " serious constraints " on his budget by the middle of next year .
zoellick said he was confident that the bank would achieve a deal on a fresh cash injection with its donors by an april deadline .
the bank 's development committee , which sets policy , said in a statement that it was committed to holding meetings to agree on voting reforms .
" it will be important to protect the voting power of the smallest poor countries , " the statement said .
the committee endorsed a deal reached at last month 's g-20 summit to shift voting rights by at least 3 percent towards developing countries .
developing nations , however , are demanding a 6-percent shift .
the world bank loans money and extends grants to developing and poor countries to pay for investment in key areas such as education , health care and infrastructure .
its request for cash comes after the imf , which targets wealthier countries , received a massive boost to its lending resources at the g-20 summit last april .
warning for eastern europe on a different note , the world bank was among three key development leaders who warned of a potential " human and social crisis " facing eastern europe and central asia .
" there are increasing risks of a major credit crunch in the region , " the world bank , the european bank for reconstruction and development -lrb- ebrd -rrb- and the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- said in a joint statement on monday .
analysts interpreted the statement as an attempt to curb growing optimism in an economic recovery , which could lead to excessive risk-taking .
" i think it 's a warning from the international banks that -lrb- investors -rrb- should really be aware of the risks , " ralf wiegert , a frankfurt-based economist with ihs global insight , told afp .
" there is certainly strong potential for the financial crisis in eastern europe to get worse in the next six months ; the potential for bad loans is still rather large .

he says that trade unions need to get involved . speaking in berlin at celebrations to mark 60 years since the foundation of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- on monday , horst koehler said decisions taken at the recent g-20 meeting in pittsburg had failed to convince him that enough was being done to prevent a repeat of the current global economic crisis .
" i do n't see the monster being tamed , " he told his audience in berlin , adding that the financial markets were still characterized by shell games , lack of transparency and speculation on commodities markets .
koehler bemoaned what he described as a lack of self-reflection from global financial actors and warned against the principle of hope .
he said nobody should think that growth could cover over or eradicate the memories of what has already happened .
the president , a former head of the international monetary fund , said the financial sector needs strong state and inter-state regulatory policies and stressed the important role of the world 's trade unions in " any fundamental reform of the global financial order . "
he called on employee representatives attending the celebrations to " get involved . "
making work a priority he called for a cooperative employment climate and a culture of co-determination in which everyone could have the feeling they were needed .
" work for all , " he said " must be and must remain a main political target . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions need to be involved in reform efforts , koehler said much has changed since the inception of the dgb in 1949 .
back then , germany was struggling to emerge from the rubble of the second world war , and needed all hands on deck to push ahead with its reconstruction effort .
the dgb came into being in order to ensure the country 's workers a good deal and what then chairman hans boeckler described as " a larger portion of the material , intellectual and cultural goods of society . "
on monday , the current dgb leader michael sommer praised the work of germany 's trade unions over the past six decades , saying they had " genuinely made a major contribution " to national reconstruction efforts .
he said it was thanks to the unions that germany was a respected member of the international community which demonstrated an obligation to the preservation of employees ' rights. tkw / afp / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their work is seen as having an important impact on research into cancer and aging .
telomerase is called an " immortality enzyme ; " it could play a role in treating the uncontrolled spread of cancer cells .
the three researchers will share the prize , worth 10 million swedish crowns , or around a million euros -lrb- $ 1.4 million -rrb- .
solving problems on protecting chromosomes professor hans jornvall of the nobel assembly said their discoveries were crucial for research on cancer , aging and inherited genetic diseases , .
a statement by the assembly said the three scientists solved a fundamental problem in biology on " how chromosomes can be copied in a complete way and how they are protected against degradation . "
the statement said the discovery of " how chromosomes are protected by telomeres and the enzyme telomerase " had stimulated the development of " new therapeutic strategies . "
recipient says she was " thrilled " " i was just thrilled , " greider told swedish radio , saying she was doing laundry when she received the telephone call about the award from the karolinska institute .
american greider is a professor at johns hopkins university school of medicine in baltimore , australia-native blackburn is a professor at the university of california in san francisco , and szostak , born in the uk , is a professor at the harvard medical school .
last year , the medicine prize went to german virologist harald zur hausen , as well as french virologists francoise barre-sinoussi and luc montaigner , for their work on identifying viruses that cause aids and cervical cancer .
based on their research , a vaccine has been developed to protect against a certain kind of virus that can cause cervical cancer .

in pittsburgh the final touches were put on the alterations to the institutional architecture agreed on at the london summit in april 2009 : with the backing of the large developing countries , the international financial institutions -lrb- ifis -rrb- are set to be further strengthened on the basis of the additional funds already agreed on for the imf as well as capital increases for world bank and regional development banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heads of states agreed on changing the global financial markets the price the industrialised countries are to pay for the developing country ’ s assent to efforts to strengthen these institutions so unloved in the south is , at first glance , not very high .
the former are to cede a certain percentage share of their voting rights to emerging countries from the developing world : two percent at the imf and three percent at the world bank .
that will do little to change the fundamental power relations there , and it is likely to be achieved mainly at the expense of a few small european countries .
old north south discourse gives way to new cooperation but one thing that is surprising is how quick the developing countries in the g-20 were to buy into the ‘ deal ’ to strengthen the role of the ifis .
the deal is , be it said , also the only condition under which china , brazil , and other emerging countries will now be prepared to make additional resources available to the imf for the purpose of the combating the ongoing crisis , e.g. in eastern europe .
the old north-south discourse – it will now , it seems , soon be a thing of the past .
the perceptive observer will have noticed that the final document also shows unmistakable signs of the approach of the copenhagen climate conference .
true , it has nothing to say about binding emissions targets .
but it does contain lots of shoptalk about sustainable growth policies .
and one thing relevant for the developing countries : it cedes to the world bank a leading role in climate policy , calling on the g-20 finance ministers to examine , prior to copenhagen , the options available to fund climate policy , propagating programmes designed to supply the poor with renewable energies , and setting out a commitment on the part of the g-20 countries to cut their subsidies for fossil energies and to replace them with targeted social transfers for the poor .
this will prove to be a huge challenge for countries like india and indonesia that spend large shares of their official budgets for just such subsidies , primarily to the benefit of their urban middle classes .
emerging economies to show little interest for poorer countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-20 wants to boost economic recovery and prevent further financial meltdowns so far the developing countries now represented in the g-20 , and in particular china , have of course weathered the crisis relatively well , thanks to their comparatively good pre-crisis economic policies , which gave them they space they needed to deploy stabilising economic stimulus programmes .
in doing so , though , they often showed little regard for the interests of poorer and smaller developing countries , opting instead for support programmes designed to promote national economic sectors and putting a whole array of protectionist measures in place to boost domestic growth .
all this naturally at the expense of other developing countries that lacked policy space for economic stimulus programmes .
g 20 still favour domestic interests and markets this protectionism is assuming the form less of tariffs than of national subsidies and political preference for domestic businesses .
the bottom line : most g-20 countries have not honoured the commitment they made at their first summit to refrain from adopting protectionist measures .
the aim now must be to reverse this process on the basis of the goal , re-affirmed in pittsburgh , to bring the doha round to a successful conclusion in 2010 .
it is above all the economic heavyweights among the developing countries that now must be expected to open their markets , at least in favour of poorer developing countries .
more economic growth needed in developing nations the final document of the pittsburgh summit repeatedly underlines that one central element of the global path out of the crisis must be more growth in developing countries .
it lists a whole array of measures designed to improve , in developing countries , access to food , energy , and financial services as well as to promote growth and prevent major population groups from sinking into poverty .
much of this is not new .
it is , however , noteworthy that now , with the g-20 , the focus is not only on special crisis-related issues like banker bonuses and financial market regulation , and that development-related issues are now increasingly placed in a global context and discussed at the highest level .

indeed , the fact that the large developing countries are now directly involved in the decision-making process must certainly be seen as one of the more positive outcomes of the financial crisis .

according to the interior ministry website , the socialists have won an absolute majority , winning 160 seats in the 300-seat parliament .
" we stand united to face the big responsibility to change our country into a nation of justice , solidaritzy , humanity and green development , " said papandreou to a cheering crowd .
the ruling conservative new democracy party came in second with just 34 percent of the vote , which translates to 93 seats .
papandreou called the results " a message of hope , for change , and a just society , a more democratic and transparent society . "
sunday 's vote was the third face-off for 57-year-old us-born papandreou , and prime minister costas karamanlis , 53 , a powerful speaker who appeals to the average greek .
both men are heirs to two of the country 's most powerful political dynasties .
scandals and economic woes weakened by scandals and a fragile parliamentary majority , karamanlis called the snap poll in september , gambling he had a better chance of winning now than later in his four-year term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the third face-off for the two leaders first elected in 2004 , karamanlis said ahead of the vote that he needed a strong new mandate to tackle greece 's economic troubles .
the vote comes at a time when the mediterranean country , seen as the eurozone 's weakest link , needs a strong government to deal with an economy on the verge of recession .
papandreou now faces a budget deficit topping six percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , rising unemployment and deep dissatisfaction over the education system , social security and immigration .
extravagant promises ?
the socialist leader promised a three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.36 billion -rrb- stimulus package on a platform of taxing the rich and helping the poor , while incumbent prime minister costas karamanlis called for two years of austerity .
some economists have questioned the wisdom of papandreou 's spending plan , saying it could lead to more borrowing at a time when greece already has the eurozone 's second biggest debt after italy as a percentage of gdp .
after years of robust growth , greece 's output , about 2.5 percent of the eurozone 's total economy , is set to slow to zero growth or even enter negative territory this year , with key drivers and job providers like tourism particularly hard-hit. av / rb / dpa / reuters / ap editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to the interior ministry website , the socialists have won an absolute majority , winning 160 seats in the 300-seat parliament .
" we stand united to face the big responsibility to change our country into a nation of justice , solidaritzy , humanity and green development , " said papandreou to a cheering crowd .
the ruling conservative new democracy party came in second with just 34 percent of the vote , which translates to 93 seats .
papandreou called the results " a message of hope , for change , and a just society , a more democratic and transparent society . "
sunday 's vote was the third face-off for 57-year-old us-born papandreou , and prime minister costas karamanlis , 53 , a powerful speaker who appeals to the average greek .
both men are heirs to two of the country 's most powerful political dynasties .
scandals and economic woes weakened by scandals and a fragile parliamentary majority , karamanlis called the snap poll in september , gambling he had a better chance of winning now than later in his four-year term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the third face-off for the two leaders first elected in 2004 , karamanlis said ahead of the vote that he needed a strong new mandate to tackle greece 's economic troubles .
the vote comes at a time when the mediterranean country , seen as the eurozone 's weakest link , needs a strong government to deal with an economy on the verge of recession .
papandreou now faces a budget deficit topping six percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , rising unemployment and deep dissatisfaction over the education system , social security and immigration .
extravagant promises ?
the socialist leader promised a three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.36 billion -rrb- stimulus package on a platform of taxing the rich and helping the poor , while incumbent prime minister costas karamanlis called for two years of austerity .
some economists have questioned the wisdom of papandreou 's spending plan , saying it could lead to more borrowing at a time when greece already has the eurozone 's second biggest debt after italy as a percentage of gdp .
after years of robust growth , greece 's output , about 2.5 percent of the eurozone 's total economy , is set to slow to zero growth or even enter negative territory this year , with key drivers and job providers like tourism particularly hard-hit. av / rb / dpa / reuters / ap editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

here 's what some of europe 's papers have to say about the resounding ' yes ' vote and the future of the reform treaty . germany 's neue osnabruecker zeitung welcomed ireland 's acceptance of the lisbon treaty , but said it was primarily motivated by money .
" nothing fanned the flames of love for europe among the irish as much as the thought of having to fight their way out of the crisis without cash injections from brussels . "
the paper was critical of the fact that the irish were the only people in the 27 nation block allowed to vote on a treaty " with such reach " .
it said all citizens of europe should have been allowed to have their say at the ballot box .
in the netherlands , de volkskrant said the second irish poll was no longer really about the treaty , but about whether or not the people of ireland wanted to remain in the eu at all .
" the mood has changed radically since the last referendum .
the financial crisis has taught the ' celtic tiger ' that it is safer to be in the eu harbor during a storm . "
in paris , the conservative le figaro said it was now up to the czech president to do the right thing by the citizens of europe .
" the resounding ' yes ' from ireland ought to have cleared the path for the ratification of the lisbon treaty .
the resistance - albeit fierce - from one man can not oppose the will of 500 million europeans . "
it added that vaclav klaus might like , against the wishes of his government and his people , to hold the treaty hostage until the conservatives take up the reins of power in britain .
but such a manoeuvre , it concluded , would be " dishonourable . "
bildunterschrift : ' yes ' was the word on the lips of 67 percent of voters in ireland the british daily , the times says the ireland vote represents another surrender to brussels and laments the fact that the british population never got their chance at a referendum .
" if the british saw the lisbon treaty as a genuine agreement among independent nations , which had been ratified either by a referendum or a general election , they might accept it .
but it is not , and they do not .
they are now asking themselves whether the benefits of belonging to a complex bureaucratic regional block of ageing powers and declining economies outweigh the sacrifice of british sovereignty .
whether it is in britain 's interest to remain in the european union has become a matter of legitimate debate . "
poland 's left-liberal gazeta wyborcza said the green light from the emerald isle meant the eu was now going to have to face some major challenges .
" the first test of the effectiveness of the eu under the new treaty will be expansion .
french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel said expansion would not be possible without the lisbon treaty .
now that its implementation is as good as guaranteed , they will have to take their foot off the brakes . "
it added that croatia , iceland , turkey , serbia , bosnia and herzegovina , montenegro and kosovo are waiting to join .
" in 2010 , ukraine will apply for membership and sooner or later , belarus and moldavia will follow suit . "
austria 's der standard praised the irish for their ' yes ' vote , saying they had left little room for czech president to throw a last minute spanner in the works .
but the question now , the paper wrote , is whether or not the treaty will prove a success .
" can labored joint policies push through planned reforms on migration , domestic security , external relations and increased democracy in eu institutions ? "

he took a small printing company and built it into one of the world 's top five media empires . reinhard mohn , the great-great grandson of company founder carl bertelsmann , died over the weekend .
he was born in 1921 in the small german town of guetersloh in north rhine-westphalia , where the bertelsmann corporation is still based .
in 1939 , at the age of 18 , he was drafted into the german army .
he eventually became a lieutenant in the africa corps .
eventually captured by the americans , he spent the rest of the war in a prison camp in kansas .
on his return to germany in 1946 , he found a town and company in ruins .
his father was bedridden , and although mohn had no plans to go into the publishing business , he acquiesced to his father 's wishes and took over the company .
initially , he and nearly a hundred employees worked to clean up the debris from the allied bombings to get the company up and running again .
humble beginnings the firm was originally a small publishing house that was founded by a printer named carl bertelsmann in 1835 .
it had its own printing plant and was mainly known for producing christian song books .
around the turn of the century , johannes mohn , reinhard 's grandfather married into the bertelsmann family and took over the running of the business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertelsmann 's corporate headquarters is still in guetersloh in 1950 , mohn started the bertelsmann book club .
the idea was very simple .
by joining the book club , customers could buy books at a discount but , they had to agree to buy books on a regular basis .
at its height , the book club had 20 million members around the world .
the steady stream of income generated by the book club sales allowed mohn to expand the company and to acquire other media properties .
these media companies include the us book publisher random house , the german tv broadcaster rtl , magazine publisher gruner + jahr and the direct group book and media clubs .
at one point it also owned 50 percent of the music company sony bmg .
the company has over 100,000 employees in more than 60 countries and revenues of approximately 16 billion euros -lrb- $ 24.7 billion -rrb- .
philanthropy in 1971 mohn converted the family business into a stock corporation and he became its chairman and ceo .
when there was a danger of the company going public , the family stopped it by buying back a 25 percent stake owned by a belgian holding company for $ 6.5 billion in 2006 .
the company is now privately held , with the mohn family owning 23.1 percent and the rest being owned by the bertelsmann foundation .
mohn retired in 1981 at the age of 60 but became the honorary chairman of the supervisory board .
he was also on the board of trustees of the bertelsmann foundation .
private life mohn was married twice and fathered three children with his first wife whom he married in 1949 .
he met his second wife liz mohn at a company function when she was just 17 and he was 38 .
he had three children with her and finally married her in 1982 .
mohn was recognized internationally for his good works and was given numerous awards including the commander 's cross of the order of merit of the federal republic of germany in 1994 , the order of merit with star of the federal republic of germany in 1998 and he was also named an honorary member of the club of rome in april 1996 .
in 2001 he was awarded an honorary doctoral degree from the university of muenster. av / dpa / reuters / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he took a small printing company and built it into one of the world 's top five media empires . reinhard mohn , the great-great grandson of company founder carl bertelsmann , died over the weekend .
he was born in 1921 in the small german town of guetersloh in north rhine-westphalia , where the bertelsmann corporation is still based .

he eventually became a lieutenant in the africa corps .
eventually captured by the americans , he spent the rest of the war in a prison camp in kansas .
on his return to germany in 1946 , he found a town and company in ruins .
his father was bedridden , and although mohn had no plans to go into the publishing business , he acquiesced to his father 's wishes and took over the company .
initially , he and nearly a hundred employees worked to clean up the debris from the allied bombings to get the company up and running again .
humble beginnings the firm was originally a small publishing house that was founded by a printer named carl bertelsmann in 1835 .
it had its own printing plant and was mainly known for producing christian song books .

by joining the book club , customers could buy books at a discount but , they had to agree to buy books on a regular basis .
at its height , the book club had 20 million members around the world .
the steady stream of income generated by the book club sales allowed mohn to expand the company and to acquire other media properties .
these media companies include the us book publisher random house , the german tv broadcaster rtl , magazine publisher gruner + jahr and the direct group book and media clubs .

when there was a danger of the company going public , the family stopped it by buying back a 25 percent stake owned by a belgian holding company for $ 6.5 billion in 2006 .
the company is now privately held , with the mohn family owning 23.1 percent and the rest being owned by the bertelsmann foundation .
mohn retired in 1981 at the age of 60 but became the honorary chairman of the supervisory board .
he was also on the board of trustees of the bertelsmann foundation .
private life mohn was married twice and fathered three children with his first wife whom he married in 1949 .
he met his second wife liz mohn at a company function when she was just 17 and he was 38 .
he had three children with her and finally married her in 1982 .
mohn was recognized internationally for his good works and was given numerous awards including the commander 's cross of the order of merit of the federal republic of germany in 1994 , the order of merit with star of the federal republic of germany in 1998 and he was also named an honorary member of the club of rome in april 1996 .

he took a small printing company and built it into one of the world 's top five media empires . reinhard mohn , the great-great grandson of company founder carl bertelsmann , died over the weekend .
he was born in 1921 in the small german town of guetersloh in north rhine-westphalia , where the bertelsmann corporation is still based .
in 1939 , at the age of 18 , he was drafted into the german army .
he eventually became a lieutenant in the africa corps .
eventually captured by the americans , he spent the rest of the war in a prison camp in kansas .
on his return to germany in 1946 , he found a town and company in ruins .
his father was bedridden , and although mohn had no plans to go into the publishing business , he acquiesced to his father 's wishes and took over the company .
initially , he and nearly a hundred employees worked to clean up the debris from the allied bombings to get the company up and running again .
humble beginnings the firm was originally a small publishing house that was founded by a printer named carl bertelsmann in 1835 .
it had its own printing plant and was mainly known for producing christian song books .
around the turn of the century , johannes mohn , reinhard 's grandfather married into the bertelsmann family and took over the running of the business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertelsmann 's corporate headquarters is still in guetersloh in 1950 , mohn started the bertelsmann book club .
the idea was very simple .
by joining the book club , customers could buy books at a discount but , they had to agree to buy books on a regular basis .
at its height , the book club had 20 million members around the world .
the steady stream of income generated by the book club sales allowed mohn to expand the company and to acquire other media properties .
these media companies include the us book publisher random house , the german tv broadcaster rtl , magazine publisher gruner + jahr and the direct group book and media clubs .

they ’ re trying to influence the eu agriculture ministers ' meeting on the milk market and get further concessions . about 1,000 dairy farmers from germany , france and other countries converged on brussels on monday , clogging the streets with around 200 tractors .
they also brought cowbells , whistles , and even eggs – which they hurled at the eu headquarters – in a bid to add volume to their cries . they are campaigning for help from the eu so they can turn a profit .
milk production is higher than demand in europe and , therefore , prices are currently low , which is putting some farmers ' livelihoods at stake . germany 's agriculture minister ilse aigner , like her french counterpart bruno le maire , has tried to position herself clearly in the dairy farmers ' camp for monday 's informal lunch meeting in brussels . " the milk sector is in dire need of further supporting measures , " aigner says in an interview with the passauer neuen presse newspaper . " sadly , however , the various representatives of the milk industry still have very different opinions on what should be done .
nevertheless , i am going to brussels with a clear task at hand . " aigner says that 20 european nations are in favor of the milk plan spearheaded by germany and france , which calls for manufacturing subsidies to encourage increased production , and for unused eu funds to be reallocated to national governments so they can help milk farmers .
the plan also advocates tighter - or at least unchanged - milk quotas , regional limits on production set by brussels in a bid to encourage widespread dairy farming . however , great britain , denmark , the netherlands , and others oppose milk quotas , saying that the controlled market is the root cause of the problem .
bildunterschrift : " we might as well be throwing it away , " farmers say frequent protests the uproar in brussels is but the latest instalment in a string of dairy farmer protests .
they argue that prices are now so low that it 's almost impossible to produce profit making milk .
many german farmers already protested by spraying thousands of tons of the white stuff on paddocks , instead of selling it to milk and cheese factories . some french farmers even caused consternation by dumping milk in a lake , killing freshwater fish in the process . the dairy farmers want higher prices , subsidies to help boost production , and schemes to help increase demand - for example pushing milk back onto the menus in european schools .
most eu agriculture ministers seem determined to assuage the farmers ; however , many experts see these desires as unrealistic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe makes too much , and drinks too little " it 's going to take a long time until the milk sector is stable again , " says industry expert professor hannes weindlmaier from the technical university of munich . " the main problem is a simple case of over-production - we make too much milk . " yet weindlmaier also acknowledges that the current milk prices - especially for german dairy farmers - barely cover costs , with smaller operations in the south of the country suffering most .
if germany wants to maintain nationwide milk production , government schemes will be necessary to keep higher-cost dairy farmers in business , he says . monday ’ s meeting in brussels is only meant as a chance to discuss the new proposal from france and germany to help the dairy farmers .

they ’ re trying to influence the eu agriculture ministers ' meeting on the milk market and get further concessions . about 1,000 dairy farmers from germany , france and other countries converged on brussels on monday , clogging the streets with around 200 tractors .
they also brought cowbells , whistles , and even eggs – which they hurled at the eu headquarters – in a bid to add volume to their cries . they are campaigning for help from the eu so they can turn a profit .
milk production is higher than demand in europe and , therefore , prices are currently low , which is putting some farmers ' livelihoods at stake . germany 's agriculture minister ilse aigner , like her french counterpart bruno le maire , has tried to position herself clearly in the dairy farmers ' camp for monday 's informal lunch meeting in brussels . " the milk sector is in dire need of further supporting measures , " aigner says in an interview with the passauer neuen presse newspaper . " sadly , however , the various representatives of the milk industry still have very different opinions on what should be done .
nevertheless , i am going to brussels with a clear task at hand . " aigner says that 20 european nations are in favor of the milk plan spearheaded by germany and france , which calls for manufacturing subsidies to encourage increased production , and for unused eu funds to be reallocated to national governments so they can help milk farmers .
the plan also advocates tighter - or at least unchanged - milk quotas , regional limits on production set by brussels in a bid to encourage widespread dairy farming . however , great britain , denmark , the netherlands , and others oppose milk quotas , saying that the controlled market is the root cause of the problem .
bildunterschrift : " we might as well be throwing it away , " farmers say frequent protests the uproar in brussels is but the latest instalment in a string of dairy farmer protests .
they argue that prices are now so low that it 's almost impossible to produce profit making milk .
many german farmers already protested by spraying thousands of tons of the white stuff on paddocks , instead of selling it to milk and cheese factories . some french farmers even caused consternation by dumping milk in a lake , killing freshwater fish in the process . the dairy farmers want higher prices , subsidies to help boost production , and schemes to help increase demand - for example pushing milk back onto the menus in european schools .
most eu agriculture ministers seem determined to assuage the farmers ; however , many experts see these desires as unrealistic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe makes too much , and drinks too little " it 's going to take a long time until the milk sector is stable again , " says industry expert professor hannes weindlmaier from the technical university of munich . " the main problem is a simple case of over-production - we make too much milk . " yet weindlmaier also acknowledges that the current milk prices - especially for german dairy farmers - barely cover costs , with smaller operations in the south of the country suffering most .
if germany wants to maintain nationwide milk production , government schemes will be necessary to keep higher-cost dairy farmers in business , he says . monday ’ s meeting in brussels is only meant as a chance to discuss the new proposal from france and germany to help the dairy farmers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 05.10.2009 german coalition partners face tough talks and compromise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu and fdp will share power in the reichstag chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats and the liberal free democrats start coalition talks on monday to form a new government , but they will first have to agree on a wide range of policy issues . a good week after winning the general election , the two sides are gathering in berlin with a slew of negotiators to hammer out the differences between what they have been saying in public and where they are willing to compromise in private .
the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have gone on the offensive with the bavarian state party leader , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , who is also a possible candidate for justice minister , arguing that the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- can not simply dictate what can , and can not , be done .
" they know our election platform and they know which of their policies we have criticized in recent years , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and westerwelle are heading into tough coalition talks the key issues in the coalition talks , fdp leader guido westerwelle has said , will be taxes , finance policies , the national deficit .
equally high up on the agenda will be domestic security , labor market and health system reforms , and securing future energy resources .
stark differences have already emerged the fdp wants to dismantle the national health fund , which was only introduced at the beginning of this year ; a tall order that chancellor merkel rejects .
but , either way , with a rapidly aging population and shrinking workforce , germany urgently needs to revamp its employee-financed health care system .
the fdp insists on making it easier to fire employees , while opposing the introduction of sector-specific minimum wages .
the cdu wants to keep the minimum wage accords agreed on with the social democrats in the outgoing government and opposes labor market reforms .
the fdp has indicated , however , that this is not a top priority .
clashes are all but certain on topics like domestic security where the fdp vehemently opposes online searches and other measures , which they claim undercut personal data protection .
the cdu argues that these measures are necessary to combat terrorism and the growing scourge of internet crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government surveillance has stirred opposition on energy issues , both parties have said they would like to extend the operation of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants .
there is currently a law that calls for phasing out nuclear energy by 2020 .
although they agree on an extension , they differ on how the profits earned from that should be used .
the cdu wants to use them to keep electricity prices down , while the fdp wants to reduce subsidies for renewable energy .
tax cuts and the deficit on the deficit , the fdp wants to cut spending , which is expected to be twice the european union limit next year .
the fdp says it wants to axe state subsidies , end the " waste " of taxpayer 's money and reduce military spending .
merkel has rejected wholesale spending cuts , while some in her party have suggested raising the sales tax - an idea merkel has dismissed .
the tax issue will perhaps be the toughest nut to crack in the coalition talks in light of germany 's gaping budget deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cutting expenditures and taxes will be difficult fdp general-secretary dirk niebel has called for " a major tax structure reform " and said he was confident that " a coalition consensus could be reached for the next four years . "
but , that may be easier said than done .
saxony 's cdu state premier stanislav tillich urgently warned against lowering taxes , saying " the coalition talks must not agree on budgetary measures that burden our children and grandchildren . "
the position of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , however , is more in line with the fdp .
csu general-secretary alexander dobrindt has said " only investment in the economy and in jobs can lead to more employment and the retention of jobs .
that ultimately also leads to more financial flexibility . "
" cuts in social welfare programs would not be necessary , " he added .
the tax cuts proposed by the cdu would amount to about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.8 billion -rrb- annually .
the fdp has promised cuts worth up to 35 billion euros and wants to implement them soon .
the party also wants to simplify the tax system .
fdp finance spokesman hermann otto solms said his party would not " chicken out " of its campaign pledge. gb / dpa / ap / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have gone on the offensive with the bavarian state party leader , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , who is also a possible candidate for justice minister , arguing that the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- can not simply dictate what can , and can not , be done .
" they know our election platform and they know which of their policies we have criticized in recent years , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and westerwelle are heading into tough coalition talks the key issues in the coalition talks , fdp leader guido westerwelle has said , will be taxes , finance policies , the national deficit .
equally high up on the agenda will be domestic security , labor market and health system reforms , and securing future energy resources .
stark differences have already emerged the fdp wants to dismantle the national health fund , which was only introduced at the beginning of this year ; a tall order that chancellor merkel rejects .
but , either way , with a rapidly aging population and shrinking workforce , germany urgently needs to revamp its employee-financed health care system .
the fdp insists on making it easier to fire employees , while opposing the introduction of sector-specific minimum wages .
the cdu wants to keep the minimum wage accords agreed on with the social democrats in the outgoing government and opposes labor market reforms .
the fdp has indicated , however , that this is not a top priority .
clashes are all but certain on topics like domestic security where the fdp vehemently opposes online searches and other measures , which they claim undercut personal data protection .
the cdu argues that these measures are necessary to combat terrorism and the growing scourge of internet crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government surveillance has stirred opposition on energy issues , both parties have said they would like to extend the operation of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants .
there is currently a law that calls for phasing out nuclear energy by 2020 .

the cdu wants to use them to keep electricity prices down , while the fdp wants to reduce subsidies for renewable energy .
tax cuts and the deficit on the deficit , the fdp wants to cut spending , which is expected to be twice the european union limit next year .
the fdp says it wants to axe state subsidies , end the " waste " of taxpayer 's money and reduce military spending .
merkel has rejected wholesale spending cuts , while some in her party have suggested raising the sales tax - an idea merkel has dismissed .
the tax issue will perhaps be the toughest nut to crack in the coalition talks in light of germany 's gaping budget deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cutting expenditures and taxes will be difficult fdp general-secretary dirk niebel has called for " a major tax structure reform " and said he was confident that " a coalition consensus could be reached for the next four years . "
but , that may be easier said than done .
saxony 's cdu state premier stanislav tillich urgently warned against lowering taxes , saying " the coalition talks must not agree on budgetary measures that burden our children and grandchildren . "
the position of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , however , is more in line with the fdp .
csu general-secretary alexander dobrindt has said " only investment in the economy and in jobs can lead to more employment and the retention of jobs .
that ultimately also leads to more financial flexibility . "
" cuts in social welfare programs would not be necessary , " he added .
the tax cuts proposed by the cdu would amount to about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.8 billion -rrb- annually .
the fdp has promised cuts worth up to 35 billion euros and wants to implement them soon .

the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have gone on the offensive with the bavarian state party leader , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , who is also a possible candidate for justice minister , arguing that the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- can not simply dictate what can , and can not , be done .
" they know our election platform and they know which of their policies we have criticized in recent years , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and westerwelle are heading into tough coalition talks the key issues in the coalition talks , fdp leader guido westerwelle has said , will be taxes , finance policies , the national deficit .
equally high up on the agenda will be domestic security , labor market and health system reforms , and securing future energy resources .
stark differences have already emerged the fdp wants to dismantle the national health fund , which was only introduced at the beginning of this year ; a tall order that chancellor merkel rejects .
but , either way , with a rapidly aging population and shrinking workforce , germany urgently needs to revamp its employee-financed health care system .
the fdp insists on making it easier to fire employees , while opposing the introduction of sector-specific minimum wages .
the cdu wants to keep the minimum wage accords agreed on with the social democrats in the outgoing government and opposes labor market reforms .
the fdp has indicated , however , that this is not a top priority .
clashes are all but certain on topics like domestic security where the fdp vehemently opposes online searches and other measures , which they claim undercut personal data protection .
the cdu argues that these measures are necessary to combat terrorism and the growing scourge of internet crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government surveillance has stirred opposition on energy issues , both parties have said they would like to extend the operation of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants .
there is currently a law that calls for phasing out nuclear energy by 2020 .
although they agree on an extension , they differ on how the profits earned from that should be used .
the cdu wants to use them to keep electricity prices down , while the fdp wants to reduce subsidies for renewable energy .
tax cuts and the deficit on the deficit , the fdp wants to cut spending , which is expected to be twice the european union limit next year .
the fdp says it wants to axe state subsidies , end the " waste " of taxpayer 's money and reduce military spending .
merkel has rejected wholesale spending cuts , while some in her party have suggested raising the sales tax - an idea merkel has dismissed .
the tax issue will perhaps be the toughest nut to crack in the coalition talks in light of germany 's gaping budget deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cutting expenditures and taxes will be difficult fdp general-secretary dirk niebel has called for " a major tax structure reform " and said he was confident that " a coalition consensus could be reached for the next four years . "
but , that may be easier said than done .
saxony 's cdu state premier stanislav tillich urgently warned against lowering taxes , saying " the coalition talks must not agree on budgetary measures that burden our children and grandchildren . "
the position of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , however , is more in line with the fdp .
csu general-secretary alexander dobrindt has said " only investment in the economy and in jobs can lead to more employment and the retention of jobs .
that ultimately also leads to more financial flexibility . "
" cuts in social welfare programs would not be necessary , " he added .
the tax cuts proposed by the cdu would amount to about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.8 billion -rrb- annually .
the fdp has promised cuts worth up to 35 billion euros and wants to implement them soon .
the party also wants to simplify the tax system .

germany 's top-circulation women 's magazine said it will stop using professional models in its photo shoots .
the decision is part of a wider debate over fashion and body image in the media . " brigitte " is the fashion-and-lifestyle bible for the german everywoman . like most mass-circulation women 's magazines , its photo spreads are peopled by professional models - usually very thin ones .
at least , they were until now .
starting in the new year , that will no longer be the case , say editors-in- chief andreas lebert and brigitte huber .
" we are going to make a magazine for women as they are , and not as other people wish them to be , " lebert told a press conference in hamburg .
the plan is to feature musicians , actors , politicians , and readers , to be chosen by the magazine 's editors , instead of models in future editions of the magazine .
that means photo spreads will feature women " who have an identity " and not just " protruding bones , " lebert said .
the move is just the latest salvo in the ongoing ground war against overly thin fashion models .
recently , the topic has made headlines in connection to several international fashion weeks .
four large associations associated with the berlin fashion week last year agreed not to use overly thin models for the catwalk or fashion ads .
in madrid in 2008 , an underweight model was sent home , amid much publicity .
and this year 's london 's fashion week saw a campaign for more femininity - and curves - on the haute couture runways .
but " brigitte " editors said the magazine 's new strategy of changing size-zero models for normal folks does n't aim to declare war on the fashion industry - it merely aims to send a signal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a preference for thin models dominates the fashion industry " there is a great deal of discomfort in the fashion industry on the subject , but no one takes responsibility , " lebert said .
" maybe one medium has to say : ' we are deciding to present ourselves differently . " '
new trendsetters : bruni , obama for her part , " brigitte " editor huber commented that " these days , attractiveness has many faces . "
the days when fashion companies dictated style are over , she says ; today , fashion is dictated by people like the wife of the french president , carla bruni , or michelle obama , " as well as athletes , students , and " women on the streets of the major metropolises . "
in addition to making a statement about women and body image , the move may well be aimed at boosting circulation .
" brigitte " has seen a steady drop in readers in recent years , and the current bust in the ad business is making magazine publishers have to search for a new angle .
the magazine sold some 720,000 copies in the third quarter of 2009 , down from 757,000 a year earlier. jen / dpa / ap / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's top-circulation women 's magazine said it will stop using professional models in its photo shoots .
the decision is part of a wider debate over fashion and body image in the media . " brigitte " is the fashion-and-lifestyle bible for the german everywoman . like most mass-circulation women 's magazines , its photo spreads are peopled by professional models - usually very thin ones .
at least , they were until now .
starting in the new year , that will no longer be the case , say editors-in- chief andreas lebert and brigitte huber .
" we are going to make a magazine for women as they are , and not as other people wish them to be , " lebert told a press conference in hamburg .
the plan is to feature musicians , actors , politicians , and readers , to be chosen by the magazine 's editors , instead of models in future editions of the magazine .
that means photo spreads will feature women " who have an identity " and not just " protruding bones , " lebert said .
the move is just the latest salvo in the ongoing ground war against overly thin fashion models .
recently , the topic has made headlines in connection to several international fashion weeks .
four large associations associated with the berlin fashion week last year agreed not to use overly thin models for the catwalk or fashion ads .
in madrid in 2008 , an underweight model was sent home , amid much publicity .
and this year 's london 's fashion week saw a campaign for more femininity - and curves - on the haute couture runways .
but " brigitte " editors said the magazine 's new strategy of changing size-zero models for normal folks does n't aim to declare war on the fashion industry - it merely aims to send a signal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a preference for thin models dominates the fashion industry " there is a great deal of discomfort in the fashion industry on the subject , but no one takes responsibility , " lebert said .
" maybe one medium has to say : ' we are deciding to present ourselves differently . " '
new trendsetters : bruni , obama for her part , " brigitte " editor huber commented that " these days , attractiveness has many faces . "
the days when fashion companies dictated style are over , she says ; today , fashion is dictated by people like the wife of the french president , carla bruni , or michelle obama , " as well as athletes , students , and " women on the streets of the major metropolises . "
in addition to making a statement about women and body image , the move may well be aimed at boosting circulation .
" brigitte " has seen a steady drop in readers in recent years , and the current bust in the ad business is making magazine publishers have to search for a new angle .
the magazine sold some 720,000 copies in the third quarter of 2009 , down from 757,000 a year earlier. jen / dpa / ap / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 05.10.2009 pittsburgh summit shows positive signs for developing countries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-20 leaders will meet twice in 2010 the g-20 summit has agreed on more money for development banks and now includes developing countries in the decision making process .
that can be seen as a positive outcome of the economic crisis , argues dr. peter wolff . the third g-20 summit that just concluded in pittsburgh has quite manifestly established the g-20 as the forum for global economic cooperation .
in pittsburgh the final touches were put on the alterations to the institutional architecture agreed on at the london summit in april 2009 : with the backing of the large developing countries , the international financial institutions -lrb- ifis -rrb- are set to be further strengthened on the basis of the additional funds already agreed on for the imf as well as capital increases for world bank and regional development banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heads of states agreed on changing the global financial markets the price the industrialised countries are to pay for the developing country ’ s assent to efforts to strengthen these institutions so unloved in the south is , at first glance , not very high .
the former are to cede a certain percentage share of their voting rights to emerging countries from the developing world : two percent at the imf and three percent at the world bank .
that will do little to change the fundamental power relations there , and it is likely to be achieved mainly at the expense of a few small european countries .
old north south discourse gives way to new cooperation but one thing that is surprising is how quick the developing countries in the g-20 were to buy into the ‘ deal ’ to strengthen the role of the ifis .
the deal is , be it said , also the only condition under which china , brazil , and other emerging countries will now be prepared to make additional resources available to the imf for the purpose of the combating the ongoing crisis , e.g. in eastern europe .
the old north-south discourse – it will now , it seems , soon be a thing of the past .
the perceptive observer will have noticed that the final document also shows unmistakable signs of the approach of the copenhagen climate conference .
true , it has nothing to say about binding emissions targets .
but it does contain lots of shoptalk about sustainable growth policies .
and one thing relevant for the developing countries : it cedes to the world bank a leading role in climate policy , calling on the g-20 finance ministers to examine , prior to copenhagen , the options available to fund climate policy , propagating programmes designed to supply the poor with renewable energies , and setting out a commitment on the part of the g-20 countries to cut their subsidies for fossil energies and to replace them with targeted social transfers for the poor .
this will prove to be a huge challenge for countries like india and indonesia that spend large shares of their official budgets for just such subsidies , primarily to the benefit of their urban middle classes .
emerging economies to show little interest for poorer countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-20 wants to boost economic recovery and prevent further financial meltdowns so far the developing countries now represented in the g-20 , and in particular china , have of course weathered the crisis relatively well , thanks to their comparatively good pre-crisis economic policies , which gave them they space they needed to deploy stabilising economic stimulus programmes .
in doing so , though , they often showed little regard for the interests of poorer and smaller developing countries , opting instead for support programmes designed to promote national economic sectors and putting a whole array of protectionist measures in place to boost domestic growth .
all this naturally at the expense of other developing countries that lacked policy space for economic stimulus programmes .
g 20 still favour domestic interests and markets this protectionism is assuming the form less of tariffs than of national subsidies and political preference for domestic businesses .
the bottom line : most g-20 countries have not honoured the commitment they made at their first summit to refrain from adopting protectionist measures .
the aim now must be to reverse this process on the basis of the goal , re-affirmed in pittsburgh , to bring the doha round to a successful conclusion in 2010 .
it is above all the economic heavyweights among the developing countries that now must be expected to open their markets , at least in favour of poorer developing countries .
more economic growth needed in developing nations the final document of the pittsburgh summit repeatedly underlines that one central element of the global path out of the crisis must be more growth in developing countries .
it lists a whole array of measures designed to improve , in developing countries , access to food , energy , and financial services as well as to promote growth and prevent major population groups from sinking into poverty .
much of this is not new .
it is , however , noteworthy that now , with the g-20 , the focus is not only on special crisis-related issues like banker bonuses and financial market regulation , and that development-related issues are now increasingly placed in a global context and discussed at the highest level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter wolff heads die 's world economy department the g-8 had done much the same thing , e.g. in gleneagles in 2005 , where , with a paternalist gesture , more assistance was pledged for the developing countries .
indeed , the fact that the large developing countries are now directly involved in the decision-making process must certainly be seen as one of the more positive outcomes of the financial crisis .
dr. peter wolff heads the department ' world economy and development financing ' at the german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- .
based in bonn , the german development institute draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .

their work is seen as having an important impact on research into cancer and aging .
telomerase is called an " immortality enzyme ; " it could play a role in treating the uncontrolled spread of cancer cells .

solving problems on protecting chromosomes professor hans jornvall of the nobel assembly said their discoveries were crucial for research on cancer , aging and inherited genetic diseases , .
a statement by the assembly said the three scientists solved a fundamental problem in biology on " how chromosomes can be copied in a complete way and how they are protected against degradation . "
the statement said the discovery of " how chromosomes are protected by telomeres and the enzyme telomerase " had stimulated the development of " new therapeutic strategies . "

last year , the medicine prize went to german virologist harald zur hausen , as well as french virologists francoise barre-sinoussi and luc montaigner , for their work on identifying viruses that cause aids and cervical cancer .
based on their research , a vaccine has been developed to protect against a certain kind of virus that can cause cervical cancer .

their work is seen as having an important impact on research into cancer and aging .
telomerase is called an " immortality enzyme ; " it could play a role in treating the uncontrolled spread of cancer cells .
the three researchers will share the prize , worth 10 million swedish crowns , or around a million euros -lrb- $ 1.4 million -rrb- .
solving problems on protecting chromosomes professor hans jornvall of the nobel assembly said their discoveries were crucial for research on cancer , aging and inherited genetic diseases , .
a statement by the assembly said the three scientists solved a fundamental problem in biology on " how chromosomes can be copied in a complete way and how they are protected against degradation . "
the statement said the discovery of " how chromosomes are protected by telomeres and the enzyme telomerase " had stimulated the development of " new therapeutic strategies . "
recipient says she was " thrilled " " i was just thrilled , " greider told swedish radio , saying she was doing laundry when she received the telephone call about the award from the karolinska institute .
american greider is a professor at johns hopkins university school of medicine in baltimore , australia-native blackburn is a professor at the university of california in san francisco , and szostak , born in the uk , is a professor at the harvard medical school .
last year , the medicine prize went to german virologist harald zur hausen , as well as french virologists francoise barre-sinoussi and luc montaigner , for their work on identifying viruses that cause aids and cervical cancer .
based on their research , a vaccine has been developed to protect against a certain kind of virus that can cause cervical cancer .
the nobel in medicine is the first of a series of nobel prizes that will be announced this week ; the prize will be officially handed out in a ceremony in stockholm on december 10. jen / dpa / afp / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have gone on the offensive with the bavarian state party leader , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , who is also a possible candidate for justice minister , arguing that the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- can not simply dictate what can , and can not , be done .
" they know our election platform and they know which of their policies we have criticized in recent years , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and westerwelle are heading into tough coalition talks the key issues in the coalition talks , fdp leader guido westerwelle has said , will be taxes , finance policies , the national deficit .
equally high up on the agenda will be domestic security , labor market and health system reforms , and securing future energy resources .
stark differences have already emerged the fdp wants to dismantle the national health fund , which was only introduced at the beginning of this year ; a tall order that chancellor merkel rejects .
but , either way , with a rapidly aging population and shrinking workforce , germany urgently needs to revamp its employee-financed health care system .
the fdp insists on making it easier to fire employees , while opposing the introduction of sector-specific minimum wages .
the cdu wants to keep the minimum wage accords agreed on with the social democrats in the outgoing government and opposes labor market reforms .
the fdp has indicated , however , that this is not a top priority .
clashes are all but certain on topics like domestic security where the fdp vehemently opposes online searches and other measures , which they claim undercut personal data protection .
the cdu argues that these measures are necessary to combat terrorism and the growing scourge of internet crime .

the fdp says it wants to axe state subsidies , end the " waste " of taxpayer 's money and reduce military spending .

the tax issue will perhaps be the toughest nut to crack in the coalition talks in light of germany 's gaping budget deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cutting expenditures and taxes will be difficult fdp general-secretary dirk niebel has called for " a major tax structure reform " and said he was confident that " a coalition consensus could be reached for the next four years . "

saxony 's cdu state premier stanislav tillich urgently warned against lowering taxes , saying " the coalition talks must not agree on budgetary measures that burden our children and grandchildren . "

the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have gone on the offensive with the bavarian state party leader , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , who is also a possible candidate for justice minister , arguing that the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- can not simply dictate what can , and can not , be done .
" they know our election platform and they know which of their policies we have criticized in recent years , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and westerwelle are heading into tough coalition talks the key issues in the coalition talks , fdp leader guido westerwelle has said , will be taxes , finance policies , the national deficit .
equally high up on the agenda will be domestic security , labor market and health system reforms , and securing future energy resources .
stark differences have already emerged the fdp wants to dismantle the national health fund , which was only introduced at the beginning of this year ; a tall order that chancellor merkel rejects .
but , either way , with a rapidly aging population and shrinking workforce , germany urgently needs to revamp its employee-financed health care system .
the fdp insists on making it easier to fire employees , while opposing the introduction of sector-specific minimum wages .
the cdu wants to keep the minimum wage accords agreed on with the social democrats in the outgoing government and opposes labor market reforms .
the fdp has indicated , however , that this is not a top priority .
clashes are all but certain on topics like domestic security where the fdp vehemently opposes online searches and other measures , which they claim undercut personal data protection .
the cdu argues that these measures are necessary to combat terrorism and the growing scourge of internet crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government surveillance has stirred opposition on energy issues , both parties have said they would like to extend the operation of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants .
there is currently a law that calls for phasing out nuclear energy by 2020 .
although they agree on an extension , they differ on how the profits earned from that should be used .
the cdu wants to use them to keep electricity prices down , while the fdp wants to reduce subsidies for renewable energy .
tax cuts and the deficit on the deficit , the fdp wants to cut spending , which is expected to be twice the european union limit next year .
the fdp says it wants to axe state subsidies , end the " waste " of taxpayer 's money and reduce military spending .
merkel has rejected wholesale spending cuts , while some in her party have suggested raising the sales tax - an idea merkel has dismissed .
the tax issue will perhaps be the toughest nut to crack in the coalition talks in light of germany 's gaping budget deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cutting expenditures and taxes will be difficult fdp general-secretary dirk niebel has called for " a major tax structure reform " and said he was confident that " a coalition consensus could be reached for the next four years . "
but , that may be easier said than done .
saxony 's cdu state premier stanislav tillich urgently warned against lowering taxes , saying " the coalition talks must not agree on budgetary measures that burden our children and grandchildren . "
the position of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , however , is more in line with the fdp .
csu general-secretary alexander dobrindt has said " only investment in the economy and in jobs can lead to more employment and the retention of jobs .
that ultimately also leads to more financial flexibility . "
" cuts in social welfare programs would not be necessary , " he added .
the tax cuts proposed by the cdu would amount to about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.8 billion -rrb- annually .
the fdp has promised cuts worth up to 35 billion euros and wants to implement them soon .
the party also wants to simplify the tax system .

here 's what some of europe 's papers have to say about the resounding ' yes ' vote and the future of the reform treaty . germany 's neue osnabruecker zeitung welcomed ireland 's acceptance of the lisbon treaty , but said it was primarily motivated by money .
" nothing fanned the flames of love for europe among the irish as much as the thought of having to fight their way out of the crisis without cash injections from brussels . "
the paper was critical of the fact that the irish were the only people in the 27 nation block allowed to vote on a treaty " with such reach " .
it said all citizens of europe should have been allowed to have their say at the ballot box .
in the netherlands , de volkskrant said the second irish poll was no longer really about the treaty , but about whether or not the people of ireland wanted to remain in the eu at all .
" the mood has changed radically since the last referendum .
the financial crisis has taught the ' celtic tiger ' that it is safer to be in the eu harbor during a storm . "
in paris , the conservative le figaro said it was now up to the czech president to do the right thing by the citizens of europe .
" the resounding ' yes ' from ireland ought to have cleared the path for the ratification of the lisbon treaty .
the resistance - albeit fierce - from one man can not oppose the will of 500 million europeans . "
it added that vaclav klaus might like , against the wishes of his government and his people , to hold the treaty hostage until the conservatives take up the reins of power in britain .
but such a manoeuvre , it concluded , would be " dishonourable . "
bildunterschrift : ' yes ' was the word on the lips of 67 percent of voters in ireland the british daily , the times says the ireland vote represents another surrender to brussels and laments the fact that the british population never got their chance at a referendum .
" if the british saw the lisbon treaty as a genuine agreement among independent nations , which had been ratified either by a referendum or a general election , they might accept it .
but it is not , and they do not .
they are now asking themselves whether the benefits of belonging to a complex bureaucratic regional block of ageing powers and declining economies outweigh the sacrifice of british sovereignty .
whether it is in britain 's interest to remain in the european union has become a matter of legitimate debate . "
poland 's left-liberal gazeta wyborcza said the green light from the emerald isle meant the eu was now going to have to face some major challenges .
" the first test of the effectiveness of the eu under the new treaty will be expansion .
french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel said expansion would not be possible without the lisbon treaty .
now that its implementation is as good as guaranteed , they will have to take their foot off the brakes . "
it added that croatia , iceland , turkey , serbia , bosnia and herzegovina , montenegro and kosovo are waiting to join .
" in 2010 , ukraine will apply for membership and sooner or later , belarus and moldavia will follow suit . "
austria 's der standard praised the irish for their ' yes ' vote , saying they had left little room for czech president to throw a last minute spanner in the works .
but the question now , the paper wrote , is whether or not the treaty will prove a success .
" can labored joint policies push through planned reforms on migration , domestic security , external relations and increased democracy in eu institutions ? "

here 's what some of europe 's papers have to say about the resounding ' yes ' vote and the future of the reform treaty . germany 's neue osnabruecker zeitung welcomed ireland 's acceptance of the lisbon treaty , but said it was primarily motivated by money .
" nothing fanned the flames of love for europe among the irish as much as the thought of having to fight their way out of the crisis without cash injections from brussels . "
the paper was critical of the fact that the irish were the only people in the 27 nation block allowed to vote on a treaty " with such reach " .
it said all citizens of europe should have been allowed to have their say at the ballot box .
in the netherlands , de volkskrant said the second irish poll was no longer really about the treaty , but about whether or not the people of ireland wanted to remain in the eu at all .
" the mood has changed radically since the last referendum .
the financial crisis has taught the ' celtic tiger ' that it is safer to be in the eu harbor during a storm . "
in paris , the conservative le figaro said it was now up to the czech president to do the right thing by the citizens of europe .
" the resounding ' yes ' from ireland ought to have cleared the path for the ratification of the lisbon treaty .
the resistance - albeit fierce - from one man can not oppose the will of 500 million europeans . "
it added that vaclav klaus might like , against the wishes of his government and his people , to hold the treaty hostage until the conservatives take up the reins of power in britain .
but such a manoeuvre , it concluded , would be " dishonourable . "
bildunterschrift : ' yes ' was the word on the lips of 67 percent of voters in ireland the british daily , the times says the ireland vote represents another surrender to brussels and laments the fact that the british population never got their chance at a referendum .
" if the british saw the lisbon treaty as a genuine agreement among independent nations , which had been ratified either by a referendum or a general election , they might accept it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 05.10.2009 pittsburgh summit shows positive signs for developing countries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-20 leaders will meet twice in 2010 the g-20 summit has agreed on more money for development banks and now includes developing countries in the decision making process .
that can be seen as a positive outcome of the economic crisis , argues dr. peter wolff . the third g-20 summit that just concluded in pittsburgh has quite manifestly established the g-20 as the forum for global economic cooperation .
in pittsburgh the final touches were put on the alterations to the institutional architecture agreed on at the london summit in april 2009 : with the backing of the large developing countries , the international financial institutions -lrb- ifis -rrb- are set to be further strengthened on the basis of the additional funds already agreed on for the imf as well as capital increases for world bank and regional development banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heads of states agreed on changing the global financial markets the price the industrialised countries are to pay for the developing country ’ s assent to efforts to strengthen these institutions so unloved in the south is , at first glance , not very high .
the former are to cede a certain percentage share of their voting rights to emerging countries from the developing world : two percent at the imf and three percent at the world bank .
that will do little to change the fundamental power relations there , and it is likely to be achieved mainly at the expense of a few small european countries .
old north south discourse gives way to new cooperation but one thing that is surprising is how quick the developing countries in the g-20 were to buy into the ‘ deal ’ to strengthen the role of the ifis .
the deal is , be it said , also the only condition under which china , brazil , and other emerging countries will now be prepared to make additional resources available to the imf for the purpose of the combating the ongoing crisis , e.g. in eastern europe .
the old north-south discourse – it will now , it seems , soon be a thing of the past .
the perceptive observer will have noticed that the final document also shows unmistakable signs of the approach of the copenhagen climate conference .
true , it has nothing to say about binding emissions targets .
but it does contain lots of shoptalk about sustainable growth policies .
and one thing relevant for the developing countries : it cedes to the world bank a leading role in climate policy , calling on the g-20 finance ministers to examine , prior to copenhagen , the options available to fund climate policy , propagating programmes designed to supply the poor with renewable energies , and setting out a commitment on the part of the g-20 countries to cut their subsidies for fossil energies and to replace them with targeted social transfers for the poor .
this will prove to be a huge challenge for countries like india and indonesia that spend large shares of their official budgets for just such subsidies , primarily to the benefit of their urban middle classes .
emerging economies to show little interest for poorer countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-20 wants to boost economic recovery and prevent further financial meltdowns so far the developing countries now represented in the g-20 , and in particular china , have of course weathered the crisis relatively well , thanks to their comparatively good pre-crisis economic policies , which gave them they space they needed to deploy stabilising economic stimulus programmes .
in doing so , though , they often showed little regard for the interests of poorer and smaller developing countries , opting instead for support programmes designed to promote national economic sectors and putting a whole array of protectionist measures in place to boost domestic growth .
all this naturally at the expense of other developing countries that lacked policy space for economic stimulus programmes .
g 20 still favour domestic interests and markets this protectionism is assuming the form less of tariffs than of national subsidies and political preference for domestic businesses .
the bottom line : most g-20 countries have not honoured the commitment they made at their first summit to refrain from adopting protectionist measures .
the aim now must be to reverse this process on the basis of the goal , re-affirmed in pittsburgh , to bring the doha round to a successful conclusion in 2010 .
it is above all the economic heavyweights among the developing countries that now must be expected to open their markets , at least in favour of poorer developing countries .
more economic growth needed in developing nations the final document of the pittsburgh summit repeatedly underlines that one central element of the global path out of the crisis must be more growth in developing countries .
it lists a whole array of measures designed to improve , in developing countries , access to food , energy , and financial services as well as to promote growth and prevent major population groups from sinking into poverty .
much of this is not new .
it is , however , noteworthy that now , with the g-20 , the focus is not only on special crisis-related issues like banker bonuses and financial market regulation , and that development-related issues are now increasingly placed in a global context and discussed at the highest level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter wolff heads die 's world economy department the g-8 had done much the same thing , e.g. in gleneagles in 2005 , where , with a paternalist gesture , more assistance was pledged for the developing countries .
indeed , the fact that the large developing countries are now directly involved in the decision-making process must certainly be seen as one of the more positive outcomes of the financial crisis .
dr. peter wolff heads the department ' world economy and development financing ' at the german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- .
based in bonn , the german development institute draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .
it consults on the basis of independent research findings in germany and worldwide and deals with current issues in cooperation between industrial and developing countries . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the former are to cede a certain percentage share of their voting rights to emerging countries from the developing world : two percent at the imf and three percent at the world bank .
that will do little to change the fundamental power relations there , and it is likely to be achieved mainly at the expense of a few small european countries .
old north south discourse gives way to new cooperation but one thing that is surprising is how quick the developing countries in the g-20 were to buy into the ‘ deal ’ to strengthen the role of the ifis .
the deal is , be it said , also the only condition under which china , brazil , and other emerging countries will now be prepared to make additional resources available to the imf for the purpose of the combating the ongoing crisis , e.g. in eastern europe .
the old north-south discourse – it will now , it seems , soon be a thing of the past .
the perceptive observer will have noticed that the final document also shows unmistakable signs of the approach of the copenhagen climate conference .
true , it has nothing to say about binding emissions targets .

this will prove to be a huge challenge for countries like india and indonesia that spend large shares of their official budgets for just such subsidies , primarily to the benefit of their urban middle classes .

in doing so , though , they often showed little regard for the interests of poorer and smaller developing countries , opting instead for support programmes designed to promote national economic sectors and putting a whole array of protectionist measures in place to boost domestic growth .
all this naturally at the expense of other developing countries that lacked policy space for economic stimulus programmes .
g 20 still favour domestic interests and markets this protectionism is assuming the form less of tariffs than of national subsidies and political preference for domestic businesses .
the bottom line : most g-20 countries have not honoured the commitment they made at their first summit to refrain from adopting protectionist measures .

according to the interior ministry website , the socialists have won an absolute majority , winning 160 seats in the 300-seat parliament .
" we stand united to face the big responsibility to change our country into a nation of justice , solidaritzy , humanity and green development , " said papandreou to a cheering crowd .
the ruling conservative new democracy party came in second with just 34 percent of the vote , which translates to 93 seats .
papandreou called the results " a message of hope , for change , and a just society , a more democratic and transparent society . "
sunday 's vote was the third face-off for 57-year-old us-born papandreou , and prime minister costas karamanlis , 53 , a powerful speaker who appeals to the average greek .
both men are heirs to two of the country 's most powerful political dynasties .
scandals and economic woes weakened by scandals and a fragile parliamentary majority , karamanlis called the snap poll in september , gambling he had a better chance of winning now than later in his four-year term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the third face-off for the two leaders first elected in 2004 , karamanlis said ahead of the vote that he needed a strong new mandate to tackle greece 's economic troubles .
the vote comes at a time when the mediterranean country , seen as the eurozone 's weakest link , needs a strong government to deal with an economy on the verge of recession .
papandreou now faces a budget deficit topping six percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , rising unemployment and deep dissatisfaction over the education system , social security and immigration .
extravagant promises ?
the socialist leader promised a three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.36 billion -rrb- stimulus package on a platform of taxing the rich and helping the poor , while incumbent prime minister costas karamanlis called for two years of austerity .
some economists have questioned the wisdom of papandreou 's spending plan , saying it could lead to more borrowing at a time when greece already has the eurozone 's second biggest debt after italy as a percentage of gdp .
after years of robust growth , greece 's output , about 2.5 percent of the eurozone 's total economy , is set to slow to zero growth or even enter negative territory this year , with key drivers and job providers like tourism particularly hard-hit. av / rb / dpa / reuters / ap editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their work is seen as having an important impact on research into cancer and aging .
telomerase is called an " immortality enzyme ; " it could play a role in treating the uncontrolled spread of cancer cells .
the three researchers will share the prize , worth 10 million swedish crowns , or around a million euros -lrb- $ 1.4 million -rrb- .
solving problems on protecting chromosomes professor hans jornvall of the nobel assembly said their discoveries were crucial for research on cancer , aging and inherited genetic diseases , .
a statement by the assembly said the three scientists solved a fundamental problem in biology on " how chromosomes can be copied in a complete way and how they are protected against degradation . "
the statement said the discovery of " how chromosomes are protected by telomeres and the enzyme telomerase " had stimulated the development of " new therapeutic strategies . "
recipient says she was " thrilled " " i was just thrilled , " greider told swedish radio , saying she was doing laundry when she received the telephone call about the award from the karolinska institute .
american greider is a professor at johns hopkins university school of medicine in baltimore , australia-native blackburn is a professor at the university of california in san francisco , and szostak , born in the uk , is a professor at the harvard medical school .
last year , the medicine prize went to german virologist harald zur hausen , as well as french virologists francoise barre-sinoussi and luc montaigner , for their work on identifying viruses that cause aids and cervical cancer .
based on their research , a vaccine has been developed to protect against a certain kind of virus that can cause cervical cancer .
the nobel in medicine is the first of a series of nobel prizes that will be announced this week ; the prize will be officially handed out in a ceremony in stockholm on december 10. jen / dpa / afp / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their work is seen as having an important impact on research into cancer and aging .
telomerase is called an " immortality enzyme ; " it could play a role in treating the uncontrolled spread of cancer cells .
the three researchers will share the prize , worth 10 million swedish crowns , or around a million euros -lrb- $ 1.4 million -rrb- .
solving problems on protecting chromosomes professor hans jornvall of the nobel assembly said their discoveries were crucial for research on cancer , aging and inherited genetic diseases , .
a statement by the assembly said the three scientists solved a fundamental problem in biology on " how chromosomes can be copied in a complete way and how they are protected against degradation . "
the statement said the discovery of " how chromosomes are protected by telomeres and the enzyme telomerase " had stimulated the development of " new therapeutic strategies . "
recipient says she was " thrilled " " i was just thrilled , " greider told swedish radio , saying she was doing laundry when she received the telephone call about the award from the karolinska institute .
american greider is a professor at johns hopkins university school of medicine in baltimore , australia-native blackburn is a professor at the university of california in san francisco , and szostak , born in the uk , is a professor at the harvard medical school .
last year , the medicine prize went to german virologist harald zur hausen , as well as french virologists francoise barre-sinoussi and luc montaigner , for their work on identifying viruses that cause aids and cervical cancer .
based on their research , a vaccine has been developed to protect against a certain kind of virus that can cause cervical cancer .

he says that trade unions need to get involved . speaking in berlin at celebrations to mark 60 years since the foundation of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- on monday , horst koehler said decisions taken at the recent g-20 meeting in pittsburg had failed to convince him that enough was being done to prevent a repeat of the current global economic crisis .
" i do n't see the monster being tamed , " he told his audience in berlin , adding that the financial markets were still characterized by shell games , lack of transparency and speculation on commodities markets .
koehler bemoaned what he described as a lack of self-reflection from global financial actors and warned against the principle of hope .
he said nobody should think that growth could cover over or eradicate the memories of what has already happened .
the president , a former head of the international monetary fund , said the financial sector needs strong state and inter-state regulatory policies and stressed the important role of the world 's trade unions in " any fundamental reform of the global financial order . "
he called on employee representatives attending the celebrations to " get involved . "
making work a priority he called for a cooperative employment climate and a culture of co-determination in which everyone could have the feeling they were needed .
" work for all , " he said " must be and must remain a main political target . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions need to be involved in reform efforts , koehler said much has changed since the inception of the dgb in 1949 .
back then , germany was struggling to emerge from the rubble of the second world war , and needed all hands on deck to push ahead with its reconstruction effort .
the dgb came into being in order to ensure the country 's workers a good deal and what then chairman hans boeckler described as " a larger portion of the material , intellectual and cultural goods of society . "
on monday , the current dgb leader michael sommer praised the work of germany 's trade unions over the past six decades , saying they had " genuinely made a major contribution " to national reconstruction efforts .
he said it was thanks to the unions that germany was a respected member of the international community which demonstrated an obligation to the preservation of employees ' rights. tkw / afp / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he says that trade unions need to get involved . speaking in berlin at celebrations to mark 60 years since the foundation of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- on monday , horst koehler said decisions taken at the recent g-20 meeting in pittsburg had failed to convince him that enough was being done to prevent a repeat of the current global economic crisis .
" i do n't see the monster being tamed , " he told his audience in berlin , adding that the financial markets were still characterized by shell games , lack of transparency and speculation on commodities markets .
koehler bemoaned what he described as a lack of self-reflection from global financial actors and warned against the principle of hope .
he said nobody should think that growth could cover over or eradicate the memories of what has already happened .
the president , a former head of the international monetary fund , said the financial sector needs strong state and inter-state regulatory policies and stressed the important role of the world 's trade unions in " any fundamental reform of the global financial order . "
he called on employee representatives attending the celebrations to " get involved . "
making work a priority he called for a cooperative employment climate and a culture of co-determination in which everyone could have the feeling they were needed .
" work for all , " he said " must be and must remain a main political target . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions need to be involved in reform efforts , koehler said much has changed since the inception of the dgb in 1949 .
back then , germany was struggling to emerge from the rubble of the second world war , and needed all hands on deck to push ahead with its reconstruction effort .
the dgb came into being in order to ensure the country 's workers a good deal and what then chairman hans boeckler described as " a larger portion of the material , intellectual and cultural goods of society . "
on monday , the current dgb leader michael sommer praised the work of germany 's trade unions over the past six decades , saying they had " genuinely made a major contribution " to national reconstruction efforts .
he said it was thanks to the unions that germany was a respected member of the international community which demonstrated an obligation to the preservation of employees ' rights. tkw / afp / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 05.10.2009 pittsburgh summit shows positive signs for developing countries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-20 leaders will meet twice in 2010 the g-20 summit has agreed on more money for development banks and now includes developing countries in the decision making process .
that can be seen as a positive outcome of the economic crisis , argues dr. peter wolff . the third g-20 summit that just concluded in pittsburgh has quite manifestly established the g-20 as the forum for global economic cooperation .
in pittsburgh the final touches were put on the alterations to the institutional architecture agreed on at the london summit in april 2009 : with the backing of the large developing countries , the international financial institutions -lrb- ifis -rrb- are set to be further strengthened on the basis of the additional funds already agreed on for the imf as well as capital increases for world bank and regional development banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heads of states agreed on changing the global financial markets the price the industrialised countries are to pay for the developing country ’ s assent to efforts to strengthen these institutions so unloved in the south is , at first glance , not very high .
the former are to cede a certain percentage share of their voting rights to emerging countries from the developing world : two percent at the imf and three percent at the world bank .
that will do little to change the fundamental power relations there , and it is likely to be achieved mainly at the expense of a few small european countries .
old north south discourse gives way to new cooperation but one thing that is surprising is how quick the developing countries in the g-20 were to buy into the ‘ deal ’ to strengthen the role of the ifis .
the deal is , be it said , also the only condition under which china , brazil , and other emerging countries will now be prepared to make additional resources available to the imf for the purpose of the combating the ongoing crisis , e.g. in eastern europe .
the old north-south discourse – it will now , it seems , soon be a thing of the past .
the perceptive observer will have noticed that the final document also shows unmistakable signs of the approach of the copenhagen climate conference .
true , it has nothing to say about binding emissions targets .
but it does contain lots of shoptalk about sustainable growth policies .
and one thing relevant for the developing countries : it cedes to the world bank a leading role in climate policy , calling on the g-20 finance ministers to examine , prior to copenhagen , the options available to fund climate policy , propagating programmes designed to supply the poor with renewable energies , and setting out a commitment on the part of the g-20 countries to cut their subsidies for fossil energies and to replace them with targeted social transfers for the poor .
this will prove to be a huge challenge for countries like india and indonesia that spend large shares of their official budgets for just such subsidies , primarily to the benefit of their urban middle classes .
emerging economies to show little interest for poorer countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-20 wants to boost economic recovery and prevent further financial meltdowns so far the developing countries now represented in the g-20 , and in particular china , have of course weathered the crisis relatively well , thanks to their comparatively good pre-crisis economic policies , which gave them they space they needed to deploy stabilising economic stimulus programmes .
in doing so , though , they often showed little regard for the interests of poorer and smaller developing countries , opting instead for support programmes designed to promote national economic sectors and putting a whole array of protectionist measures in place to boost domestic growth .
all this naturally at the expense of other developing countries that lacked policy space for economic stimulus programmes .
g 20 still favour domestic interests and markets this protectionism is assuming the form less of tariffs than of national subsidies and political preference for domestic businesses .
the bottom line : most g-20 countries have not honoured the commitment they made at their first summit to refrain from adopting protectionist measures .
the aim now must be to reverse this process on the basis of the goal , re-affirmed in pittsburgh , to bring the doha round to a successful conclusion in 2010 .
it is above all the economic heavyweights among the developing countries that now must be expected to open their markets , at least in favour of poorer developing countries .
more economic growth needed in developing nations the final document of the pittsburgh summit repeatedly underlines that one central element of the global path out of the crisis must be more growth in developing countries .
it lists a whole array of measures designed to improve , in developing countries , access to food , energy , and financial services as well as to promote growth and prevent major population groups from sinking into poverty .
much of this is not new .
it is , however , noteworthy that now , with the g-20 , the focus is not only on special crisis-related issues like banker bonuses and financial market regulation , and that development-related issues are now increasingly placed in a global context and discussed at the highest level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter wolff heads die 's world economy department the g-8 had done much the same thing , e.g. in gleneagles in 2005 , where , with a paternalist gesture , more assistance was pledged for the developing countries .
indeed , the fact that the large developing countries are now directly involved in the decision-making process must certainly be seen as one of the more positive outcomes of the financial crisis .
dr. peter wolff heads the department ' world economy and development financing ' at the german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- .
based in bonn , the german development institute draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .
it consults on the basis of independent research findings in germany and worldwide and deals with current issues in cooperation between industrial and developing countries . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to the interior ministry website , the socialists have won an absolute majority , winning 160 seats in the 300-seat parliament .
" we stand united to face the big responsibility to change our country into a nation of justice , solidaritzy , humanity and green development , " said papandreou to a cheering crowd .
the ruling conservative new democracy party came in second with just 34 percent of the vote , which translates to 93 seats .
papandreou called the results " a message of hope , for change , and a just society , a more democratic and transparent society . "
sunday 's vote was the third face-off for 57-year-old us-born papandreou , and prime minister costas karamanlis , 53 , a powerful speaker who appeals to the average greek .
both men are heirs to two of the country 's most powerful political dynasties .
scandals and economic woes weakened by scandals and a fragile parliamentary majority , karamanlis called the snap poll in september , gambling he had a better chance of winning now than later in his four-year term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the third face-off for the two leaders first elected in 2004 , karamanlis said ahead of the vote that he needed a strong new mandate to tackle greece 's economic troubles .
the vote comes at a time when the mediterranean country , seen as the eurozone 's weakest link , needs a strong government to deal with an economy on the verge of recession .
papandreou now faces a budget deficit topping six percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , rising unemployment and deep dissatisfaction over the education system , social security and immigration .
extravagant promises ?
the socialist leader promised a three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.36 billion -rrb- stimulus package on a platform of taxing the rich and helping the poor , while incumbent prime minister costas karamanlis called for two years of austerity .
some economists have questioned the wisdom of papandreou 's spending plan , saying it could lead to more borrowing at a time when greece already has the eurozone 's second biggest debt after italy as a percentage of gdp .
after years of robust growth , greece 's output , about 2.5 percent of the eurozone 's total economy , is set to slow to zero growth or even enter negative territory this year , with key drivers and job providers like tourism particularly hard-hit. av / rb / dpa / reuters / ap editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to the interior ministry website , the socialists have won an absolute majority , winning 160 seats in the 300-seat parliament .
" we stand united to face the big responsibility to change our country into a nation of justice , solidaritzy , humanity and green development , " said papandreou to a cheering crowd .
the ruling conservative new democracy party came in second with just 34 percent of the vote , which translates to 93 seats .
papandreou called the results " a message of hope , for change , and a just society , a more democratic and transparent society . "
sunday 's vote was the third face-off for 57-year-old us-born papandreou , and prime minister costas karamanlis , 53 , a powerful speaker who appeals to the average greek .
both men are heirs to two of the country 's most powerful political dynasties .
scandals and economic woes weakened by scandals and a fragile parliamentary majority , karamanlis called the snap poll in september , gambling he had a better chance of winning now than later in his four-year term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the third face-off for the two leaders first elected in 2004 , karamanlis said ahead of the vote that he needed a strong new mandate to tackle greece 's economic troubles .
the vote comes at a time when the mediterranean country , seen as the eurozone 's weakest link , needs a strong government to deal with an economy on the verge of recession .
papandreou now faces a budget deficit topping six percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , rising unemployment and deep dissatisfaction over the education system , social security and immigration .
extravagant promises ?
the socialist leader promised a three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.36 billion -rrb- stimulus package on a platform of taxing the rich and helping the poor , while incumbent prime minister costas karamanlis called for two years of austerity .
some economists have questioned the wisdom of papandreou 's spending plan , saying it could lead to more borrowing at a time when greece already has the eurozone 's second biggest debt after italy as a percentage of gdp .
after years of robust growth , greece 's output , about 2.5 percent of the eurozone 's total economy , is set to slow to zero growth or even enter negative territory this year , with key drivers and job providers like tourism particularly hard-hit. av / rb / dpa / reuters / ap editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he took a small printing company and built it into one of the world 's top five media empires . reinhard mohn , the great-great grandson of company founder carl bertelsmann , died over the weekend .
he was born in 1921 in the small german town of guetersloh in north rhine-westphalia , where the bertelsmann corporation is still based .
in 1939 , at the age of 18 , he was drafted into the german army .
he eventually became a lieutenant in the africa corps .
eventually captured by the americans , he spent the rest of the war in a prison camp in kansas .
on his return to germany in 1946 , he found a town and company in ruins .
his father was bedridden , and although mohn had no plans to go into the publishing business , he acquiesced to his father 's wishes and took over the company .
initially , he and nearly a hundred employees worked to clean up the debris from the allied bombings to get the company up and running again .
humble beginnings the firm was originally a small publishing house that was founded by a printer named carl bertelsmann in 1835 .
it had its own printing plant and was mainly known for producing christian song books .
around the turn of the century , johannes mohn , reinhard 's grandfather married into the bertelsmann family and took over the running of the business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertelsmann 's corporate headquarters is still in guetersloh in 1950 , mohn started the bertelsmann book club .
the idea was very simple .
by joining the book club , customers could buy books at a discount but , they had to agree to buy books on a regular basis .
at its height , the book club had 20 million members around the world .
the steady stream of income generated by the book club sales allowed mohn to expand the company and to acquire other media properties .
these media companies include the us book publisher random house , the german tv broadcaster rtl , magazine publisher gruner + jahr and the direct group book and media clubs .
at one point it also owned 50 percent of the music company sony bmg .
the company has over 100,000 employees in more than 60 countries and revenues of approximately 16 billion euros -lrb- $ 24.7 billion -rrb- .
philanthropy in 1971 mohn converted the family business into a stock corporation and he became its chairman and ceo .
when there was a danger of the company going public , the family stopped it by buying back a 25 percent stake owned by a belgian holding company for $ 6.5 billion in 2006 .
the company is now privately held , with the mohn family owning 23.1 percent and the rest being owned by the bertelsmann foundation .
mohn retired in 1981 at the age of 60 but became the honorary chairman of the supervisory board .
he was also on the board of trustees of the bertelsmann foundation .
private life mohn was married twice and fathered three children with his first wife whom he married in 1949 .
he met his second wife liz mohn at a company function when she was just 17 and he was 38 .
he had three children with her and finally married her in 1982 .
mohn was recognized internationally for his good works and was given numerous awards including the commander 's cross of the order of merit of the federal republic of germany in 1994 , the order of merit with star of the federal republic of germany in 1998 and he was also named an honorary member of the club of rome in april 1996 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 05.10.2009 german coalition partners face tough talks and compromise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu and fdp will share power in the reichstag chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats and the liberal free democrats start coalition talks on monday to form a new government , but they will first have to agree on a wide range of policy issues . a good week after winning the general election , the two sides are gathering in berlin with a slew of negotiators to hammer out the differences between what they have been saying in public and where they are willing to compromise in private .
the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have gone on the offensive with the bavarian state party leader , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , who is also a possible candidate for justice minister , arguing that the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- can not simply dictate what can , and can not , be done .
" they know our election platform and they know which of their policies we have criticized in recent years , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and westerwelle are heading into tough coalition talks the key issues in the coalition talks , fdp leader guido westerwelle has said , will be taxes , finance policies , the national deficit .
equally high up on the agenda will be domestic security , labor market and health system reforms , and securing future energy resources .
stark differences have already emerged the fdp wants to dismantle the national health fund , which was only introduced at the beginning of this year ; a tall order that chancellor merkel rejects .
but , either way , with a rapidly aging population and shrinking workforce , germany urgently needs to revamp its employee-financed health care system .
the fdp insists on making it easier to fire employees , while opposing the introduction of sector-specific minimum wages .
the cdu wants to keep the minimum wage accords agreed on with the social democrats in the outgoing government and opposes labor market reforms .
the fdp has indicated , however , that this is not a top priority .
clashes are all but certain on topics like domestic security where the fdp vehemently opposes online searches and other measures , which they claim undercut personal data protection .
the cdu argues that these measures are necessary to combat terrorism and the growing scourge of internet crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government surveillance has stirred opposition on energy issues , both parties have said they would like to extend the operation of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants .
there is currently a law that calls for phasing out nuclear energy by 2020 .
although they agree on an extension , they differ on how the profits earned from that should be used .
the cdu wants to use them to keep electricity prices down , while the fdp wants to reduce subsidies for renewable energy .
tax cuts and the deficit on the deficit , the fdp wants to cut spending , which is expected to be twice the european union limit next year .
the fdp says it wants to axe state subsidies , end the " waste " of taxpayer 's money and reduce military spending .
merkel has rejected wholesale spending cuts , while some in her party have suggested raising the sales tax - an idea merkel has dismissed .
the tax issue will perhaps be the toughest nut to crack in the coalition talks in light of germany 's gaping budget deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cutting expenditures and taxes will be difficult fdp general-secretary dirk niebel has called for " a major tax structure reform " and said he was confident that " a coalition consensus could be reached for the next four years . "
but , that may be easier said than done .
saxony 's cdu state premier stanislav tillich urgently warned against lowering taxes , saying " the coalition talks must not agree on budgetary measures that burden our children and grandchildren . "
the position of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , however , is more in line with the fdp .
csu general-secretary alexander dobrindt has said " only investment in the economy and in jobs can lead to more employment and the retention of jobs .
that ultimately also leads to more financial flexibility . "
" cuts in social welfare programs would not be necessary , " he added .
the tax cuts proposed by the cdu would amount to about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.8 billion -rrb- annually .
the fdp has promised cuts worth up to 35 billion euros and wants to implement them soon .
the party also wants to simplify the tax system .
fdp finance spokesman hermann otto solms said his party would not " chicken out " of its campaign pledge. gb / dpa / ap / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have gone on the offensive with the bavarian state party leader , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , who is also a possible candidate for justice minister , arguing that the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- can not simply dictate what can , and can not , be done .
" they know our election platform and they know which of their policies we have criticized in recent years , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and westerwelle are heading into tough coalition talks the key issues in the coalition talks , fdp leader guido westerwelle has said , will be taxes , finance policies , the national deficit .
equally high up on the agenda will be domestic security , labor market and health system reforms , and securing future energy resources .
stark differences have already emerged the fdp wants to dismantle the national health fund , which was only introduced at the beginning of this year ; a tall order that chancellor merkel rejects .
but , either way , with a rapidly aging population and shrinking workforce , germany urgently needs to revamp its employee-financed health care system .
the fdp insists on making it easier to fire employees , while opposing the introduction of sector-specific minimum wages .
the cdu wants to keep the minimum wage accords agreed on with the social democrats in the outgoing government and opposes labor market reforms .
the fdp has indicated , however , that this is not a top priority .
clashes are all but certain on topics like domestic security where the fdp vehemently opposes online searches and other measures , which they claim undercut personal data protection .
the cdu argues that these measures are necessary to combat terrorism and the growing scourge of internet crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government surveillance has stirred opposition on energy issues , both parties have said they would like to extend the operation of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants .
there is currently a law that calls for phasing out nuclear energy by 2020 .
although they agree on an extension , they differ on how the profits earned from that should be used .
the cdu wants to use them to keep electricity prices down , while the fdp wants to reduce subsidies for renewable energy .
tax cuts and the deficit on the deficit , the fdp wants to cut spending , which is expected to be twice the european union limit next year .
the fdp says it wants to axe state subsidies , end the " waste " of taxpayer 's money and reduce military spending .
merkel has rejected wholesale spending cuts , while some in her party have suggested raising the sales tax - an idea merkel has dismissed .
the tax issue will perhaps be the toughest nut to crack in the coalition talks in light of germany 's gaping budget deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cutting expenditures and taxes will be difficult fdp general-secretary dirk niebel has called for " a major tax structure reform " and said he was confident that " a coalition consensus could be reached for the next four years . "
but , that may be easier said than done .
saxony 's cdu state premier stanislav tillich urgently warned against lowering taxes , saying " the coalition talks must not agree on budgetary measures that burden our children and grandchildren . "
the position of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , however , is more in line with the fdp .
csu general-secretary alexander dobrindt has said " only investment in the economy and in jobs can lead to more employment and the retention of jobs .
that ultimately also leads to more financial flexibility . "
" cuts in social welfare programs would not be necessary , " he added .
the tax cuts proposed by the cdu would amount to about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.8 billion -rrb- annually .
the fdp has promised cuts worth up to 35 billion euros and wants to implement them soon .
the party also wants to simplify the tax system .
fdp finance spokesman hermann otto solms said his party would not " chicken out " of its campaign pledge. gb / dpa / ap / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's top-circulation women 's magazine said it will stop using professional models in its photo shoots .
the decision is part of a wider debate over fashion and body image in the media . " brigitte " is the fashion-and-lifestyle bible for the german everywoman . like most mass-circulation women 's magazines , its photo spreads are peopled by professional models - usually very thin ones .
at least , they were until now .
starting in the new year , that will no longer be the case , say editors-in- chief andreas lebert and brigitte huber .
" we are going to make a magazine for women as they are , and not as other people wish them to be , " lebert told a press conference in hamburg .
the plan is to feature musicians , actors , politicians , and readers , to be chosen by the magazine 's editors , instead of models in future editions of the magazine .
that means photo spreads will feature women " who have an identity " and not just " protruding bones , " lebert said .
the move is just the latest salvo in the ongoing ground war against overly thin fashion models .
recently , the topic has made headlines in connection to several international fashion weeks .
four large associations associated with the berlin fashion week last year agreed not to use overly thin models for the catwalk or fashion ads .
in madrid in 2008 , an underweight model was sent home , amid much publicity .
and this year 's london 's fashion week saw a campaign for more femininity - and curves - on the haute couture runways .
but " brigitte " editors said the magazine 's new strategy of changing size-zero models for normal folks does n't aim to declare war on the fashion industry - it merely aims to send a signal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a preference for thin models dominates the fashion industry " there is a great deal of discomfort in the fashion industry on the subject , but no one takes responsibility , " lebert said .
" maybe one medium has to say : ' we are deciding to present ourselves differently . " '
new trendsetters : bruni , obama for her part , " brigitte " editor huber commented that " these days , attractiveness has many faces . "
the days when fashion companies dictated style are over , she says ; today , fashion is dictated by people like the wife of the french president , carla bruni , or michelle obama , " as well as athletes , students , and " women on the streets of the major metropolises . "
in addition to making a statement about women and body image , the move may well be aimed at boosting circulation .
" brigitte " has seen a steady drop in readers in recent years , and the current bust in the ad business is making magazine publishers have to search for a new angle .
the magazine sold some 720,000 copies in the third quarter of 2009 , down from 757,000 a year earlier. jen / dpa / ap / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but " brigitte " editors said the magazine 's new strategy of changing size-zero models for normal folks does n't aim to declare war on the fashion industry - it merely aims to send a signal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a preference for thin models dominates the fashion industry " there is a great deal of discomfort in the fashion industry on the subject , but no one takes responsibility , " lebert said .
" maybe one medium has to say : ' we are deciding to present ourselves differently . " '
new trendsetters : bruni , obama for her part , " brigitte " editor huber commented that " these days , attractiveness has many faces . "
the days when fashion companies dictated style are over , she says ; today , fashion is dictated by people like the wife of the french president , carla bruni , or michelle obama , " as well as athletes , students , and " women on the streets of the major metropolises . "
in addition to making a statement about women and body image , the move may well be aimed at boosting circulation .
" brigitte " has seen a steady drop in readers in recent years , and the current bust in the ad business is making magazine publishers have to search for a new angle .
the magazine sold some 720,000 copies in the third quarter of 2009 , down from 757,000 a year earlier. jen / dpa / ap / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to the interior ministry website , the socialists have won an absolute majority , winning 160 seats in the 300-seat parliament .
" we stand united to face the big responsibility to change our country into a nation of justice , solidaritzy , humanity and green development , " said papandreou to a cheering crowd .
the ruling conservative new democracy party came in second with just 34 percent of the vote , which translates to 93 seats .
papandreou called the results " a message of hope , for change , and a just society , a more democratic and transparent society . "
sunday 's vote was the third face-off for 57-year-old us-born papandreou , and prime minister costas karamanlis , 53 , a powerful speaker who appeals to the average greek .
both men are heirs to two of the country 's most powerful political dynasties .
scandals and economic woes weakened by scandals and a fragile parliamentary majority , karamanlis called the snap poll in september , gambling he had a better chance of winning now than later in his four-year term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the third face-off for the two leaders first elected in 2004 , karamanlis said ahead of the vote that he needed a strong new mandate to tackle greece 's economic troubles .
the vote comes at a time when the mediterranean country , seen as the eurozone 's weakest link , needs a strong government to deal with an economy on the verge of recession .
papandreou now faces a budget deficit topping six percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , rising unemployment and deep dissatisfaction over the education system , social security and immigration .
extravagant promises ?
the socialist leader promised a three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.36 billion -rrb- stimulus package on a platform of taxing the rich and helping the poor , while incumbent prime minister costas karamanlis called for two years of austerity .
some economists have questioned the wisdom of papandreou 's spending plan , saying it could lead to more borrowing at a time when greece already has the eurozone 's second biggest debt after italy as a percentage of gdp .
after years of robust growth , greece 's output , about 2.5 percent of the eurozone 's total economy , is set to slow to zero growth or even enter negative territory this year , with key drivers and job providers like tourism particularly hard-hit. av / rb / dpa / reuters / ap editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a stakeholder who refused to leave the podium had to be removed , while 50 others stood , chanting for the head of the board of directors , bernd thiemann , to leave the gathering .
security forces were called in , who then formed a protective barrier between the podium and the audience . " we regard the move as a compulsory expropriation , " said daniela bergdolt of the german association for private investors -lrb- dsw -rrb- . the planned settlement of 1.30 euros per share is a mere " pittance , " she argued . the rebellious shareholders did n't stand a chance , since the government already owns 90 percent of hypo real estate .
hre chief executive axel wieandt told shareholders that only full privatization could save the lender from bankruptcy .
there was no other alternative , he said .
hre set to become fully state-owned the squeeze-out marks the final step in the first nationalization of a german bank since the republic was founded in 1949 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " ms. merkel ... today you 're expropriating my child , " the sign reads the government moved to nationalize hre earlier this year to prevent the bank from collapsing , which , authorities said , would have threatened the entire german banking sector .
it had to take direct control after intervening repeatedly to shore up the company with loan guarantees of around 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 146 billion -rrb- .
in june , the government 's financial-sector rescue fund secured 90 percent of hre when the majority of shareholders accepted an offer that valued the shares at 1.39 euros each .
the german lender also announced on monday that it needs seven billion euros in fresh cash to cover losses for 2009 and the following years .
that money comes in addition to three billion euros already received and the massive multi-billion euro loan guarantees by the german financial market stabilization fund soffin . hre will need several years to repay the state aid , wieandt said .

germany 's top-circulation women 's magazine said it will stop using professional models in its photo shoots .
the decision is part of a wider debate over fashion and body image in the media . " brigitte " is the fashion-and-lifestyle bible for the german everywoman . like most mass-circulation women 's magazines , its photo spreads are peopled by professional models - usually very thin ones .
at least , they were until now .
starting in the new year , that will no longer be the case , say editors-in- chief andreas lebert and brigitte huber .
" we are going to make a magazine for women as they are , and not as other people wish them to be , " lebert told a press conference in hamburg .
the plan is to feature musicians , actors , politicians , and readers , to be chosen by the magazine 's editors , instead of models in future editions of the magazine .
that means photo spreads will feature women " who have an identity " and not just " protruding bones , " lebert said .
the move is just the latest salvo in the ongoing ground war against overly thin fashion models .
recently , the topic has made headlines in connection to several international fashion weeks .
four large associations associated with the berlin fashion week last year agreed not to use overly thin models for the catwalk or fashion ads .
in madrid in 2008 , an underweight model was sent home , amid much publicity .
and this year 's london 's fashion week saw a campaign for more femininity - and curves - on the haute couture runways .
but " brigitte " editors said the magazine 's new strategy of changing size-zero models for normal folks does n't aim to declare war on the fashion industry - it merely aims to send a signal .

the pick-your-own strawberries farm , in the unsuspecting town of roevershagen near rostock , in northern germany , appealed to its visitors to scour their attics for pots they no longer needed and to donate them to the worthy guinness cause .
and they apparently heeded the call in droves , delivering an astounding 13,267 original items .

here 's what some of europe 's papers have to say about the resounding ' yes ' vote and the future of the reform treaty . germany 's neue osnabruecker zeitung welcomed ireland 's acceptance of the lisbon treaty , but said it was primarily motivated by money .
" nothing fanned the flames of love for europe among the irish as much as the thought of having to fight their way out of the crisis without cash injections from brussels . "
the paper was critical of the fact that the irish were the only people in the 27 nation block allowed to vote on a treaty " with such reach " .
it said all citizens of europe should have been allowed to have their say at the ballot box .
in the netherlands , de volkskrant said the second irish poll was no longer really about the treaty , but about whether or not the people of ireland wanted to remain in the eu at all .
" the mood has changed radically since the last referendum .
the financial crisis has taught the ' celtic tiger ' that it is safer to be in the eu harbor during a storm . "
in paris , the conservative le figaro said it was now up to the czech president to do the right thing by the citizens of europe .
" the resounding ' yes ' from ireland ought to have cleared the path for the ratification of the lisbon treaty .
the resistance - albeit fierce - from one man can not oppose the will of 500 million europeans . "
it added that vaclav klaus might like , against the wishes of his government and his people , to hold the treaty hostage until the conservatives take up the reins of power in britain .
but such a manoeuvre , it concluded , would be " dishonourable . "
bildunterschrift : ' yes ' was the word on the lips of 67 percent of voters in ireland the british daily , the times says the ireland vote represents another surrender to brussels and laments the fact that the british population never got their chance at a referendum .
" if the british saw the lisbon treaty as a genuine agreement among independent nations , which had been ratified either by a referendum or a general election , they might accept it .
but it is not , and they do not .
they are now asking themselves whether the benefits of belonging to a complex bureaucratic regional block of ageing powers and declining economies outweigh the sacrifice of british sovereignty .
whether it is in britain 's interest to remain in the european union has become a matter of legitimate debate . "
poland 's left-liberal gazeta wyborcza said the green light from the emerald isle meant the eu was now going to have to face some major challenges .
" the first test of the effectiveness of the eu under the new treaty will be expansion .
french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel said expansion would not be possible without the lisbon treaty .
now that its implementation is as good as guaranteed , they will have to take their foot off the brakes . "
it added that croatia , iceland , turkey , serbia , bosnia and herzegovina , montenegro and kosovo are waiting to join .

their work is seen as having an important impact on research into cancer and aging .
telomerase is called an " immortality enzyme ; " it could play a role in treating the uncontrolled spread of cancer cells .
the three researchers will share the prize , worth 10 million swedish crowns , or around a million euros -lrb- $ 1.4 million -rrb- .
solving problems on protecting chromosomes professor hans jornvall of the nobel assembly said their discoveries were crucial for research on cancer , aging and inherited genetic diseases , .
a statement by the assembly said the three scientists solved a fundamental problem in biology on " how chromosomes can be copied in a complete way and how they are protected against degradation . "
the statement said the discovery of " how chromosomes are protected by telomeres and the enzyme telomerase " had stimulated the development of " new therapeutic strategies . "
recipient says she was " thrilled " " i was just thrilled , " greider told swedish radio , saying she was doing laundry when she received the telephone call about the award from the karolinska institute .
american greider is a professor at johns hopkins university school of medicine in baltimore , australia-native blackburn is a professor at the university of california in san francisco , and szostak , born in the uk , is a professor at the harvard medical school .
last year , the medicine prize went to german virologist harald zur hausen , as well as french virologists francoise barre-sinoussi and luc montaigner , for their work on identifying viruses that cause aids and cervical cancer .
based on their research , a vaccine has been developed to protect against a certain kind of virus that can cause cervical cancer .

but the real winner was norway . norwegians enjoy the highest standard of living in the world .
the oil-rich scandinavian country , with its well-developed social welfare system , landed first place on the 2009 united nations index for human development .
australia and iceland took second and third places , respectively , and germany took a disappointing 22nd place out of 182 countries .
germany 's relatively low rank was partly due to a sinking per capita income in the wake of reunification , the report said .
other industrialized nations have increased their standing .
france , for instance , climbed to eighth place from 11th in the ranking .
ireland ranked fifth , austria 14th and spain 15th .
" progress is unevenly distributed , " said jeni klugman , the main author of the report .
" many countries have experienced setbacks in the past decades in the face of economic recession , conflict - crises and the hiv / aids epidemic setbacks experienced , " she said .
dramatic differences in life expectancy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in many african countries have a lower life expectancy than their european counterparts the worst results were for the african country of niger .
a child who is born in niger can expect to live to be just 50 years old - 30 years less than a child born in norway , according to the report .
afghanistan , sierra leone and the central african republic were also at the bottom of the list . the index combined values for life expectancy , literacy , school enrollment rates and gross domestic product per capita to arrive at an " aggregate measure of human welfare . "

mi5 's task is described in its motto , regnum defende - latin for defence of the realm .
it is a phrase which is deceptively simple , but the true meaning of which has often sparked deep controversy and suspicion .
it is also a title borrowed for the first authorised history of mi5 , the defence of the realm : the spooks and the politicians , which uses the organisation 's own secret records to tell its story from 1909 to the present day .
when it was created in 1909 , mi5 's function was simple - catching german spies in britain .
world war ii marked a high point , with mi5 taking the lead in the legendary " double cross " - turning incoming german spies to supply false information back to their controllers .
in the early cold war , catching soviet spies became a particularly painful task once it became clear that members of mi5 , and its foreign intelligence counterpart mi6 , were among those who had been handing over secrets .
it was during the cold war that mi5 's work became entangled more closely with politics , as it focused on countering " subversion " - those attempting " to undermine or overthrow parliamentary democracy by political , industrial or violent means . "
discreet dossier this definition left plenty of room for debate over who mi5 should be watching and led to some difficult conversations , especially since any warrant for a phone tap had to be approved by the home secretary .
politicians themselves were not immune from being watched for communist influence .
whenever a new prime minister assumes office , they are discreetly handed a dossier before deciding who to appoint as ministers .
inside are details of those mps about whom mi5 has security concerns .
in the first wilson government , three labour mps are said by the book to have been working for soviet bloc intelligence agencies .
according to the authorised history , it was politicians who often pushed mi5 to become more engaged in political and industrial disputes .
in most - but not all - cases , mi5 resisted .
a number of incidents revealing the interactions between the spies and the politicians are documented including : • in 1961 , labour party leader hugh gaitskell had a list of his own mps suspected of being communists handed over to mi5 .
it declined to be drawn into what was seen as party political activity . • when henry brooke became home secretary , he generated considerable anxiety by asking mi5 for a list of all those individuals living in his hampstead constituency whose mail or phones were being intercepted . • a file was opened on harold wilson in the mid-1940s but was kept under a pseudonym . • in early 1965 , wilson asked how many mps were having their phones tapped .
the answer was three labour mps and one conservative .
mi5 was only supposed to spy on those engaged in subversion , but some of the most controversial aspects of mi5 's interaction with politicians came over industrial disputes and the question of whether mi5 should be providing intelligence to the government on union activities .
in 1966 , a national union of seamen 's -lrb- nus -rrb- strike was initially seen as a straightforward industrial dispute , but then nus militants were overheard at the communist party headquarters asking for advice .
as a result , mi5 officers went to see the prime minister , harold wilson , and began providing regular reports , briefing him once or twice a day .
both the main political parties pressed for mi5 's help in dealing with industrial unrest .
edward heath and his home secretary pressed for eavesdropping of the electricity council , but were told it could not properly be considered subversive .
" the home secretary wondered whether our view of what was subversive needed bringing up to date , " recorded mi5 's number two at the time . "
we 'd inherited a position where our predecessors had been slightly less intellectually rigorous about this than we were " dame stella rimington ' struggle ' with soviet spies meanwhile , union activist arthur scargill first had his phone tapped in the 1973 miners ' dispute .
under jim callaghan , a group was established in whitehall to look into subversion in public life , which was provided information by mi5 .
there was concern within mi5 that the definition of subversion was being confused with opposition to the government .
john jones , the deputy director general in 1977 , wrote that ministers and senior officials had a " natural tendency " which the service must continue to resist " to equate subversion with -lrb- any -rrb- activity which threatens a government 's policies or may threaten its very existence " .
under margaret thatcher , the net was cast even more widely in the hunt for subversion .
she demanded action to deal with " wreckers " in british industry .
a cabinet office unit was established to prevent industrial disruption to which mi5 provided support .
subversive questions the former head of mi5 , dame stella rimington , said there was much debate then about what a subversive was and whether files should be kept .
she said : " we 'd inherited a position where our predecessors had been slightly less intellectually rigorous about this than we were .
" we took the responsibilities of the service very seriously .
" we reviewed many of those files created by our predecessors and destroyed them .
mi5 obtained a copy of the minutes of union leader derek robinson at a communist party meeting during the leyland strike .
margaret thatcher and home secretary willie whitelaw agreed an mi5 officer could pass these to british leyland 's chairman in a brown paper envelope and they eventually found their way to the sunday times .
during the miners ' strike , mrs thatcher was passed detailed information about union strategy based on warrants to watch specified subversives , and devoured mi5 's box 500 reports .
wise move ?
looking back now , some former senior mi5 officials believe too many files were opened on individuals .
in the 1980s , many left-wing activists were monitored .
during this period , mi5 monitored peace groups like cnd and the greenham common protesters as well as other left-wing activists .
files were opened on cnd chair bruce kent and activists like joan ruddock , patricia hewitt and harriet harman , now labour deputy leader .
the ministry of defence pressed for " ammunition " on cnd .
in 1983 , mi5 provided it with open source material on the political affiliation of seven leading cnd members .
this activity came to light in the mid-1980s , when one mid-ranking officer cathy massiter quit and spoke out .
but by the late-1980s , counter-terrorism had already begun to supplant subversion as the main focus of activity , dealing first with the ira and then increasingly after 9/11 with al-qaeda .
allowing such a history to be written is certainly unprecedented , but is it wise ?
the hope of those who commissioned it is that it will dispel some of the myths surrounding mi5 's work , explain what it really does and does not do and the context in which it operated .
the days of monitoring subversion are long past and officials will be hoping that being open about the past will help build the public trust which is now vital to mi5 's mission .

under margaret thatcher , the net was cast even more widely in the hunt for subversion .
she demanded action to deal with " wreckers " in british industry .
a cabinet office unit was established to prevent industrial disruption to which mi5 provided support .
subversive questions stella rimington says many files were destroyed the former head of mi5 , dame stella rimington , said there was much debate then about what a subversive was and whether files should be kept .
she said : " we 'd inherited a position where our predecessors had been slightly less intellectually rigorous about this than we were .
" we took the responsibilities of the service very seriously .
" we reviewed many of those files created by our predecessors and destroyed them .
mi5 obtained a copy of the minutes of union leader derek robinson at a communist party meeting during the leyland strike .
margaret thatcher and home secretary willie whitelaw agreed an mi5 officer could pass these to british leyland 's chairman in a brown paper envelope and they eventually found their way to the sunday times .
during the miners ' strike , mrs thatcher was passed detailed information about union strategy based on warrants to watch specified subversives , and devoured mi5 's box 500 reports .
wise move ?
looking back now , some former senior mi5 officials believe too many files were opened on individuals .
in the 1980s , many left-wing activists were monitored .
during this period , mi5 monitored peace groups like cnd and the greenham common protesters as well as other left-wing activists .
files were opened on cnd chair bruce kent and activists like joan ruddock , patricia hewitt and harriet harman , now labour deputy leader .
the ministry of defence pressed for " ammunition " on cnd .
in 1983 , mi5 provided it with open source material on the political affiliation of seven leading cnd members .
this activity came to light in the mid-1980s , when one mid-ranking officer cathy massiter quit and spoke out .
but by the late-1980s , counter-terrorism had already begun to supplant subversion as the main focus of activity , dealing first with the ira and then increasingly after 9/11 with al-qaeda .
allowing such a history to be written is certainly unprecedented , but is it wise ?
the hope of those who commissioned it is that it will dispel some of the myths surrounding mi5 's work , explain what it really does and does not do and the context in which it operated .
the days of monitoring subversion are long past and officials will be hoping that being open about the past will help build the public trust which is now vital to mi5 's mission .

dame stella rimington on the use of subversion a new authorised history of mi5 throws light on the dealings of the secret service .
mi5 's task is described in its motto , regnum defende - latin for defence of the realm .
it is a phrase which is deceptively simple , but the true meaning of which has often sparked deep controversy and suspicion .
it is also a title borrowed for the first authorised history of mi5 , the defence of the realm : the spooks and the politicians , which uses the organisation 's own secret records to tell its story from 1909 to the present day .
when it was created in 1909 , mi5 's function was simple - catching german spies in britain .
world war ii marked a high point , with mi5 taking the lead in the legendary " double cross " - turning incoming german spies to supply false information back to their controllers .
in the early cold war , catching soviet spies became a particularly painful task once it became clear that members of mi5 , and its foreign intelligence counterpart mi6 , were among those who had been handing over secrets .
it was during the cold war that mi5 's work became entangled more closely with politics , as it focused on countering " subversion " - those attempting " to undermine or overthrow parliamentary democracy by political , industrial or violent means . "
discreet dossier this definition left plenty of room for debate over who mi5 should be watching and led to some difficult conversations , especially since any warrant for a phone tap had to be approved by the home secretary .
politicians themselves were not immune from being watched for communist influence .
the book opens the door to mi5 whenever a new prime minister assumes office , they are discreetly handed a dossier before deciding who to appoint as ministers .
inside are details of those mps about whom mi5 has security concerns .
in the first wilson government , three labour mps are said by the book to have been working for soviet bloc intelligence agencies .
according to the authorised history , it was politicians who often pushed mi5 to become more engaged in political and industrial disputes .
in most - but not all - cases , mi5 resisted .
a number of incidents revealing the interactions between the spies and the politicians are documented including : • in 1961 , labour party leader hugh gaitskell had a list of his own mps suspected of being communists handed over to mi5 .
it declined to be drawn into what was seen as party political activity . • when henry brooke became home secretary , he generated considerable anxiety by asking mi5 for a list of all those individuals living in his hampstead constituency whose mail or phones were being intercepted . • a file was opened on harold wilson in the mid-1940s but was kept under a pseudonym . • in early 1965 , wilson asked how many mps were having their phones tapped .
the answer was three labour mps and one conservative .
mi5 was only supposed to spy on those engaged in subversion , but some of the most controversial aspects of mi5 's interaction with politicians came over industrial disputes and the question of whether mi5 should be providing intelligence to the government on union activities .
arthur scargill came under suspicion in 1966 , a national union of seamen 's -lrb- nus -rrb- strike was initially seen as a straightforward industrial dispute , but then nus militants were overheard at the communist party headquarters asking for advice .
as a result , mi5 officers went to see the prime minister , harold wilson , and began providing regular reports , briefing him once or twice a day .
both the main political parties pressed for mi5 's help in dealing with industrial unrest .
edward heath and his home secretary pressed for eavesdropping of the electricity council , but were told it could not properly be considered subversive .
" the home secretary wondered whether our view of what was subversive needed bringing up to date , " recorded mi5 's number two at the time .
we 'd inherited a position where our predecessors had been slightly less intellectually rigorous about this than we were dame stella rimington ' struggle ' with soviet spies meanwhile , union activist arthur scargill first had his phone tapped in the 1973 miners ' dispute .
under jim callaghan , a group was established in whitehall to look into subversion in public life , which was provided information by mi5 .

dame stella rimington on the use of subversion a new authorised history of mi5 throws light on the dealings of the secret service .
mi5 's task is described in its motto , regnum defende - latin for defence of the realm .
it is a phrase which is deceptively simple , but the true meaning of which has often sparked deep controversy and suspicion .
it is also a title borrowed for the first authorised history of mi5 , the defence of the realm : the spooks and the politicians , which uses the organisation 's own secret records to tell its story from 1909 to the present day .
when it was created in 1909 , mi5 's function was simple - catching german spies in britain .
world war ii marked a high point , with mi5 taking the lead in the legendary " double cross " - turning incoming german spies to supply false information back to their controllers .
in the early cold war , catching soviet spies became a particularly painful task once it became clear that members of mi5 , and its foreign intelligence counterpart mi6 , were among those who had been handing over secrets .
it was during the cold war that mi5 's work became entangled more closely with politics , as it focused on countering " subversion " - those attempting " to undermine or overthrow parliamentary democracy by political , industrial or violent means . "
discreet dossier this definition left plenty of room for debate over who mi5 should be watching and led to some difficult conversations , especially since any warrant for a phone tap had to be approved by the home secretary .
politicians themselves were not immune from being watched for communist influence .
the book opens the door to mi5 whenever a new prime minister assumes office , they are discreetly handed a dossier before deciding who to appoint as ministers .
inside are details of those mps about whom mi5 has security concerns .
in the first wilson government , three labour mps are said by the book to have been working for soviet bloc intelligence agencies .
according to the authorised history , it was politicians who often pushed mi5 to become more engaged in political and industrial disputes .
in most - but not all - cases , mi5 resisted .
a number of incidents revealing the interactions between the spies and the politicians are documented including : • in 1961 , labour party leader hugh gaitskell had a list of his own mps suspected of being communists handed over to mi5 .
it declined to be drawn into what was seen as party political activity . • when henry brooke became home secretary , he generated considerable anxiety by asking mi5 for a list of all those individuals living in his hampstead constituency whose mail or phones were being intercepted . • a file was opened on harold wilson in the mid-1940s but was kept under a pseudonym . • in early 1965 , wilson asked how many mps were having their phones tapped .
the answer was three labour mps and one conservative .
mi5 was only supposed to spy on those engaged in subversion , but some of the most controversial aspects of mi5 's interaction with politicians came over industrial disputes and the question of whether mi5 should be providing intelligence to the government on union activities .
arthur scargill came under suspicion in 1966 , a national union of seamen 's -lrb- nus -rrb- strike was initially seen as a straightforward industrial dispute , but then nus militants were overheard at the communist party headquarters asking for advice .
as a result , mi5 officers went to see the prime minister , harold wilson , and began providing regular reports , briefing him once or twice a day .
both the main political parties pressed for mi5 's help in dealing with industrial unrest .
edward heath and his home secretary pressed for eavesdropping of the electricity council , but were told it could not properly be considered subversive .
" the home secretary wondered whether our view of what was subversive needed bringing up to date , " recorded mi5 's number two at the time .
we 'd inherited a position where our predecessors had been slightly less intellectually rigorous about this than we were dame stella rimington ' struggle ' with soviet spies meanwhile , union activist arthur scargill first had his phone tapped in the 1973 miners ' dispute .
under jim callaghan , a group was established in whitehall to look into subversion in public life , which was provided information by mi5 .
there was concern within mi5 that the definition of subversion was being confused with opposition to the government .
john jones , the deputy director general in 1977 , wrote that ministers and senior officials had a " natural tendency " which the service must continue to resist " to equate subversion with -lrb- any -rrb- activity which threatens a government 's policies or may threaten its very existence " .
under margaret thatcher , the net was cast even more widely in the hunt for subversion .
she demanded action to deal with " wreckers " in british industry .
a cabinet office unit was established to prevent industrial disruption to which mi5 provided support .
subversive questions stella rimington says many files were destroyed the former head of mi5 , dame stella rimington , said there was much debate then about what a subversive was and whether files should be kept .
she said : " we 'd inherited a position where our predecessors had been slightly less intellectually rigorous about this than we were .
" we took the responsibilities of the service very seriously .
" we reviewed many of those files created by our predecessors and destroyed them .
mi5 obtained a copy of the minutes of union leader derek robinson at a communist party meeting during the leyland strike .
margaret thatcher and home secretary willie whitelaw agreed an mi5 officer could pass these to british leyland 's chairman in a brown paper envelope and they eventually found their way to the sunday times .
during the miners ' strike , mrs thatcher was passed detailed information about union strategy based on warrants to watch specified subversives , and devoured mi5 's box 500 reports .
wise move ?
looking back now , some former senior mi5 officials believe too many files were opened on individuals .
in the 1980s , many left-wing activists were monitored .
during this period , mi5 monitored peace groups like cnd and the greenham common protesters as well as other left-wing activists .
files were opened on cnd chair bruce kent and activists like joan ruddock , patricia hewitt and harriet harman , now labour deputy leader .
the ministry of defence pressed for " ammunition " on cnd .
in 1983 , mi5 provided it with open source material on the political affiliation of seven leading cnd members .
this activity came to light in the mid-1980s , when one mid-ranking officer cathy massiter quit and spoke out .
but by the late-1980s , counter-terrorism had already begun to supplant subversion as the main focus of activity , dealing first with the ira and then increasingly after 9/11 with al-qaeda .
allowing such a history to be written is certainly unprecedented , but is it wise ?
the hope of those who commissioned it is that it will dispel some of the myths surrounding mi5 's work , explain what it really does and does not do and the context in which it operated .
the days of monitoring subversion are long past and officials will be hoping that being open about the past will help build the public trust which is now vital to mi5 's mission .

dame stella rimington on the use of subversion a new authorised history of mi5 throws light on the dealings of the secret service .
mi5 's task is described in its motto , regnum defende - latin for defence of the realm .
it is a phrase which is deceptively simple , but the true meaning of which has often sparked deep controversy and suspicion .
it is also a title borrowed for the first authorised history of mi5 , the defence of the realm : the spooks and the politicians , which uses the organisation 's own secret records to tell its story from 1909 to the present day .
when it was created in 1909 , mi5 's function was simple - catching german spies in britain .
world war ii marked a high point , with mi5 taking the lead in the legendary " double cross " - turning incoming german spies to supply false information back to their controllers .
in the early cold war , catching soviet spies became a particularly painful task once it became clear that members of mi5 , and its foreign intelligence counterpart mi6 , were among those who had been handing over secrets .
it was during the cold war that mi5 's work became entangled more closely with politics , as it focused on countering " subversion " - those attempting " to undermine or overthrow parliamentary democracy by political , industrial or violent means . "
discreet dossier this definition left plenty of room for debate over who mi5 should be watching and led to some difficult conversations , especially since any warrant for a phone tap had to be approved by the home secretary .
politicians themselves were not immune from being watched for communist influence .
the book opens the door to mi5 whenever a new prime minister assumes office , they are discreetly handed a dossier before deciding who to appoint as ministers .
inside are details of those mps about whom mi5 has security concerns .
in the first wilson government , three labour mps are said by the book to have been working for soviet bloc intelligence agencies .
according to the authorised history , it was politicians who often pushed mi5 to become more engaged in political and industrial disputes .
in most - but not all - cases , mi5 resisted .
a number of incidents revealing the interactions between the spies and the politicians are documented including : • in 1961 , labour party leader hugh gaitskell had a list of his own mps suspected of being communists handed over to mi5 .
it declined to be drawn into what was seen as party political activity . • when henry brooke became home secretary , he generated considerable anxiety by asking mi5 for a list of all those individuals living in his hampstead constituency whose mail or phones were being intercepted . • a file was opened on harold wilson in the mid-1940s but was kept under a pseudonym . • in early 1965 , wilson asked how many mps were having their phones tapped .
the answer was three labour mps and one conservative .
mi5 was only supposed to spy on those engaged in subversion , but some of the most controversial aspects of mi5 's interaction with politicians came over industrial disputes and the question of whether mi5 should be providing intelligence to the government on union activities .
arthur scargill came under suspicion in 1966 , a national union of seamen 's -lrb- nus -rrb- strike was initially seen as a straightforward industrial dispute , but then nus militants were overheard at the communist party headquarters asking for advice .
as a result , mi5 officers went to see the prime minister , harold wilson , and began providing regular reports , briefing him once or twice a day .
both the main political parties pressed for mi5 's help in dealing with industrial unrest .
edward heath and his home secretary pressed for eavesdropping of the electricity council , but were told it could not properly be considered subversive .
" the home secretary wondered whether our view of what was subversive needed bringing up to date , " recorded mi5 's number two at the time .
we 'd inherited a position where our predecessors had been slightly less intellectually rigorous about this than we were dame stella rimington ' struggle ' with soviet spies meanwhile , union activist arthur scargill first had his phone tapped in the 1973 miners ' dispute .
under jim callaghan , a group was established in whitehall to look into subversion in public life , which was provided information by mi5 .
there was concern within mi5 that the definition of subversion was being confused with opposition to the government .
john jones , the deputy director general in 1977 , wrote that ministers and senior officials had a " natural tendency " which the service must continue to resist " to equate subversion with -lrb- any -rrb- activity which threatens a government 's policies or may threaten its very existence " .
under margaret thatcher , the net was cast even more widely in the hunt for subversion .
she demanded action to deal with " wreckers " in british industry .
a cabinet office unit was established to prevent industrial disruption to which mi5 provided support .
subversive questions stella rimington says many files were destroyed the former head of mi5 , dame stella rimington , said there was much debate then about what a subversive was and whether files should be kept .
she said : " we 'd inherited a position where our predecessors had been slightly less intellectually rigorous about this than we were .
" we took the responsibilities of the service very seriously .
" we reviewed many of those files created by our predecessors and destroyed them .
mi5 obtained a copy of the minutes of union leader derek robinson at a communist party meeting during the leyland strike .
margaret thatcher and home secretary willie whitelaw agreed an mi5 officer could pass these to british leyland 's chairman in a brown paper envelope and they eventually found their way to the sunday times .
during the miners ' strike , mrs thatcher was passed detailed information about union strategy based on warrants to watch specified subversives , and devoured mi5 's box 500 reports .
wise move ?
looking back now , some former senior mi5 officials believe too many files were opened on individuals .
in the 1980s , many left-wing activists were monitored .
during this period , mi5 monitored peace groups like cnd and the greenham common protesters as well as other left-wing activists .
files were opened on cnd chair bruce kent and activists like joan ruddock , patricia hewitt and harriet harman , now labour deputy leader .
the ministry of defence pressed for " ammunition " on cnd .
in 1983 , mi5 provided it with open source material on the political affiliation of seven leading cnd members .
this activity came to light in the mid-1980s , when one mid-ranking officer cathy massiter quit and spoke out .
but by the late-1980s , counter-terrorism had already begun to supplant subversion as the main focus of activity , dealing first with the ira and then increasingly after 9/11 with al-qaeda .
allowing such a history to be written is certainly unprecedented , but is it wise ?
the hope of those who commissioned it is that it will dispel some of the myths surrounding mi5 's work , explain what it really does and does not do and the context in which it operated .
the days of monitoring subversion are long past and officials will be hoping that being open about the past will help build the public trust which is now vital to mi5 's mission .

files were opened on cnd chair bruce kent and activists like joan ruddock , patricia hewitt and harriet harman , now labour deputy leader .
the ministry of defence pressed for " ammunition " on cnd .

this activity came to light in the mid-1980s , when one mid-ranking officer cathy massiter quit and spoke out .
but by the late-1980s , counter-terrorism had already begun to supplant subversion as the main focus of activity , dealing first with the ira and then increasingly after 9/11 with al-qaeda .
allowing such a history to be written is certainly unprecedented , but is it wise ?
the hope of those who commissioned it is that it will dispel some of the myths surrounding mi5 's work , explain what it really does and does not do and the context in which it operated .
the days of monitoring subversion are long past and officials will be hoping that being open about the past will help build the public trust which is now vital to mi5 's mission .

dame stella rimington on the use of subversion a new authorised history of mi5 throws light on the dealings of the secret service .
mi5 's task is described in its motto , regnum defende - latin for defence of the realm .
it is a phrase which is deceptively simple , but the true meaning of which has often sparked deep controversy and suspicion .
it is also a title borrowed for the first authorised history of mi5 , the defence of the realm : the spooks and the politicians , which uses the organisation 's own secret records to tell its story from 1909 to the present day .
when it was created in 1909 , mi5 's function was simple - catching german spies in britain .
world war ii marked a high point , with mi5 taking the lead in the legendary " double cross " - turning incoming german spies to supply false information back to their controllers .
in the early cold war , catching soviet spies became a particularly painful task once it became clear that members of mi5 , and its foreign intelligence counterpart mi6 , were among those who had been handing over secrets .
it was during the cold war that mi5 's work became entangled more closely with politics , as it focused on countering " subversion " - those attempting " to undermine or overthrow parliamentary democracy by political , industrial or violent means . "
discreet dossier this definition left plenty of room for debate over who mi5 should be watching and led to some difficult conversations , especially since any warrant for a phone tap had to be approved by the home secretary .
politicians themselves were not immune from being watched for communist influence .
the book opens the door to mi5 whenever a new prime minister assumes office , they are discreetly handed a dossier before deciding who to appoint as ministers .
inside are details of those mps about whom mi5 has security concerns .
in the first wilson government , three labour mps are said by the book to have been working for soviet bloc intelligence agencies .
according to the authorised history , it was politicians who often pushed mi5 to become more engaged in political and industrial disputes .
in most - but not all - cases , mi5 resisted .
a number of incidents revealing the interactions between the spies and the politicians are documented including : • in 1961 , labour party leader hugh gaitskell had a list of his own mps suspected of being communists handed over to mi5 .
it declined to be drawn into what was seen as party political activity . • when henry brooke became home secretary , he generated considerable anxiety by asking mi5 for a list of all those individuals living in his hampstead constituency whose mail or phones were being intercepted . • a file was opened on harold wilson in the mid-1940s but was kept under a pseudonym . • in early 1965 , wilson asked how many mps were having their phones tapped .
the answer was three labour mps and one conservative .
